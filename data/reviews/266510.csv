You move your token from card to card, travelling across them until you reach the end of them.  As you "step" on each card, it is revealed.  Whatever the card reveals informs the adventure - an ambush by thieves, a mysterious cave, a helpful vendor, it's all randomized and set out under the cards for you to discover.\n\nNow imagine the cards are composed of a deck of cards that YOU build, as well as some cards the "gamemaster" stuffs in there.  You don't know what you'll get in your travels, or in what order, and that is the core gameplay.\n\nAll combat is resolved in a simple, but elegant, action combat system similar to the Batman Arkham games (WASD, E to "counter", Space to roll, and sometimes # keys for specials) and it's fun.

Think of it as a random adventure game where the cards are your storyline, equipment, quests, enemies, curses and blessings. And the actual battles are fought in Hack & Slash real time encounters which mirror the cards you have on hand. I hope there will soon be a Demo available for people to try it, because its really unique and should be experienced instead of described.\n\nThe strongest point of the game is probably the Narrator of the Card Dealer, very well done and highly immersive and even comments on your situation or what cards you have on hand. The second strong point is the randomness and replayability, every adventure you start will be different, depending on the cards you choose and how they are played.\n\nThe presentation is top notch, the card animations fluid and pretty. Only the switches to the Battles are a bit tiresome after a while, but they can be skipped.\n\nThere is a big luck factor in the game which makes things interesting, it can screw you over royally, but also make you come back against all odds. You will die, and you will not be successful in every quest and adventure. And you probably have not many ways to prevent it, its the luck of the cards.\n\nIf something is missing then maybe character variety, there is only the main character. At least the different equipment is displayed nicely on him.\n\nThe real time battles are short encounters against one or more groups of enemies with varying abilities and are visually pretty and also randomized. The actual fighting is not too difficult as long as you learn how to block & dodge and use the abilities. The store page says controller recommended, but i played with M&KB just fine. The Battles might be easier with a controller.\n\nThe game feels like playing a real board game and I highly enjoyed it so far. It came out of Early Access and was updated regularly. I encountered no technical issues or bugs, its pretty polished from what i can say.\n\nI think this game should be played =)","February 25, 2015","true","18.3"," 173 of 188 people (92%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","92","173","188","8","18"

But what makes this game so special? So unique? Well, it is a card game, and there are plenty of card games. It is an action game, and there are plenty of action games. And yet this game can suspend my disbelief like no other.\n\nThis game just want to make you fell like you are... playing a game, and in this simplicity lies its brilliance. It does not try to suspend your disbelief to great heights and in doing that it brings an incredible immersion. All I need to feel is that I am playing a game with that strtange fellow in front of me. A fellow that, like no other character, I wish to pull of the screen just to have a chat over some beverages. Or maybe... a game of cards.\n\nIt is impressive how a game that does not create anything new, but just mixes what we have already seen in a way we have never seen can fell so fresh, so different.\n\nAs for the game itself, it plays as a roguelite. The randomness, the decisions based on your circinstances, the reset after a failure. Failure that does not bring the game back to the beggining, as the bosses you already defeated will remain defeated, but the entire board of the one you are chasing gets reset. Failure that can still reveal some minor rewards as you unlock tokens. Or even just comments from the dealer.\n\nAnd I press forward. Not for a quest to save the world, but for the wonder of discovery after each new card. Or even some old ones.

Its wildly addictive and honestly some of the most fun I've had in a game for a while, and I intend to play much more.\n\nThis game makes me feel like I'm sitting down for a single player DnD game with the dealer as sort of a "dungeon master", laying out the adventure for me to go through. There are a lot of stories to be told that keep fairly short but interesting, and will occasionally result in combat.

Very different,innovative and very unique.\nit is an  rpg/deck building/ action packed/ addictive card game that comes to life as you are dealt the cards of fate.\n\nThe game gives you a hero outfitted with certain gears and debuff (Depending on deck stack), your job? To fight the dealer by traveling through his deck of cards and facing the boss.He shuffles and places the cards in random positions where you move a token across them to see what your of fate is, you'll have a certain amount of heatlh and food to make it through to the boss. Run out of health? you die, run out of food? you'll take damage as you move instead of heals, reach 0 hp andyou'll have to start the entire adventure deck over. You'll encounter monsters, Trap cards, Quest cards,shops to gear yourself, reward cards,  or even dangerous cards that will throw you completely off and thus could completely cost you the game.\n\nSince the game is randomized depending on what you put into the deck randomization will be what you put into the deck which is required along with his cards, After each deck either by death or actually winning you'll get tokens for completing every card's quests that is played and whatever drops from the boss. You'll also get rewarded with even MORE cards you can throw in the deck.\nAfter beating 3 sets of his deck, the game gets more challenging with Paradigm cards (This is what i label them), it'll reward you but at the same time buff your enemies up by giving them MORE abilities, more strength, or any other crazy benefits you can think of to beat you down, before you know it the game gets even harder forcing you to throw even more strategic cards into play. Items and such will help you but those are completely randomized also so hope that luck is on your side\nThe combat is quite simple, you'll be set in an arena, you'll be able to evade, stun if you have your shield, or counter hit your enemies with.  Its very similar to batman arkham combat style.\n\nWith what there is now the game is playable and has plenty of randomization and contents that you can really enjoy.\n\n+ Great voice acting\n+ Innovative and unique  gameplay\n+ Rogue-Like adventures since its completely random decks thrown at you\n+ Gets a bit challenging as the game goes on once you complete set, and harder, and harder so play your cards right\n+Controller support\n+ Graphics are quite decent\n+ The music is done well and fits the game\n+ Voice acting from the dealer is fantastic, he is so vibrant and speaks so much.\n+ REPLAYABILITY  = PLENTY with endless mode.\n+ Good writing and lore on the cards, very intresting cards\n+ Good variety of enemies, and cards that will kick your ♥♥♥\n+ The best polished work I've invested in from an early access game which didn't require me to place anymore cons about the game, I love it.\n\nCon - Only the Camera can beat you if it twist in a strange direction.\n- Some battle could be fustrating, Very fustrating near the end if your luck hits rock bottom. ROCK BOTTOM ! lol.\n\nOthers\n+-Try playing with a controller, It might be easier for some of you the handle works great equally with kb + m now.\n+- Dlc content comes out later on, Cannot wait\n+- Worth every penny","July 7, 2014","true","23.5"," 157 of 190 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","157","190","2","14"

You, a figure on the board, will be traversing through a dungeon made of cards. As you land on each card it'll reveal a new event. These events are varied, and can range from loot drops, to enemy encounters, or even a quest, just to name a few. It's a very interesting take on the genre.\n\nHand of Fate features incredible visual aesthetics. The dealer, the table, the cards, almost all aspects of the game is masterly designed, and executed with incredible technical finesse. The game is gorgeous visually, and the audio, though subtle, is very memorable and suiting to the game. The dealer is voice acted well, and there's a snarky charisma about him. He's a likable character, and that's good, because you'll be with him for the majority of the game.\n\nMechanically it seems so simple. A card based roguelike where the deal of the cards IS the RNG system. Once you play the game you'll be wondering why it took so long for some one to come up with this concept. It seems so obvious and fitting once it's played. The game also offers a great deal of meta gaming and offer a fair amount of complexity for players who like to dive into the nuance of a game.\n\nThough there is plenty to love about Hand of Fate, there is one area that seems lacking, or even uninspired in comparison to the rest of it. The combat. The combat will play out very similar to say the Batman Arkham games, where there's an attack, a dodge, stun, and counter button. You'll be mashing that attack and stun over and over again until either the counter or dodge prompts come up. Like I said, very similar to the Batman games. Though it shows some similarities to other games, it's not as smooth, and feels rather stiff and clunky by comparison. It's certainly not my favorite part of the game. Luckily for us, the combat is not the center ring of this, and it's very much a side mechanic, used to enhance the true character of the game, the procedurally generated dungeon running.\n\nOverall, Hand of Fate is a fantastic entry to the roguelike(lite) genre, that introduces some very interesting concepts that seem to fit right in. If you're interested in the game, I think I can safely recommend the buy!\n\nPros:\n- Brilliantly conceptualized in themeing\n- Great Graphics\n- Excellent genre blending\n- Addictive gameplay with lots of incentive to replay\n\nCons:\n- Combat, though not terrible, feels sluggish and uninspired compared to the rest of the game\n- Lacking in the options menu","February 18, 2015","true","13.5"," 152 of 193 people (79%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","79","152","193","10","15"

The full review contains additional sections that explain and analyze the game in more detail:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=585997734\n\nHand of Fate is a rare beast indeed - a successful genre blend! It is simultaneously a proof of concept and a masterpiece. It is something truly unique and wonderful.\n\nThe genre blend is so unusual, that the gameplay is very difficult to explain succinctly. But, I shall try:\n\nHand of Fate is an RPG card game rogue-lite with an interesting Four Card Monte mechanic and simple, but fun brawl style combat.\n\nYeah. It's hard to know exactly what that means, but if you'd like to know more, then go ahead and read the Gameplay Explained section below.\n\nBesides the engaging gameplay, Hand of Fate has superb art and animation, music and sound, expertly combined into a highly atmospheric, immersive experience.\n\nIn short, I highly recommend it.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=586012076\n\nShould You Buy It?\nYes! Well... probably! It's a bargain at the current sale price, and quite well worth it at full price also.\n\nBut, here are a few reasons why you might want to stay away:\n* If you really hate reading. You'll have to do a decent amount here.\n* If you really, really hate roguelikes. Single sessions are fairly short, except for endgame Endless Mode (there is autosave).\n* If you are allergic to repetition. Yes, there will be some repetition per the nature of this genre mix, but I think it's entirely tolerable, and unavoidable given the nature of the genres.\n* If you can't stomach the idea that a little grinding may be required to unlock everything and/or 100% the game. If you aren't an obsessive completionist, however, this won't be a problem at all! If you are, it will take you about 50-100 hours to unlock all achievements.\n* If you can't stand a video game character occasionally insulting you (masochists, take note).\n\nOtherwise, you have every reason to play the game, especially:\n* If you want to try something different\n* If you like indie games with high production values and great atmosphere\n* If you like card and/or board games\n* If you like brawling style combat\n* If you like rogue-likes and games with high replay value\n* If you like collecting/unlocking mechanics in games\n\n\nWhat about the DLC?\nBasically, you don't need it to start with. It's more for expanding endgame possibilities.

This game is beautiful in a lot of ways, from the narration, to the environment and visuals, to the overall presentation. Early on, the game is very balanced, growing in difficulty as you progress. It also features a roguelike element, in that if you lose, you start at the beginning of the floor again. The roguelike comparison mostly ends there, besides luck being an element, but there is also a choose your own adventure feel to the game that adds longevity and a breath of fresh air!\n\nGameplay\nIn this card game, you have cards that both you and the dealer place into the deck. The deck is then laid out like a dungeon, and you traverse it. Each step, or new card, costs food, but there are gain cards that you can draw that can give food, money, or equipment. There are also pain cards that will make you lose resources or health, too. So there is in almost all things an element of risk vs reward, and this is good. There is also resource management: You will have to be wise with your spending. The right or wrong gear can save or cost your life.\n\nThis game features real-time rhythm-based combat, in an interesting mix. You can attack at any time, but if you wait and time your button presses, you can dodge, or parry enemy attacks automatically. With every update it seems to get smoother, allowing for a fun and engaging flurry of attacks that flow together with bliss.\n\nThere is also an element of stacking the deck, as you gain more powerful equipment, and more situations in which you know the outcome to pit yourself against, you can make sure to load the deck with only encounters and equipment suited to the floor ahead. In this way, early on, success can be guaranteed, but later on, it will become very beneficial and perhaps required.\n\nOther gameplay features include and endless mode, mini dungeons complete with traps and treasure, a card-based mixup game where you can actually track the cards, and inventory management in the form of being able to buy/sell extra cards at shops.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics in Hand of Fate can be as simple or immersive as you want, ranging from murky at the lowest settings to absolutely gorgeous when maxed out, although this can be quite performance intensive. The use of color, light, shadow, cartoonish and realistic aspects are all outstanding. There is also a great use of special effects. Everything feels immersive and hand-tailored to perfection.\n\nThe environments are gorgeous, from the dealer's room to the mini-dungeons to the encounter fields and even the cards themselves. Everything in this game drips quality and polish. This game is obviously a labor of love for the developers.\n\nI should also mention that the animations and transitions, which can be jittery at times, are really well done!\n\nAudio\nIf you've heard the dealer speak, then you likely know how nice the audio in this game is. Everything is crisp, with a good recording quality, and here too, drips polish. The sounds of weapons slicing, clashing, and bouncing off of shields are all quite nice, and probably some of the most common you will hear aside from the dealer.\n\nThe music is good, although I find it blends into the background sneakily most of the time. The large majority of the game is made up of the various sound effects, all of which, again, are nice. Unfortunately, I can't say much specific about the audio that would convey to you just how it all sounds when you're actually playing the game.\n\nConclusion\nHand of Fate is more of an indie goldmine than an indie gem. It oozes polish and is a glorious mashup of TCG and roguelite featuring rhythm-based combat that still allows for real-time as well. It features quality music, an outstanding voiceover, flowing combat, a wonderfully refreshing choose your own style, and good resource management qualities. You owe it to yourself to pick this game up and enjoy!\n\n======================================","July 1, 2015","true","4.4"," 108 of 142 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","108","142","3","9"

To call it a "card based RPG" is a misnomer, even though thats what it is. Its kind of like playing those old RPG board games like HeroQuest, mixed with the Lone Wolf books, mixed with an ARPG. Its really unique. I'm an old jaded gamer and Ive never seen anything like this. Its awesome.\n\nBasically, you have a deck of cards, your opponent (a mage who you are playing against and who narrates the story - I think the voice is the narrator from Fable 2 but Im not sure) has a deck of cards (encounter cards). He lays out encounter cards face down, and you move a token across them, choosing where you go. When you land on a card, it is flipped over and an encounter ensues. Sometimes its good, sometimes its bad, and sometimes its combat. Sometimes it can be good or bad depending on what you choose to do and what card you draw (success, failure ect). There are item cards, weapon cards, armor cards.\n\nAs you move through the levels you gain more cards. At the end of each sequence, you start a new one and can build your deck based on the cards you won in the last deck. You also build your encounter deck, as you win new encounter cards as well.\n\nCombat is resolved in a 3rd person ARPG style. Sometimes theres traps and environmental hazards as well. Its pretty simple, attack, counter, block, roll. You can also get power ups/downs and special one-use cards. Its really fun. It doesnt take a whole lot of strategy at first, but the enemies and maps do get more complex as you go. Certain attacks cant be blocked or countered and must be avoided, some enemies have ranged attacks, and so forth.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that the camera is fixed, which can be a big pain in certain areas. A "maze of traps" where you are dodging flames and spears comes to mind, as well as in encounters where you cant see the enemies attacking you from off screen because you cant rotate the camera to look at them.\n\nThat is pretty much the major flaw of the game. Fixed cameras in ARPGs are not a good idea. Fortunately, its reltively minor and since the game is still in E.A. at the time of this writing, maybe it'll be implemented later.\n\nThat shouldnt stop you from getting this unique and awesome game, though.","December 21, 2014","true","2.6"," 84 of 106 people (79%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","79","84","106","6","0"

Most of them have approx. 6 hours and I would leave positive review too if I didn't spent a bit more time in this game.\nOnly 2.6% of player base completed this game and there is reason behind this. The more you play the more game becomes annoying rather than enjoying. Yes, narrator's voice is beatiful, music is beatufil too, aesthetics is good, but this game some serious gameplay problems.\nFirst of all, the way diffuclty inrecreases is absolutly irratating - new "event" cards become a lot more diffulty in terms of randomness or difficulty of combat. For example, there is event card which will reduce your max HP by 66% if you fail to pass 25% roll. So you can have almost a perfect run and ruin it just by failing this event. And it's a pretty big deal, because it's not like winning an event grants you perma win, you work really hard trying to accumilate as much equipment as possible, but it still wouldn't be enough to win a final fight, becase of this - the combat system is really bad.\nWhen you play for the first time, combat seems fine, of course, it's not outstanding, but it's fine for this type of game, but later, when you unlock more events, combat becomes pain in the ♥♥♥, because there is a huge change that you face a pretty big amount of tough enemies while wielding ♥♥♥♥♥♥ rusty axe. And it's boring. It's boring to fight 6 enemies when each of them requires at least 20 hits to kill. I'm not even taking in consideration fact that you can encounter mini-bosses who will heal allies and has twice as much hp.\nThere is no variety in weapons - no 2h weapons, no duals, no ranged - only 1h and shield. All bosses have pretty much the same skill set, there is also no variety in that. There is also very annoying things like "unblockable" attacks and amount of enemies who can do that increases with amount you play, it's verry annoing because some of them is faster then your counter attack animation so it can lead to a situation where you receive almost guarnteed damage, combine it with fact that combo counter (thing that will increase your damage for some weapons) seems to be broken because it  sometimes resets when you roll (the only way to dodge unblockable attack) and sometimes it's not, sometimes you can make a few steps with combo still active, sometimes it's resets when you stop attacking for a few moments.\nFor me this game feels like pretty mediocore early access title, it needs a lot more polishing and variety which is not the case right now.\nBuy it only if you want to enjoy narrator's voice and music for 6h hours and then never launch it again.","March 10, 2015","false","14.0"," 382 of 592 people (65%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","65","382","592","17","19"

Grab it if it sounds right, because it is.\n\nPros:\n- Excellent and fresh concept: The mix works well, giving the player some of all worlds. Marvelous voice acting: Top notch and plenty of commentary from the GM. This is how it should be done.\n- Gorgeous graphics of the cards and coherent one within the 3d-fighting world.\n- Well written cards with sometimes alternate texts, the perfect amount of reading required.\n- A real chance to influence the random elements of the game when you draw one of four cards that were shuffled.\n- Plays really well with PC xbox-gamepad controller. I recommend using a gamepad for this.\n- It's fun! Yups, that counts...\n\nCons:\n- Feels little too easy the first 3-4 chapters, but becomes harder, and that's in the very start of the game.\n- Lacks adjustable difficulty settings, but makes that in part up by having an eternal mode. The game is geared towards the casual leaning to intermediate player or the experienced ones searching for some fun and well paced action. Hence, this doesn't have to be a con.\n- The combat system could possibly have gotten an overhaul for the more demanding players: It's somewhat too simplistic even if it is indeed challenging in it's own right. Feels too static now despite the fact that this wasn't ever aiming to be the next Arkham et.c.\n- When the shuffle is done it is sometimes impossible to understand where the card went mainly to how the shuffling is represented.\n\nWant:\n- Workshop support: Let the community create custom cards and/or campaigns. The game will never die then and keep getting followers.\n- DLC:s - this game has way more to offer within the already established framework. I'm certain that those who enjoyed it will want more of it.","April 5, 2015","true","6.0"," 51 of 62 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","51","62","4","0"

It helps if you’ve ever played a deck building game… or any of the Batman Arkham games as the combat style is precisely “Batman with an ax”. Combat is deliberately slow and methodical. Curating you deck is satisfying in that nerdiest of ways(Calculating the ice knife’s slow down effect verses the War Hammer’s added attack strength).  HoF relies a bit to much on the Skinner Box as unlocking tokens and cards is far more engaging than beating the bosses. Also you’ll want to equip the largest helmet you can find because your random viking avatar is the ugliest man… and you have to look at him the whole game. At the start of playing HoF I estimated I’d get about 20 hours out of it and at time of writing I’m at 22. Well worth the money simply for being able to listen to the dealer over and over.","March 23, 2015","true","23.8"," 48 of 60 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","48","60","4","0"

I've been playing the game since before it was released on steam. I think that now they've made it clear the game is almost finished I'm going to explain why this game is FAR from finished.\n\nLet me start out by saying that I'm an old gamer, yeah an old guy still playing games. So, the definition of what was and what is now considered a ROGUE-like are two completely different animals. The old rogue-likes were fun games were you crawled a dungeon in search of treasure and weapons much like the new ones. After that the definition has changed. Old rogue-likes required you to use your wits to advance your character in such a way that you could accomplish your goals as long as you played your cards right "no pun intended". The new rogue likes are a smorgasbord of take it up the proverbial gluteus without any way to counter/block/prepare or even chance your way out of a situation. This growing trend of masochistic (why people think it is) enjoyment has literally turned rogue like games that could have been great from games that lasted weeks, months, & years into ones that only last a few hours, days, or weeks. That’s if you're willing to deal with them for that long.\n\nThis game has (with a quickly closing window of opportunity) great potential. Its play style is great, the graphics are excellent, and the concept is really good. The issue is with the little faults in mechanics that destroy its greatness. The little bits of masochistic garbage that has been added in because of the fan boys that have demanded more challenge.  There are cards that instantly reduce your health by 50% with no way to counter them. Cards that do the same for food, max-health, or take your highest priced item with no way for you to stop it from happening. In 3-4 turns you can go from having 150 health, 60 food, and a good weapon down to having 24 max-health, 6 food, and your weapon stolen. Every one of these things under the frustration of them being uncounterable. I’ve died almost 9/10 times in this… game due to starvation because if you get food you lose food. If you have food it’s instantly screwed over.\n\nI’ll come right out and say this, the card shuffling challenges (once again due to whining fan boys) are plain and simply garbage. Yeah sure you can do them at lower levels (maybe level 1-4). After that it becomes a 100% guessing game because the cards move so fast, are undetectable in their sequence when going that fast, and shuffle 2-3 times. The card shuffling is just plain bad. It’s not novel at all, and in my honest opinion it detracts from the game. Aside from that I’m not even sure what they could do to replace it. I understand the frustration of trying to come up with a type of skill challenge were cards are involved, but there has to be something better than a crappy shifting cups knock off. I’ve played the game for some time now hoping they’d come up with something better, or at least improve on the current style. To my dismay it not only didn’t get any better but worse because fan boys asking for the cards to go faster (stating it was to EASY for them to spot the winning cards).\n\nThis leads me into my next complaint. Multiple people on these forums have asked for game modes (AKA easy, hard, expert, & Masochistic). Apparently the Devs refuse to acknowledge these requests. Who knows, it’s possible that these modes will be added on the final release, but it’s starting to look like the compass isn’t point north on this happening.\n\nThis game is looking more like a game of luck than a game of skill, and because of that I just can’t endorse it. My heart bleeds for how much I so wished this game wouldn’t become another modern aged rogue-like. Bosses and mobs that Spam the same unblockable attack over and over again. Many of them don’t even give you enough warning to even say you’ve been warned (AKA rat men). Controls that are unresponsive in many cases. Fire shooting Lizard-man that do massive damage to you in one hit if you even miss one of their projectiles.\n\nIn closing I could go into intricate detail on certain cards that are extremely annoying in this game. Why they literally ♥♥♥♥ me off every time I see them, and why they’re the reason this game is more of a chore then a fun experience. Every patch they’ve come out with since its release on steam has fixed some things, but destroyed others. As stated in the beginning this game is FAR from finnished. So much potential in a game from a group of programmers that could have made something extremely great instead of what is starting to look like a money grab that is falling short of its glory because of masochistic fan boys.\n\nadded 2/12/2015 after morgan's post on 2/10/2015\nI see that you’re passionate about the game. Hearing that it will eventually have game modes is a good thing. Especially for people that don’t like the over the top “luck based” system that is currently offered. I can see your point that many will consider this a finished product, and so I concede that it can be viewed that way.\n\nAs far as the taking the money and running quote. I’m sorry, yes I jumped the gun in the heat of the moment of my frustration in writing this review. If there are plans for game fixes in the future after the games release. Along with content updates that will surely fix the cards that will eventually be deemed less than enjoyable by many such as “example: choose to place on top or on bottom” then I will remove my negative post, and wait until a future time to once again try the game.\n\nIf I may, please make it so (if it’s not being implemented already) mob bosses don’t continually Spam their unblockable attacks. I don’t have a problem with the attacks so much as the constantly having to dodge the entire battle because they chain Spam the ability. Which ends up becoming problematic, repetitive, and less than fun when you have a Jack of Dust, and a King of dust doing nonstop power attacks along with 12 bandits swinging at you in tandem, and 3 of them throwing daggers almost the entire time.\n\nHere’s the thing. The keyboard buttons respond better than the joystick buttons do. However, joystick movement is much easier to use than the keyboard. So it’s a toss up. Example, I can counter rat men dart throwers with the keyboard because it responds better even if I’m hit by one of their projectiles. Were as if you get hit by one of the projectiles while using the joystick it’s almost impossible to block the rest of the attacks due to the slow response time of the buttons (In case you’re wondering I’m currently using an Afterglow Xbox 360 controller). Not sure if it's due to my controler or if there’s a fix to this, but it’s extremely frustrating when you get hit by a plethora of darts because you failed to block the first one.\n\nIn the end I realize I can’t have my cake and eat it too, and that I'm just one voice out of millions that play this game. I’ll stick with you guys as a backer; your response time is well appreciated, and shows you do care, so if people read this post hopefully they’ll read this section. Unless you want me to remove the whole post, in which case if you do, keep this in mind. You might want to make it really clear to people planning on buying this game that it is a heavily luck based system. If anything this is something I want to get across to the buying community. The games concept is awesome, and I commend your team for the work they have done up to this point on the game. I’ll refrain from a refund, and I’ll stick with it. The way I see it I’ve already gotten plenty of hours of game play out of the game, and don’t feel it fair that you guys won’t get paid for the work you’ve already done up to this point.","February 10, 2015","false","42.0"," 409 of 663 people (62%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","62","409","663","40","39"

There is way too much that this game does well and only 2 things that it does poorly. But first, I just have to do this:\n\n- Was entirely unlucky, got failures at almost everything, including the treasure chest - but for the evil carnival, I got 2 huge successes there\n- Got down to 2 health and got the close shave achievement\n- Went down to 10 HP with no food, got ambushed and restocked\n- Went down to 5 HP and got a shop\n- Entered the Scales boss battle with only 35 HP.\n- Then killed the stompy stompy tail lizard and his band, all of this one the same level.\n\n10/10 will try my luck again - and I will go play the lottery too now cause this was like 1/100. BRB.\n\nBack. Now what does this game does well and what poorly.\n\n(EDIT: I think I could have been less excited and more informative about the game. I am sorry, I was way too hyped. So here goes...)\nForeword: this is a card collection game, unlike any other. Here you do not use cards to fight - the cards represent actions or encounters. In essense, the cards fight you - or help you. In the beginning of the level, a maze of cards is laid out in front of you, which you must traverse to the end, which results in entering another area (different card layout) or a boss battle. And of course, to make your life even more miserable, you have food, gold, equipment and life points. Food needs to be replenished at a regular basis, or you will start losing life points and die of starvation. Gold is used in shops and random events, equipment and life points are used in battles.\n\nTo make the long read short short you have:\n- Random events - ranging from quests to finding a treasure chest or running a gauntlet to it\n- Fights - there is a number of encounters you need to fight through, including a boss at the end of the level who play in a 3D Batman/Assassin's Creed style\n- Shops and helpful NPCs who will give you buffs or food\n\nGood:\n1. No 2 games are the same, even if you play the campaign. Decks determine playthroughs, not scenarios.\n2. Winning a whole encounter and beating up the boss of a level with a starter rusty axe has never been more satisfying.\n3. Building a deck matters, molding it to your liking even moreso.\n4. Some people complain about the slowmo attacks, but it is exactly these that give you a good view of the battlefield.\n5. Mashing buttons can both win or lose you the game. Cool. Makes gamers learn something.\n\nBad:\n1. Bind the camera to buttons, people. You have both tabs unused, make it like Dynasty Warriors 8 and you will be golden. While I agree that you can't see behind your back and it adds a realistic combat, rogue-like games are punishing as they are by default.\n2. Boss battles become a bit repetitive once you learn how the bosses work and what is their attack sequence.\n\nSemi-bad: this game is best played with a controller. I hope you have one. My RAZR is doing a magnificent job with it.\n\nBuy the game on this last day of the early access and enjoy it. You don't have much time left, and the free first DLC is just an added bonus.","February 17, 2015","true","4.9"," 75 of 111 people (68%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","68","75","111","10","0"

Traversing the dungeon will flip the cards and apply the effects of the card. Your ultimate aim is to find the dungeon boss and defeat them, this unlocks the next boss AND token (booster packs / single cards).

As you step onto a card it is revealed, and the dealer narrates the events that ensue, while you decide how you act in the situation.\nThere is a wide range of different situations presented here, some result in combat, some might draw you cards from the pain deck (punishments, if your decisions or luck are bad) or the gain deck (food, gold, health, equipment).\nOn some encounters you play for a token, which represents one (or more!) cards to unlock for future rounds.\n\nAside from your inventory, you have health, food and gold as resources, all of which are important. On each turn, you consume 1 food, which heals you, unless you have no food, in which case you begin to starve. This quickly results in death, and means that you should plan a few turns ahead. And maybe not spend all your gold on shiny rings, but good instead.\n\nCombat & Controls\nWhenever you enter combat mode, you enter the world in third person mode and do battle against the monster cards the dealer has drawn for you.\nControls are fairly simple, left stick to move around, and the actions at your disposal are "attack", "counter" (if you have a shield), "weapon ability" and "use artifact" (usually buffs or area effect attacks)\n\nWhile this may appear shallow at first, it becomes rather taxing once there are more than a few enemies on screen, some of which may have ranged or special attacks, or block your attacks.\n\nI played with a controller and felt the game controlled very smoothly. I did not try mouse/keyboard at all, so cannot make a statement about it.\n\nProgression, Attrition & Deck building elements\nAfter you beat the tutorial, the dealer reveals to you that there are 12 champions (the "royal" cards of the suites, Jacks, Queens and Kings) for you to defeat. As you progress through the game you unlock many new equipment and encounter cards.\nOut of these you build 2 decks which the rounds are based on.\nBut as you gain more cards, the dealer also inserts his own cards into the encounter deck, the pain deck and of course the monster deck from which your opponents are pulled.\n\nIn one session you will usually accrue a number of items making combat easier for you, but to balance it out, you will also take damage, consume resources and later might be struck by one or more of the dealer´s nasty curse cards.\nThese serve as a means of hampering your progress, to not make it too easy for you. They range from basic debuffs (e.g. starvation causes more damage) to severe restrictions (e.g. you can not sell items, or "the more gold you carry, the slower you move"), putting you into interesting predicaments.\n\nAttrition, difficulty and long term fun\nDeath is permanent, but especially in the beginning of the game you will mostly emerge from a round with several newly unlocked cards, as such, frustration is kept to a minimum.\nUnlocking new cards is a strong incentive to keep playing, as many of the cards are interesting, and the encounter cards often form little story arcs.\n\nI beat the game after about 20 hours, meaning I defeated all of the champions.\nAfter beating the main game, there is also an endless mode, in which you dont construct a deck, but have all of your unlocked cards available (and so has the dealer, that sinister man.)\n\nThere were a few difficulty spikes (mostly the Jack of Scales and the King of skulls for me), but nothing too bad.\n\nGraphics, Sound & atmosphere\nAs mentioned before, the art style and graphics, as well as the beautiful music (with an oriental touch) serve to craft a very nice atmosphere.\nThe sinister musings of the dealer are often interesting (tough they repeat after a while, but not to the point where they are annoying)\n\nGripes\nWhile I can heartily recommend the game, there are a few gripes & nitpicks I have, which I will list here, in case they are a show-stopper to you:\n\nSome of the cards seem rather imbalanced, some equipment feel too strong (2 of the rings, I won´t spoil which) and some enemy encounters can stop a round quite early (The kraken especially, but at least it´s a card that you unlock rather late)\nIn-game advertising for the DLC (extra characters, which are basically game modifieres), achievements which can only be done with the DLC.\nThe DLC is only "okay"\nEndless mode starts out a bit slow, the first 2-3 floors are usually a cakewalk\nSometimes the combat can be a bit repetitive, more so if you aim for maximum unlocks/achievements\n\nOur hero´s deadly sin is gluttony, seriously, one food per turn, learn some restraint!","July 23, 2015","true","64.2"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","26","31","3","0"

The combat sequences can be a bit repetitive after long periods of play but this is meant to be more of a pick it up when you want 15mins to half an hour of fun game than an engrossing (and some might say long winded) story driven adventure. It IS an adventure nonetheless and no playthrough is ever quite the same. The dialogue and voice acting of the dealer is unsurpassed and does a fine job of creating that atmosphere I mentioned. Don't get too distracted by the words "card game". It's not what you would expect if you do. Despite the fact that it becomes very challenging in later play most gamers will have little trouble completing the story mode within about twenty hours. There is also a fairly entertaining "endless" mode though and this is one you could come back to any time you feel the urge. Perfect for "casual" play when you want a break from anything too substantial.","December 28, 2015","true","15.8"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","27","33","2","0"

Now it's on sale and with Steam's newly implemented refund system online I thought I would give it a go and I'm very glad I did!\n\nTo watch the gameplay videos does not do this game an ounce of justice, especially if you watch one from the beginning of the game and the reason for this is also one of it's biggest strengths.  Hand of Fate does a fantastic job of teaching by doing; there are no 'press 1 to feel' tutorials here, you enter the game and press start and before you know it you're already playing.  The first run is short and gives you a good idea about what the game is about but without smothering you in advanced rules and options and things you won't remember later on.\n\nFor the whole game you sit opposite a nefarious looking fellow akin to a games master, he draws cards for you and tells the story.  You simply have to choose the path you travel through the level and deal with each card as you land on it.  It may be an encounter you enter where you must fight (more on combat below), a series of traps you must negociate or a tradiditional text based quandry to muse over, where the outcome is determined by blind choosing one of four cards.  The likelyhood of being successful is often directly related to your gear, i.e. it's easier to cross a river in light armour than heavy so more of the four cards will give success and fewer failure.\n\nAs I alluded to previously simply watching the gameplay and combat videos do this game a great misjustice, hack and slash is not terrbily exciting to watch and the very reason you are fighting is lost.  You cannot possibly know the tension created by this being your penultimate fight before the boss of the level, that the card before was a goblin card and they stole your shield and that prior to which was a merchant card where you sold your spare shield.  The story that goes along with each encounter really enriches the combat, which really only makes up a portion of the game on the whole anyway.\n\nFinally there is the hearthstone-esque component of Hand of Fate; each time you complete a run you unlock more cards.  There are 3 decks, equipment for yourself (just because you choose to put a fancy new hammer in your deck doesn't mean you will ever draw it - just like in HS where you may be desperate for that flamestrikebut not draw it), modifiers to your character (flavour cards that add boons and debuffs and add great variety to playthroughs) and finally encounters.  When you get new cards you have to experience them in the game to see what they actually do (equipment included) so often you pick new cards with a hint of trepidation.  As you become more powerful and add more of your own cards so must you also add more cards for the game master to play and the enemies also grow in power and variety.\n\nIn closing I have played this game for 2 hours and felt compelled to write a fairly detailed review in the hopes it might urge others to try this fantastic game.  Worst case you play for just less than 2 hours and ask for a refund if it's not for you, best case you enjoy this gem as much as I did.","June 19, 2015","true","12.8"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","24","30","0","2"

The game lets you choose your own paths and craft your own story, and no two games are ever alike. A witty and snarky card dealer who sits across the table narrates much of your journey and adds his own personal commentary to the decisions you make and the fates that befall you.\n\nThe music is great, it's incredibly atmospheric and sets the stage and mood quite nicely. The voice acting is fantastic, the number of cards is large and varied, and the aesthetic is all around perfect.\n\nThe combat system is the only problem the game suffers, and even then it still works well. At times the animations can be a bit stiff and janky and there isn't much depth to it, but at the end of the day it's a nitpick to an overall fantastic game and experience.\n\nIf you enjoy rogue-likes, choose-your-own-adventures, deck builders, and story telling, pick this up.","February 22, 2015","true","2.7"," 27 of 37 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","27","37","4","0"

What would happen if someone walked in on you rolling dice and drawing cards all by yourself?\n\n"Oh, are you playing Solitaire?"\n"No! I'm not playing Solitaire. I'm playing a game where you have to fight zombies and aliens and disarm a nuclear bomb in 60 minutes or the world will be plunged into eternal darkness."\n"...it is okay to masturbate, Jimmy. You don't have to be ashamed of your body."\n"But I'm not doing the M-word, Daaaaaaaaad!"\n\nHand of Fate is like one of those dorky card games. I think the developers realized this when they started development, and so they threw in the card dealer and added all the stuff about life and death afterwards. It definitely needed it - because the Dealer is what really makes this game work. Without the Dealer, the game is you, sitting at a table, drawing cards and hallucinating these battles and these traps and sometimes wrestling with a convoluted camera angle operated by a narcoleptic operator. Plus there wouldn't be all these interesting story crumbs as to who the Dealer is, why you're here playing this game, the big dust-up that will eventually happen between you and him if he draws one more ♥♥♥♥ing Devilish Traps card.\n\nIt's not a bad game, but I just feel like it depended on a lot of the momentum from my earlier victories to keep me going, because I got tired of it after I got stuck fighting the King of Scales. Speaking of the King of Scales: This game has a difficulty curve that partially resembles a flat area and then a sudden, large ramp-up in difficulty on the last two stages. The difficulty curve ramps up on the King of Scales because the game forgets to tell you that his henchmen are all invincible while he's around, something that took me ten tries and five minutes in the Steam Community forums to realize. Also there's some fun balance issues that randomly make the game too easy or hard. And I hate when the game makes me have to run through a Traps level, because not only are you trying not to die to a bunch of traps, you're also playing with a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ camera angle that hides some of those traps.\n\nSo while it's not a perfect game, it's rather fun while the unlocks keep coming, but when they stop... oh man, this game starts to fall into a RUT.","January 20","true","13.8"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","77","23","30","6","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XB92AI/recommended/266510/","XB92AI","upNorth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XB92AI/","563 products in account","This game is a card game.  It is a resource management game.  It is a brawler. It is a text based, classic adventure game. It is a RPG and a rogue-like. This game is phenomenal, I thoroughly enjoyed my short time with it so far.\n\nI played but just 1 hour of Hand of Fate, I closed the game and instantly came to write this piece.  If you are like me and you like a good RPG, choose your own adventure or anything vaguely close to fantasy, I feel you will appreciate the direction that this game embarked upon.\n\nHand of Fate handles the tutorial with such finesse that I wasn’t even aware it was a tutorial until it had come to a end – I was already invested In my character and in my story.\n\nWhen you first boot up the game it will launch you directly in to the “game of life and death”, as is so aptly described by the card dealer. You will proceed to get comfortable at the fortune teller-esque table and Gothic surroundings with a inexplicably cryptic figure who welcomes you to the game of life and death. We do not know who the card dealer is, but you will get a sense of power and mystique as he shuffles the deck. Very quickly you will come to realise that Hand of Fate is not a run-of-the-mill card game, it is that and so much more.\n\nThe premise is to advance through each area and kill the twelve different heroes, that are under the guidance of the quippy card dealer.  The dealer will lay several cards in front of you on to a table, where you will take control of a game piece, just like in a board game. To advance you must move the game piece on to the different cards and watch the game unfold, for every card you move to one piece of food will be consumed – manage these resources very carefully. Each card brings with it its own adventure and riches, its own danger and fortunes, will you be brave and save the Captain of the Guard or leave him to the fate of the Undead?\n\nDefeating a hero card can be rewarding and in some cases, difficult.  With them, hero cards draw different monster cards from the deck that will place them in to the battle, increasing its difficulty. Once a hero is defeated, the game is over and you will be able to use any card tokens that you obtained throughout your journey to unlock more cards.\n\nUnlocking cards will allow you to customize your deck to your liking, just like any other collectible card game. If you are not in to fiddling about with so many cards, or are inexperienced with creating card decks, there is a option to create a deck optimized for you – Which the game will do for you.\n\nThe tone is set from the exact moment you launch the game – it is dark, it is mysterious and it is Gothic. The art direction for this title is spot on, everything just fits in to place, even the cards are designed in such an intricate way they left me feeling that I was really sitting at the table playing this game. The burning candle flickering over the game table sets the perfect mood for a stare-down with a hooded, mystic figure. I would love to be able to buy myself a physical copy of the cards.\n\nI genuinely cared for the actions that I took.  I wanted to save the Captain of the Guard, I wanted to loot the goblin cave and plunder its riches and I felt it necessary to make a deal with the devil. I delved in to reading each card and the tales it brought with it.  My hero was a holy-mace wielding, bandit slaying, guard saving badass and I loved it. I wanted to make sure that he had the gear I wanted him to have; maybe not necessary the best gear, but the gear that I believed fit in to his persona. This was a pen and paper RPG at its finest.\n\nDid I mention that this game is a brawler?  No?  Well it is.  When the cards are down and the candle flickers, when playing the game of life and death and inhaling the musky atmosphere, expect to kill or be killed. Combat is not turn based – It is not handled like a card game nor is it RPG-like.  I would forgive you for thinking that combat happens like that of a text-based adventure game, but you would be wrong. You, your character and all of the gear you have amassed will be teleported in to a 3D environment along with the monster cards that were drawn, and you will fight.  Combat is much like the Arkham series, but feels less polished.  It is obvious that this was not meant to be the games strong point – And that is okay.  It works and It fits in with the game, hell, at this point what doesn’t?\n\nWithin 1 hour of gameplay I had created a character that I was entirely invested in and cared about. He had saved the Captain of the Guard who provided us with his powerful Mace masked in a Holy boon to ward off the Undead. I had met a Fair Maiden who blessed me with life longevity by providing me with a +5 health boost. I encountered Mister Lionel, a Goblin disguised as a old man who mysteriously appeared a shield right in front of my face, as a gift. I had scaled the winding vines of a canyon as a glistening metal caught my eye – I had found a sword. The Maze Of Traps had been conquered and the gold plundered. I defeated the Devil’s challenge before looting a Dead King’s Tomb for +10 Max health, food and riches. I was no longer playing as a character in a video game, I was me and I was creating a story.\n\nHand of Fate is fantastic and if you have a vested interest in RPG’s, card games or fantasy I highly suggest that you give this game a go.  It is something different that tries and succeeds in covering many different game genres. This game is a gem that I was not expecting, I had no idea that this game was being released and I am glad I paid a measly £15 for this phenomenal title.  I know for certain I have only scratched at the surface of this game and I need to get back to playing more.\n\nFor more like this, head to XB92AI.com","February 19, 2015","true","5.2"," 32 of 47 people (68%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","68","32","47","7","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wastingsanity/recommended/266510/","wastingsanity","WastingSanity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wastingsanity/","167 products in account","Hand of Fate has a very unique approach to action RPG. As the player, you will find yourself sitting at a table and across the table you will find a robed individual with rather large hands. This masked man has plucked and manipulated your very memories in order to set the stage. Cards are used to construct levels, provide gear, health, or pain. Part story, part combat this game brings both worlds together to give the player a interesting taste of the characters life through the dealer's eyes.\n\nThe player progresses through the game by moving from the starting position to the stairs, cave, boat or basically the exit point for that level. With each move the player consumes one food. If you do not have food than the player loses 10 health. Each move delivers a new encounter for the player as he lands on a card. These cards are determined by what cards were included by the player and the cards added by the dealer. There are more player cards than dealer cards for the campaign. The encounters can be everything from rat men, humans, skeletons to an old woman that asks the player to bring her husband home.\n\nThe combat system is rather simple. Counter green indicators, dodge red ones and use shield bash to get past their block. Melee is confined to one button and feels  semi fluid. Weapons and items will give you special abilities, but it appears that only weapons will influence combat. For some reason if you do not have a shield you will not be able to see when to counter or dodge the enemy. With each boss run feeling slightly different, it improves the idea of playing more or even endless mode.\n\nFor additional details click the link below!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmPgm7OjyCc\n\nAlthough the game is not perfect, or that difficult I would recommend it to others as long as they found this style interesting.","February 21, 2015","true","12.2"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","18","22","3","0"

Every single level, you start with basically the same default gear. Sure it upgrades as you progress, but the point being, there isn't any of the enjoyment/excitement/satisfaction of finding new loot, at least in the traditional sense. You may get a card for a new awesome weapon, but there is a good chance you won't get to use it any time soon, or technically speaking, you could make it through the rest of the game without getting a particular equipment card that you've unlocked. Because of that, I don't really view this as much of an RPG, instead it's more of fantasy game wrapped around an action framework.\n\nAll and all, I loved the fresh approach, and many aspects of the game, enough that I would in fact recommend it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IronHeads/recommended/266510/","IronHeads","KellFromHell (D/S)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IronHeads/","104 products in account","There is a feeling you get on discovering a new world that cannot be duplicated. Like stepping through the wardrobe, falling down the rabbit hole, or having been spat in the eye by a Hobgoblin; when you first see the curtain drop, and the landscape come into focus, excitement akin to Christmas morning overtakes all other senses.\n\nSuch was my experience long ago when, on a whim, I picked up Suikoden II at my local flea market. To me it looked like your average game at the time. Pixel graphics. Promise of amazing story on the back. I had no great expectations.\n\nI've never been more wrong in my life.\n\nAs many who love RPGs have found, the Suikoden series is one of the best if not THEE best in the history of the genre. When I popped that disc into my old PS1 and heard the opening, named my avatar, and within the first hour was betrayed?! Hah! I was eight years old again, unopened red an green boxes sat before me under the tree.\n\nFast forward about 15 years and that same jolt of excitement strikes again. This time in the form of an indie game I picked up on Steam called 'Hand of Fate'.\n\nBrought to us by Defiant Development - a small Studio based in Brisbane, Australia - greenlit by the Steam community, and funded on Kickstarter; the game could not be more Indie if you gave it a whip and put it above a pit of snakes.\n\n55,000 dollars was all it took to see this masterpiece come into being. A drop in the bucket compared to the triple A titles being produced these days. Yet, as I play the game, I don't notice the difference. The voice acting is superb, the graphics are breath taking, and the combat animations are so satisfying you feel like yelling out, "GET REKT!!" whenever your shield connects with an NPC's face.\n\nWhat truly makes this game stand out however is not the RPG elements, nor the brawling. No, they are but two of the ingredients Deviant Development decided to toss in the pot. You also have a table top experience that's like a Tarot card reading mixed with Magic the Gathering. Deck building that reminds you more of 'choose your own adventure' books. Mazes reminiscent of classic dungeon crawlers. With all of it wrapped in a game of luck to the style of 'choose your card, any card'.\n\nMost of the deaths I've had in game has been due to choosing the wrong card and having my health eaten away. Or my food depleted, adding to the RPG experience of resource managing. Every single move has you on the edge of your seat because of this. With the fights actually a nice respite, and chance to catch your breath.\n\nNow, that isn't to say the fighting isn't challenging. Think Assassin's Creed, but with an element of luck thrown in. As all your armor and weapons are picked up by chance. Sometimes taken away as well. As was the case one round when Goblins came and stole my shield. Leaving me with just an axe to try and defeat a veritable army of bandits.\n\nThere literally isn't one BAD thing to say about the experience this game brings to the table. One can only nitpick at the few misspelled words, or similarities in Boss appearance. None of which diminish the shear enjoyment one gets from traversing the ever changing game board, unlocking new cards, and dodge rolling around trap-filled arenas with fire-breathing lizards, musket-toting skeletons, and kung-fu ratmen all hot on your tail.\n\nAt launch the game was 20 USD. It's since gone up to 25 USD. Would I recommend people wait for a sale to pick up what I'd describe as the biggest surprise in gaming since the early 2000s? No. A resounding NO! Go, buy it now. Play it, enjoy it. You're welcome!\n\nIt's such a good game, it's worthy of the meme, "Shut up and take my money"\n\nhttp://youtu.be/moxbxFrpYSo?list=PLFP2lSgrnK83QVkL1rerIAHKriEA3OhMV","March 2, 2015","true","8.8"," 25 of 36 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","25","36","3","0"

Others are great because they present themselves so well (like Rogue Legacy).  But Hand of Fate does everything well.\n\nHand of Fate is polished, deep, accessible, and rewarding both for the casual player interested in a unique game and the hardcore collector who wants to get every achievement.  Even when grinding for some of the more difficult cards available, I've never stopped enjoying the experience, the rich theming of the dealer's grim narration or the surprises of certain windfalls or turns of fate.\n\nHand of Fate is a rogue-like wrapped in a deckbuilding game.  As you progress, you unlock cards which represent weapons or equipment as well as enemies and encounters.  All together, these form your "decks" - the equipment you'll find available in shops and as random rewards, as well as what monsters or towns or characters you'll meet along the way.  As a result, there are multiple levels of strategy at play throughout the game as you decide which encounters are most rewarding, whether to include high-risk, high-reward cards or cards that consistently yield some small benefit.  Collecting these cards and building decks of rewarding encounters and a strong arsenal of weapons and armor will be the core of your experience.\n\nBut where Hand of Fate really shines is in its presentation.  The card-as-fate metaphor persists throughout, making for a surprisingly immersive game, even as it transitions between the navigation of your pawn from encounter to encounter and the Arkham-style combat instances in which you'll fight a variety of interesting enemies, each with its own set of different attacks and powers.  I'm reminded on the one hand of the old Lost Kingdoms games for Gamecube; on the other, of the grim atmosphere of Demon's Souls or Dark Souls; and also of FTL, with its emphasis on careful decision-making as you explore deeper and deeper into the unknown.\n\nBottom-line, it's the best-looking, deepest rogue-like I've played to date.  It looks good, plays well, and has tons of content, even at the $25 tag.  If you're even remotely interested, get it.  You may be surprised - you won't be disappointed.","February 17, 2015","true","87.1"," 27 of 41 people (66%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","66","27","41","4","0"

Now I am happy, that I did.\n\nI fully recommend this game, if you:\n1. Enjoy "rouge"-like systems, when you should go many runs deeper and deeper inside the game, some times lucky, some times not, to begin to understand what's happening or "get a hand of it".\n2. Enjoy building your experience by your own hands. You build 2 decks each time (except endless mode, which is just using all of your cards). First deck is equipment, that you will get chance to get, second is encounter deck. Got sick of unfair encounter? Just get rid of it. Or push your luck to limits to overcome it and get new equipment or encounter cards in return.\n3. Enjoy indirect storytelling. (When you get information about the world, characters and things that happen - piece by piece, finding new names or view on things by reading or hearing vague descriptions or remarks, and you are 100% free to try and put them together in a way, that will make sense.) I got tons of fun, while doing this.\n\nI thinks that you should go look for other alternatives, if you:\n1. Do not enjoy reading and prefer to skip any available dialog - "Just get me to action already, dammit!" You still can play this game, no problem, but will miss half the fun, and knowing that there are a lot of monster-slashing brawlers out there, I can assure you that if you just wasnt to slash some monsters go play something else, you will have more fun there.\n2. Do not enjoy increasing level of hardships you should deal with, further you play. Number of "freebies" will ultimately decrease, longer you play and hardships will only rise, will it be amounts of rewards or just chances of winning an encounter. Do not expect a "free ride" from start to finish.\n3. Can't handle simple action combat system, in which you should dodge or block of break guard at least from time to time. It is not just card game, or turn-base strategy, for more relaxing and meditative experience go somewhere else.","November 3, 2014","true","41.5"," 22 of 32 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","22","32","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Riverdusk/recommended/266510/","Riverdusk","Riverdusk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Riverdusk/","416 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOverview:  A single player action RPG with cards used to determine your encounters and loot.  You have two different decks,  Equipment and Encounters.   You have a specific number of cards you need to use to create each deck and some are locked in, at least at first.  The Dealer will also throw some cards in of his own “to spice things up” as he says.\n\nThere is some strategy to building a deck, but your choices are fairly limited early on until you unlock more cards. You unlock cards by successfully completing encounters.  Deck building is pretty simple to start and honestly never gets really complicated.   For good or bad, this isn't a game you'll spend long lengths of time agonizing over what to put in your deck like you can in some other card based games. You also have a choice to have the decks auto built for you if you don’t want to bother with building at all.\n\nThe game is played by moving on a “map” built with a layout of the Encounter cards.  Some are battles that open up a separate battle map where you fight real time, some are shops, and some are random events.   Many of the random events end up with a three card monte style system where you try to pick the "success" card among failure ones.\n\nThere is a story mode where you fight through a series of bosses until you beat them all or an endless mode where you just see how long you can last.\n\nGood:\n+ Presentation: Very polished.  It is a definite cut above your typical indie game.\n+ Voice acting: Excellent.  You’ll hear from the dealer a lot and his comments really add to the feel of the game and he is talented.\n+Graphics: Good on the deck building, the cards themselves and the dealer.   Battle maps aren’t quite as nice looking, but they aren’t bad.  Bonus points that it supports 16:10 resolution which has been an issue for me on some other indie games.\n+Gameplay: The card building is simple, but interesting. There is a good variety of different encounters and loot.\n+Music: Very nice overall.\n\nBad:\n-Combat: Overall a fun action combat system.  However, it can sometimes can get a bit clunky.  Excessive use of slow motion and the camera can sometimes be an issue.  I also think a turn based combat system would have fit the style of the game better and would have made it overall more strategic and fun of a game.  Personal preference though.\n-Replayability:  It grabbed my attention initially better than most games and has kept me entertained so far, but 8 hours in and 9/13 of the bosses defeated in the story mode, it is getting a little repetitive.  I don’t see this being a game I play for 50+ hours, at least at this point.  Then again, I don’t play many games for 50+ hours.\n\nOverall:  Well worth picking up.  If you want to wait for Early Access to end, it is scheduled to release Feb. 2015.\n","January 11, 2015","true","9.6"," 22 of 32 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","22","32","2","0"

This little gem isn't flashy or pretentious, it is indeed very humble, and feels genuine and smooth.\n\nThe Game\nReading a few reviews while i was deciding if i should purchase the game or not, i quite didn't understand how the game worked, what it was about, and so on. I'll try to describe it in the simplest, most immediate of ways.\nYou sit at a table, in a mysterious hall, playing a game of cards with a hooded man, his face covered by a veil. There are different kinds of cards:\n-Equipment cards (you get these during the game, they give your character the gear he needs to face monsters and such)\n-Encounter cards (challenges, monsters, mini trap dungeons, shops, bosses and so on)\n-Random cards (depending on the level, these cards are added to the mix by your opponent to "spice up things")\nYou move your pawn through covered cards, one at a time, uncovering the cards you land on and facing the challenge. Each level is composed by 2+ randomized layouts of cards. The goal is to reach the final boss and defeat it, surviving all along. The game starts easy, but after a while it starts to get really challenging. The rng plays a big part in the game and it can be frustrating at times, but when you actually succeed it feels very rewarding. Each time you get to choose from the cards you earned which kinds of encounters you can make on a level, same goes for the equipment, so you can adjust your chances and create a strategy.\n\nPros\n-Incredible replayability thanks to the randomized levels, cards and decks.\n-Big variety of creatures, challenges\n-Diffiucult but rewarding\n-Amazing voice acting and atmosphere\n\nCons\n-Like all games with a high random factor, at times, it can get frustrating\n-Fights can get a bit repetitive at times\n-You can't really play a "class", you're a standard warrior-ish guy\n\nI personally really liked the game, and i can see myself playing it a lot. It isn't one of those immersive games that you spend long sessions playing it, but it's great to play in a relaxed way if you have some spare time. It retains the feel of the old table games and definitely deserves a try.\n\n8/10","February 20, 2015","true","9.0"," 23 of 34 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","23","34","0","0"

And also that you don't have to spend $60 on a game for it to be fun and compelling.\nHand of Fate offers a nice mix of card game and roguelike-like and does so brilliantly. The graphics are really nice, in sort of a dark/cartoonish style that I find really easy on the eyes. It runs really well, obviously, given that it doesn't try to go into the spectacular visuals with tons of shaders and post-effects. Instead it offers a solid, stylized presentation where nothing feels out of place. The voice acting is quite good, too, and helps set the mood, with the card dealer commenting on your choices and their consequences. There probably aren't hundreds of hours of recorded audio, but what little there is is quality voice acting and writing.\nGameplay wise, it's mostly a tarrot game of sorts with some third-person Batman-like brawling action to spice things up from time to time. The action scenes are relatively well executed, as in they're functional (if not grandiose) and offer a fun way to see your bonus/equipment cards in action. They also help adding some manner of player agency in a game that's mainly RNG vs. you. TLDR: the actions scenes, while not the best brawling gameplay you can find, are well integrated and end up making the game a better, more varied experience as a whole.\nAll in all, Hand of Fate feels like a very well crafted little game, that's not yet another 16bit pixel style roguelite, and asks very little $ for what it has to deliver.","March 8, 2015","true","5.7"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","16","22","0","0"

Relating back to the original deck of cards with Jack's Queen's and King's as the primary bosses, the game manages to provide a very replayable adventure/tcg experience. Visually, it's gorgeous and the voice acting is on point. The bosses are all creative and each have different ways to be dealt with, giving the game a nice variety. The only reason I would not recommend this game is due to the final boss dungeon.\n\nOkay sure, it's the big conclusion to the game, expect it to be a challenge yeah? Well yes it is a challenge, almost to the point where it's 90% luck and 10% skill related. Every time you decend a level you're cursed and you cannot gain any blessings, each curse can be extremely brutal to the point where I some how reached the last boss but with a max hp of 30 and significant stat decreases. Nearly every battle is involving a boss, which is reasonable, but to chuck you into a fight with a King and another King in a very very claustrophobic environment is just flat out unfair, especially with the King of Scales... Odds of selecting the 1 victory card out of the 4 cards involving the rest being failure is stupidly difficult as the cards are mixed obserdly fast and it would take a computer to even begin to comprehend where it is, and if failure occurs, not only aren't you rewarded but you're punished, every thing is punishment. It almost ruins the entire game and enduces rage just because everything that could possibly go wrong, does. And there is nearly no way to even remove these curses, as most of the curses would either prohibit it or take all your gold and food away so you cannot afford to have it removed.","February 27, 2015","true","14.2"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","13","17","3","0"

Have been wanting this since way back in the days of Vampire the Masquerade - and it never really came.  Hand of Fate manages this really nicely, as the encounter you are about to face is created by the very cards you draw.  The smooth Arkham-style fighting rounds this out to be a solid, very layered game.\n\nThe graphics are unique and nice, a cool blend of fancy hand-drawn card/boardgame and more Diablo-esque arcade environments.  You feel like you're across from your nemesis/Game Master and that it's all playing out based on your interactions with him.  The voice acting of this GM-type character is critical to the game since you hear his voice so much, so thankfully they've got A-list voice work here.\n\nVery replayable as you collect cards and expand the possibilities of each game.  Roguelike in that once you die, you die and your current adventure is over, but the cards you've earned along the way are still added to future adventures making for even more diversity.\n\nThis game is in early access right now and it still plays like a complete game.  It's awesome and in only 4ish hours of play I can already tell I'm addicted to it somewhat.  If the developer/s keep polishing and expanding this, I think it could potentially explode on the scene and start a beloved new franchise because so far it's as good as any I've played.\n\nThink Talisman meets Magic the Gathering meets Diablo and you'll be roughly in the ballpark.

People tend to say Hand of Fate is a brawler, roguelike, and deckbuilder put together, but there's really not a deckbuilding function in the sense that people drawn to the word are going to want. Your encounters, gear, map layouts, etc. are represented by cards but it's more a way to reduce encounters to separate instances. It's an abstraction of systems you'd find in any roguelike. It's not Ascension or Dominion or anything like that.\n\nAnd that's fine! Hand of Fate is no more diminished by not being a deckbuilder than an apple is diminished by not being an orange.\n\nHand of Fate gives a lot of bang for the buck with a reasonably deep brawling system -- a bit shallower than Arkham Asylum but deeper and more rewarding than most every game that's tried to recreate it since. Hack and slash, shield bash, counterattack, leap, roll, reflect attacks, and use powerful magic tied to cooldowns. Your experience in combat might change a lot based on the character you run, the gear they're carrying, and the blessings and curses that follow them into battle.\n\nThe overworld is drawn out by cards. Each room, each challenge, each store and story element finds its place on your dungeon-crawl from the dealer's hand shuffling out your cards. Your choices here determine whether you go to battle in gleaming armor with the favor of the gods on your shoulders or drag your starving, penniless, curse-tainted husk to its last stand.\n\nOverall, there's plenty of content and loads of depth to ensure you get your money's worth, and a series of free expansions make Hand of Fate a good buy.","March 26","true","53.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I’ve had the probability of card change on me for seemingly no reason, and I’ve gotten encounters on cards that I hadn’t before, without so much as a witty one liner from the DM about patching the card.\n\nAlso the arena’s get really cramped really quickly and are too small, and later on when they become booby-trapped it becomes a nightmare. Especially with the plague rats that poison you if you go by there body after you kill them. It makes what little land you have even more of a mine field. Overall the combat is serviceable but too clunky for the amount of precision it demands.\n\nOverall I like the game and it is a lot of fun, but there is some frustration factors. I would recommend it if you love tabletop games, and “choose your own adventure” style games, but avoid it like a plague rat if you were interested in it’s combat.\n","June 22, 2015","true","6.8"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

The graphics are colorful, the sounds great and the voice over narration achieves something I've not seen in another game: an adversary that breaks the fourth wall and speaks directly to the player.\n\nThe Dealer concept works for several hours of play as a sort of mentor, antagonist, peer and philosopher, making all manner of observations and acidic quips. This masked character sets up the field of play, composed of upside down cards arranged in a variety of formations. You move a simple, game-board style pawn, like if Monopoly went all Dungeons & Dragons, navigating a limited number of routes to find the stairs to the next level.\n\nThe Dealer both taunts and encourages you along to a particular confrontation, completing a story-mode mission; or, in the case of endless-mode, the script runs short and he quickly begins repeating himself.\n\nWhile the game offers a fair amount of loot and situations to encounter, and the developers do seem to be adding more of both, it is limited not just by this single narrator, the Dealer, but by a total lack of customization of your character. Every time you play, you look like a background character from Ragnar's troupe on Vikings. While the Dealer is faceless, your character is stamped with one single solitary, indelible look. Seeing options for both, even in the form of a DLC that included more encounter cards and such, would enhance the replayability and deepen the experience.\n\nThe combat keeps things fresh with relatively simple controls and a rock-paper-scissors structure of moves and counter-moves. Adding in the variety of effects such as freezing, cooldown reductions, stunning etc allows for a great many synergies to discover through repeated play. I did find the documentation of just how all these different statuses and statistics interacted to be lacking, but I don't think it ultimately effected my enjoyment of Hand of Fate.\n\nFor me, combining the abstract fantasy tropes of the encounter cards with the fun, colorful and continually improved-upon combat, hit that sweet spot of allowing for my own imagination (excepting for being trapped with the one skin) to exist alongside the developer's sense of imagination. Hand of Fate helped me imagine many fun, pointless, rollicking and satisfying fantasy beat'em ups, so I give this both thumbs up.","March 5","true","83.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kubillium/recommended/266510/","kubillium","Kubillium","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kubillium/","222 products in account","EDIT: Some information was plain wrong and has been corrected, see below...\n\nThis is one of those ominous blind buys I do on impulse once in a while. I bought Hand of Fate because it looked weird enough, especially since I'm not a fan of fantasy games. I liked the idea of a random card-based dungeon and I'm a fan of old adventure books. So, HoF landed in my checkout cart for 18 EUR (20% off at the time) and I started playing while I had some vacation.\n\nThe Good StuffAlthough the graphics aren't next gen or even really good it uses colors that look great (not that horrible pastel stuff a lot of games use at the moment) and especially the dealer animations were really fun to watch. He rolls his eyes at you if you take too much time, he tucks on his wristbands once in a while and his dealing animation is still so cool to watch even after so many rounds. Also, his voice acting is just amazing. It fits perfectly, the lines are nicely written and you always feel this play between the arrogance of the dealer and his goodwill. Even without a real background story and any personal events he feels like a real character, a really cool feat to accomplish if you ask me.\nThe drawings on the card decks are also really fun. They look great, have just the right amount of detail and always give you hints of what to come without revealing too much about what they do. Some are like tarot decks (with conceptual or more abstract themes -- your event card deck that creates the dungeon), some just show you different equipment/resources, and some are based on French decks: boss enemies are jacks, queens, and kings; the numbers from two to six depict a minion spawn of two to six enemies, the suit determines the different types of enemies.\nThe gameplay is also pretty cool. People call it roguelike and trading card game based but I didn't get the feeling of any of that. Of course you have randomly generated dungeons. Of course you have some elements of TGC's in there (like receiving new cards for your deck if you win a round, creating your own decks, and managing resources) but the game reminded me a lot more of those adventure books I read as a child... ("If you want to go down to the basement turn to page 278, if you just turn around and run away turn to page 141.") The basic idea is that you move your figure from card to card to reveal new and unknown challenges. They may be good ("You find a Maiden that grants you a wish") or they might be horrible ("Someone ambushes you!"), but pretty much every single card is unique and many offer various interesting different events, depending on your choices.\n\n\nThe 'Meh' StuffThe game can be very unforgiving. As someone who has played Dark Souls I'm probably not allowed to say that but the later levels can go twenty minutes and your hero will be in amazingly good shape but then everything will fall apart within one move you make. This bummed me out more than once but never enough to not restart the game.\nThe sound overall is not really good, especially in fighting sequences, and the music isn't entirely special (although it never really bothered me, which is a good thing, I guess). The fighting mechanics are very much like those from the newer Batman games but they feel a lot heavier and simplified. They still managed to add a lot of diversity by all the interesting equipment in the game. Basically every single item above starting gear level has unique abilities that force you to adjust tactics (especially later in the game). Still, there are less than a handful of basic enemy types and the bosses aren't all that different except from one special ability, more hit points and more devastating attacks. In the end you beat them  all up by mashing 'X.'\nAnother thing is: There is not a lot of end game to enjoy. After finally finishing the last story mode chapter (about five hours into the game) the only thing left is endless mode which doesn't even have a save-game option in case you're into one good run. So there's no way to drop into the game for a few minutes and play a round. The good news is that the developers are working on DLCs, but I couldn't find good info wether it will be more story mode missions with progress items or just new cards.\nFinally I want to mention the price. The game is nicely produced and definitely is fun to play but with a pricetag of 23 EUR I feel those five hours could've been easily ten hours of fun with some more levels like aces for each suit (or what about the full jack to king sets of lava golems and mages?). There wouldn't have been a need to draw and story-board twice as many cards, I just want to do a bit more before the game will go stale.\n\nThe Final StuffDrawn in by nothing more but 'uh, thos cards look cool,' and the fact that I liked the idea of adventure books since I've been a child I think the game turned out great. I felt very nostalgic, even though I had my XBox controller in hand instead of a book. The ambience and voice acting is amazing while the fighting would've been more interesting for me would it have been old-school with dice throwing. Still, while the story mode lasts and while you still feel new stuff coming, you will be entertained, even if you're not a fantasy fan. I think my 18 EUR found a good place to be, if you get it for 50% you already have a great deal. I wouldn't buy it for the full price since the content is not as extensive as it could or should be. Finally, you might be disappointed by the looks of the character who is not costumizable and ugly and male.\n\nEDIT: I am an idiot. I totally forgot about the secret level that pops up after you beat the last regular boss (not trying to spoil too much here). So there might be quite a bit more time than 5 h in the game, the final boss is insanely hard at first so you can easily spend 10 h to beat him (just a guess, might be more, might be less).","February 23, 2015","true","9.7"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","11","15","3","0"

It definitely has that "one more try" factor going for it.\n\nI'm 60 years old, and have been playing computer games since they were born. I have 195 of them in my steam library, and this is the first review I've submitted. Well, I don't actually plan to review it (I'm way too lazy for that tonight), but this is the first time in a long while that I felt obliged to post a comment. The reason I'm doing that is that I have a feeling that this game might just slip under the radar, and never fulfill it's potential...and that would be a shame. I've seen that happen many times over the years, and "potential", is often somethiing that's never followed up on. I know that. My eight grade nun predicted that I "had so much potential, but I'd never make anything of myself"...and she was "spot on" with that observation. But I digress ;) The game still needs a bit of work in terms of balancing, some of the choices that are offered are a bit too random...maybe a bit of RPG type progression could be introduced to help with that, but it's certainly playable right now.\n\nAnyway, I'd recommend that you give it a try. Use a controller; I'm more a keyboard guy myself, but keyboard/mouse is a little clumsy at the moment.\n\nI'm only a few hours into it, but I'm actually planning to give some feedback to the developers.

I strongly recommend this to fans of RPG/adventure. 8/10\n\nIt seems incredibly easy at first, but after only a few hours the difficulty starts to ramp up. Sometimes you do live or die by the sheer luck of how the cards are dealt, but that's just RNG for you. I don't have any complaints in this regard.\n\nThe game seems to be about ~15 hours long to play through the story mode, allowing for a few failures (I'm about halfway now with 6 hours), but the endless mode offers near-infinite replayability, particularly if you enjoy trying desperately for the best possible scores. Also, there's a decent variety of cards to play with, so you can always replay a level with different decks to try something new. I think that some DLC or expansions are to be expected in the future with new cards and new challenges, so you'll get even more time out of this game then.\n\nI have no major issues with this game. The simplified combat does result in some "clunkiness" (you can play around it but it feels like you shouldn't have to) and I've noticed the occasional graphical error (monster heads stretching after death and the narrator's jaw showing through their face scarf for example). These are not things that tarnish the experience of the game though.","February 22, 2015","true","10.6"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","11","16","3","0"

This game is so awesome and so clever, it's hard to know how to start.\n\nHand of Fate is an early access game of indeterminate genre. Roguelike is probably closest fit, but it's a blend of deck-building, rogue-likes and Arkham Asylum's combat with a dark fantasy setting.\n\nEarly Access: Entirely playable. Very solid beta release.\n\nGameplay: You build an encounter deck and an equipment deck using cards you win through playing the game and defeating encouters. How this plays out narratively and mechanically is so clever. As an example, there are "Ratling Hunters" cards that become locked into your encounter deck until you defeat the "Ratling Exterminators" encounter.\nWhen you encounter monsters, the action takes place in a small instanced arena where you must fight for your life. You start out with very little but as you gain cards you can become an incredible killing machine. Once you have the "counter" ability, it becomes similar to Batman Arkham Whatever's combat.\n\nThe encounters you face are randomly laid out as a tarot style reading. And you're going to die. Die a lot.\n\nAsthetics: Visually, the game is nice enough to look at. It won't blow you away but it sets the dark fantasy mood. The audio for the game is mostly good but there are bugs. The music is fitting, the VO for the dealer is acerbic but sometimes the sounds are annoying. Spawning enemies all sound like the 60's version of the Penguin (waaaark wark wark wark) and your dude sounds like Link but looks like an ancient celtic bad-♥♥♥. Still, early access, it's forgivable.\n\nThis game is amazing. Get it. Just get it. The only thing I really want is more customisation over my character, or possibly mulitple characters. Playing as a mage or something like that would require a different eq. deck and thus DLC is born.\n\n","August 24, 2014","true","46.5"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

Out of nowhere it seems. I was intrigued when I saw the store page and watched some videos via Steam broadcasting. There's nothing quite like it. At its core its a card game where you start immediately in some mysterious location, at a very creepy gaming table and even more mysterious dealer. He deals encounter cards which form your "playing board".\n\nYou move your token around the board uncovering the cards and your story or "fate" unfolds as the title implies. The encounter cards vary from quests, travelers, monsters, combat, shops, weapons, artifacts, blessings, curses, mazes and all sorts of other things (good and bad) too numerous to mention. Many of the cards offer you a choice which you must consider carefully as it will affect the outcome of the game. Your goal is to defeat boss encounters and move your way up to more challenging decks and bosses. All the while the dealer talking and commentating on the state of the game. The voice acting is superb. A very well done and hypnotizing soundtrack really sets the mood and makes you feel like your taking place in something epic.\n\nAs you play you unlock more cards which then go into your deck and the dealer's deck both of which you can customize within the game rules. This makes the game even more interesting and varied as you go and replay again. In the end though each play session is procedurally generated as he deals the cards, adding some of his own and making each play through unique. Will you live or die? What waits for you at the end of the card chain? You'll just have to play to find out.\n\nYour three primary resources are health, gold and food, all of which are necessary to proceed. Along the way you'll need to (hopefully) acquire enough and manage/spend them all wisely or you might find yourself rich and starving, or poor and overfed with not enough gear to stay alive in combat. It's your choice but balance seems to work the best.\n\nThe combat takes place in 3D top down arenas played Diablo style. It's fast paced, dramatic, very tense and requires quick reflexes. Here you can use artifacts, special weapon powers and abilities if you're fortunate enough to have found them to help you in your fight. If not then well.....good luck.\n\nTable graphics are excellent. The card art is average. The fighting arena graphics won't win any awards but are decent enough to get the job done. It doesn't matter though because the gameplay trumps everything else and that's clearly where the devs put most of their efforts. With the exception of the final level difficulty which is miserably hard, the game is near perfect.\n\nIt's risky pushing the boundaries of stale genres and the litany of "card" games that flood the store. This game succeeds in doing so on so many levels. Highly recommended if you're looking for something different.","February 20, 2015","true","60.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","6","8","3","1"

Many elements of this game involve the RNG - the success/failure card picks, the combination of enemies you face in a given encounter (and the environment in which you face them), the weapons/magic/blessings/armor you have access to in a given game.  All of this can lead to a very frustrating experience.  You may desire to complete a "quest," only to find that you can't seem to get the "success" card multiple times in the card game. Sometimes, you won't even see the quest card that game.  Perhaps I should've seen all this coming? I enjoyed the Arkham Asylum-esque combat, and the ability to create both your equipment and encounter decks. My main recommendation would be simply to quit after you finish the campaign.

It says "Beta" which while true they aren't missing much. Mainly a few sounds here and there. So there will be an odd silence when you would expect a clink of metal or for your masked opponent to say something to you. Other than that maybe a few features here and there are missing like custom cards, characters and annoyingly enough a tutorial. I would love to see classes implemented and more in depth card play.\n\nThe 3D combat is simple but works well into the game. Each battle is short and usually is kept spiced up with traps, new enemies, and modifiers to gameplay. Its got a very batman arkham feel to it. With dodging countering and attacking while you bounce from enemy to enemy beating them over the head with that shiny new mace you got from a gorge. Then you play a little bit more of the card game and get some rewards and get excited for the next combat so you can test out that hail of daggers power you got. I'm perfectly fine with the simple short combat and never felt like it was hindering gameplay.\n\nNow I should note that the whole card game bit is rather soft. It is a deck builder but the element is light and plays more of a thematic role (which by the way is my favorite part and by no means is a bad thing) The whole time your playing the game you are constantly getting new cards which you get to discover and play with. Everything very much feels like a mystical card game of sorts. Not a hearthstone/magic the gathering feel but none the less a mystical card game. (also my other favorite thing no microtransactions unlike many card games) The price may seem steep but I went ahead and took a quick peak of gameplay and was quite impressed. I won't expect you to get this game after my review but I would at least ask that you go take a peak at some gameplay even if you skip around the video.\n\nShort Hand:\n\nLove the theme and constant rewards.\n\nMildly annoyed at a few small features that I feel are missing.","July 29, 2014","true","12.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The atmosphere is incredible, the pretense for the story delivered through a card based roguelike dungeon is genius in how it capitalises on the strengths of both card games and roguelikes.

That said, I can't recommend it in its current state.\n\nI originally wanted to say that the game is too difficult, but that's not true. The game is outright unfair. I'd be fine with the game being difficult, because difficulty implies a requirement for careful application of thought and skill. This is not what this game offers. Especially nearer towards the end of the game, there are an incredible amount of cards the dealer plays that may as well read "Player loses game". For an example, in the final encounter I'd unlocked before giving up, the deck was stacked with entirely uncounterable cards that reduce maximum life by 50%.

Beware though, this is not a card game. Yes the theme is about card games but the combat is the 50% of the gameplay and it is the ultimate deciding factor between the win or loss condition. Definately watch a gameplay video of Totalbiscuit or whatever before purchasing!!! aside from that, this is totally worth the purchase.\n\n- Long version: Although the price seems a tad bit high, you will probably feel like the game deserves it in the first 30 minutes of gameplay. The theme is laid out elegantly, voice acting, soundtrack and the general atmosphere is just amazing.\nYou get to create your own deck of possibilities (cards are events). Your decisions and sometimes mere chance decides the outcome of that event. Events can sometimes turn into a battle ( AC style 3rd person combat style) .\nCombat is the 50% of this game in the beginning. However in the later stages of the game, the strategy, deck-building and the choices made outside of the combat is the bigger deciding factor. So its safe to say that combat is probably around 25% of importance once you get better at it.\n---------------\n\nPROS:\n\n*  TONS of replay value. (This is the part that deserves the full price);\n*  Awesome presentation. Artwork just fits with the theme like a glove;\n*  Great gameplay mechanics. Combats last as long as they should, no more or less;\n*  Simple UI design is just relaxing, the game has almost no menu's or complicated screens;\n*  Most importantly, The game makes you want to play again, and again, and again...\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCONS:\n\n* Combat. This game would be PERFECT withouth combat (or at least with different styles) . I can't describe the exact reason but the game is just too perfect "on the table" with the atmosphere, that I want to sit on that table, face to face with the dealer. Combat feels like a chore, something to get out of the way before I can come back. It just feels like a break from the actual game. Totally breaks the immersion for me.\n\n*  In the story mode, everything builds up to combat, and resolves with the outcome of the combats (or at least the final combat). God I just wish cards would be a little bit more important. (not just determining the variables of combat)\n\nOverall: A perfect game for some, but not the game for everyone. Has its own style. Really original ideas that should not be missed out. Worth the purchase\n","March 5, 2015","true","17.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The introduction to the game is simple and easy to follow allowing you to pick up the game quickly and play at your own pace.\n\nAs you play the game you step from card to card in stages and deal with a number of random events including; battles, moral choices, ethical choices, gambling, quests and visiting shops while progressing through the stage towards the goal of a boss fight. The main story consists of 12 stages each with a boss of its own. All heading towards a final 13th stage that you will not be prepared for the first time. Around about the time you defeat the 4th boss you will unlock a game mode called "endless".\n\nEndless mode is never ending stages progressively getting harder until you can go no further. I suppose the goal is around stage 30 as this is the achievement awarding level. I personally was never able to beat my record of stage 26. It gets seriously rough. The addition of "endless" mode allows you to unlock more cards/ rewards as you complete each cards requirement which can then be used in both story mode and endless.\n\nA great addition to the game is the ability to edit the "world" or "level" by using the deck builder which is available basically at the start of the game. Once you have an idea for the game, the events and items you have preference for you are able to open the deck builder before a main story level and adjust it to your specific liking. The game does offer an auto recommended deck which is fine but once you hit that final 13th level you will most likely need to adjust the deck to your specific play and equipment style.\n\nOverall I had a great time with this game, an interesting story, great narration/ music and a play style that was addictive, punishing and rewarding. If this sounds even remotely interesting to you I would suggest you pick it up and give it a try. I loved my time spent on Hand of Fate and I couldn't recommend it enough.","March 23","true","29.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

In an industry that has become highly itterative, Hand of Fate combines tried and true fighting game mechanics with a rogue-lite/dungeon-crawler and blends it into an original package with "trading" card game mechanics.\n\nThe combat is a cross between Batman: Arkham City and Witcher 2. It has the style of combat from Arkham (different enemies do different attacks, organizing which enemies to eliminate first, counter system) but it has the pace of Witcher, in that it is quite slow and you cannot constantly spam the counter button, but instead must really time your attacks and counters. In addition, in this game you are not invincible, each strike landed on you will take away 5-10 health and your health persists for the entire dungeon (you get +5 health regen per "turn"). this is where my comparison to witcher makes more sense, this isnt a pure action game like Arkham, instead you must really plan the weapons and armor you take into combat, and you must manage your resources, if you run out of resources (-1 per turn) you enter starvation where you lose 10hp per turn. There is also an interesting mechanic where the instances that the game transports you to, is filled with traps that can harm you and your opponents. It a nice little touch that adds to the difficulty.\n\nAs for the card game element of the game, its not like your traditional TCG like scrolls or Hearthstone, instead the cards you acquire are used to create the dungeon that you will traverse to reach the final boss, you can make an "easy" dungeon in some sense of the word, but that will yield very little buffs when you face the dungeon boss. Also, that strategy will limit the amount of gold you get and the Holy card buffs you receive that carryover from dungeon to dungeon.\n\nSo far I've been raving about the game, but there are some grievances, mostly it comes down the combat. So far the combat is great, but this game essentially revolves around its combat system and for that it has to be flawless. My only gripe is subjective, in that it doesnt quite feel as "tigh/responsive" as I would prefer. In leans more towards the witcher style of combat, which is not a bad thing to say; the game just needs some polish. The devs needs to reduce the delay between pressing a button and it registering in the game. Also, at times, the enemies (usually bosses) will have canned animations that they must complete which prevents you from attacking them. Ie, they will continue slashing and NOT take damage from you while they are finishing the animation. That and the fact that the counter attack isnt always responsive does take away from the combat experience. Lastly, the camera is kind of janky and to my knowledge you cannot control it, which can be very annoying at times. However, the game is in early access, so I will give the benefit of the doubt to the devs in that they will sort these things out.\n\nLike I said, im not a "professional" reviewer, but the game is so unique that it deserves some attention. At the least, check out some lets plays on youtube.  Question is, is it worth it? for me, yes, at the $25 price range, even in the early access state, you can get a lot of enjoyment out of it. However, as a wise consumer, its always best to wait until the official release, but if you are a fan of the genres it combines or have some disposable cash to spend on steam, give it a shot.\n\nTLDR: Action game mixed with a rogue-lite dungeon crawler and some card-game elements. Combat is a mix of Batman: arkham asylum and Witcher 2, leaning more towards Witcher. The game is actually pretty challenging, its not a superhero simulator like Batman or even Assassins Creed where you just counter continuously.\n\nIf devs are reading this, find a way to add MP/CO-OP, perhaps take turns being the "dungeon master", the game has soooo much potential.","July 9, 2014","true","1.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It still is kind of barebones and kinda unresponsive, but that's early access for you. As a game It really hooked me and I did really enjoy playing this. Deckbuilding is kind of stale until you actually get more cards by beating bosses and succeeding in events.\n\nFighting feels good and meaty and slow-mo-last-hit -effect feels amazing! Still, it isn't really too complex and mostly just spamming X to do damage, in my honest opinion the combat doesn't flow too well having quite long animations and a split-second "stop-period" after them if there are no enemies nearby, this makes you really vulnerable, especially if you do not have weapon with counter attacking-modifier and can cause you take lots of unnessecary damage.\n\nMy biggest gripe about the game is the random element. I see what they're trying to do as drawing cards from deck for random outcome really is the games namesake, but especially early on if you draw an event that really hurts you (takes away lots of your food or health) or do not draw any weapon/armor cards at all can get REALLY frustrating. One could argue that it brings challange to game, but honestly, if how well you're doing is dependant on just pure dumb luck, it really doesn't feel good.\n\nThat being said, I really don't know how that could be fixed without seriously hurting the games premise and after you beat first three bosses that is negated by little bit, but that can take way long depending on your luck, sooo-- yeah.\n\nOverall, I have high hopes about this game, I did enjoy playing it and will return to it when I have more time!","July 9, 2014","true","4.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

You get to customize your deck of cards to fit your playstyle. You play as a hero who is trying to make it through all of the trials and tribulations of a warrior, all that matters is defeating the next boss (and eventually the main boss a.k.a the dealer of cards). Every card you draw can either help you or hurt you, it is very random. Whatever you end up drawing will be the equipment you end up with. The randomness of what you can get is what makes this game so appealing.\nThere are small battles in which you can physically take controll of your hero to hack and slah the enemies to death. These battles help break the monotony of just playing a card game. You might draw a good set of armor and a decent sword or you could end up with a nasty group of gremlins to fight, either way you will still end up having a blast. Once you defeat a boss you will continue unto the next boss and set of challenges untill you get to the last boss.\nYou earn in-game gold through defeating mobs or completeing quests. There are shops in every set of cards in which you can use this gold to buy/ sell armor, weapons, or even cure curses and heal health. You can also completely customize your equipment/encounter decks to make sure you are having the most personal experience possible.\nIf you are a fan of strategey games or just a card game fanatic then this is a must buy. I am not in any way partial to these types of games, yet I can't help but have a blast playing this.\nIf you can find this on-sale I'd say grab it no questions asked. Even if this wasn't on sale I still believe it's worth 25$. There is an enormous ammount of replayability to be had.

It combines the combat of the Arkham series with the elements of any fantasy table top, pencil and paper RPG.  At the beginning of each story quest which culminates in a boss encounter, you build up an encounter and an equipment deck of cards that you have acquired previously.  The events of the story and the rewards of various adventures in that quest are randomized from these decks and a couple other decks the Dealer has at his disposal.  This gives the player more agency in the sequence of events and what equipment could be acquired during gameplay.  In addition, the game includes some resource management which presents obstacles to the player.\n\nOne downside is that, like all rogue-likes, there is the possibility of having a "bad run."  You may not receive enough food and starve to death, not receive enough gold and be unable to purchase items or possibly be unable to complete encounter cards requiring gold, or have bad luck in general leading to the character's untimely demise.  However, the randomness that causes this problem also makes each iteration of a quest different than the previous ones and so, keeps the game interesting and alive.\n\nPresently, this game is in beta and the devs are still balancing it.  Even so, I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys pencil and paper RPGs, Arkham style combat, and rogue-likes.","November 2, 2014","true","83.9"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

Live action combat system with fluid dodge and parry system. Unique encounters and bosses. Every playthrough has been an entirely different experience from start to finish. The story mode is a great introduction to the game. In my opinion where this game really shines is in the deckbuilding mechanics and Endless Games Mode! Great game, very polished at this stage! Only down side I have had is a couple collision problems with environment when dodging enemies and occasional glitches where sound goes completely out or comes and goes. Also the gold pawn comes and goes sometimes as well! Other than some UI stuff the heart of the game and the deckbuilding mechanics are very solid and I would rate this game 8/10 even at its current state!

Having the encounters with monster cards be played out in a slightly Arkham Style (Attack/Counter/Dodge/Stun) was an even further brilliant idea.  Although the combat is the weakest part with a fixed camera, it is still manageable and fun.  Trap Rooms are also played out in this 3rd person camera style as you dodge your way through a trap maze.\n\nEven if you complete all 12 of the storymode levels there is an Endless mode to see how far you can go.  The game starts out relatively simple, but starts to become challenging about 1/4 of the way through the Story decks.\n\nAdd to this the amazing way it's presented, the dealer is well voice acted and doesn't get annoying.\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough.\n\nIt's reminds me of playing a game of Munchkin, but against a dealer instead of a group of friends.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bolm/recommended/266510/","bolm","Gänseblümchen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bolm/","593 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIn-depth analytical video on Hand of Fate: (written review below)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__o1V2zMrVs\nThe aesthetics of Hand of Fate are undoubtedly stellar. The high quality ranges from great sketches for every card, to beautiful 3D graphics as soon as the brawling starts. Most notably here are the lighting and special effects that manage to bring the whole scenery to life. Especially the fight against the Queen of Dust did impress me with its flying sand everywhere. Hand of Fate makes it abundantly clear that the overall aesthetics are not meant to be overlooked and it succeeds in creating a very appealing style overall.\n\nAlmost the same could be said about the sound design of Hand of Fate. The dungeon master for example is exquisitely voice acted, the effects give precise feedback and underline every nook and cranny. Sadly, all of the event texts are not voice acted and have to be read, which is understandable in terms of budget for voice acting, however sad due to the competent voice actor already in the game. Since the music is mainly meant to create an atmospheric background noise instead of carrying emotion or story, it is competent in what it tries to achieve, however forgettable. All in all, the sound design of Hand of Fate is very good, could however be improved in terms of the quantity of voice acting.\n\nLet’s delve into the rather unique gameplay mixture of Hand of Fate. For every story adventure you start, not taking the endless mode into account, you prepare two deck of cards. On the left hand side the equipment that can be found during your dungeon crawling. Which consists not only of stronger weapons, but also of armour, helmets, gloves, rings, artefacts and trinkets. Ideally you would want to include cards specifically against a certain type of enemy that you suspect to encounter, however I mostly threw in new cards that I had not used before to keep the game experience fresh. On the right hand side of the decks, you can select the encounters that you want to possibly face during your adventure. Hereby it is important that some encounters cannot be removed until you fulfil certain conditions. The same procedures holds true as previously: I mainly selected encounters that I did either not face before to keep experiencing new content or that I did not manage to complete previously. As soon as you are satisfied with your decks, you start the story. Depending on the boss you plan to encounter at the end of the adventure, the card dealer adds some fixed cards into the mix, indicated by their purple tint and as soon as all decks are shuffled the game begins.\n\nThe dungeon master begins by laying down the encounters face down in a randomly selected pattern. Now you strife to reveal the final boss and defeat said enemy to claim victory of this part of the story. Your character is indicated as golden statue and you always move by one card either horizontally or vertically hereby consuming one food, healing a bit and revealing the encounter you step on. One possible card is the choose-your-own-adventure style encounters, whereby you select an option and more often than not the final result is determined by your selection of one of four cards, ranging from huge success to huge failure and thus affecting the outcome rather randomly. While the encounters themselves are fun at their core, I do see a problem in the random nature of selection as there is no skill or learning involved from the player’s side and thus it fails to feel rewarding when selecting success and at the same time also unreasonably punishing when you hit that huge failure card, especially when this ends up costing you your weapon just before facing the final boss. I would have preferred a system similar to how FTL manages random encounters by which certain abilities or other pre-collected items can affect the outcome positively.\n\nAnother possible encounter is one of the multiple combat scenarios. This is where the third person brawling comes into play and the graphical fidelity turns up several notches. Depending on the encounter or just by random selection you will be spawned into one of several arenas together with a bunch of enemies and possibly even traps. These short brawling segments are highly reminiscent of the Batman Arkham series without being as fluent and as responsive. Make no mistake, the brawling in itself is good, however the animations are not quite as top notch as the basically perfect ones of the Arkham games. Also, at least in the first three hours, the combat is not as strategic and as deep as the inspiration. Hand of Fate mainly relies on counter-attacking on green indicators and dodging on red indicators, while there are only very few special moves or strategic approaches to the combat in itself. This problem obviously arises as the game relies on random generation and thus you are always dependent to create enemies that could be faced with the basic equipment, while other story-driven games can later on throw enemies into your way that require you to use the latest acquired item or special move and the like. To summarise, the brawling is competent and refreshing, however does feel repetitive after a while. A perfect example for this is the spawning animation. While it is highly enjoyable the first few times your character spawns and gets all his equipment step by step and lastly your huge hammer falls from the sky just before you charge the flabbergasted and underpowered bandits, after a couple of hours game time though, I wished this animation could be skipped or disabled entirely, as it eats up so much time, especially when going from combat to combat encounter and thus this delay turns to be obnoxious rather quickly. Oh, and speaking of annoying, the camera cannot be rotated while in the combat arena, which can lead to some weird angles and fighting directions. Hopefully that will be fixed in the future.\n\nAfter defeating the final boss at the end of the adventure or by dying in between due to combat or starvation, the tokens you collected along the way are opened and thus new cards are unlocked, keeping the encounters fresh and empowering your equipment for future approaches. With these new cards you start the cycle over again, selecting a new boss, adapting your decks and facing the latest random encounters you selected beforehand.\n\nAll in all, Hand of Fate is a beautiful, very competent mixture of dungeon crawling choose-your-own-adventure, third person brawling and deck building, with a few flaws in between. Nonetheless, Hand of Fate is one of the best Steam Early Access games I have played and I am very much looking forward to future improvements, which in my opinion should mainly target the repetitive combat, possibly granting you permanent special moves every few defeated bosses and thus creating more depth and tactical approaches overall.\n\nUPDATE\nAs I now played a little more and stand before the Queen of Skulls, I must say that the further the game progresses, the more infuriating the random nature becomes. There are several encounters with three failure cards resulting in severe penalties like losing 50 health and 30 permanent health, basically rendering the whole remaining adventure impossible. Also, due to the entirely random nature of encounters, it happened multiple times that I died on the first floor. If the brawling would be a bit tighter and more fluent overall, I am rather sure that you could go through these encounters with ease, however for example a ranged attack from close up is impossible to block and if enemies swarm you, there is a good chance that an unblockable attack will it you while you are countering another one. All in all, Hand of Fate is still a good game, however the further I progress (now over 4 hours played) the less fun I have, thus I now doubt the longevity of this dungeon crawler.","October 18, 2014","true","5.7"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

One of the few kickstarter success stories, definitely worth your time and money.\n\nBasically, the premise of the game is that you are playing a card game against "The Dealer", the game is based around "Encounter" cards, this may be you finding a treasure chest but needing to go through a series of obstacles to get to it, being ambushed by skeletons or going to a demon clubhouse and gambling your soul after getting drunk. There are loads of them and they are very varied.\n\nThe encounters usually come in sets, miniture stories that unlock as you complete each card in the sequence, which is dead cool and a good reason to keep unlocking cards. For every action in an encounter (that isn't directly combat) you pick from a set of four dealer shuffled cards, which indicate how much you failed or succeeded at the action, which adds a nice RNG element to the game (you can follow the card shuffle with your eyes, so not ENTIRELY luck based) and keeps things interesting.\n\nYour characters equipment and blessings/curses can also interact with some of the encounters, suprising me even 20+ hours in with new paths in the old cards I thought I knew. Even once you are finished with the story there is an endless mode which uses all the cards you have unlocked to create a neverending run which gets harder the longer you play. The replay value is huge.\n\nThe combat is Arkham styled (counter system and very flowy in how you move between enemies), here the equipment from encounters will really come into play, it's fairly simple in terms of what you can do but gets quite tactical, as the battlegrounds can have traps and the enemies get harder and more complex as the game goes on. The dealers starts adding curses and difficult encounters to the deck, making the later levels very difficult.\n\nThe game never feels like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t or cheating, pretty much every encounter can be run away from/refused and the combat can be difficult but it never feels like any enemy is particularly over powered, it's always down to your own skill. Due to the huge number of encounters and equipment, your freedom to choose and balance risk/reward, and the RNG element every run feels unique, the only downside I would add is that the combat is fairly simplistic, but considering this is an indie development, it's a very impressive accomplishment.\n\nOne of the few kickstarter success stories, definitely worth your time and money.","April 14, 2015","true","51.4"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

Also I feel a big disconnect between the exploration and the combat. I didn't really feel like I wanted any of the things I could get from the encounters or the shops, I just wanted to get to the boss with a decent amount of health and at least my starting equipment.\n\nAlso the illusion of choice in picking cards is annoying instead of adding anything in my opinion; a simple roll without my input would feel much better to me.","April 2","false","3.7"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

You go through a dungeon, gaining equipment, and fighting random encounters, much akin to a Roguelike. It's a deckbuilding game, wherein your decks, are built, by you to choose what encounters and equipment you are going to encounter. Simple Batman like controls, and you have yourself something that plays rather smooth, and is kinda neat. Later dungeons add elements such as curses and blessings that can change the way you handle it, giving you a much different way of approaching things. For instance, one of the games, in which I lost gold based on health remaining.  Do I forsake food, so that I can lower my health, as to not lose gold to buy things? Do I rely on my combat mastery to survive? Should I sell this item now, knowing I may well lose the excess gold left over from what I want to buy?  A simple thing can change it up quite a bit.\n\nBut then there's the atmosphere. This game has a wonderful sense of mystery to it. It's dark, illuminated by candles, told in a haze. It is you vs. a mage who is playing cards that are symbolic of encounters from your past. The narration for him sells it very hard. His comments about what you do, the achievements you just got, how he feels about the cards,  and if you can handle them. As the sole talking bit of the game, he is fantastic, and his voice fits perfectly.\n\nWith a large amount of card unlocks, variable outcomes, and an atmosphere that I cannot emphasize enough, this game is something else. It was well worth breaking my Early Access embargo on it.","November 18, 2014","true","6.1"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","0"

And the Dealer has a lot of dialogue (especially as you get to newer levels). Plus he's not just a bad guy - he has a complex character that you get to know. Their is a certain amount of random chance to the game (but their is too in life) and it can get a little maddening trying to get the right cards in sequence.

It can be very satisfying to kill a monster you had thought was unbeatable.\n\nAnother nice thing is that if you really hate a card you can often just not select it.

As a deck-building game, it starts off somewhat bland with few cards... but that's all a part of it as you learn basic mechanics and how the game is played. As you progress, you build your deck full of new interesting encounters and gear that you can find during your adventure. The gameplay itself reminds me of the Batman games, though a little clunkier. As an Early Access game, I am not too worried about that.\nThis has a lot of potential and I recommend it if you enjoyed the combat in the Batman Arkham series. This is scratching my 'action-rpg-loot' itch for the moment. The voice acting of the card dealer is also very well done.\nHowever, you should use a controller.

Why ? Because even if the game looks REALLY easy in the beginning, when action phases (fights and escape traps sequences) remain "simple", it becomes a real nightmare at the end of the game. The camera is NEVER looking in the right direction, so sometimes you'll have to fight ennemis you cannot see... or avoid traps hidden by the awful camera. Same goes for the action phases gameplay : it's impossible to precisely move around the map or attack from a certain angle, so you'll loose heath by falling into traps a lot. In the late game, you cannot really afford to loose health in such a way.\n\nIt's a HUGE frustration because this game really rocks, but I get so angry when I play it, I just wanna smash my keyboard into my screen.

It's essentially a roguelike adventure game, which uses cards to determine your journey and has a bit of combat that's somewhat similar to the Batman games.\n\nThe cards you draw affect various things, from your equipment, to your resources, to what enemies you face. Some cards are mini-quests which have different outcomes depending on your choices. I came across a card called "Devil's Choice", where I was given the choice to fight one of three cards: 2 of Dust, 2 of Dust and 3 of Dust. When I chose 3 of Dust, the Devil basically removed that card and made me fight the other two combined, "just for laughs".\n\nYou won't have many cards at first, but as you complete dungeons, defeat bosses and complete quest cards, you will receive tokens that unlock new cards. You can then choose which cards to use in your deck. This offers a good amount of player freedom in how you want to shape your experience for each run. For example, if you wish an added challenge, you can choose to play a deck that contains no armour or shield cards.\n\nThe game starts of easy enough, but after the 3 first "dungeons" it already gets exponentially more difficult, mainly because of what I like to call Roguelike Syndrome; basically, no matter how well you do, the game can mess you up worse than any one enemy can.

While I'm perfectly alright with such events, do understand that if you're not used to Roguelike Syndrome, you will swear at this game for being unfair. A lot.\n\nThere are currently two game modes; story mode and endless mode. Story mode pits you against the dealer in a quest to defeat his lieutenants (who are based on the the regular deck of cards - 4 jacks, 4 queens and 4 kings, one of each for each suit) and ultimately, him. Endless mode simply allows you to play for as long as you can.\n\nThe few flaws I have found so far, I don't consider to be dealbreakers, and I believe these could be ironed out by the time this gets out of early access.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/silentzero1/recommended/266510/","silentzero1","SilentZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/silentzero1/","21 products in account","Introduction:\nHand of Fate is a mix between a tabletop card game and an action/RPG video game, with some added tarot, fantasy and roguelike inspiration thrown in.  Featuring hundreds of items, armor, weapons, artifacts, curses, blessings, encounters and quests, every single playthrough is unique.  On top of that, the deck-building mechanic adds even more variety as you customize your deck to suit your needs and playstyle.  All of this across two modes of gameplay.  Whew, someone deal the cards already!\n\nTLDR Highlights:\n++ Playthrough Randomness\n++ Quest Cards\n++ Deckbuilding System\n++ Voice Acting\n+ Action Combat\n+ Visuals/Graphics\n\n- Frustrating Chance and Luck of the Draw\n- Single Player Only\n\n= Truly an amazing game!  I wish I had thought of it.  Highly recommended!\n\nReview:\nPROS -- At the top of my list is the randomness of each playthrough.  Sure, you'll see the same cards a lot, but no two hands will ever be the same.  There are so many factors and variables at work that each time you play will be a different experience.  This is huge for me, because it's what will keep me coming back for more.\n\nOne of the most fun features I've found in Hand of Fate are the quest cards.  These often have interesting situations, stories and adventures, that you get to see unfold right then or spread across several games if the quest has multiple parts.  Fun stuff and, again, keeps me coming back for more!\n\nWhich brings me to the deckbuilding system.  By completing quest cards, defeating bosses, and other such things, you'll recieve tokens (which work similar to booster packs in a TCG) giving you more cards to add to your deck.  You can let the game recommend and build your deck for you, or you can hand select individual cards to build your own deck.  Granted, this system may seem pretty standard, but there was something about winning tokens and unlocking new cards that consistently gets me excited throughout the game.  Not to mention that it adds variety to my deck, which -- you guessed it! -- keeps me coming back for more.\n\nWhen it comes to voice acting, the dealer character is the only one that has any dialogue.  That being said, I don't think they could have found a better voice actor for the job.  It's done extremely well, and fits perfectly with the theme.  Not only that, but the script is excellent, because his idle chat and card/situation specific dialogue never seems to get old and has a genuine feel to it.\n\nMixing action RPG (Batman/Shadow of Mordor-esque) combat might have been a risking move on the developers part, but it was executed very well.  Combat starts out ridiculously easy as it teaches game mechanics, but as your deck gets stronger the enemies do too, thus making the fights more challenging.  A lot of reviewers say it's too easy all the way through, but I guarantee they died in combat plenty of times, and if they didn't then they didn't play very far into the game.  I will agree that combat might not be very complex, but it's fun and satisfying, and just challenging enough to mesh well with card game without drowning it out.\n\nThe last "pro" I have to add is that the visuals and graphics, even the animations, are really quite good.  It's all very pleasing to look at, and I was particularly impressed with the combat scenery.  The card artwork was well done too, and the theme fit perfectly.\n\nCONS --  Not much to add here, but like any card game, sometimes it comes down to the luck of the draw, which I can attest does not always go your way.  And it can be frustrating at times, especially later in the game when a single misstep can be very dangerous and potentially cost you the game.  Some people find this intolerable, but I don't really mind it that much.  It's a card game, after all, and chance is part of the territory.  Besides, there are blessing cards to help tip things it your favor (curse cards to make it worse too, so watch out).  And when you have to pick a card to determine success or failure, it's made so that you can try to follow movement of the card you want during the shuffle.  Still, it can be quite punishing at times, which turns some people off.\n\nFinally, I'm disappointed that there's no multiplayer.  Not entirely sure how it would work in this game, but I'd love to play a card game like this with friends!\n\nOVERALL --  There's so much to like about Hand of Fate, and very little to complain about. Without a doubt, this is one of the best games in my steam library.  I can't believe I never even heard of it until recently, but I'm very glad this game entered my crosshairs, because it's a true gem.  I most certainly recommend!","March 22","true","17.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's essentially a roguelike adventure game, which uses cards to determine your journey and has a bit of combat that's somewhat similar to the Batman games.\n\nThe cards you draw affect various things, from your equipment, to your resources, to what enemies you face. Some cards are mini-quests which have different outcomes depending on your choices. I came across a card called "Devil's Choice", where I was given the choice to fight one of three cards: 2 of Dust, 2 of Dust and 3 of Dust. When I chose 3 of Dust, the Devil basically removed that card and made me fight the other two combined, "just for laughs".\n\nYou won't have many cards at first, but as you complete dungeons, defeat bosses and complete quest cards, you will receive tokens that unlock new cards. You can then choose which cards to use in your deck. This offers a good amount of player freedom in how you want to shape your experience for each run. For example, if you wish an added challenge, you can choose to play a deck that contains no armour or shield cards.\n\nThe game starts of easy enough, but after the 3 first "dungeons" it already gets exponentially more difficult, mainly because of what I like to call Roguelike Syndrome; basically, no matter how well you do, the game can mess you up worse than any one enemy can. My first attempt at the Jack of Plagues ended when I drew two consecutive Angry Mob challenges, and rolled the worst outcomes on both while I was already low on life and resources. While I'm perfectly alright with such events, do understand that if you're not used to Roguelike Syndrome, you will swear at this game for being unfair. A lot.\n\nThere are currently two game modes; story mode and endless mode. Story mode pits you against the dealer in a quest to defeat his lieutenants (who are based on the the regular deck of cards - 4 jacks, 4 queens and 4 kings, one of each for each suit) and ultimately, him. Endless mode simply allows you to play for as long as you can.\n\nThe few flaws I have found so far, I don't consider to be dealbreakers, and I believe these could be ironed out by the time this gets out of early access. The combat seems a little bit too easy. A "blind random" deckbuilding option would have been nice as well. And of course, more content is always nice.\n\nOther than that, it looks pretty good, the voice acting of the dealer is pretty solid, and there's already a good amount of content to keep you busy.

I catch my breath for a moment, roll past some arrow traps, and grab a chest!\n\nAnd my reward is some cards.  And the man across the table from me makes some cryptic statements about my past, or the history of that card, or something vague and menacing.\n\nThis is the sort of thing that happens in this game, and its amazing.\n\nHand of Fate can be best described as a Deck Building Action RPG hybrid.  You are a nameless someone, who has decided to play a game of life and death against a mysterious Dealer.  Your goal is to defeat the 12 members of the Dealers Card Court.  Your weapons, tools, and even dungeons are the very cards being used in the game.\n\nI have not played for very long as I don't want to spoil the game for when I do a video playthrough of it, but suffice to say what I have played has my interest piqued.  I want to know who I am, where I came from, how I got to this place, and why this Dealer is such a snarky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nRecently, the devs put out a Free content expansion, which adds another little mini story to the game.\n\nThe basic gameplay is that you have a deck of cards that you have built.  Well 2 actually: Equipment and Encounters.  The dealer then spices things up by adding cards to them, cards you have no knowledge of.  He then lays out a dungeon face down on the table, made up of cards.  You then move a token around from card to card, and experience a variety of things.  One card might be an Ambush of Skeletons, another might be meeting an Elf Lass, another might be a dangerous ravine, or a trap room.\n\nIn the case of combat, or trap rooms, the game switches to an Action RPG setup, using a combat system very similar to the new Batman Arkham games.  You can dodge, roll, attack, and eventually should you find the gear cast spells or special powers.  One power I had early on let me cause all my attacks to generate cash on the ground that I could pick up.\n\nThe devs have said the main campaign takes about 12 hours to get through, so about an hour per court member.  There is also Endless mode, which is of course Endless.\n\nHopefully more content updates come down the pipe as I can see myself playing this for quite a while.","June 21, 2015","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Hand of Fate is absolutely in working condition. You may encounter a bug here or there, but I just beat the alpha version of the game yesterday - or at least all 12 current encounters.\n\nSo what kind of game is it? It's a mixture of board game that you can customize + real time action brawler (like the arkham series) wrapped in a rogue-like shell. It's fun to engage on a strategic level when dealing with card choices and then on a visceral level when fighting monsters, you're learning two different aspects as you go. Also, if you enjoy punishing games like Demon's/Dark Souls then this game would be something to think about.\n\nDevs are also active in the forums and are releasing updates so not only do you get a game to play, you also get a game that the devs care about making better.\n\nAll in all, highly recommended.","August 8, 2014","true","18.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It also can be challenging with the random draw of cards because you dont know what monsters or mazes or traps you will have to face, you could say the game has a roguelikness to it because if you die you die. But you keep the cards you unlock and can build preset decks, and decide what you want to take with you into your next game such as armor, weapons, abilities, etc. Take in mind though that this game is in beta, and it needs a little more fine tuning in the fluidity of fighting and character movement but i beliieve that will be taken care of in one of the many updates being worked on in the future. This game is amazing and has great potential i would recommend this game to all my friends or any other gamer.","August 17, 2014","true","6.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

You build your own deck from the cards you have unlocked.\n-Action Adventure Game (god of war) :: While the combat is not impressive looking and visceral as those games tend to be, the combat has strategic and dynamic elements to keep you on your toes.\n-Rogue Like :: Rogue likes have always been about exploration and resource management. This game offers that in spades.\n\n\nWhen I played this for first few runs, I thought that "Soon I've seen all the encounters and items so it will lose it's charm" but I discovered that some of the encounter cards are not set in stone. They have multiple "forms". For example encounter called "Rock Fall" had very different conclusion.\nAlso when player is given "random" positive or negative conclusion to encounter the player draws from Four different cards.\nCards can be any combination of Fail, Greater Fail, Success, Greater Success.\nThe fact that player is physically show the shuffle of these cards gives him opportunity to follow how the cards move and can eliminate possibilities.\n\nAlso every encounter with "red spot" on it, is part of a quest of sorts. When dealt with correctly will unlock the next part of the quest available for your encounter deck. This is very neat way of not making the game all about getting to the boss but the path to the boss is also important.\n\nSo that this review would not be complete hype lets bring up few issues:\n-Combat is every now and then very easy. When there are 1-4 opponents you can overwhelm the enemy quickly because your "auto targeting" attacks send you flying across the map. You feel like juggernaut from Dota 2\n-Block / Counter animations are too slow compared to your normal ones. You feel like everyone in the game stops for your to do your animation.\n-Enemies NEVER attack at same time. There is always only single enemy swinging a sword + one ranged enemy ready to fire.\n-Block / Counter "quick-time" prompts show for too long. I feel like being babied into the game. I wish there was some difficulty settings about this.\n-Blood. Game really needs blood right now the swings rarely give me that satisfaction. I barely get any feedback from hitting the enemy. Its even harder to discern how much damage I've done or have I actually killed one of my enemies without any blood splatters.\n\nAs you can see Most gripes I have are in the combat of the game. Thankfully the combat still feels fun but could be more.\nAnd HEY! It's not all about the combat anyway. :3","July 15, 2014","true","28.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Needs more balancing.  Certain cards produce encounters that are laughably easy and others that are pure hell.  You are literally at the mercy of total randomness in this game.  Queen of Dust fight brought realization as to how wierd and sluggish combat can be.  Combat tries to be like Batman Arkham games yet more linear and slow with one to two combat animations and no exciting combos to my knowledge.   Spent entire QoD fight lunge diving to evade and waiting to strike someone and thought to myself how ridiculous this mechanic is and has been in past fighting games.  If shield cards or blessings rolled may have been easier fight yet in my experience this is fith time fighting her and found nothing useful on my way to her so far.  Player seems to have enormous hitbox and compared to enemies and because of the stationary camera during fights it is easy to misjudge distance at a critical time.  Don't feel as if I am making any substantial progress in the game.  You unlock new cards but may never see them in a playthrough and more often than not they wont help you anyway (and can also possibly hurt you).

So you decide whether you want this extra shield or ring, or rather add an extra sword into the deck. The same thing is possible with your dealer's deck, as it's your call to make your game easier and miss out on those card tokens, which you need for new cards, equipment as well as encounters, or choose the cards, which are yet to be beaten and try your best on the way.\nThe dealer lays out a dungeon with the chosen cards, in which you navigate around with your little figurine, kinda like a board game. From time to time you'll encounter a monster or a trap, from where the game will switch into a Arkam City-style 3rd person combat system, which is debateably the weakest part of the game, in which you can move around a small area, dodge, attack and counter attacks.\n\nI really hope you found this review helpful in aiding your decision towards buying this game.\nIf you have thoughts on improving this review, please contact me!

Card deckbuidling game mixed with RPG-games, all hidden in a rogue-like coat. The game is hard, shows no mercy, yet is enjoyable as hell. Let's see why.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\n+ Card game base\n+ Real-time fights\n+ Roguelike board game\n+ Various encounters\n+ Cards are changing and getting more difficult\n+ Strategy needs to be changed a lot\n+ Well made DLCs!\no Sometimes clunky controls (training is needed :-D )\n- Luck is needed (lack of it can be potential game-ender)\n\nGameplay is based on solving cards, either through choices, or you have to deal with threat personally in combat. As you progress further, game becomes more and more difficult, but there is one thing that has to be cleared. Game is rogue-like, so if it seems unfair to you, then it is right and you have to try your luck.\n\nThat can be frustrating sometimes, because hardly defeatable encounter with full gear can be your first card in dungeon! Anyway, both DLCs added some cards and new strategies to defeat upcoming challenges. Still, with all possibilities, the game is a step ahead. Bugged achievements got fixed, so good luck!\n\nVISUALS\n\n+ Marvelous art style\n+ Formidable combat\n+ Backgrounds and battlefields\n- Minor bugs and glitches\n\nThere is nothing I can complain about visual style. Cards are stylish, they are looking like an old card game played in some mysterious temple. The atmosphere is mystical and full of tension and expectations. Combat is also perfectly created, though, some creatures might get bugged after hits, but that seems more funny than annoying to me.\n\nCHARACTERS\n\n+ Dealer and Warrior\n+ Story\n\nIt is a game of life and death. Just the Dealer and unknown Warrior. Nothing more or less. Perfect.\n\nSOUNDTRACK\n\n+ Arabic-style songs\n+ Credit song\n\nJeff van Dyck showed us many excellent performances and this music belongs to one of his best. Arabic-themed songs are adding its piece to whole impression of this mystical game. My favourites - Life and Death, Welcome to the Game, Deal of the Millenia, Dead Skin, Dune Storm, Hand of Fate (Instrumental) and Hand of Fate.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nCard game with real fights, what more can be desired? With music of that kind and perfect voice-acting it was a pleasure to play and discover the secrets of this game. And also to return to it again. Many mysteries were revealed and more are awaiting to be. But is it possible? Let's find out.

It's a real fun RPG card game.  Basically you're sitting across the table of a card dealer.  He deals you cards and that determines what enemies you fight, where you fight and items you get.  You also gain loot by chance by flipping cards or winning fights.  Sometimes there's a character on a card and you can select answers when they speak.  Unlike other card games, when the level and enemies have been drawn you're character is warped into that world and you really fight them!  I've found that the controls are just like the Batman Arkham series when using Xbox controller.  The game is fun right from the start and easy to figure out.\n\nPros\nCard game and battle adventure game\nEasy to learn\nGame outcome depends on cards drawn and player choice\nGraphics\nControls\n\nCons\nLack of game info.

It's absolutely worth the full price, and being on sale makes it a no-brainer!\n\nThis is an amazing game to keep you busy between larger games, or just as something to play to unwind before bed. There's not a ton of over-arching story, which makes it ideal for dipping into for a few minutes at a time, even if you let weeks pass between play sessions.\n\nThe general mechanic is that you've died, and are playing a card game against death. Death deals a set of cards that create a dungeon for your character to play through. Each card is a different room or event for you to play through, with everything from gambling events to stores to story-driven events to combat. Each dungeon you play through unlocks new cards -- both equipment for your adventurer as well as rooms and events to play through.  The next time Death deals a dungeon, it will be slightly longer than the last one you played through.\n\nOne of the best mechanics is that when you hit a "combat" room, you actually "dive into" the card and control your adventurer as he fights the minions from the card. The combat mechanics are simple, but surprisingly fun. The minions have enough variation in attacks and style that combat never becomes dull, even though you have to fight several mobs per dungeon.\n\nThe devs are also great people. They've added a ton of new contenet since the games release, and as you play through you'll notice their little DLC expansions peppered through -- you always have the option to dive into DLC from the main game. I hope they keep releasing these expansions!\n\nSo all in all, this game is a no-brainer. It isn't likely to be one that you sit down an play through entirely without breaks, but it makes a perfect distraction between larger games or just for a short session at night.

The music is good, the dealer's voice is great with his speeches, the deck of card is really wide and so the choices too !\n\nThe story mode let you beat each Jack, Queen and King of each 4 series through chapters. At the end of each chapter you have to deal with the Jack or Queen or King with a battle, a kind of small boss ! When you beated 3 or 4 of them you unlock a starting bonus and malus. When you succeed any encounter you unlock more cards by acquiring its token. Also each chapter have their own encounters, curses, blessings and shop that are added to the deck.\n\nThe battle are played in real time with the stuff you got, the highest combo you make the heavier you attack. You need to manage your health and many items can help you like shields (reflect projectiles, counter attack, stun), artifacts (magical spells) and others ! You can also discover some vault to steal some gold if you dare avoiding all the traps ! There are also many ennemies you can defeat, many encounters and lot of gold to gain and spend but do not forget to buy food before starving to death ! Don't worry you can still continue your journey while starving, but you'll soon need to find supplies before your last breath.\n\nIn this game there is also a part of luck, you can still see the shuffle to guess where the card will be if you are able good enough or you can also have some equipments or blessing that will help you a lot. Also some fight can be really tough but you can easily get the strongest equipment you can to succeed every battle.\n\n(#):\nThere is at least one little annoying thing with the controller, you can be really precise that much while you're moving. Indeed, when you're facing north and want to get south you'll need to go in circles instead of turning back. So that may be a little tougher to avoid traps.\n\n(*):\nThe good thing is you can quit the game whenever you want and resume it before you reached the previous encounter. So you can use that to avoid death or avoid some encounters failures whenever you want.","March 27","true","58.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

But this I will say:\n\nThe Dealer is your Narrator, as well as your Savior and your Opponent. He has offered you the chance to play his Game. As the Player, you are in charge of a pawn - a nondescript adventurer. You are given cards upon which the Game is played. You build the pawn's equipment deck, and the story's encounter deck. The Dealer will deal out the cards and lead you on an incredible tale of greed, hubris and honor. Your pawn will face endless, faceless foes as well as specific boss villains. There will be violence, traps, treasure and horror. The Dealer will attempt to entice you to send your pawn into situations most peril for the offer of a few tokens. These tokens unlock more cards, which unlock more adventure and equipment/treasure.\n\nAnd as you defeat each boss villain, the Dealer will put the card into his cabinet, where you will be able to choose the next villain. Defeat a row of villains, gain a special item. But beware, every Game, every card, every victory will add to the complexity and danger that your pawn will face as you struggle to reach and win the final Game. Your pawns will die, but never fear - there are countless pawns waiting for you to guide them.\n\nWho is this man in the robe, who created these cards that influence a world, individuals and items? Who are you, Player? Are we Gods who are meant to play with the lives of mortals? Maybe.\n\nYou'll have play to experience it.","October 20, 2014","true","4.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

The random nature of the game and path toward your goal, along with building your deck to make that journey easier on you, makes the replay value surprisingly high. As you progress you unlock more enemies to fight, dangers to face, and equipment to find or purchase from vendors.\n\nAs Early Access games go, I'm not even sure why it's considered Early Access, this already seems like a full fledged game worth it's pricetag. Highly recommended for those that want to take a risk on something fun and interesting.","January 16, 2015","true","8.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

The challenges get progressively harder but are relatively easy until about 2/3 of the way through, when the difficulty ramps up considerably.  The combat is akin to a slightly less polished Batman-esque attack, doge, shield bash type affair, it's still quite fun.  Voices, music, and sound are all pretty good, but is that really the reason you're buying this thing?  The game is probably good for about 15 hours for a playthrough.\n\nThe negatives have been touched on in other reviews but those that stand out to me are the "fate" based challenges you'll encounter here or there.  It's true that, at a certain point, getting the right card (success or fail) becomes a complete guessing game.  This negative in no way detracts from an otherwise awesome game.  While the randomness may bother some people, the game is called Hand of FATE, and that last word really sums it all up.\n\nAll in all, tons of fun, highly recommended.","February 26, 2015","true","12.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

You make your deck, then the dealer adds his own cards to it.  These cards make up the "dungeon" and are placed face down (mostly) randomly.  You move your avatar from one card to the next to explore each dungeon, turning the cards face up and resolving their events or encounters as you go along.  Maybe it's a shop, maybe it's an ambush, maybe it's an event where you get lost in the swamp, or goblins steal your equipment and you have to kill them before they escape.\n\nThe variety and depth is impressive.  Some events rely on skill (beating down goblins who just stole all your weapons, for example), while others rely solely on chance/luck of the draw (picking from 3 success cards and 1 failure card to climb safely down into a ravine, for example).  As the game goes on, it introduces more and more facets, all of which give another layer of chance and strategy.  Combat takes place like the Batman: Arkham Whatever games, where you just smack enemies until they fall over and counter when it tells you to, but it's still fun, and the enemies provide enough challenges to keep from being boring/easy.\n\nBottom Line: Absolute recommend.  This is one of those rare times where a game tries to do a little of everything, and manages to succeed at it fantastically.","June 24, 2015","true","53.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The dealer is a narcissistic wind bag who spends most of his time boasting about all the warriors who have excepted his challenge , and then fallen by his hand (no pun intended) trying to beat him at his usually unfair scrimmage. For example win two food cards, lose 4 food on his very next move...and food is important because each move you make costs you 1 food..."oh I AM sorry" he smugly spouts...and let's just follow that up with a lose half your gold card as well, making it harder for you to buy food . That's fair right? There are other examples as well but seriously, it is very aggressive and it's pretty much like that through the entire game.\nSO if you don't have patience at all for this kind of mental abuse, you should probably avoid this one to spare yourself a lot of unnecessary stress and quite possibly the death of your favorite controller or any other throw-able object nearby ...But  If you can handle the dealers cockiness it...it's a pretty cool and challenging game.","February 4","true","10.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Many games neglect the voice acting so it is always very refreshing when it is done well in an Indie title such as this. :)\n\nMy only gripe is that I feel like the combat is a little awkward with the camera angles. I've learned to adapt and can still play just fine but sometimes it gets a little frustrating trying to block incommng blows if you get a poor angle on your hero. That is really my only complaint though which is really just a tiny nit pick more than a game breaking problem. :P\n\nOther than that, I just love everything. Even playing with the cards that the computer recommends haha.\n\nHonestly this game is worth the full price of $24.99 so I wouldn't hesitate in grabbing it along with the wildcard DLC.

Instead Defiant have wonderfully crafted the game and mechanics, so as to make you feel like you're being guided by a Poker dealing Dungeon Master.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by how well the it all blends together and plays. The game is still in development, and I have never liked the idea of Early Access, but Hand of Fate certainly has amazing promise. The music is good, although not finished, and the graphics despite using the unity engine runs and looks really well. Although sadly the maximum resolution was only 1920x1080.

In Hand of Fate you play cards with the occasional break for fighting. The combat is a little repetitive but encounters never last very long and is still fairly enjoyable.\n\nThe card game itself, though, is great - a sort of progressive deck-builder with dealer-supplied cards thrown in to shake things up. You move across a randomised map of location cards, resolving the conflicts on each as you pass them, and gaining (or losing!) loot and resources as you make your way to the boss for the level. Then you start again for the next level... but with a couple new cards, a few new story items and a new item or two up for grabs.\n\nThe style, story and narration are also quite charming and really add to the overall feeling and aesthetic of the game.","February 5","true","1.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The card system doesnt feel like its forced onto the arena-fighting element, nor do the rogue-like elements are not ever compromised for the sake of story or the card mechanic. The game has the same replayability of games like Binding of Isaac or Rogue Legacy. Even simple things like "draw 2 gain cards" (each of which is slightly different) instead of just "gain 10 gold" make you glad nobody else thought to make this game first. And if they did and I just don't know about them, they probably didnt make as smooth (or graphically impressive) a game as this.\n\nAs for the mob-fighting type of combat that people keep comparing to the Batman: Arkham series, dont let that scare you off. Its not the 'repeatedly tap x' kind of fighting, but a type of combat were you still have the cool animations of batman, but you actually need to control your character's direction and time your attacks and counters.\n\nThis game would still be the best digital-card-game/rpg/rogue-like/text-adventure/arena-fighter even there were two of them.\n10/10","August 30, 2014","true","11.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

And I'm happy I did so, because this game is pretty great. It's not easy to describe. You play cards like in a mixture of a collectible card game and a board game, but it has also RPG-mechanics, a little bit of story, quests, descisions and an action based combat system. At first I thought that the latter was a bit too simple but I gotta admit - it's a lot of fun. Very fast paced, reaction based and dependent on what cards you already got, concerning equipment and abilities.\n\nAnd then there's the dealer of course. And this guy .. he really doesn't want you to win.

You interact with, use, or equip cards for the main aspects of the game, and gain more cards as time goes on (depending on your success/failure). If you don’t like a card, you can remove it from the deck and not play with it again later (as long as you have enough cards required for the play through).  This deck building aspect allows you to choose what possible events you encounter in your adventure.\n\nIt’s hard to summarize this game without going in depth since there are so many different things from so many different genres here; however, you’re pretty likely to find something you like about the game. I will admit that it can become repetitive depending on how you arrange your deck, and the combat might turn into button spamming, but you don’t have to let it...you can play the game as you choose.\n\nWhat is nice about this game is that you can either go “endless”, or use the “story mode” which gives you “break points” as you finish each piece once you beat the boss at the end of the dungeon. Like I said, it’s hard to explain...but you’re bound to like at least a couple aspects of this games layout. I enjoy the dialogue from the card master quite a bit and it really adds character to the game.\n\n\nThe Bad News:  This game is a currently an unoptimized resource hog. It has memory leak issues. After about 30 minutes of play today, Windows was asking me to close the program because it had nearly 3 GB of RAM in use and was eating resources like crazy. (It didn’t crash, but Windows noted the issue, and presented the event to me for action.)\n\nOnce this game is optimized, I think it will become very popular with the gaming community.","September 25, 2014","true","3.2"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"

game is the definition of wasted potential. sure it's fun for the first couple hours. you'll breeze past the first half of the content in about 2-4 hours, but once you get about two thirds of the way through, the game takes a massive difficulty spike. the game starts reusing old boss fights, but they use them along side other groups of enemies, in addition to the ones that that the boss comes bundled with. see every time you fight a boss they summon 2-4 enemies to fight along side them at the start of the battle. it's impossible to fight *just* a boss. this wouldn't be a huge problem, except that in addition to fighting the bosses again, with more enemies this time, the bosses and their mooks are all powered up, they have more health, and more (and more powerful) moves. now all of theses things combine would be challenging, but managable if not for one major flaw: the arenas in which you fight get smaller and smaller as the game progresses. at the start of the game you fight 1 boss and about 2-3 enemies in a REALLY big arena making it possible to divide and conquer, and avoid attacks. by the end of the game, you can wind up facing about 10+ enemies including 2 bosses in an arena about a quarter of the size in which you found the original boss encounter. oh by the way the second to last boss is in one of the smallest arenas in the game, spawns with 4 ranged units with shields, has undblockable attacks, can block attacks himself, AAAANNNNNDDDDD his minions can't be killed until AFTER you kill the boss. oh and his unkillable minions (seemingly intentionally) position themselves between you and the big guy, and even when they aren't in your way, sometimes your character just seems to ignore him. the autoaim on your attacks seem to prioritize his unkillable minions for some reason, and even when he's alone, it will just ignore him entirely.\n\n\nall of this only outlines the problems with the combat encounters. most of the other encouters in the game are strictly luck based, and rely entirely on you winning a 25% roll, or you lose most of your equipment/health/provisions.\n\nall I can say is, I hope the devs look at this game, figure out all the stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t they got wrong, and make an awesome sequel, because if not for its compeletly unforgivable, unignorable, experience ruining flaws, this game would be in the running for the greatest game I've ever played. that said, don't buy it. it's not worth you money because you'll never be able to actually beat it without getting incredibly lucky and I mean that literally, no matter how well you play, no matter how clever you are, most of the game comes down to situations where you have a 75-100% chanace of immediately dying a completely unvoidable death.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nResponse to developer's comment:\n\nthe graveyard deals a ton of damage (I think I lost like 45 health most of it in max health reduction) to you if you are cursed, and you are always cursed passed the first wing if I'm not mistaken (100% chance for a negative, potentially run ruinning outcome especially on levels like the king of scales where you lose health/food/gold randomly and can easily starve). also the treasure chest goes from being a nearly garunteed free gain to a nearly garunteed chance to lose most of your health to gas and a mimick (again, often in permanent health reduction). those are the ones that come to mind right now, but I know there are others.\n\nbasically some cards like the graveyard have a garunteed negative outcome if you don't know what they do ahead of time and put them in your deck at the wrong time, and others go from being really good during the early stages of the game to just being a death sentence later like treasure chest.\n\nnow don't get me wrong, I don't mind that the cards change as the game progresses, I mind that they change completely *without any warning.* if the game told you ahead of time that certain encounters where going to get more difficult that would be one thing, but when an important part of my strategy for getting a good run going with decent gear arbitrarily decides to kill me with out warning... that's when I get a bit upset.\n\nmy reccomendation would be to put a level indicator on encouters similar to the monster cards to warn you "hey this has a much bigger chance to go south, you sure you still want it in your deck?" but instead you have to learn that it can screw over your entire run by having it screw over your entire run, and that really sucks.\n\nall that said, I love the ideas you guys put into the game, it's really REALLY cool, it's just that the luck vs. skill could use a little bit of balancing more towards skill --or at least informed deck building-- and the arenas just get way to small and crowded to fight in later on and both those things really ruin an otherwise ingenious game.\n\noh and btw, I hate playing

The game setup with the cards feels nice but everything in between to me is rather bland.\n\nThe combat is too easy and generic and the high luck factor is something that I know will get me upset if I will keep playing that and should die due to it. To me the game started to feel very repeatitive really early on and I doubt it will grow different.

(Davy Jones, give me back my soul !).\nBut the more vicious challenges tends to give the more interesting rewards (and if it's too hard, don't keep them in the deck).\n\nSeveral challenges are kept in the deck in order to unlock others events so you end up by keeping the difficult one only to complete them once.\n\nFor an indie game, graphics are also really great and animations well executed. Presentation is top notch. The amount of work in this gem should have been huge.\n\nReminds me the books where you are the hero.\nThe result is original, well refined, and gives a game that you actually want to complete.","February 22, 2015","true","16.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

It combines a simple-to-learn (but challenging) combat system with the randomness of an old-school story-telling collectible card game (such as Mythos).\n\nIn short, each session you navigate your character through a serious of cards (that represent scenarios) in a game. Each card is effectively a random chance for loot, health, upgrades or monsters. When a monster card is drawn, you fight the monster(s) in a third-person view and gain treasure. At the end of a "game", you fight a boss monster. If you win, you gain new scenario cards and bosses to add to your deck. Each time you play, the cards are shuffled - so your scenarios are randomised as well!\n\nEach session is quick, and exciting.

Hidden behind the $15 dollar paywall, it's most likely the one game people won't bother paying the extra few bucks to check out.\n\nShame on them.\n\nThe game is, hands down (ba dum tsh), awesome. For those of you living under a rock and that have never any of the Extra Credits reviews of this game (they actually did it twice), lemme summurize it for ya:\n\nThe game is a cross between card game, Arkham City arena battles, and choose-your-adventure book. Basically you have a table with face-down cards and a character token that moves through those cards. Each card is an Event card, which can range from "You have been ambushed by Goblins who took your stuff" stage, made classic by the Golden Axe games, a maze stage filled with traps, or a plain-text event where you have to use your wits to avoid being on the receiving end of a prostate exam. The It's Toasted of the game is that during combat events the game zooms in and you control your character (with customizable gear!) to fight the hordes of enemies in the aforementioned Arkham City arena battles. It's pretty neat, althought it gets really unfair sometimes as the game has no challenge ballance - if you got dealt a bad hand of cards you're gonna have a bad time. You "improve" (as much as adding harder challenges is an improvement) by acquiring cards after beating the dealer's challenges along stages. So no way this is gonna be monetised in the future. Yey!\n\nThe game is still in Early Access, as of the time of this review the latest patch marks it as Beta1, so there's a lot of unpolished and unfinished things. The dealer has only a couple few animations and sometimes runs out of voice lines, there's not much variation between enemy models, the menu's navigability is horrible, and every now and again you stumble into attrociously unballanced dificulty spikes, but this is all expected from Early Access titles.\n\nI highly recommend the game, even in it's current form. One of the best card game concepts I've seen, reminds me a lot of the old Shadowrun TGC game.","August 27, 2014","true","3.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

As you progress through the game you unlock new cards which you can then build your "decks" from. This includes weapons that can be founf in the dungeon, food, and even new cards that can appear in the next dungeon. Each dungeon has a "Boss" that when you defeat unlocks the next in the series.\n\nPros:\n- Fantastic graphics and style\n- Great combat controls\n- Love the card collection\nCons:\n- Traps in 3rd person mode can be a bit distracting and frusterating.\n","January 15, 2015","true","3.1"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

It combines a simple-to-learn (but challenging) combat system with the randomness of an old-school story-telling collectible card game (such as Mythos).\n\nIn short, each session you navigate your character through a serious of cards (that represent scenarios) in a game. Each card is effectively a random chance for loot, health, upgrades or monsters. When a monster card is drawn, you fight the monster(s) in a third-person view and gain treasure. At the end of a "game", you fight a boss monster. If you win, you gain new scenario cards and bosses to add to your deck. Each time you play, the cards are shuffled - so your scenarios are randomised as well!\n\nEach session is quick, and exciting. I recommend this to fans of the boardgame Talisman, CCGs and action fantasy games. There are hours of fun to be had in this little gem.","July 11, 2014","true","1.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Very much unfinished and unpolished as of now, but the core concept is well done and people that enjoy games like FTL will probably get some fun out of this too. Fun, but there are caveats.\n\n\nLong:\nThe Good:\n\nThe strange genre mix plays out surprisingly well, with the ability to influence your dungeon and the RNG parts by careful considerations. The fighting system is heavily influenced by batmans free flow. The voiceover and presentation is atmospheric and the unlock system itself is telling a story. There are many interesting items and effects that keep runs fresh even after failing coupled with the unlocks.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThe combat is at times clunky, sometimes bordering unfair and the camera can get into weird angles. Some items and effects are poorly balanced and the RNG can really screw you over sometimes. The aesthetics are ok, but it's no AAA title of course. Restarting a run does takes 30 seconds because of the presentation, that should really be skippable (and sometimes the token animation). For some token encounters, you have not the slightest clue how to get them.\n\nThe Ugly:\n\nTerrible optimization (as of now): some rooms and angles can make your framerate dip very significantly but it doesn't offer a proper graphics options menu, only presets. Also, for some reason it is a big memory hog (in excess of 2GB).  I was unable to play the combat with KB+mouse as it didn't register the mouse buttons. Works fine with a controller, but that should work anyway. The key rebinding in the launcher is bad, listing controls for 9 gamepads (wtf?) and binding for attacks on KB+mouse didn't work for me.","August 25, 2014","true","16.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Getting to chat with some of the developers was really neat, and I expressed how much I liked the game there, as I am here. The idea of taking a deck-building/shuffling game, and stuffing RPG, brawling, rogue-lite dungeon crawler all into one package seemed so inovative to me, and appealed to a lot of the game types I like.

Lucky for it, Hand of Fate nails both. The voice-acting for the dealer is spectacular and easily on-par with Triple-A developers. The card dealing mechanic is well-delivered and helps keep the game feeling quite different with each runthrough. Missing a chance to earn a token is heartbreaking, mostly because you don't know what little nugget of the game was just pulled out of your grasp and how you could have used or played it in a future game run.\n\nThe game isn't without its issues, and most of them are related to combat. Using a controller just isn't an option for me personally. It doesn't feel right. But nor is the mouse-and-keyboard combo ideal, given you're restricted to just the eight cardinal directions. But pulling off a serious combo is still satisfying, and ultimately, the combat system is just a vessel for the greater card-dealing system, which is the meat of this game. Combat, ultimately, is passable. It doesn't bog the game down.\n\nOh. And the music.

The main "story" starts off easy enough, and with the new difficulty cards, you can tailor the challenge to your own desire.

The endless mode is also very fun, and there's a lot of new cards to unlock by following their unlock paths.  The only main problem is that the combat, while fun, can get rather repetitive.  The Batman style combat isn't bad, however, but with it dictating all of the combat encounters, a little more variety would breathe more life into the game and allow players to experiement more and increase diversification in playstyle.

Not finished but:\n\nCombat might or might not get deeper than it is - counter/reflect projectiles, dodge roll, stun, and combo multipliers.\n\nIn many encounters the difficulty seems to be mainly from managing both the actual enemies and the arena itself which can be laden down with traps. Even at the start I find it taxing to manage both, but the game doesn't seem to expect you to be able to come out unscathed. The other part of the difficulty is managing resources as you move through grid dungeons.\n\nThe story itself is deliberately vague so far, it fits the setting and the delivery from the deckmaster really sells it. The game might be hinting at a deeper story involving the character's past, or it might just be dressing for the nature of the game, it's hard to tell. I'd condiser it a bonus if there's a payoff, but what's already here definitely nails the atmosphere.\n\nI'd say the atmosphere is definitely the game's strong suit, and the developers did a really good job with the little details such as using expanding lighting on load, sound effects for things like the opening of the token bowl and dropping of items. The game also knows its exact limits in terms of graphics and animation, and utilizes those things very well.\n\nIf I have a complaint so far it's mainly just that the use of the game world load for merchant visits is a little bit pointless, though the location and appearance of the shop does change with respect to what kind of shop it is and (I'm guessing) what kind of dungeon you are running.\n\nAll in all an excellent game especially at the sale price.","June 18, 2015","true","8.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There are other sources to explain how the game works so I won't re-explain that but I will highlight its key points.\n\nYou build a deck of equipment and encounters, then run the level with that deck of cards, making progress towards expanding your deck (and thus your options), and in the middle of all that you engage in short third-person fights with creatures/enemies. And in the middle of ALL of that, you are continually listening to the comments of the dealer, the writing for which is superb and the voice acting for which really sets a very mysterious and compelling tone to the game. Added to that the animation as all this takes place, the atmosphere of the game is extremely enticing, full of exploration, mystery and intrigue.\n\nThe deck building is compelling as it has a real impact on how you will play the level and has more depth that 'best equipment in, worst equipment out', actually requiring thought to get cards which may work well with your building of the encounters. Speaking of which, you also choose what the encounters are going to be during the level, mainly focusing on ones which you have not completed yet which in turn will expand your available cards. A very rewarding and compelling loop with surprising depth.\n\nThe little battles are not too long or onerous and as they are very short and there is a lot of variety (some variety in enemies and variety in how you play based on what equipment you've managed to acquire, completely changing your abilities) they do not get repetitive quickly.\n\nThe campaign is, as I have said, very atmospheric. It is all about exploring the encounters around you (as you don't know which ones they are), with success leading to rewards expanding your deck for the next run. There is a fair element of luck involved, which would be annoying if it weren't for the fact that you make permanent progress on each run even if you die, which means that you still feel like something was achieved.\n\nOverall, these factors combine to make a very compelling and enjoyable experience which is highly recommended for just about everyone, since it isn't really just a 'brawler' or a 'card building game' or any of those, but a great hybrid which takes the best elements from everything in my opinion. Add to that the updates by the developers, it is one to pick up and keep playing. (And the DLC also comes highly recommended as it adds yet another element to this great game!)","December 24, 2015","true","4.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The player controlled combat is really well defined to the point where its actual skill (further than the extent of earlygame where you spam mouse 1) and could use a touch up on how you teleport/slide to counter enemies but great integration of 3rd person combat into a deckbuilding rougelike.\n\nThe decks you build are unique and you can partially decide your fate through random encounters.  You may start the game with the best weapon you shuffled into your weapon deck but next turn be held up by an angry mob that steals most your food, leaving you desperate to take any advance towards combat to earn gold to hopefully stumble across a shop to scrape by until you gather enough food to make it to the next shop, until fate decides you either run out of food and die, scrape by until the boss and have no weapon or skill advantage because youve spent no gold on gear, or by stroke of luck stumble into plentiful amounts of food.

Some how I missed this games kickstarter, and man was I mad that I missed it. I was extremely happy and lucky to be given one of their printed cards regardless, becuase I was attending PSX. Getting to chat with some of the developers was really neat, and I expressed how much I liked the game there, as I am here. The idea of taking a deck-building/shuffling game, and stuffing RPG, brawling, rogue-lite dungeon crawler all into one package seemed so inovative to me, and appealed to a lot of the game types I like. I was very surprsied when I was sitting down playing and the combat opened up for the first time, but I had loads of fun with the two boss fights they let me play through.

Unlike most other cards games, you don't need to learn all cards by hand, as all of these are explained in detail whenever you draw them.\n\nFurthermore, I am deeply a fan of the rogue-like aspect, which I never thought a card game could have. The gameplay is very original; there is no other game even close to this. Everytime you draw a card, you either gain resources, equipment, or you will enter a combat. I am still astonished at how one can combine so many different gaming aspects, whilst yet creating a wonderful game.\n\nWith no doubt, from the old RTS games I've played to the FPS games that have been dominating the planet, this is one of the best single-player games ever made.","March 8","true","1.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

That's not an easy thing for me to say. Everything about this game is unique. It gets a perfect score in my book. Also, it has the all time greatest boss fight at the end of the game, hands down. I love this game to death.\n\nThe gameplay is the best part of this game, the game can twist and turn any which way when your progress is lead by pure luck. The way the card system works is very simple and easy to wrap your mind around. The combat is excellent and fluid, it's awesome to watch. The combat isn't just hacking and slashing, it's about timing blocks and dodging opponents you can't fight all at once. The combat is reminscent to the first Fable, in fact, much of this game really is a Fable game without the brand name, but the combat is so much more interesting here than in any Fable.\n\nThe graphics are lush and colourful. It has that wonderful atmospheric fantasy mood that Fable set so perfectly.\n\nThe sound quality is top notch for the most part. There is a few times when the sound does cut out but a simple restart fixes that immediately. The soundtrack is awesome and really has an epic vibe to it. I was even thinking of buying it if it's sold on Steam. It's one of those soundtracks that'll take me back years from now. I love the clanging of the swords and the thumping of swords against shields. The voice actor behind the Dealer is on the same level of deep and mesmerizing as Morgan Freeman. He's like an English Morgan Freeman, I can't stress enough how good of a voice actor he is.\n\nThe story line is interesting, it's not a normal storyline. You enter at the end of the adventurer's story. This is a retelling of all his adventures. So it's a game about retrospective and reflection. The Dealer makes very interesting remarks and ponderings that make me think on a philosophical level. What kind of game does that?\n\nI love a game that I can put hundreds and hundreds of hours into. A game that has endless replayability and isn't limited by just having a storyline. This is one of those games. It doesn't ever have to end. There's an endless mode. There's also 200+ cards to collect. Each card is an encounter. Every game randomizes these encounters and even throws in some that benefit you and some that debilitate you to a certain extent. This game definitely earns its pay and has lot of bang for very little buck.\n\nIf you're on the fence about getting it, don't be. This game isn't hard to fall in love with. I'd recommend this game to absolutely anyone.\n","February 23, 2015","true","30.3"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","5","10","2","1"

Each card changes you path for greater or for worse, offering you chances of possibly great loot but could also take items or health from you just as fast. The writing is great from the card text to the spoken word of the game master. Combat however while I love how you are summoned into a battle sequence from the cards the actual combat still feels a bit shaky. It's slow and doesn't feel as fast as I would expect.

And then complete it? And then fail because you were meant to complete it this time? Well then ... welcome to the RNG heaven and hell\n\nHand of Fate is a mix of roguelike, dungeon-crawler and deckbuilding game. While you play, the dealer will narrate what is happening on the board and you will obey while you fight your way to the dealer.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThe gameplay in Hand of Fate can be separated in several categories starting with the Deckbuilding ,Card unlocking, "Dungeons" , Items, Encounters/Enemies and Combat. Let's get it started.\n\nDeckbuilding\n\nDeckbuilding is the neatest of the features I liked in the game because as said it let you make your own Dungeon. While in Endless Mode you dont have deckbuilding because you use all unlocked cards , in Story you have to build your deck, matching the required number of cards for Encounters and Equipment. While you have complete freedom in your Equipment deck, in the Encounters one you will  see locked cards ( one of them is the end boss of the dungeon). Some of the locked cards can be removed by completing them but often leads to new locked cards.\n\nCard Unlocking\n\nCards are being unlocked by receiving card tokens. And you receive card tokens when you complete an encounter for first time. And you harvest the rewards at the end of the dungeon ... or after you die( its cool that you arent being punished for dying since a lot of card unlocks can end up terribly for you) . Different cards got different requirments to be completed and gest the best of RNG doesnt mean you will get the token. Once you get to the part where token breaks to reveal cards you will be welcomed with a neat animation. From the token you can get new equipment, encounter cards or gain cards. There are several "quest" chains that are worth doing. The newly obtained cards contain no information until you encounter them in-game so you can only guess what may happen.\n\nDungeons\n\nOnce your deck is ready  the party starts. Dealer will setup the board with separating the different decks in piles and then he starts drawing encounter cards to form dungeon levels. Once everything is setuped you start hoping from card to card till you reach the end... your end or dungeon's end. During story every dungeon comes up with bonus ... curses which will improve your game experience(or make you rage) . Every dungeon in story mode ends up with a boss fight(if you find it before you die) that will unlocks new cards, including the next level. At the end you will unlock new cards(hopefully) and will be able to increase your deck variety. While in the dungeon you have to take care of your supplies: Gold and Food. Food is beiung used on every turn and heals you.\n\nItems/Equipment\n\nOne of your deck is filled with equipment that you can use during your adventures, if you get lucky to find it. You have Weapons,Armored,Gloves,Helmets,Rings, Artifacts(skills) and Blesses/Curses. While you can hoard all the equipments, you can change your active items before fights so you have to be picky and hope for the best. You can have only 1 active item from each category apart from Rings and Blesses/Curses. Encounters can remove any kind of item without blessing/curses(unless its stated otherwise). There are a lot of different items with their own pros and cons.\n\nEncounters and Enemies\n\nAh the Encounter Deck, no matter how many good encounters you put in it, there will be always some that will screw everything. There are different kind of Encounters, from straight fights to short text-based adventures. Almost every encounter comes with a lovely RNG that features cards and there are 2 kinds of RNG : Success/failure that are represented with Huge Success,Success,Failure and Huge Failure cards. The amount of cards you can pick is 4 but they depends on the encounter themselves but you always have at least 1 success/failure card and the amount of cards you have to pick from is 4 ; Enemies are also represented by cards . You have the 4 basic enemies Skulls(skeletons), Dust(bandits), Plague(rats) and Scales(Lizardmen) . Each of them got melee and range model which puts the enemy count to 8. While playing you can unlock additional enemies( I got so far Mages, Liches and Lava Golems) which put the enemy count up to 11 . And the Iceing on the cake is the boss cards. Once you beat the boss its being unlocked in the monster deck and with 12 bosses to unlock you put the enemy count up to 23. So enemy variety is quite big for this kind of Game.\n\nCombat\n\nLast but not least, the Combat. Combat is pretty straightforward. You have Melee attack, Weapon Skill,Artefact Skill, Counter, Stun and Dodge. So you can say that the combat is similiar to Batman or Kingdoms of Amalur but with lower budget. Enemies attack are slowed most of the time so you can react accordingly. If you have shield you can counter melee attacks or reflect projectiles but thats only if the prompt for attack glows green... if its red you better get the f* out of there.  There is a friendlyfire so you can use this to your advantage with good positioning so you can let enemies tank the range attacks. Now.. one thing that I noticed is often so long leaps when you counter enemies at distance or being stuck in animation with no time to react. My main issue with the combat is the camera. You cant rotate it so at times you have no idea what are you gonna face or where exactly the enemy is. Apart from that combat is fine.\nStory and Narration\n\nStory is pretty simple : you are an adventurer who stumbled upon Dealer's home and you are invited for a game but you are free to leave whenever you want. In the said game you have to defeat the Dealer but before that you must defeat his strongest warriors(on every warrior's level you will meet new challenges so GL). Simple yet well presented thanks to the strong Narration. Voice actor did his job superb but there is still something more to be desired from the writing. Still even when Dealer repeats himself is often in the mood of the situation and there are just a view occassions when the line will not be fitting the situation.\n\nDifficulty/Fates\n\nNow this is more about the DLC "Wildcards" . Fates lets you change your playstyle. In base game you have 3 fates that serve as Easy/Normal/Hard difficulty in other games but if you have the DLC you get access to 9 more fates with different stats that affect your playstyle. It's a neat addition but there is still room for improvment.\n\nEndless Mode\n\nOnce you are done with the story, Endless mode seems best option to play it .. but I personally didnt like it since it kills Deckbuilding. In Endless Mode you play with all the unlocked cards you have and on every floor the Dealer gets stronger and stronger.\n\n\nOverall\nIts a neat roguelike with forgiving RNG and superb quest design and narration. Its good for short playsession and for people who like to unlock all cards.","June 21, 2015","true","18.6"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spencicles/recommended/266510/","Spencicles","Trip Fisk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spencicles/","338 products in account","tl;dr: good game, but expensive. 8/10\n\nI have to give Hand of Fate credit. The presentation and style, as minimal as it is, is impressive. The game itself offers a unique and potentially engaging experience. The mysterious dealer sets the perfect mood with his appearance and narration. The only problem is HoF is one of those style over substance sorts of games. The flow of the game is entirely determined through cards as they're flipped over, and its this.... hand... that determines your fate. (eh? eh? that's the pun in the game's title)\n\nMost of the time the game itself never goes beyond making a choice based on the card flipped and then selecting a shuffled card to determine if your action is successful or not. This in of itself isn't bad, but if you're looking for an action-y graphically intense RPG experience with deep lore, you won't find it here.\n\nInfrequently, there are action-y bits. Usually in the form of a fight. Sometimes as an obstacle course. They're good place holders and don't do anything particularly wrong, but the AI is typically predictable and easy to overcome if you're a well seasoned gamer even on the harder mode. The action areas are also cramped looking and claustrophobic feeling.\n\nPlaying off its card based mechanics, the more you play and beat the game, the more and different cards you unlock, and the longer the new games you start become. Longer games translate into higher difficulty. This is one of those games where moves are a resource represented as food. Running out of food typically means you lose HP until you die and starving is typically how you fail in Hand of Fate.\n\nHand of Fate does come together very well though. It works as a game and, most importantly, is enjoyable and fun. The only major complaint I have is there isn't enough content or variety to justify the $25 price IMHO.","June 22, 2015","true","4.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

But it's all in your control for the most part so really that's up to the player.\n\nAlso, the wizard man gets his own deck. This will add cards to ♥♥♥♥ up your day. Rediculous cards that will make you want to cry. But without the wizard man there is no point in building your own deck to make you as powerfull as you can.\n\nThat's when luck starts to take effect. When it seems like all you do is run into the wizard man's cards, you won't be able to build up equipment on your character as easily, or at all. I've made it a few floors without gaining any gear.\n\nHowever in the end the wizard man's cards, your cards, and the choices you make as you crawl and battle your way thrtough the floors creates a very rewarding experince.\n\n8/10.\n\nAlso they seem to add some free stories/cards to play from time to time.

It does this through the side stories in the game. For a lot of cards, when you land on them they will give you a side quest that you can complete. If you do complete it then it will unlock another card that keeps driving this side story into multiple play throughs. This really helps in making the game not stagnate the more you play it, because it is constantly adding new cards for you to interact with and furthering the stories at the same time.\n\nOn the subject of RNG, this game is not always fair because a lot of it comes down to RNG. Most of the time you can handle what the game throws at you, but sometimes you will have a game where literally nothing goes your way. If you do not enjoy games that have RNG elements like this, then you will probably not enjoy this game. However, I feel like for the most part the RNG is not that bad.\n\nThe main problem that this game has is the combat. The combat is fairly simplistic, where you mainly just dodge and counter enemy attacks, similar to the Batman Arkham games, but less polished. Something about the combat just isn’t very satisfying. The enemies usually take a good bit of hits before they go down and when they do go down they don’t really have any kind of death animation, they just go full ragdoll which isn’t very gratify.\n\nBut, this game is still very enjoyable to play and I recommend checking it out.","January 31","true","15.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The difficulty is fairly easy at first, with the challenge becoming greater as you progress. Those who are at least adequate with the kind of combat described should be able to get right up to the end without too much difficulty, but the last encounter is an absolute nightmare that will take a lot of skill to get past.\n\nThe game at first is only 16-ish levels long, which can easily take up at least an hour each. The story is very intriquing, delivered mostly through the narration of the dealer, your constant enemy and companion. This, in my opinion, is far more preferable than them just right out telling you everything at the beginning, and the mystic behind the game only fits with the theme of it all. There is also several stories hidden within the cards you will begin to collect as you progress through the game.\n\nInitially, I'd say this game is slightly overpriced, with a cost of $20 being more appropriate. However, the developers of the game have started releasing DLC for the game for absolutely nothing, which more than makes this game worth the price.\n\nHand of Fate is a true gem on Steam, with an interesting take on the RPG genre.","December 5, 2015","true","19.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Very well thought of game with a mixture of cards and action. This game has good narrative storyline, very polished gameplay, good bgm and sound effects. The game can also be quickly entertaining without having to spend alot of hours into it. It is easy to learn and pickup even with the lack of a subtle tutorial.\n\nIn general this game allows you finish something like a quest given to you, and you gain a card token. After the end of each session, you open the card tokens revealing new adventures, new equipments that can be added into ur encounter deck, equipment deck and etc. This game is very well thought of because it uses a card interaction of allowing players to create their own encounters with a mixture of the dealers encounter cards. Very interactive gameplay. Players are required to do some sort of resource management from obtaining food resources, consuming food as each step taken requires you to consume one food resource. Sometimes you might think you will not gain anymore food, prompting you to quickly move on to the next level.\n\nOne downside to this game is that by the time you are 80% completing this game. You realize that there are no new monsters and the background setting are always the same. But it's not a problem because the developers can choose to release new DLC's that feature new monsters and bosses in the near future.\n\nOverall, this is a great game that any gamer should add into their collection.","November 22, 2015","true","7.6"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","2"

Getting to chat with some of the developers was really neat, and I expressed how much I liked the game there, as I am here. The idea of taking a deck-building/shuffling game, and stuffing RPG, brawling, rogue-lite dungeon crawler all into one package seemed so inovative to me, and appealed to a lot of the game types I like. I was very surprsied when I was sitting down playing and the combat opened up for the first time, but I had loads of fun with the two boss fights they let me play through. I'm happy to have finally gotten a copy of this game, and love it.","December 28, 2015","true","1.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Currently have 50 hours into it (due to a lot of on-and-off gameplay), and still have quests to finish and things to unlock. Combat is simple (swing, counter, stun, and dodge), game of chance is fun (Four cards shown, then flipped and mixed up. Follow a card, if you can, and pick one.), and Endless mode keeps the game going after you've beaten the story mode, or even if you decide you don't like the story mode for someodd reason.\n\nCannot recommend this game enough!","January 18","true","53.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'll focus on the main game in this review. This game is well worth the price(although I got it during the winter sale). The replayablity is really high and there are tons of new cards to unlock everytime you play a stage or endless. The main game let's you select the boss for the stage and each one comes with seperate rules(in the form of curses) and encounters to make getting to each boss it's own challenge. You can make your own deck to suit your playstyle or to adapt to certain stages, the cards that make up the equipment and encounter deck are cards you unlock from bosses, tokens, and from the easy and hard mode fates(you also unlock new gain cards from tokens). Equipment explains it's self, but encounter cards make up the floors in the stages, so you are in charge of the events that occur on each floor, it's a really awesome feature of this game. There are three main ways to die, one is from combat, another is from failing chance cards that make you draw pain cards, and last is from starvation.\nThe combat in the game isn't the best part, but it at least provides a good amount of challenge to the game, this is even more so if you're stuck in basic gear. Some negative things I could say about the game would be some chance cards are really hard to succeed at or survive(looking at you Petward ;c) and some of the most annoying encounters are locked in your deck and can ruin a playthrough. I'll briefly go over endless which is a mode where you select which fate you'll use and every card you unlocked will be in the mode(so no deck building), it's pretty much a mode where you need to survive as long as possible to get a highscore. Endless can be fun, but if you have encounters like Petward still up it could be all for naught. So I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes rogue-likes and action rpgs that have a twist to make it feel like a completely different experience. :)","January 16","true","85.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The trinity of those three games might appear to suggest that Hand of Fate is a casual game. It is not. Actually it is quite hardcore on the higher difficulty levels, which one will need to play at to unlock all cards and events. Don't deprive yourself of 80% of the game by just playing it on easy. It's not just more difficult, the game plays very differently with different "decks".\n\nThe only reason I would not recommend Hand of Fate is because of the RIDICULOUSLY difficult Kraken encounter which has soiled about 95% of my endless mode runs. **** you Kraken. 11/10 would get smashed by tentacles, stabbed by lizard men, eletrocuted, set on fire or chomped on by a Kraken all in one single encounter at the same time again.","January 14","true","26.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

With a lot of cards representing equipment, encounters and fights. It's usually up to the player to fill in the blanks in the story.\n\nYour only real contact is the Dealer. A mysterious man, sitting in a locale controlling the ''game'', which are shown through the cards. He is the person that sets it all in motion. Yet, you do not know what purpose he fulfills otherwise.\n\nThe game is for the most time in the adventure on the cards. The encounter cards are laid out in a pattern, sometimes a linear path, other times a maze-like construction. Your goal is to move from your start point, to the exit, which remains hidden. Important to know, is that every move uses food. if you run out of food, you start losing health. As per usual in most games, no health = death.\n\nSome encounters require a luck-based desicion, this is represented by four different cards. in order: Huge succes, Succes, Failure and Huge failure. 4 cards are shown, with the possible outcomes for you to choose. the cards are flipped, shuffeled, and then it's up to you to choose the adventurers fate in the encounter. It's important to know that succeeding the challenge, does not always progress the encounter, nor does failure always have a bad outcome.\n\nSometimes, an encounter happens to be a fight. You are then taken to a scene, which has a lot of variation in both size and looks. The game then turns in a 3rd person brawler. you must beat all enemies to continue, or die trying.\n\nThe story of your character is vague at best, and it is up to you, as the player, to find out who he is. And most importantly, what happened to him as to how he got there. Do not think that the Dealer is there to help you, as he will remind you a lot of times.\n\nI personally like the setting a lot, it's simple, yet complicated, and shrouded in mystery. The Dealer as a character is awesome, and basically creates the atmosphere of the game on his own, commenting on your choices, your succeses, and failures.\n\nIf a point of negativity is to be made, I would have liked to see some character customisation. Not that the game requires it, but it would have been nice. Also, the Dealer runs out of lines quickly, and sometimes his conversations are pretty long. Still, the story that he conveys through said dialogue is very nice.\n\nOverall, i had a great experience with the game as a whole. the DLC that i got, added a whole lot of semi-adventures to go through. I do not value scores, since a game should be your experience. A game that people generally dislike, may be the game you love the most.\n\nIf a score is to be put up:\n8.5/10.\n","January 2","true","50.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It boils down to attack, counter, dodge, and special move.\n\nUnlocking new cards that are part of a series (Blood Auction, any of the Wildcard DLC, etc) can be tedious due to the luck involved.\n\nUnlimited Mode is fun but it's just about score in the end. You can only "win" the game in Story Mode\n\nWith the new free DLC, a challenging late game boss can appear early on in Unlimited Mode when monster difficulty is supposed to be low.

It incorporates elements of cards games, rpg games, and action style games and tries to wield them all together.  It shouldn't work, but somehow it does, creating something refreshingly different.\n\nThe core of the games main story mode is that you pick a boss to go after (although you must beat each to go on to the next one) the assemble a deck of story cards and one of equipment.  The story cards are then mixed together with new cards by the mysterious Dealer and laid out to form a map.  As you move your character onto a story card, it flips over, usually resulting in a choose your own adventure style encounter, although there are also straight up combats and stores to discover.  Any equipment you find is usually drawn from your equipment deck, so what cards you put in that can be important as are what encounters you added into the mix. Some encounter cards come with tokens you can earn by achieving something during the encounter.\n\nWIn or lose, once your run is over, any tokens you've earned unlock new eqiupment and encounter cards.  It is no coincidence that some of the most useful cards are rewards for some of the most risky encounters, so going safe is not always good for the long run.\n\nCombat is handled with a battle system nearly identical to the Batman Arkham games.  If you enjoyed that system, you'll like this one.\n\nAll in all a very unique game that is easy to pick up for a quick 30 minute run.","January 2","true","14.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

There are other sources to explain how the game works so I won't re-explain that but I will highlight its key points.\n\nYou build a deck of equipment and encounters, then run the level with that deck of cards, making progress towards expanding your deck (and thus your options), and in the middle of all that you engage in short third-person fights with creatures/enemies. And in the middle of ALL of that, you are continually listening to the comments of the dealer, the writing for which is superb and the voice acting for which really sets a very mysterious and compelling tone to the game. Added to that the animation as all this takes place, the atmosphere of the game is extremely enticing, full of exploration, mystery and intrigue.\n\nThe deck building is compelling as it has a real impact on how you will play the level and has more depth that 'best equipment in, worst equipment out', actually requiring thought to get cards which may work well with your building of the encounters. Speaking of which, you also choose what the encounters are going to be during the level, mainly focusing on ones which you have not completed yet which in turn will expand your available cards. A very rewarding and compelling loop with surprising depth.\n\nThe little battles are not too long or onerous and as they are very short and there is a lot of variety (some variety in enemies and variety in how you play based on what equipment you've managed to acquire, completely changing your abilities) they do not get repetitive quickly.\n\nThe campaign is, as I have said, very atmospheric. It is all about exploring the encounters around you (as you don't know which ones they are), with success leading to rewards expanding your deck for the next run. There is a fair element of luck involved, which would be annoying if it weren't for the fact that you make permanent progress on each run even if you die, which means that you still feel like something was achieved.\n\nOverall, these factors combine to make a very compelling and enjoyable experience which is highly recommended for just about everyone, since it isn't really just a 'brawler' or a 'card building game' or any of those, but a great hybrid which takes the best elements from everything in my opinion. Add to that the updates by the developers, it is one to pick up and keep playing. (And the DLC also comes highly recommended as it adds yet another element to this great game!)","December 24, 2015","true","4.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Ive only played 2 hours or so but honestly, theres so much luck, skill, and storyline, i found it hard to stop at the end of a level.  The player controlled combat is really well defined to the point where its actual skill (further than the extent of earlygame where you spam mouse 1) and could use a touch up on how you teleport/slide to counter enemies but great integration of 3rd person combat into a deckbuilding rougelike.\n\nThe decks you build are unique and you can partially decide your fate through random encounters.  You may start the game with the best weapon you shuffled into your weapon deck but next turn be held up by an angry mob that steals most your food, leaving you desperate to take any advance towards combat to earn gold to hopefully stumble across a shop to scrape by until you gather enough food to make it to the next shop, until fate decides you either run out of food and die, scrape by until the boss and have no weapon or skill advantage because youve spent no gold on gear, or by stroke of luck stumble into plentiful amounts of food.

Create two sets of cards. One set is of items to find. The other set is of encounters. Thankfully the NPC (game master?) shuffles and sorts everything out for you.\nThe GM places cards on the table in various configurations and you move a taoken along the cards as you would on a grid or board. Sometimes you have more than one direction from which to choose. Most often you can only more in one direction. Once chosen you reveal the card to see what you encounter. You may encounter combat, find equipment, make a choice as to your action or many others. Don't forget to stock up on food as each card your token moves to will cost one food.\nAfter traveling awhile (down stairs to new 'floors'), you find the end boss. Use your equipment to defeat this foe the same way you beat any previous combat. Use the ASWD keys to swing your current weapon. Other items may give you other skills and will be explained as you get them. If you beat the boss, you'll unlock many new cards and can change your decks around to include them if you wish.\nTailor your decks to what you think might happen. Add more armor, a shield or even stronger weapons. There is a lot you cannot plan for, so I suggest erring on the side of caution.\nYou can always go into another 'dungeon' to fight a boss you have already fought. To start a game, choose the boss you want to fight then choose the difficulty for what is needed to unlock specials.

I love the game, I have beaten almost all of the bosses (stuck on the last one) and I love how hard the game is!\n\nMy first expressions to Hand of fate were something like this: "Another fantasy card game? Hearthstone ripp-off?" But I was suprised how there is third-person realtime combat in this! So how does it work?\n\nThe idea is this: There is the "table" where you have cards. You don't know what the cards are and as you move you unfold the cards one by one. Behind every card there could be a Fight, a choice, a shop or the Devil giving you something to kill. The more you play the more cards you get, and more cards you have, more difficult the game gets. Also the first time you kill a boss, it becomes a reqular encounter in the game. So don't be like me and say "Now I will never have to fight him again.." Woopsie\n\nThe game is wonderful and I recommend it from my frozen heart,,, now I have a meeting with the King of Scales (again)","December 9, 2015","true","21.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Most talked about how easy the game was etc, etc.  For the first 75% is it not difficult at all. Some of the tokens require some luck of the draw to get but everything is definitely doable.\n\nThe only difficult fight I found was the boss at the end but if you get a good trip to him with the right abilities you can beat him.  The heal is really needed.  However, it is pretty easy if you get the damage increase per curse as you have a lot of curses when you get there.  That makes him much easier.\n\nAfter reading reviews I was skeptical, but it was fun.  The graphcis are nothing to write home to mom about, but the play through was enjoyable.  I do not think I will play through it again, but I did enjoy it.\n\nIf you catch this on sale, it is really worth a play through.  If you are looking for hack and slash or building up a character to just go one shot everything, this is not the game for you.  If you like a little strategy, luck of the dice, and some chance involved, this will keep you interested.\n","December 14, 2015","true","18.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

But I think this game need a little rebalance, especially with encounter chance and THAT last battle. Seriously, this game get kinda unfair near the end game. You need both LUCK and SKILL to succeed.

Through these is the main way of drawing from your equipment deck and affecting your 3 resorces.\n\nThe whole time the dealer has awesome dialogue based on the cards and your options as well as banter, this makes the atmospher of the game awesome.\n\nCombat:\nIs fairly simple but fun and can be heavily affected by equpitment, blessings and curses you have got hold of during that run. You have attack, combo damage, block,counter, stun, dodge roll, weapon ability, artifact ability.\n\nThis from an overall perspective is a very unique and fun game, plenty of loot and replayablity, and you gain more options even on failing a run, so your time never feels completely wasted.\n\nVERDICT:\nThere's nothing about the game I dislike or feel is badly done, so a full recommendation from me :)","January 30","true","32.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It does this through the side stories in the game. For a lot of cards, when you land on them they will give you a side quest that you can complete. If you do complete it then it will unlock another card that keeps driving this side story into multiple play throughs. This really helps in making the game not stagnate the more you play it, because it is constantly adding new cards for you to interact with and furthering the stories at the same time.\n\nOn the subject of RNG, this game is not always fair because a lot of it comes down to RNG. Most of the time you can handle what the game throws at you, but sometimes you will have a game where literally nothing goes your way. If you do not enjoy games that have RNG elements like this, then you will probably not enjoy this game. However, I feel like for the most part the RNG is not that bad.\n\nThe main problem that this game has is the combat. The combat is fairly simplistic, where you mainly just dodge and counter enemy attacks, similar to the Batman Arkham games, but less polished. Something about the combat just isn’t very satisfying. The enemies usually take a good bit of hits before they go down and when they do go down they don’t really have any kind of death animation, they just go full ragdoll which isn’t very gratify.\n\nBut, this game is still very enjoyable to play and I recommend checking it out.","January 31","true","15.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

That's not an easy thing for me to say. Everything about this game is unique. It gets a perfect score in my book. Also, it has the all time greatest boss fight at the end of the game, hands down. I love this game to death.\n\nThe gameplay is the best part of this game, the game can twist and turn any which way when your progress is lead by pure luck. The way the card system works is very simple and easy to wrap your mind around. The combat is excellent and fluid, it's awesome to watch. The combat isn't just hacking and slashing, it's about timing blocks and dodging opponents you can't fight all at once. The combat is reminscent to the first Fable, in fact, much of this game really is a Fable game without the brand name, but the combat is so much more interesting here than in any Fable.\n\nThe graphics are lush and colourful. It has that wonderful atmospheric fantasy mood that Fable set so perfectly.\n\nThe sound quality is top notch for the most part. There is a few times when the sound does cut out but a simple restart fixes that immediately. The soundtrack is awesome and really has an epic vibe to it. I was even thinking of buying it if it's sold on Steam. It's one of those soundtracks that'll take me back years from now. I love the clanging of the swords and the thumping of swords against shields. The voice actor behind the Dealer is on the same level of deep and mesmerizing as Morgan Freeman. He's like an English Morgan Freeman, I can't stress enough how good of a voice actor he is.\n\nThe story line is interesting, it's not a normal storyline. You enter at the end of the adventurer's story. This is a retelling of all his adventures. So it's a game about retrospective and reflection. The Dealer makes very interesting remarks and ponderings that make me think on a philosophical level. What kind of game does that?\n\nI love a game that I can put hundreds and hundreds of hours into. A game that has endless replayability and isn't limited by just having a storyline. This is one of those games. It doesn't ever have to end. There's an endless mode. There's also 200+ cards to collect. Each card is an encounter. Every game randomizes these encounters and even throws in some that benefit you and some that debilitate you to a certain extent. This game definitely earns its pay and has lot of bang for very little buck.\n\nIf you're on the fence about getting it, don't be. This game isn't hard to fall in love with. I'd recommend this game to absolutely anyone.\n","February 23, 2015","true","30.3"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","5","10","2","1"

He isn't a bad guy whom wishes to see you destroyed, he is but a pawn himself, playing his role and carrying out his duties to whatever forces hold him in check. Seeing how he is the only character besides the randomly generated baddies that you encounter, I do find it beneficial to the overall quality of the game that he has a sense of mystery around him and that you experience a sort of growing "give-take" relationship with him via dialogue and card plots as you play throughout the story mode. I've put over 3 hours into the game and I haven't heard the dealer repeat himself yet. This a huge plus as most games have a very shallow dialogue pool to pull from.\n\nWhile I've heard others complain that the hack n' slash format of combat that you are thrown into upon landing on a card that generates baddies is boring and unrewarding-I STRONGLY disagree. The combat is fast paced and frantic, keeping you on your toes as ranged enemies attack from afar, the map deploys it's traps, and the "boss" of the group has unblockable abilities. The space bar will be your best friend when it comes to combat scenarios! The inventory items that I've experienced this far have all been unique, each with their own situational applications (damage against the undead or the plagued, gold gain whenever you regen health, etc.).\n\nThe next major aspect of this game is deck customization. Do you dare to stray from the auto build?\n\nI've yet to try the endless mode (yes there are two game modes 'story' and 'endless').\n7/10, would recommend picking this game up, ESPECIALLY if it is on sale.

The game mechanics themselves are simple but solid but serve mainly as a vessle for its better elements, the lore and style. The thermatics of this game are expertly managed, often with slippets of lore being dropped by your nemisis the superbly voiced and acted "dealer", an enigmatic and charismatic foe. One of the problems worth mentioning is that the random elements can sometimes kill a player too easily especially at the early levels (where a large enemy type in a small stage often means certain demise).

It boils down to attack, counter, dodge, and special move.\n\nUnlocking new cards that are part of a series (Blood Auction, any of the Wildcard DLC, etc) can be tedious due to the luck involved.\n\nUnlimited Mode is fun but it's just about score in the end. You can only "win" the game in Story Mode\n\nWith the new free DLC, a challenging late game boss can appear early on in Unlimited Mode when monster difficulty is supposed to be low.

It incorporates elements of cards games, rpg games, and action style games and tries to wield them all together.  It shouldn't work, but somehow it does, creating something refreshingly different.\n\nThe core of the games main story mode is that you pick a boss to go after (although you must beat each to go on to the next one) the assemble a deck of story cards and one of equipment.  The story cards are then mixed together with new cards by the mysterious Dealer and laid out to form a map.  As you move your character onto a story card, it flips over, usually resulting in a choose your own adventure style encounter, although there are also straight up combats and stores to discover.  Any equipment you find is usually drawn from your equipment deck, so what cards you put in that can be important as are what encounters you added into the mix. Some encounter cards come with tokens you can earn by achieving something during the encounter.\n\nWIn or lose, once your run is over, any tokens you've earned unlock new eqiupment and encounter cards.  It is no coincidence that some of the most useful cards are rewards for some of the most risky encounters, so going safe is not always good for the long run.\n\nCombat is handled with a battle system nearly identical to the Batman Arkham games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeceasedCrab/recommended/266510/","DeceasedCrab","Deceased Crab","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeceasedCrab/","162 products in account","There's a lot of content in this game. There are tons of items and events to unlock, and there's a lot of good combat. I sank over 41 hours into this game, and most of that was probably grinding for trying to unlock specific cards. But it suffers from a couple serious design flaws.\n\nI appreciate the giant random element in the game, but when the difficulty ramps up about 7 bosses in, it makes a very large difficulty spike. Some of the dungeon curse combinations are punishingly difficult.\n\nThere are cards which are close to impossible to beat unless you beat them early enough in the game. These can include Devil's Wager and The River.\n\nToo many of the encounters require you to either have  a ridiculous amount of gold or food, or require you to do a lengthy quest chain to unlock new cards. The random chance issues in some of these later encounters can make them ridiculously difficult to complete.\n\nBy the end of the game, pain cards can aggregate to the point where you get insta-killed from max HP if you have enough curses. It happens.\n\nDo not ever quit the game in the middle of a run. Normally it will save your spot, but if the developers decide to patch the game, it can delete any in-progress runs you have going. The code to prevent that is simply to hard for them to implement, due to poor design choices. Just don't leave runs in-progress, as the developers should not be trusted.\n\nThe dealer is usually funny, tends to get annoying when he runs out of new things to say and just repeats himself over and over. There were also issues with prejudiced and thoughtless dialogue of his which have since been patched out.\n\nThe DLC isn't all that expensive, and it unlocks character classes for your protagonist, each which has its own quest chain, but each class has its own benefits and drawbacks. Some of the classes are ridiculously overpowered in certain fields, which kind of makes the DLC "pay to win".\n\nThe graphics and controls are okay, usually. A couple of glitches here and there, and sometimes the controller seems unresponsive until a couple seconds after a battle has begun. That's no good.\n\nThe developers have an unfortunate habit of "rebalancing" cards, moving around their place in the unlock system or difficulty levels they show up on, and completely changing the way the later dungeons work, and not for the better. This is the sort of negative developer behavior that similarly plagued Dark Souls II.\n\nThe overall experience is marred by a couple of bad design choices.","August 17, 2015","false","41.2"," 26 of 53 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","26","53","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Super_Pirate/recommended/266510/","Super_Pirate","Super Pirate the LAST-GINEER","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Super_Pirate/","395 products in account","I'm going to begin by saying that this review was written after playing the first level beyond the tutorial, so I might not have a full handle of the games nuances.\n\nFirst and foremost, this is a deck-building game. The cards are not just a creative way to stylize the game, they are the source of your equipment and your challenges. Before each level you assemble two sets of cards. Your equipment deck, and your encounter deck. Now, you don't start with any of these cards, these are the cards that are going to be on the board for you to gather or miss depending on chance. The Equipment is your assortment of weapons, armor, and special abilities. And the Encounter deck is your encounters in the level (duh), of scaling severity. From the farmer, to the goblins, to the hall of traps, to the ambush. While these can hurt you, they can just as easily reward you. At the end of the hall of traps, is treasure. At the end of the ambush, loot. This brings us to the core gameplay\n\nAfter building your decks, you begin the game, where cards are shuffled and laid face down on the table in random assortment. This acts like a board to a tabletop game, where you can only move one space (or card) at a time, and each card is an encounter. And just because you built an encounter deck doesnt mean that's all you'll face, The Dealer (or Game Master) peppers his own cards in there as well. The encounters for me so far have either been text blocks with multiple choice answers, or action phases where you navigate hazards or fight enemies.\n\nThe combat reminds me of the Batman: Arkham series. While not reliant so heavily on combos, there is an assortment of enemy types and a dodge and counter system that is very similar, if not identical. Special abilites are earned through cards and do things like generate gold on hit or throw a fan of knives.\n\nAfter winning encounters and navigating the board, you make your way to the boss, which, after the battle, you collect the tokens you've earned up to that point. These work as booster packs for your deck, giving you random equipment and encounter cards, which can be used for the levels ahead. New cards however, remain somewhat of a mystery, because while you have the name of the card like say, Scavanger's Helm, you don't know exactly what it does until you aquire during a level. (probably something involving loot)\n\nDeath is going to be common, but, much like the game Rogue Legacy, death isn't the end. It's a chance to do better next time, with the new cards you've earned from tokens during the round, and a new assortment of cards that might be more (or less) favorable to you.\n\nDuring the game, The Dealer will taunt you and will make comments on the cards you draw. It can really draw you into the game and give the immersion that you're really in a card duel with a (slightly overdramatic) snarky wizard, trying to beat him at (literally) his own game.\n\nOverall, This game has my complete approval. Being a very creative and well exicuted concept I would love to see more of it.","February 22, 2015","true","3.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

When an adventure starts, you and the dealer both have a deck each (you have the chance to build your deck before you start your adventure), and The Dealer builds a board in front of you with his cards, of which you move your board piece around. Sometimes the board is linear, sometimes you have a choice of which path you want to follow.\n\nYou land on one card per turn - each card either has a scenario for you to complete, or an encounter with some bad guys (Bandits, Lizards, Skeletons etc.). Each scenario or encounter may give you the chance to win some Gold (required to buy stuff at the shop), Food (every time you move your piece, you consume food, which you don't want to run out of), an item out of your chosen armoury cards (sword, mace, hammer etc.) or some other item (gauntlets, helmet etc.).\n\nEffectively, how the cards are dealt onto the board will shape how your adventure will go and how tough it will be. Example, on the first move you could land on a card which has "The Maiden" scenario, which could give you extra food or gold, or increase your max health. And then you could move onto another very generous scenario which will give you a new sword. Or the total opposite could happen - you could end up fighting 4 bad guys, only to be then dealt another monster card which will give you 4 more bad guys to fight, all on the first card.\n\nThe combat system is very good too - the only game I can compare the combat to which I've played is the Batman Arkham Series. It's very smooth, controls are simple to use and provides enough of a challenge to make you want to do it over and over. It can also get very hectic, but in a good way.\n\nOutside of story mode there is also endless mode, which I only just started playing last night. You start of as you always do, but you just try to get as far as you can before you are killed - think of it as just one big endless adventure.\n\nThe game sets the mood so perfectly - The Dealers voice and narration is fantastic, the graphics are very good and the music is by one Jeff Van Dyck, who, if you've played the Total War series, you'll be very familiar with.\n\nThe game is a great combination of luck and skill. If the cards play against you, then you are going to have a very hard game, sometimes impossible. That's just how some adventures work out - you get beaten, you start again. I have only two issues with Hand of Fate - one is the fixed camera in the combat scenes. They can be an issue on larger arenas, I keep wanting Right Stick to move the camera but it doesn't. Very frustrating. The other is, on the board, I wish there was more choice on which card to choose next. Sometimes it's very linear, only one card to choose from next. It would be nice to see perhaps a round where you are given 3 rows of 5 cards, and you choose your own path.\n\nBut like Chaos Reborn, if luck isn't on your side then you have to up your skill, and that will put many people off. If you are one of those people then please do not buy this. However, for others who don't mind luck influencing how the game plays out for you, then I highly recommend this.","June 22, 2015","true","14.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Theres a common notion that roguelike = perma-death.  And while Hand of Fate is merciless in this regard, the defining characteristic of a roguelike is randomness and replayability; a variable experience in every new game.  It is ironic that Defiant would choose to name this title Hand of "Fate" as there is limited variability in the "Hand" your dealt, at least in the first several levels I've played.  The game bills itself as a deckbuilder, indicating a level of tactical cunning is required to defeat the game.  In my time with the game, the key to victory seems to have nothing to do with cards or fate, but your ability to succeed in the action phase of the game.  More of a button mashing twitchfest than the card game I was hoping for, Hand of Fate would be best played with a console remote, feeling more like a God of War inspired beater than a Deckbuilder.  Being a early access title, the game is lacking any upfront system options, but atleast you can access them by holding shift when launching the game.  The voice acting and graphics are excellent, so hopefully Defiant will continue to enhance the core game to match the potential of the AV experience.","November 16, 2014","true","2.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

STACKING PENALTIES, MULTIPLE BOSSES AT THE SAME TIME AND DECK-STACKING ARE ALWAYS AGAINST YOU***\n\n\nAn excellent mash-up of deck building, card-progression/upgrades through success, and timing-based combat. You find yourself in a Plutonian hall before the Dealer, the Game Master of a card game that reflects your life and memories. Will you donate blood to a vampire? Save a maiden while you are severely outnumbered? Break open sand-buried tombs for a chance at treasure or curses? It was your life, what memories of yours do the cards hold?\n\nThis rogue-like combines card game with random chance, mini-games with careful preparation, and mystery with thirsty curiosity.\n\nYou WILL be tested.\nYou WILL smash your keyboard at the unfairness of the decks and bosses.\nYou WILL face those bosses again, as they are added to the chance encounter deck as soon as they are beaten...\n\n...and you will come back for more. Again and again you will be rebuffed, and again and again you will come crawling back to unlock more powerful cards, win at games of chance and squeeze all the efficiency out of your food (movement) and gold (money) as you can.\n\nThirteen Challenges await. The further you progress the smaller the arenas get, the tougher and more numerous the enemies get, and the more unfair the Dealer stacks the deck against you. What's your threshold for pain?\n\n\nI hope it's high. This game is gorgeous in it's own mystery and difficulty.","October 23, 2015","true","14.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The idea of an adventure which depends on the card which you are dealt by the well designed shady dealer is fantastically executed. You have just enough control over the situiation with the deck you construct but can still be surprised by the dealer. On top of that there is tons of DLC which the developers released for free , which is a commendable gesture to the early backers.

Bought in the Bumble Bundle and got a foil card drop from it so it essentially cost me nothing! I'm really enjoying it so would recommend.\n\nPros:\n\nI like the fact that at the end of each chapter the game will re-build your deck for you with the optimium cards. For those that don't particularly want to build their own decks it means they don't get left behind.\n\nFor the pick a card shuffle rounds I really like the fact that you can actually follow the cards - I've played too many games where it's just randomised but here it's pretty simple to pay attention!\n\nCons: The direction keys aren't too fantastic, I find that I need to let go completely to move in a new direction as I get stuck, it doesn't flow so well but it's not that big a deal as it isn't enough of a handicap to get you killed.\n\nTip: Don't even bother trying to remove the curses, it's not worth the gold. Good weapons and lots of food is far more valuable. From the strange looking maiden I always go for blessings, you generally get something pretty decent and long lasting - there are plenty of other places to get gold, food and life.","November 15, 2014","true","2.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You want a better one, you have to earn it; you can only find/buy equipment whose cards are in play so as you unlock new cards, you get to influence the type of gear you can find, and also to some extent what can happen to you.\n\nAs of now, the beta (early access) looks and plays nice--apart from the occasional out-of-sync sound effects, everything looks and feels very much worth the $$$. It will be interesting to see if it has any replay value though.\n\nDid I mention that it runs on Linux, and flawlessly at that?\n\nOne thing though: Multiplayer.

It's a cross between Talisman (the board game), Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, and Diablo, and it integrates all of those into a consistently fun whole. I have found myself willing to fight a hard battle before the boss (even knowing I will die at the boss if I do) because I will get a card to add to my deck. The decisions create tension.\n\nEven the luck elements - of which there are many - feel different than a die roll because you get to choose. Yes, it's still the exact same amount of randomness, but it somehow feels like "If I had only chose that one...I was going to choose that one..."\n\nThe negatives:\n\n1) Luck can be a harsh mistress\n2) On my very middle-of-the-road system, the frame rate drops on complex battles to where it's almost a guaranteed fail\n3) I had to go get a controller - the mouse and keyboard were just too clunky\n\nThe positives:\n1) The dungeon master's voice. I usually get annoyed by voice acting, but this is masterful.\n2) In story mode, even though it's roguey, it still feels like a story\n3) Fantastic mash-up of different types of gameplay - the ability to pick the encounters I'm going to face and the range of equipment I'll have access to is brilliant.\n4) The arkham-style combat is fun, and as frustrating as it is to have goblins steal your shield (which makes counters and blocks unavailable), it emphasizes that these are not just multiple game modes strung together, but multiple facets of a single experience.\n\nEven though I've died a lot, I have almost always earned something, and I've always wanted to continue.

And I hope this review will help to support this game.\n\nThis game is what i would call a story telling rogue-like/lite adventure rpg card game with the Arkham Style fighting system. Seem like alot to put into game but it works well.\n\nIn this game you must traverse the card layed out by the card dealer. The cards are semi- randomised but, I'll go into more detail later. You click on the card adjacent to where you current position is and then experience the story behind that card which results in either a fight, a choice, a lucky dip or any combination of the three. Then eventually reach the end of the level.\n\nCombat\nThe combat in the game seems to be solid for the most part. The way you fight is simillar if not the same to Batman games style of combat. You move with "wasd", "space bar" to roll/dodge,"q" to counter, "left click" to attack and "right click" to stun. There are also ranged units which can be blocked by your shield. Unless they have a rifle in which case you have to dodge. With as much as I have played so far, the combat seems to be solid, it's not as smooth as it could be and seems a bit jittery, but nothing too extreme. There are also ranged units which can be blocked by your shield. Unless they have a rifle in which case you have to dodge. I have had no problems with the combat so far.\n\nBosses\nThe bosses seem to have a bit of variation. Their mechanics are different depending on their species and the amount and way they attack differ from one to another. There are 12 bosses and so far i have beaten 3, fought 4 as of initially typing this. I have yet to face the later on bosses so unfortunetly I have no experience against them to share as of yet. But, you can still tell when you are in a boss fight and you feel satisfyed to win against them.\n\nEnemies\nThere are 4 mains enemies you face against, Dust - Bandits, Skull - Skellingtons, Lizard and another which i have yet to encounter. They each are weak to a diffent thing which makes you fights easier or harder depending on the elements of your gear. There are other enemies such as golbins and rats which you face against from their specific event but they all got their own gimic to. Rats will leave a poisonous cloud, goblins will steal your items and won't fight back but will instead try to escaps, so on, so forth.\n\nCards\nI huge mechanic in this game is the cards. The cards you get in the events you play depend upon the cards you use to build your deck. You get two decks, equipment and events. You unlock more cards through completing events. The cards you unlock are set so it's not all randomised. However, the cards dealer throughs in a couple of his own cards to teach you more mechanics about the game such as enemy types and to prevent you from picking cards which give you a load of free stuff.\n\nDifficulty\nWhen you start off the game, it start off at a beginers pace, to allow you to get use to the controls. It then steadily escilates in difficulty so you are more reliant on your skill and cards you pick. I personally think that the game scales well in difficulty, but you also affect it by the cards you choose. Exsample - If you choose all fights cards, then you could get good loots, but at the same time loose alot of health. If you choose alot of simple equip events, then you will be stuck with low level stuff against the boss. Finding balance is crucial.\n\nMy Opinion\nI personally think this game is well made. It plays quite well and the combination and implementation of all the mechanics are great. I would recomend this to people who enjoy rogue-like and/or RPG games with similar combat systems. Regardless of the fact that this game is in early acess at the time of this review, I think if it was released how it is, it would be well worth the price.\n\nI would give this game a 8/10 - If you wanna find gameplay of this game, looks at Jessie Cox's Video for fan friday.\n\nI haven't played the endless game mode yet so i can not say how good it is, but regardless, it is well worth the price and a ton of fun.\n\nI hope this review helps and this is my first review so sorry for any mistakes. This is my opinion of the game, I am not a critic but i decided to write this as i saw there were no reviews. I hope this helps!","November 1, 2014","true","17.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Rats will leave a poisonous cloud, goblins will steal your items and won't fight back but will instead try to escaps, so on, so forth.\n\nCards\nI huge mechanic in this game is the cards. The cards you get in the events you play depend upon the cards you use to build your deck. You get two decks, equipment and events. You unlock more cards through completing events. The cards you unlock are set so it's not all randomised. However, the cards dealer throughs in a couple of his own cards to teach you more mechanics about the game such as enemy types and to prevent you from picking cards which give you a load of free stuff.\n\nDifficulty\nWhen you start off the game, it start off at a beginers pace, to allow you to get use to the controls. It then steadily escilates in difficulty so you are more reliant on your skill and cards you pick. I personally think that the game scales well in difficulty, but you also affect it by the cards you choose. Exsample - If you choose all fights cards, then you could get good loots, but at the same time loose alot of health. If you choose alot of simple equip events, then you will be stuck with low level stuff against the boss. Finding balance is crucial.\n\nMy Opinion\nI personally think this game is well made. It plays quite well and the combination and implementation of all the mechanics are great. I would recomend this to people who enjoy rogue-like and/or RPG games with similar combat systems. Regardless of the fact that this game is in early acess at the time of this review, I think if it was released how it is, it would be well worth the price.\n\nI would give this game a 8/10 - If you wanna find gameplay of this game, looks at Jessie Cox's Video for fan friday.\n\nI haven't played the endless game mode yet so i can not say how good it is, but regardless, it is well worth the price and a ton of fun.\n\nI hope this review helps and this is my first review so sorry for any mistakes. This is my opinion of the game, I am not a critic but i decided to write this as i saw there were no reviews. I hope this helps!","November 1, 2014","true","17.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Even with graphics quality set to "Fastest" I was having hiccups in framerate and enough input lag to make the game nearly unplayable. I imagine this is something that will eventually get worked out. This is an early early build.

But the review..\n\nThe Good:\n\nAddicting game play, obviously I mean who doesn't like card games and rpgs and dungeon crawlers and blah blah blah you get up grades that do different things and they do them well.\n\nThe gear assortment is pretty neat, lots of different piece of gear that have little thing here and there like extra life if you heal or a sword that can shoot frost all at the touch of a button.\n\nThe random encounters are also really cool from the Elf Maiden to the Priest or perhaps A fallen hero, lots of different encounters with rewards.\n\nthere is a lot more but I have just scratched the surface.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nNot really BAD but kinda annoying so be ready but some random encounters are BAD like falling rocks... damn rocks I mean you would figure the guy could dodge a falling rock but NOPE! you get 1 chance to succeed in this actiong to avoid the falling rocks and if you don't it hurts... A LOT.\n\nFOOD!!!! for the love of everything everywhere bring FOOD! if you have a chance to get food some where TAKE IT omfg if you run out you are now running on Health until you die, try fighting a boss with 14 health I had to change my underwear.\n\nOn the subject of random encounter some of them have pretty bad optins as far as how much you can succeed like 1 success and three failure or even one Huge failure, it makes the game interesting but still fresh into the game it can hurt a lot.\n\nDifficulty ramps up pretty quick.. once you get past the first gate things become more dangerous and you can die.. like dieing in a trap maze to a bush -.- yeah there is a defining moment for you you died to a damn bush a BUSH! ANY WAY...\n\nAll in all this is a GREAT game and I am REALLY REALLY glad I got it, I hope the game take off and adds more content because wow... I love it and I have like maybe a few hours at the time of writing this.  So if you have any doubts DON'T this is worth the money 100%.. now excuess me I have a bush to go take care of... giggity!.

Now that the time is finally here, I'll try to break down what makes this game such a gem.\n\nThe premise of the game is simple; you, the player, are in a tabletop game against some random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wizard called The Dealer. That may seem harsh, but, trust me, you'll hate this guy by the time you finish story mode. He's a card sharp and a cheat, and he quite shamelessly weights the deck against you at every turn. This becomes particularly apparent towards the endgame, where you can die on the first board due to the insane limitations he can put on you in terms of both combat and curses. That doesn't make him a bad character, however. The Dealer is quite effective as an antagonist, and his growing desperation as you (whom he implies to be a meathead jock adventurer) mow down his court is somewhat reminiscent of a DM growing exasperated with a party that refuses to die.\n\nThe nature of the game is a Shoggoth monstrosity that can shift its genre at will between choose-your-own-adventure, Arkham-style brawling, tabletop RPG, and roguelike. To be honest, I could spend hours trying (and failing) to describe it in any decent fashion. Watch a video of it. Jim Sterling's Squirty Play is a good one; it's the release version, and you get to see the reaction of someone who: a) has had no exposure to it, and b) was expecting something very different.\n\nBasically, what makes this game great isn't really the gameplay; the individual parts of it are rather bland. By itself, the combat would be mindlessly dull. By itself, the board game would be ridiculously unfair. By himself, the Dealer would still be a jerk. It's the smooth integration of all the facets of this game that make it such an amazing catch. I'm not sure it will ever be considered a "great" (although one can hope), but it certainly has all the markings of a cult classic.\n\nPros:\n+Very simple and effective gameplay\n+Good voice acting (although it IS only the one voice)\n+Lack of backstory allows the player's imagination to do its thing\n+Although the individual sections of gameplay aren't unique, the combination certainly is\n+Will shamelessly kill you without truly punishing you\n+Doesn't interrupt gameplay; even on death, you can immediately jump back in\n+Endless mode is pretty entertaining\n+No ♥♥♥♥♥♥ crafting systems\n\nCons:\n-Combat can be a tad wonky\n-The optimization is quite iffy; it will tank your CPU for no apparent reason sometimes. Seems to occur more prominently later in the game. This'll probably be fixed (and it's ALOT better than it used to be), but it should be noted.\n\nNiggles:\n~It feels like some of the event triggers are a tad insane, particularly the ones with multiple RNG draws. I still haven't completed the River encounter.\n~You can wind up in positions that can break the game in your favor; I've had more than 1k health at one point due to a bit of RNG luck after finding the Ring of Poverty.\n~Flame golems are ridiculous. They take a lot of hurtin' and they dish out even more. When they show up in multi-monster encounters, it usually means a wipe.\n~The Dealer is an incorrigible cheat. No really, he's a prick.\n\nI'd give it a hearty thumbs up. Buy it.","February 24, 2015","true","35.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Most of the game play is very good. Not much in the way of tutorials, so mistakes in the early game are bound to be made and those can be costly; such as cant go back thru doors, stairs, etc... Deck building isn't explained either, so you will need to go to outside sources for the basics. The combat controls are slow to respond, such that if an enemy gets a hit on you, you will get one or two more as your dodge will not be recognized. So with heavy doubts I am recommending this game, but with great caveats.","March 1, 2015","true","2.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Very glad I did, this game is really good.\n\nIt's a deck builder - a card game where you gain more, better cards to add to your deck as you progress through the game.  You sit at a table facing a hooded mage who controls the cards and narrated the story.  The voice acting is very good and once you have drawn the same card a couple of times the narration for that card is muted so you don't end up running through the same dialoque game after game.  It's kind of like playing a single player RPG with the mage as DM expanding the story around the cards drawn.  The voice (and the image of the DM to a degree) put me in mind of John Hurt which is cool.\n\nThe DM deals out a number of cards in a pattern depicting the path (or paths) you have to travel before meeting the final enemy.  You can choose which way to go by which cards you turn over on the path (although some are straight so no choice) and you can be lucky and find the exit to the next level quickly meaning you can skip forward but possibly miss out on finding a shop or other useful encounter.  I prefer to take my chances of drawing a bad encounter for the benefits of potentially better equipment/more cards.\n\nThe decks consist of armour, weapons, enchantments and food as well as enounters both good and bad.  Some enounters involve a test of luck where you have to choose a 'success' card from a selection of four cards.  These are displayed before being shuffled so there is a chance you can follow the best card before they are dealt face down.  Winning encounters let you draw cards from your deck giving you the chance to upgrade your armour, weapons or giving you more food (needed to heal)\n\nIt's not just a static card game however.  The battles are actually played out as a third person skirmish with you controlling your character fighting, blocking and using any special abilities granted by your equipment.  This is the part that really marks the game out as different and deepens your sense of involvement - you're not just sat at a table playing cards, you are truly part of the story which is unfolding.\n\nCompleting the final enemy grants you additional cards for your deck and every fourth quest grants you an item from the DM levelling up both your character and the enemies you will face.\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with deckbuilding or just want to progress to the next game quickly, at the start of each quest you have the option of using a recommended deck based on y0our cards.  If you wish, you can then go in and edit the deck to your satisfaction although newly gained cards will not reveal their effects until they have been played.\n\nThere is the skill of choosing which cards you own will be best suited to the upcoming quest.  This gets more important the further you progress and the more cards you have.\n\nOverall, a very enjoyable and quite relaxing game, definitely worth the money.","April 19, 2015","true","30.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Atmospheric. Pick up and play.\nIf you've ever wondered what it would be like to play a card game against a mysterious wizard, then this is the game for you. Just by sitting at a table to play cards against this man, the game does a wonderful job at world building. It creates the impression you're in some sort of Arabian Nights tale, or perhaps one of the Call of Cthulhu back stories. Either way, I was quickly sucked in.\n\nAll the card game's rules are handled by your wizard friend, who is both your opponent and your friendly dealer. The learning process for this game was quick. The tutorial is a natural part of the game and a natural part of story progression, which I thought was well done.\n\n\n+ The Game Itself\nThe wizard lays out a series of face down cards connected like a road. Your little chess hero starts at one end and has to jump from one card to the next to reach the Big Bad at the other end. Each card you land on is turned over and will result in a random event. Sometimes it will mean combat (that will take you into 3rd person combat mode) but many other times it will be games of chance, or decision making that may affect you later, or risky opportunities. In the end, you reach the Big Bad, enter combat and fight to the death. Victory means you win new cards to add to your deck and a chance to play again to fight a new Big Bad. Defeat means the wizard reshuffles and deals again. You keep your victories over the previous Big Bads though.\n\n\n+ Combat\nFighting is all about building up hit streaks and finding a rhythm. Mouse and keyboard controls are slightly\n'janky' but not bad enough to get in the way or make you lose a fight. There are many cards that enhance the things you can do in combat - they add weapons, equipment, spells, and so on. The combat mechanics are simple and could be improved, but the simplicity of the combat is also what allows this game to be a "pick up and play" type of game. I like the starting animation when your hero enters combat and puts on his gear, it's clever and it's an excellent in-game way to remind the player what cards he or she might be able to use in combat.\n\n\n+ Card Collecting\nEach time I won a game I unlocked new cards which I could add to my deck and play in the next game. The cards I unlocked were random, but also related to my wins and losses to the little battles and tests of luck against the wizard during the game. It made me feel like I had earned them.\n\n\n+ Deck Building\nIf you know that the next card game is going to focus heavily on undead, for example, then you may want to tailor your deck in that direction. The deck builder is straightforward, but if you don't want to bother building a deck, the game will build it for you and it does a good job. I never unlocked too many cards per game, so I never felt swamped, so I always made my own deck. Just to add some spice, the game hid the precise details of new cards until I landed on them in a game, so if I added them to my deck it was a gamble, but a necessary one.\n\n\n+ Random Events\nThese cards are the bulk of the game and they are what make it so much fun. They are surpisingly varied, and you can even encounter the same card you've seen before and get a totally different experience from it. These cards, coupled with the dialogue from the Wizard, who was talking directly to me, made the game feel personal and turned every victory or loss from these cards into a fun wager.\n\n\n+ Lore & Atmosphere\nThere is some lore surrounding the Big Bads and there's some lore present in the description of the various characters you meet while travelling, but overall it is light. All the atmospheric strength and character of this game emanates from three places: The first is the wizard and his desk. His hands and his eyes are expressive, I just dig him. The second is the Wizard's voice. I found him wry and sarcastic at times but also dark when he needed to be. And the third place is the deck of cards. I thought the art on the cards was well done and perfectly suited to this type of game.\n\n\n+ Game Time\nA single game might be 15 to 30 minutes. So it's perfect for that moment of downtime. I'd say that during that harder difficulties you're more likely to spend 30 minutes on a game than 15, because you'll try different strategies or try for more cards, or get more combat. It just depends on your luck. Except for combat, the game runs at your pace.\n\n\n+ Other Thoughts\n- This is a game for someone who values their time, enjoys Call of Cthulhu, M:TG (3rd Ed, Ice Age, or Tempest), watching tv and playing a computer game at the same time because they don't really want to concentrate, and graphic novels.\n- It's probably best with a controller, good with a keyboard and mouse, definitely not with a trackpad.\n- Works on low-ish settings on my Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro.\n\n\n\nI hope you got something from this review. I'm currently developing my own game called Heroes of the Antarctic[thinkpadius.com] which is an exploration roguelike set in the Antarctic during the early 1900s. Check it out if it interests you.","June 22, 2015","true","4.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Highly addictive game where you assemble a deck of cards on what you might encounter for equipment or encounters with the stranger you are playing against has his own cards to throw against you. From there the cards you pick for encounters are put out in a path for each section where sometimes you have a choice & others it's a straight path.\n\nSometimes it's more of a 3rd person adventure style of combat against different opponents, other times with the encounters, you are given cards that have various success & failure, take your pick & your gains or losses will sometimes unlock new cards adding to the addictive nature of the game. Blessings & curses are random later on to make things quite a challenge as you gain new tactics to use or avoid to help you on your quest. From the unlocked cards, you can go back to battle old bosses with the added challenge of taking new cards in to make a familiar encounter completely new depending on the cards you get from what you picked.

Atmospheric. Pick up and play.\nIf you've ever wondered what it would be like to play a card game against a mysterious wizard, then this is the game for you. Just by sitting at a table to play cards against this man, the game does a wonderful job at world building. It creates the impression you're in some sort of Arabian Nights tale, or perhaps one of the Call of Cthulhu back stories. Either way, I was quickly sucked in.\n\nAll the card game's rules are handled by your wizard friend, who is both your opponent and your friendly dealer. The learning process for this game was quick. The tutorial is a natural part of the game and a natural part of story progression, which I thought was well done.\n\n\n+ The Game Itself\nThe wizard lays out a series of face down cards connected like a road. Your little chess hero starts at one end and has to jump from one card to the next to reach the Big Bad at the other end. Each card you land on is turned over and will result in a random event. Sometimes it will mean combat (that will take you into 3rd person combat mode) but many other times it will be games of chance, or decision making that may affect you later, or risky opportunities. In the end, you reach the Big Bad, enter combat and fight to the death. Victory means you win new cards to add to your deck and a chance to play again to fight a new Big Bad. Defeat means the wizard reshuffles and deals again. You keep your victories over the previous Big Bads though.\n\n\n+ Combat\nFighting is all about building up hit streaks and finding a rhythm. Mouse and keyboard controls are slightly\n'janky' but not bad enough to get in the way or make you lose a fight. There are many cards that enhance the things you can do in combat - they add weapons, equipment, spells, and so on. The combat mechanics are simple and could be improved, but the simplicity of the combat is also what allows this game to be a "pick up and play" type of game. I like the starting animation when your hero enters combat and puts on his gear, it's clever and it's an excellent in-game way to remind the player what cards he or she might be able to use in combat.\n\n\n+ Card Collecting\nEach time I won a game I unlocked new cards which I could add to my deck and play in the next game. The cards I unlocked were random, but also related to my wins and losses to the little battles and tests of luck against the wizard during the game. It made me feel like I had earned them.\n\n\n+ Deck Building\nIf you know that the next card game is going to focus heavily on undead, for example, then you may want to tailor your deck in that direction. The deck builder is straightforward, but if you don't want to bother building a deck, the game will build it for you and it does a good job. I never unlocked too many cards per game, so I never felt swamped, so I always made my own deck. Just to add some spice, the game hid the precise details of new cards until I landed on them in a game, so if I added them to my deck it was a gamble, but a necessary one.\n\n\n+ Random Events\nThese cards are the bulk of the game and they are what make it so much fun. They are surpisingly varied, and you can even encounter the same card you've seen before and get a totally different experience from it. These cards, coupled with the dialogue from the Wizard, who was talking directly to me, made the game feel personal and turned every victory or loss from these cards into a fun wager.\n\n\n+ Lore & Atmosphere\nThere is some lore surrounding the Big Bads and there's some lore present in the description of the various characters you meet while travelling, but overall it is light. All the atmospheric strength and character of this game emanates from three places: The first is the wizard and his desk. His hands and his eyes are expressive, I just dig him. The second is the Wizard's voice. I found him wry and sarcastic at times but also dark when he needed to be. And the third place is the deck of cards. I thought the art on the cards was well done and perfectly suited to this type of game.\n\n\n+ Game Time\nA single game might be 15 to 30 minutes. So it's perfect for that moment of downtime.

Perhaps not entirely in the best way, but it suits the theme very well.\n\nHand of Fate is all about maneuvering a playing board made up with cards and going through the dangers that lie within. As you complete these challenges, you'll gain additional cards which will unlock additional treasures and additional challenges. Interestingly enough, the game remains very challenging to slightly unfair levels as time goes on. From the beginning, the first three bosses are simple and you'd be forgiven if you think Hand of Fate is an easy game. Not long afterwards more elements are introduced and older cards/challenges get refreshed to be harder so you can't as easily fall back on them for easy rewards. By the end of the game you're scrabbling for every advantage you can get and if you don't spend your time completing these challenges you're going to be absolutely decimated.\n\nBut that ends up being one of the game's major weaknesses. While the game is pretty damn strategic and has you fighting a whole lot of different elements in your quest for ultimate ambigious glory (which is told through an interesting way having the various cards represent your character's various memories and experiences), there's a heavy amount of luck involved as well. Especially late game. Smart players will start spotting good cards to stack their deck with, but there are many moments where the game just decides that you aren't going to win and pits you against a boss who makes all enemies of his faction invincible and another that attacks you relentlessly in a very small area. Meaning that if you're fortunate enough to get 200 health - somehow - you can still end up ♥♥♥♥ed by luck so hard that it'll make your head spin. Throw in a slightly slippery control scheme, enemies who love to dog pile on you, various traps that are at times hard to see or avoid (see the control scheme issue), and your victory ends up having a whole lot of luck involved. And one loss can put you back quite a way which means a lot towards the end game.\n\nThat said, from start to finish (though I'm very close to finish now, not quite there yet), Hand of Fate is very well set up and excells at telling a story that's all about the adventure. A neverending adventure really. And a whole lot of insanity that occurs along the way. Plus it's just fun, when it isn't deciding that you're not going to have fun.","November 5, 2015","true","10.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/megakensei/recommended/266510/","megakensei","Kensei","http://steamcommunity.com/id/megakensei/","147 products in account","This is a very unique game and I recommend you play it. However be aware of the fact that it does have a few issues, despite being late after release.\n\nFor starters some cards don't trigger properly, and you might have to guess the solution yourself. For example a card may require you to pay 5 gold, but the option would be grayed out no matter how much you have. On the other hand, if you have 0 gold, you can pay the price and it will be deducted from 0.\n\nPoor card trigger code aside, another issue with the game is the camera. At later levels you will absolutely curse it when traversing traps. What happens is that instead of maintaining a top-down angle, camera is scripted to do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ it wants and provide you with a more "cinematic" viewing, even though you know, you're trying not to get stabbed, shot, impaled, skewered, crushed and barbequed.\n\nAlso be aware of the somewhat poorly designed combat in the game. At later stages flaws become aparent, such as getting stuck between a turret and the boundary collider that prevents you from falling out of the arena. The dodge is not long enough to dodge certain attacks and traps, and not enough time is given for a second evade in order to avoid damage.\n\nStill, the game is interesting enough to play. The nagging issues prevent it from being a trully entertaining piece, mostly due to the frustration provided by an assinine camera logic and underdeveloped combat. You may have spent your last 3 hours running around, collecting gear and becomming overpowered, but all it takes is 1 level to screw you over in order to make you lose. This creates the feeling of a cheap loss, something mechanical, instead of punishment for a lack of foresight.\n\nDespite the dealer so often repeating how fair the rules are, they aren't entirely upheld when you are pitted against 5 lava giants in a cubicle sized arena that blow themselvs up just for giggles. Also the game deems it unfit to let you collect any gold you have lying around after combat. While a minor problem, it does force you keep someone alive in order to collect the bounties, however the lack of a health bar on enemies makes this task akin to playing the lottery.\n\nOther than that HoF provides an interesting perspecting on the roguelike genre and is definitely worth a buy at 50% discount. I recommend the full priced game only for hardcore players or TCG mega fans.","November 29, 2015","true","34.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I'm really liking this game a lot.\n\nIt is a "deck building" game, with a  great twist - the deck is used to generate an "adventure" for you to experience.  The cards are laid out (at random?) for you to go over, one by one.  Some cards will give you equipment or other aid, some will give you battles to fight.\n\nWhen you DO fight, it is action combat on a small battlefield.  Lots of mad clicking and pressing going on.  Great animations, the "slow down camera" for big hits and battle endings.  All that jazz.\n\nThe only CON I can say so far is that it is a little annoying sometimes in how the randomness affects things.  An example goes like this:   After a fight which you've one, it might say "one of the enemies is only faking his death" and offer you the choice - go back and get him, or leave him be.  It shows you 4 cards - 3 with success and 1 with failure.  It shuffles those and you pick one.  Lots of scenarios like that, and it seems to come up with the "bad" card way too often.\n\nThe game has many ways for you to alter the difficulty UP or DOWN, and from what I've seen so far, it will have a huge amount of replayability.\n\nI love it!\n","November 29, 2015","true","3.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Whaaat. Well, it's pretty ♥♥♥♥in' great. Very hard to nail down exactly how it plays, as you might imagine, but let's say it's a card-driven, sorta 80s/90s board game-styled, randomly generated action-adventure game... with combat strongly inspired by the Arkham batman titles. Recent patches and expansion content (some of it free!) have further built upon this very strong foundation by adding new cards of all types, and introducing entirely new difficulties and game modes.\n\nIf the images on the store page, and this recommendation, at all intrigue you, I'd strongly suggest taking the game for a spin. If by some unlikely chance you don't like it, there's always the refund option. But you won't need to because it's radical.","November 10, 2015","true","63.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It definitely isn't for everyone, but don't listen to the people who say it's all or heavily luck based, because it's not. A good strategy will win in the end (I reccomend building your own deck, not using their pre-built ones).\n\nIt has some minor glitches, so keep that in mind, but they release bug fixes periodically, which makes this okay.\n\nThis is a good game to pick up and play either casually, or to get immersed in for hours.","February 22, 2015","true","15.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There's the simple action fighting aspect (which I guess could be improved, but since it's secondary it's not a huge deal), and the DnD type aspect, and the Deck building part. It's such a unique and refreshing twist on everything. I feel like that will lend to so much replayability. The graphics are rather impressive too. For a game just abrely out of early access (apparently) it's really well done. I can't wait to see where they go from here.

The game features two modes; Story and Endless. This will mostly be focused on Story, as I've not played Endless yet.\n\nThe game is fairly simple; the dealer will lie down cards on the table and you will move your piece onto the cards. Sometimes, this is linear, but sometimes it isn't. Some cards will activate things like visiting a shop, encountering baddies to kill, traversing a maze or coming up against a situation where, of 4 cards, you must pick the "Success" card in order to win. You will have, at the bottom right, three "stats": your health, your food & your gold. Every move consumes 1 food, but you'll restore lost health. Gold is fairly self-explanatory.\n\nWhen you get an encounter card, you are placed onto a small plot of field where you will fight against monsters, ranging from goblins to skeletons, zombies and bandits. While variation is limited, it doesn't pull away from the experience. However, the fighting / combat is rather wonky; borrowing from the Arkham series, you will basically use WASD to move around and left click to attack. You cannot hard target a specific enemy, which can be a bit frustrating, but again, really doesn't affect the game greatly.\n\nSituation cards vary, from finding a weapon in a crevasse to saving someone from being swarmed by enemies. Successfully "winning" these situations nets you a token from the dealer. At the end, all of your accrued tokens are counted up and you are given specific rewards based on the tokens. For example, I was tasked with defeated a knight that had been overrun by some skeletons. Once I defeated them, he told me I could keep the mace I was given prior to the fight, as his kingdom was flush with them. Once I completed the level, his token rewarded me with 2 Mace cards.\n\nYou progress through the 'levels' by travsering through the cards, finding that particular level's 'end card' and moving onto the next level. At the end of the final level, you will fight a boss. Defeating the boss gives you more tokens, which unlock things like weapons, armor, encounters and other varying cards.\n\nOne of the coolest things this game offers is the Deck Builder. On one side, your deck has cards for Equipment; weapons and armor and trinkets. The other side are your encounters, from visiting shops to situations. If the card has a lock icon on it, that means it has a situation / encounter you've yet to face. Drawing & defeating that card will net you another token.\n\nLast but not least is the Dealer himself; an elderly mage who speaks to you throughout the game. His dialogue is superb and I found myself actively listening to what he had to say. The first level, I drew a card that had a goblin giving me a shield. The next level, I drew the card again and, in this very dry tone, he said "I think you purposefully put that card in there just to get an early shield." (or something to that effect) It's minor, but the fact he recognizes that made me smile.\n\nI know my hours played as of writing this is low (think it's barely 2 hours), but honestly - the game is immediately fun. The combat is a bit wonky, but everything else excels so well that I don't mind. It doesn't hurt that the game also looks really good & sounds pretty good, too. I can't wait to jump back into the game and have more fun with it. :)","February 23, 2015","true","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Once you've completed the encounters, there's really only a few variants in Endless mode that are somewhat interesting, but I don't think I'll be playing through them all, as they consist of encounters I've seen a million times.\n\nThe gameplay consists of a randomly dealt and organized map of cards which you traverse. When you complete encounter cards, you get tokens, which unlock new items, encounters, and more, which pertain to the cards defeated. The difficulty of these encounters ramps up very quickly and sometimes seem impossible with their ridiculous requirements, which bank almost soley on your luck in drawing the right encounters previously.\n\nThis is a huge problem, as a lot of the encounters rely on luck rather than skill. The bigger problem is, a lot of skill portions rely on how well your luck is at picking success cards in those encounters (if you can't play Four Card Monte and follow the Success cards, you will not enjoy this game). It took me a lot of grinding to finish a lot of the encounter cards, and as of right now, I still have not beaten the main Story mode, because you are restricted by the curses you are given when you enter a level, and the last boss has ridiculously overpowered curses that make the last level about luck rather than challenge.\n\nThe combat in this game is similar to the Batman Arkham games, which is cool, and very close to as smooth as those games. But the VERY limited enemy selection and TRUE boss battles (not just better versions of main enemies) makes this tedious over time. The selection of weapons gets bigger as you finish more encounters, but as you are given them randomly during play, a perfect loadout is left to chance, which is mostly ok, considering a perfect loadout would make you practically invincible, but not ok when you end up with nothing at the end of a dungeon because of a poorly placed random chance card.\n\nI purchased this game when it was on sale for 9.99, and I think at that price, it's worth it. If you are someone who enjoys a challenge, this is a very challenging game, but the challenge is mixed in with a fair amount of true unfairness, which I think sometimes is confused for challenge.\n\nJust know that this will be frustrating as all get-out.\n","January 10","true","33.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

During a sale or something.\n\nI think the game is pretty fun, but has a few flaws that keep it from beign significantly better.  I've never been really into Dungeons and Dragons, but I've always thought the concept was fun.  Basically, this takes some of the ideas of dungeon exploring from D&D and puts you in the place of the single player of the game, playing against the Dungeon Master.  As a genius add-on, rather than rolling dice to determine the outcome of enemy encounters, you enter a 3D action battle that plays very much like the Batman: Arkham series (which I really enjoyed).  Overall, great idea and production quality.\n\nOn the overall card/exploring portion of the game:\nThe idea is fun and I enjoy running into new cards and seeing the outcome and individual stories as they unfold over multiple playthroughs.   Each run plays similar to a rogue-like in that you play a ~20 minutes session where you start from scratch and progress through a dungeon, trying to become more powerful while maintaining your life, food and gold.  Here's where it takes a turn.\n\nI enjoy hard games.  But I like to have the difficult and whether I win or not depend on my skill, not luck.  The game has multiple difficulty settings, but I feel like it either needs more (preferred choice) or needs to balance them better.  I find normal mode to be incredibly easy, where hard mode is too hard.  I play a run on normal mode and come out with far more life and strength than I went in with, rarely even being hit by enemies, or play hard mode and only make it half-way through the run.  Well, get better!  This is part of it, but often times, as mentioned by other reviewers, you run into an unlucky location and  half of your max life, most of your food, etc...   I would say that combat is about 4x harder on hard mode than on normal mode because: 1. The enemies are stronger. 2. There are twice as many of them.  It would be nice to be able to balance the difficulty with a mode between normal and hard. Maybe where there are twice as many of them, but they aren't stronger.\n\nAll-in-all I think the dungeon portion of the game is fun, but can be frustrating when everything goes down the tube over the course of 3 steps.\n\nAs far as teh combat:\nI really enjoy  the combat style and feel that it complements the game well.  That being said, it could use quite a bit of polish.  After having played the first two Batman: Arkham games on hard mode and mastering the challenges, I feel that I am pretty good at the combat.  That carries over to some degree here.  The Batman games  (at least on hard mode) are heavily combo focused and require you to keep an eye on your enemies, the combo counter and plan your next move carefully.  Trying to attack an enemy that is down or trying to counter when an enemy has not begun an attack ruins your combo.  This is all the same in Hand of Fate BUT it is not nearly as clear what is happening.  When you finish an enemy on Batman, you hear a "Whoosh" sound.  You know he is down.  As crazy as it may get sometimes, you have all of the indicators to know exactly what is happening with each enemy on the battlefield at all times.  In Hand of Fate, collisions are often screwy, it can be hard to tell who is dead and who is not and counters seem to misfire fairly often.  It's pretty regular to attack an enemy you didn't mean to.  With the challenges of hard mode I would feel prepared to take it on if I had better control and awareness in battle.\n\nOverall, I think it is a fun game.  Take the great parts of the rogue-like genre, D&D and the Batman: Arkham games and combine them, but be aware of the significant issues that come along with this.","January 10","true","7.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The narrator is amusing, the graphics cartoonish in a lovely way that pops on the screen totally appropriate for a game that is within a game.\n\nThe basic conciet of the game though is pretty briulliant - the player is playing cards against the enigmatic narrator who is some sort of dyspeptic frog voiced oracle or wizard. He's fun enough and he has new quips for most new cards, but I could I can see a DLC with a different dealer being profoundly satisfying - say a urbane devil, petulant child or defeatist death.  The card came is itself an adventure, with the randomly selected (you can build the decks though - within certian limits) card laid down and most cards offering a garphic of a charming woodblock image, a paragraph and a choice.  most selections lead to a pick and choose mechnic where four cards representing degrees of success and failure are shuffled monty style and the player picks one.  Other cards lead to combat.  In general when the player is successful with a card they gain a token that's convereted to another card at the end of each game.  Thus as one plays more and more choices are added.  It's fun, and for an "unlock" method of providing content feels very natural.\n\nDespite that praise, I almost gave this gave a thumbs down because even now, long after release (and to the developers' credit the seem to keep adding cards and content) the game seems to suffer from technical issues.  It lags, it slows and it crashes with alarming regularity on my laptop - which while no gaming machine is well above the minimum specs.  This isn't a general set of errors, more a steady degradation of capability culminating in multi minute load times for combat sequences or simply sudden crashes in the combat engine.  Whatever the cause these errors, they make the game frustratingly unplayable - becauase I want to play it and it's a good game.\n\nI'm still giving it a positive rating here because when it does work (and sometimes it's fine) it's a very fun, very smart game.","January 7","true","13.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game does not do one of those things terribly well, my opinion, some may argue. What it does do well is make the whole situation work, all of these elements together, how random and unsyncable they may seem, come together to make a really interesting experience.\n\nI would compare hand of fate to a very simple table top game, munchkin perhaps. You get a map made up of cards, which are adventures, meetings, shops, curses, and eventually - an exit from the current map. Each game has a certain amount of maps, and then you get to the end, where instead of an exit, you get a boss. So far, the boss has been an upgraded version of one of the vanilla enemies, with a twist. The combat is boring at best, but this is coming from someone who has difficulty capped 2 souls games.\n\nHonestly, I give the game about a 8 right now with the boring combat. The narrative of each game makes up for it, I would really almost prefer a table top combat to the hack n' slash that they have. more strategic, maybe involve rolls - but that might ruin the balance they got going, so i dunno.\n\nOne thing it does need is a workshop for endless customizability.

Considering you spend 95% of your time interacting with him and listening to him, if he was in anyway written terribly, or voiced terribly, then it would kill the game for you because otherwise, all you had was some fun quests and mediocre Arkham combat.\n\nThankfully, the Dealer is engaging, hardly ever repeats his lines, and even then, his delivery is so snarky and full of personality and flavor, you don't mind occasionally hearing the same line again. He will have up to 3, perhaps even more, different lines for the same card, or same kind of card (like the Helpful Priest line of cards, where he shows his disdain of the clergy).\n\nThe Dealer's performance is what sells and buoys this game, especially as the rest of its features and mechanics, while serviceable, really aren't much to talk about. Specifically, the combat is closer I think to Assassin's Creed, where sitting and waiting on the counter indicator to appear is the best way to go, especially if you put it on Hard Mode from the outset (which I recommend, as otherwise the combat pace is even slower and easier).\n\nI would recommend buying this game on sale. I got mind for $10 during 2015's Holiday Sale, and it's completely worth the $10.

The narrator is amusing, the graphics cartoonish in a lovely way that pops on the screen totally appropriate for a game that is within a game.\n\nThe basic conciet of the game though is pretty briulliant - the player is playing cards against the enigmatic narrator who is some sort of dyspeptic frog voiced oracle or wizard. He's fun enough and he has new quips for most new cards, but I could I can see a DLC with a different dealer being profoundly satisfying - say a urbane devil, petulant child or defeatist death.  The card came is itself an adventure, with the randomly selected (you can build the decks though - within certian limits) card laid down and most cards offering a garphic of a charming woodblock image, a paragraph and a choice.  most selections lead to a pick and choose mechnic where four cards representing degrees of success and failure are shuffled monty style and the player picks one.  Other cards lead to combat.  In general when the player is successful with a card they gain a token that's convereted to another card at the end of each game.  Thus as one plays more and more choices are added.  It's fun, and for an "unlock" method of providing content feels very natural.\n\nDespite that praise, I almost gave this gave a thumbs down because even now, long after release (and to the developers' credit the seem to keep adding cards and content) the game seems to suffer from technical issues.  It lags, it slows and it crashes with alarming regularity on my laptop - which while no gaming machine is well above the minimum specs.  This isn't a general set of errors, more a steady degradation of capability culminating in multi minute load times for combat sequences or simply sudden crashes in the combat engine.  Whatever the cause these errors, they make the game frustratingly unplayable - becauase I want to play it and it's a good game.\n\nI'm still giving it a positive rating here because when it does work (and sometimes it's fine) it's a very fun, very smart game.","January 7","true","13.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's perhaps one of the greatest examples of a game being more than the sum of its parts.\n\nThe central concept that underlies Hand of Fate is perhaps best described as "Luck of the draw" or any other kind of card-game term, signifying the idea that sometimes you get dealt a good hand, sometimes a bad one. It's a game that is centered around this very idea, of both luck and fate, that draws on a heavy mysterious atmosphere, a strong narrator and stories that are slowly uncovered with each run. It's this presentation, narration and atmosphere that sets it apart from other, perhaps better rogue-like games and that keeps me coming back to pit myself against the dealer over and over again.\n\nThe game has weaknesses here and there, the arena combat can sometimes be frustrating (damn scales), the trap-mazes are rather predictable and sometimes, the suggested decks aren't entirely up to snuff, but I am willing to overlook all of that, and would likely overlook more, for the delightful world and theme.\n\nAs it stands, I've sunk more time in Hand of Fate than I've sunk in many other games and the very idea of two players, playing a game like this for a mysterious reason, has kept me engaged both while playing and when not. The art-style, narration and depth of this game make it a no-brainer for me to recommend.","June 10, 2015","true","45.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's a new take on an RPG that I've never experienced, that and the create your own adventure part of it brings back memories of the books I read as a child. It mixes RPG/Card Game/Create Your Own Adventure so well, I am about half way through the story mode, have yet to touch the Endless Mode but I definitely will after I finish the story. I couldn't stop playing, I put 8 plus hours in straight, minus roughly 1 hour for a break I took to eat and watch a show.\n\nBasically how this game goes (its awesome) is you sit face to face with the guy who created the game essentially at a table, he opens his cabinet of boss enemies and you must take one boss out at a time. So each journey you unlock cards, weapons, armor, blessings etc etc that become part of your deck. You can build your deck between journies. One boss takes you through a journey where you'll face numerous enemies, mazes of death, merchants, people that need help, all kinds of things. You get a choice to whether or not you are good or bad or you will help or you won't. You'll be rewarded in some way, either way whether that's good or bad. That's the create your own adventure part, gives you control of what choices you make in the game and the consequences of those choices. It's very cool.\n\nWhat is also REALLY awesome is you actually do battle yourself when you come across enemies or a boss etc, the cards dont just animate the fight, you'll take control of your character and have to take on all the enemies yourself, it's really fun. So the character (which you can look at anytime in the inventory along with your other goodies/curses/blessings etc) will change his appearance based on what armor or weapons you have equipped. You can counter enemies when wielding a shield and get various items that do different things, different weapons, helmets, armor, braces etc that have different properties, it's quite cool.\n\nThis game is worth every penny, I can't say enough about it, one of the best games I've played in a long while. I'm glad a friend of mine told me about it.","February 18, 2015","true","13.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Considering you spend 95% of your time interacting with him and listening to him, if he was in anyway written terribly, or voiced terribly, then it would kill the game for you because otherwise, all you had was some fun quests and mediocre Arkham combat.\n\nThankfully, the Dealer is engaging, hardly ever repeats his lines, and even then, his delivery is so snarky and full of personality and flavor, you don't mind occasionally hearing the same line again. He will have up to 3, perhaps even more, different lines for the same card, or same kind of card (like the Helpful Priest line of cards, where he shows his disdain of the clergy).\n\nThe Dealer's performance is what sells and buoys this game, especially as the rest of its features and mechanics, while serviceable, really aren't much to talk about. Specifically, the combat is closer I think to Assassin's Creed, where sitting and waiting on the counter indicator to appear is the best way to go, especially if you put it on Hard Mode from the outset (which I recommend, as otherwise the combat pace is even slower and easier).\n\nI would recommend buying this game on sale. I got mind for $10 during 2015's Holiday Sale, and it's completely worth the $10. At its full price, I would have hoped that the combat mechanics be more polished, as they do bring down the whole package and presentation of the game.","January 5","true","36.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you like gamebooks (esp. fighting fantasy series), you will like this game, and if you enjoy RPGs I highly suggest giving this game a chance. You play as an adventurer who has to defeat a set of bosses that are like tiers of each other, but not really in a way making it repetetive. You collect cards that make up the game and put them in the main playing deck and basically yours are meant to better your chances, and the dealer puts in cards to make it more challenging. Its amazingly fun collecting the cards to unlock new encounters and the dlc is actually a rare dlc that does in fact give you something new, it adds cards that change the rules from the start which makes it a LOT more replayable.The artwork is GREAT, like I mean really, really good and the fights sequences gain a lot from that. I esp. like the tomb/crypt area when you fight undead. The real only negatives are that the fights can get a bit boring, but not really such a big deal....another thing is a pretty annoying bug that causes background card shuffle noises (pls fix!!!!) that drives you mad if you don´t restart the game lol.

The fact that the user reviews state that it's overwhelming positive should be enough for you to at least try it and $20 isn't asking much. I generally prefer First Person Shooters as my staple but this is honestly my favorite game of the year second to Evolve.","February 20, 2015","true","6.2"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

The game in its current state has an unrelenting learning curve that comes out of nowhere after the first few bosses. I also felt the combat tutorial was somewhat lacking as it didn’t explain everything you can do such as ground executions.\n\nOther than these minor qualms I highly recommend buying it.

You get to pick half of the cards that will appear in the game ( your favourite weapons, armour and positive encounters ), the computer picks the other half ( rusty weapons, monsters, curses and negative encounters ).\n\nThe computer shuffles your deck with his deck, this creates true procedural generation. No two games will ever be the same. The cards are placed, so as to simulate floors in a building and corridors.\n\nThis is Kenuty's excellent Early Access gamplay video:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRc6O9HeP6w\n\nThe combat for the first few quests consisted of simple attack and parry but scaled up to "God of War 1" meets "Golden Axe" with: tumble, shield bash, magical weapons and magical artifacts.\n\nThere are 12 different quests. It took me 20 hours to finish three quarters of the game ( at which point I had only unlocked a little over half of the equipment cards and half of the encounter cards ie. the game is massive ). It took me another 20 hours to finish the last three missions because they are brutal. I highly recommend this game to hardcore gamers!\n\nIf you want to make the game easier or harder, there is a "Wildcards" expansion that will do that:\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/350460/\n\nThe voice narration is eloquent. I thought that it was narrated by Jeremy Irons but it was voiced by Anthony Skordi. The dialogue is immersive and teaches you the game mechanics on the fly, as you encounter the different cards.\n\nNorthern Lion: "Let's Look At: Hand of Fate!"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLSEOkX83yE","September 22, 2014","true","106.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

I cant stress this enough.\nGET HAND OF FATE.\nThis game is amazing.\nCreated by Defiant Development, this game mixs a table top card game with a top down action rpg.\nAfter the tutorial, you have to edit your deck (or use a reccomended preset) and in doing this you choose what encounters, shops, weapons, armor and enchantments will be randomly drawn throughout the game.\nThese items get reset every game, but you add to the total cards in the deck. Which means you have wider variety to build a play deck with.\nEach floor consists of face down cards. These are encounters. You have to move your token across these, one after another, down the depths to find the boss at the end of the dungeon.\nThis part is similar to Nethack.\nEach time you touch a new card, you have to decide how to deal with it.\nBe it scaling down a cliffside to reach a weapon or an angry mob wanting to steal your food.\nResources!\nIn this you have 3 resources.\nFirst, obviously, is your health. This is gained each time you move or take a heal action through an encounter. Maximum health can be gained or lost through different successes or failures. Lose all of this and you have lost the game.\nSecond. Food.\nFood is used to move. Consuming 1 food per movement. There are events in this where you can lose or gain food, sometimes lose all of it too, very harsh as i learned.\nIf your food has fallen to 0 then every movement will cost -10 health.\nFood is gained through combat, gain cards or shops.\nThird. Gold.\nWhat dungeon crawler would exist without the treasure?\nGold is used to shop with, buy off bribes or charity through events.\nGold can be stolen from you and you can also gain it through events or combat.\nNow, this gets better. because you have a full inventory.\nHead, Armour, Hands, Weapon, Shield, Trinkets.\nLots of combos that do lots of things.\nSome weapons have elemental damage that do extra to different creatures, or less!.\nThis can be found in treasure chests through events, given to you, bought, sold.\nThese items are preset into the deck by the deck builder, but you dont just get them, you need to EARN them in the game.\nCombat is simple and short, but enjoyable.\nThe dealer will select monster cards (or you do, depending on the event)\nThese monster cards will say things like Four of Skulls or 3 of Dust.\nThe 4 of Skulls will summon 4 Skeletons. 3 of Dust will summon 3 bandits.\nThe combat now moves into a character control, no longer a card game but a top down action rpg, think of Diablo and you will be getting close.\nCombat is a little clunky, but nothing to make this game anything of any sort of shabby.\nSome weapons have abilities like exploding, gaining damage through combos, do more damage the less health you have, that sort of thing.\nSome shields can reflect range damage back and some trinkets will do things like throw 8 daggers around you, some will activate and give you gold-per-hit and some will give you temp poison.\nThe goal of this is to kill all 12 bosses in the story mode, all with a varying range of tactics.\nSo once again, Want to support Australian developers and get something worth while out of it?\nHand of Fate.","February 19, 2015","true","10.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Desenova/recommended/266510/","Desenova","Desenova","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Desenova/","319 products in account","Hand of Fate is a game I've been seeing around lately, hearing a lot of solid words from trusted sources and fellow gamers, and of course some harsh criticisms, which is to be expected, but the one theme that keeps popping up is that it is addicting as hell. Combining elements from card games such as Hearthstone and Magic the Gathering, board games like Dungeons and Dragons, as well as RPGs like Skyrim, Diablo, and The Witcher, this game has all the elements to be the meth of gaming, a blend of a lot of different things making for a hell of a drug, but is it fun? Let's find out, shall we?\n\n\n\nGameplay: 93/100 A-\n\nAs I mentioned in the intro, Hand of Fate is a mix of a lot of different things, taking the best aspects of each and nearly seamlessly melding them into one, a feat that is hard enough to do separately, let alone flowing from one to another, but it is an achievement that Defiant have successfully done. Playing through the cards and planning ahead with equipment, magic, traps, all the standards that you can find in other card games, but then the RPG side comes in a bit as you can trade with caravans, should you draw that card, and finally landing on the combat, which is fairly simple to get used to. Attack, blocking, countering, all can be done and the game does flow like water over river stones in the spring time.\n\n\nAudio: 94/100 A-\n\nThe sound effects and music is also done very well. It was never intrusive or overwhelming, Calm when it needed to be and action packed elsewhere. The voice acting has to be the crowning jewel here, where listening to your "trainer" felt real. For example, leave the game playing during a turn or when picking cards, he may start babbling or criticizing you for taking too much time. It's an organic feel that I really welcomed and made me chuckle a few times. The combat sounds and ambience is also very well produced, a solid effort on this end.\n\n\nVisuals: 94/100 A-\n\nHand of Fate is good to look at, even at the lowest settings. There is of course clipping issues here and there, but I feel like that's going to be an issue in gaming for at least another generation and a half. Anyways, the colors are all done well and placed in logical locations, things look like they belong as well as drawing inspirations from all the genres that are mashed together in the game: medieval fantasy, gothic dark ages, D&D, it all comes together quite nicely, giving Hand of Fate a distinct style.\n\n\nContent: 95/100 A\n\nThere are a LOT of cards to play with here, easily competing with other big dogs in the market, both old and new, couple that with the other elements of the game and you're into a lot of replayability, but with that also comes some repetitiveness, and while the latter is annoying, it is also expecting in a game that uses themes from other games which rely on such a large selection of options and randomness. But the game works well together, keeping me interested even when things became repetitive. It is something you come back just in case that awesome moment happens this time around and you get that ultra rare thing you've always wanted.\n\n\nDesign: 96/100 A+\n\nLike I said, the game flows very well together. Everything is done in moderation and not one aspect of the game overwhelms or overpowers another and I think that is the key to Hand of Fate's popularity, despite the often complicated genres that it takes inspiration from. A testament to Defiant's understanding of the multiple elements they've taken from.\n\n\nPerformance: 80/100 B-\n\nNow we get into the issues I ran into. While the game itself is brilliant in combining everything together, the technical side of things are a bit choppy. Again, this is from my experience on my machine, got it? The biggest issue I had, first, involved the Steam overlay glitching and remaining on the screen when I took screenshots. Another issue was often times during the loading of the combat scenes took ages to load, often making me think that the game had frozen, only to come alive suddenly. There was some detection issues with the combat as well, but that could just be my suckiness at said combat. Not to mention glitches here and there bugged me in many ways, but the game is good, so I just learned to ignore them and kept going.\n\n\nVerdict: 93/100 A-\n\nAt the end of it all, you can't deny the strokes of brilliance in Hand of Fate. The developers picked and chose the right things from each genre melded them together, where they would be most effective and instead of falling flat, it stands tall, albeit a little shaky with a lot of polishing needed, it is still a great start. The potential for this game is through the roof.","February 22, 2015","true","1.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","2"

Wish I could have gotten it when it was on sale, but it's definately worth the full price. I have to agree with him that the dealer is easily one of the best selling points. (The dealer is both creepy and entertaining.) The only misgivings I have seems to be the graphical options and that (my copy at least) seems to lock you into using a controller if you have one plugged into your PC. However, the controller doesn't limit gameplay. Combat is not overly complicated. Some have panned the game for it, but I don't see that as a drawback.","May 3, 2015","true","3.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

A combination of card games, where what you get is determined by what is in your deck and action RPG fights. It feels like a playing a Lone Wolf gamebook where your choices dictate few outcomes biased by your luck (damn!).\nAt the same time, you do feel like you are just a pawn into the Dealer's hand and the lore is very appealing.\n\nI personally had to play with mouse and keyboard though the game is designed for gamepad: I still don't understand if the gamepad commands are laggy or if just don't activate in menus and fight.\nFights and map loadings feel a bit laggy too.","August 22, 2014","true","5.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Do I risk searching the remaining cards on a floor in hope of finding better equipment but risk losing everything trying to cross a river, leaving myself bare of armour and weilding only a rusty axe when it comes to challenging the deck boss? These are just some of the many difficult decisions you will face in Hand of Fate. Gripping dialogue and voice acting straight from the off. (The voice actor of the dealer is superb). Immense replayability and customisation through the use of the randomising deck system. Challenging bosses, enemies, events and decision making. I have not seen a game that can blend card based gameplay, with RPG elements such as your equipment, curses and 'artefacts', and actual in game combat. (One criticsm would be the combat system is a bit, well lots of rolling around randomly dodging enemies whilst mashing the LMB...But theres potential for a more substantial combat system in the future, furthermore this is only a minute criticsm in my opinion and should not overshadow the vast quality and diversity this game offers). Icant wait to see what the developers include in later patches and updates, perhaps character facial customisation? Some sort of tech-tree or research tree to go alongside the RPG aspect of the game?

Game is interesting and enjoyable for about an hour or two but once you're past the first few bosses every run turns into a slow and tedious slog as each one adds more and more events that are basically just boring static debuffs that you don't get any opportunity to mitigate or avoid. Every time you finish or fail a run it sends you all the way back to what is essentially the title screen and you have to sit through a million unskippable animations and spam through a million clunky menus to start the next run. The dealer's voice acting is good and enjoyable until hour two when you realize you've heard the exact same lines twenty times already and you're sick of constantly being forced to wait to make actions until he finishes saying the entirety of his 15 second tangent about fate which wasn't even interesting the first time.\n\nThe combat just gets worse and worse as the game goes too, they throw more and more guys in but the arenas are all tiny and there camera is fixed so you get tons of guys attacking you from onscreen and all the enemy types and especially the later ones have terrible animations that all look the same but are randomly unblockable. There's also really inconsistent bullet time slowdown to try and make your attacks look cool but it just makes your character look like an idiot as he slowly floats through the air swinging his axe while enemies just walk around and set up attacks at normal speed in the background. The combat system is standard Arkham-style Simon Says stuff but it's the clunkiest version of any game to use it and nothing about it feels good or consistent.","May 11","false","5.2"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

Then add a card dealer that actually feels like a real person is playing cards with you....I just cant say enough good about this game but I'm going to try.\n\nThis game is unbelievably good. The voice acting is literally perfect. It is so immersive watching all of the little animations that the  dealer uses and his comments are so on point that it is akin to psycho mantis from mgs. I really get the sense that I am playing cards with a powerful, mysterious and devious being and he is talking to ME! His covered face was a brilliant idea to add to the sense of mistrust.\n\nThis is truly a seamles mashup of several components. TCG, action, RPG, strategy. While Hand of Fate isn't a complete experience in any of the forementioned genres there is enough of each one that somehow when combined...is so throughly entertaining and enthralling I simply cannot put it down. The concept is so simple yet so brilliant it's a wonder noone has made a game like this years ago. The gameplay is so fun that I played the game for 7.4 hours straight the same night I purchased it. It is realy a unique experience. What a gem! I really cant say enough about the dealer's character he makes every single moment of this game feel meaningful and the absolutely nailed the atmosphere. The presentation is top notch. there are so many wonderful details such as the way the candle burns down as the game goes on and as such the room becomes darker.\n\nI was so filled with wonder, excitement, terror, joy and anger while playing this game. The games difficulty seems to ramp up nicely. I am not even half way done with this game yet but I am so looking forward to the bosses and cards that I will unlock next but most of all I am looking forward to unraveling the mystereis behind the dealer and what this game is all about.\n\nFascinatingly there is no tutorial you are simply thrust into the game and yet I can tell that this is not an oversight, it is deliberate and the dealer makes mention of it several times. If you've ever played a videogame before you will figure it out and the gameply is so intuitive that to my surprise, no tutorial is necessary! He will wager some precious artifacts if you win you earn them if you lose you will have to roll your deck again and he will deal the dungeons from the beginning.\n\nI took a chance on this game because I really like TCG and the way that this suppossedly had an action elemant sounded interesting and unique and I am so glad I did. Now that I know how good this game is I would have gladly spent twice the price I paid. Unless you are some sort of gibbering idiot who only plays madden games you will definitely love this game. I seriously cannot imagine anyone not liking this game; it is straight up fun! The game really put a smile on my face very quickly and then gradually became very challanging. I really love Hand of Fate. I give HOF my highest reccomendation and I would place this game among my top favorite games of all time.","February 15, 2015","true","14.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","20","1","5","2","0"

Before embarking you can put the cards you have into the encounter and equipment decks which will be used during the run. Some cards are locked for the specific adventure, some cards you may not know the effect of until you've encountered them in game at least once. For some adventures there are special circumstances like more damage from projectiles or taking damage if you carry too much gold at a time.\n\nOnce you've started the game, the narrator will deal out cards to form the dungeon floor you're on. Either your target is on this floor, or there's a stairwell to go deeper. You move one card at a time either horizontally or vertically using food as you go. Each card is an event, some with just text, others with battles. It does lend a good feeling to this being an adaptation of a card game and you're playing against the deck out to kill you.\n\nIf you enter battle, the world changes into 3D for a battle sequence flowing a bit like the Batman games or Asassins creed, though without the vertical element to it. Initially the combat feels clunky, maybe it was just the state I played it in, or maybe it owes to the fact that I didn't get a shield until later and didn't realise there was a dodge roll button either. The combat can be a bit tricky to see at times, but otherwise feels very satisfying connecting with your mace or warhammer.\n\nIn all this is a nice game with a bit of randomization. It carries the atmosphere of playing an engrossing cardgame quite well, and breaks up the text events with a robust battle system. It gets rather tense when you're down to one food hoping you'll run into a merchant or a treasure chest with food in it, and it can really ruin your run when you have little health left and run into a tough battle you were hoping to avoid till you'd regained more health.\n\nAs for negatives: There is some text to read in this game, so if you dislike reading, skip it. Maybe down the line it'll all be narrated, but for now it isn't.\nAlso you will encounter the same card and thus even several times over your playthrough. If you're the person who want new stuff constantly, this might put you off. As it is, once you know an event by heart you can usually click past it and get the effect you'd like. And of course you can alter the frequency by removing some of them from your deck if you so desire.\nThe camera can be a bit tricky in the action sequences. I only found it got in the way of fighting once or twice, but if you're the kind of person who demands manual camera control or perfect viewing angles, this is not the case here.\n\nLastly: I played this game using an XBox 360 controller, it works quite well. I don't know how well a keyboard and mouse setup would fare, but so far I've not found any ranged weapons so the 8-directional movement afforded by Keyboard should be sufficient if done well. Just know I have not tested this.","October 19, 2014","true","17.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I picked this up as part of a bundle because Extra Credits said it was worth the look for its uniqueness alone. Boy were they right. What they left off was how delightfully fun it is. It takes what could be a boring basic premise and dresses it up in just the right way to make it fresh and engaging. The voice acting (and the writing) is nigh flawless. The visual design is never stunning, but always full of loving detail. The setting sits right between being broad enough to feel deep and repetitive enough to feel symbolic. What's more it's always explored indirectly as a side benefit of progressing through the game mechanics itself. Rich with theme, a pleasure to explore, and with more to come, you'd be hard pressed to find a better choice for that distraction game you've been needing.","October 19, 2014","true","16.8"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

And I definitely did. And still sometimes do. But there are far too many things that keep me from fully recommending this to you. So, good things first, the setting is part of what I liked. The ambience the game sets is pretty cool and involving, while not too extravagant. The game master's taunts and comments might be redundant in the long run, but they're still well made and help the player get into the game a bit more. The way you unlock new cards and encounters with tokens, pretty cool too, makes you want to play more and more to unlock more cards and move deeper into the different storylines. The game system, nothing complicated, but making it simple is what makes it work : You move from encounter to encounter, spending one food at a time, healing a bit while doing so. As I said, it's simple, yet allows you a bit of planning when you look at which way you'll go.\n\nWhat could go wrong then?\n\nFirst, the encounter themselves: While having them randomly placed on the map makes sense and allows for replayability [GOOD RNG], most of them involve luck way too heavily to be amusing. You just pick a card and see if it's a success or failure, which can lead to frustrating events (looking at you there, devil's carnival) at worst and not so involving at best [BAD RNG]. I understand the need of randomness in such a game, but I wish I could have a heavier impact on it.\nAnd then the combat, oh my the combat. Arkham Asylum wasn't incredible and definitely was too easy, but it was nervous, fast paced, and pretty to look at (most of the time) because of its dynamic nature. Hand of Fate's one is just plain boring. At first it might seem enjoyable, because of the equipment possibilities and monsters that you imagine will come against you, but after two hours you've seen most of it. It's bland, slow-paced, not hard by any mean, unless the game's RNG decided to ♥♥♥♥ you up and stack everything against you (curses, loss of equipment...). Seeing that it's supposed to be an important part of the game, it's sad to see it fail to convey the atmosphere of epicness the games tries so hard to set.\nThat being said, understand that this game is fun, but that you won't have fun for more than a few hours at best, therefore I don't recommend you buying it at full price. Wait for a sale, don't pay more than 10 bucks for this, really.\n\n\ntl;dr : Yes, I'd recommend this game, but for no more than a few bucks.","April 15","false","5.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","3","0","0"

The biggest failure is the combat system.  Being able to use your mouse to control the direction you move would be great, but instead you're limited to A,W,S,D as though you're just a piece on a chessboard.  That doesn't work so well when you're surrounded by bosses and add ons in a tight space.  I saw some of the unlockable achievements being to fight X number of battles without taking any damage.  Yeah, right.  I'm all for things being more difficult the more I progress, but as others have commented, the difficulty spike soon makes the frustration outweigh the enjoyability factor far too quickly.  I've tried to love it, but the more I play, and the further I move along, the more likely I am to delete this game, count my blessings I got it on sale, and find other, more enjoyable games to play.  Hopefully the developers will read through some of the negatve reviews and continue to revamp the game.

Well so would I and this game falls far short of the mark.  The deck building is pretty pointless as there seems to be no strategy to it at all.  There are no synergies to be exploited so what's the point?  All it does is give you the space on the board to play and some equipment that the RNG will deem fit to annoint you with or screw you with.\n\nThen you have encounter cards that have you picking between four cards with success or failure.  This is such a lame feature I have no idea how it got into the final game.  Maybe somebody is a big 3 card monte fan or played persona 3 too much.\n\nThen you have the combat which basically entails whacking a couple guys, some dodge rolling and the occaisional counter telegraphed by the giant green symbol above the enemies head.  Wow.  Excitement it is not.  They try to spice it up with throwing some traps in the levels but all that does is make the combat even more tedious.  I beat some boss called the Queen of Dust with a rusty axe  (thanks RNG) by just running around in circles and then just whacking her after her unblockable attack.  It makes fighting the lamest enemies in Dark Souls seem like Swan Lake in comparison.\n\nSo let's say you die during a level.  Well you get to keep any cards you get and then try it all over again.   Great.  It's a grindy game as well.  Sorry guys, the actually combat portion of the event is not fun enough to warrant any sort of grind.  Maybe if you made the levels bigger and it were more like a streets of rage type level (waves of enemies) instead of an arena level based upon a whack and roll mechanic it may have been more fun.\n\n\ntl/dr  Not all new ideas are good.

It makes for interesting and variable playthrough. I think with a few improvements this could easily turn into one of my favourite games.\n\nSo the big problem I had is that the combat became very dull and one dimensional about halfway through the game. I felt like as soon once the number on enemies faced in each combat scenario got high enough I ended up just tapping the counter key constantly and could not do much else, and without a shield the was no hope of completing more than a couple of combat scenarios.\n\nThe deck also started to feel unbalanced partway through the game, which I suppose added to the difficulty, but it seemed like too many cards had a 75% failure or epic failure chance with signifcant consequences and samll chance of reqrd, which was frustrating at times.\n\nI think encorporating a bit of dungeon crawling could really liven things up as well. Rather than just being thrust into an arena for each combat, creating a larger level where you could approach the enemies and the combat situation in multiple ways would really improve the gameplay.\n\nI am a bit torn about recommending or not recommending this game; I still think it is an interesting concept and worth a playthrough, but there is definitely a lot of room for improvement.","March 18, 2015","false","5.5"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

The animations were nice, combat was fun, the voice acting was great.  It was a really well polished random adventure generator game.\n\nThe basic mechanic of the game is that encountering cards generates an encounter, whether combat, puzzle, story, what-have-you, and completing the card will unlock that card's token, which will in turn unlock more cards to add to future decks.  It gives a good incentive to try to encounter many cards and figure out how to unlock more.  Quite cool.\n\nAs you progress in the game, unlocking more cards, you will also encounter bosses.  Beating them unlocks the next boss card, and after you beat enough bosses you will unlock an artifact that gives you some bonuses but will also make the game harder.\n\nThis is the point where the game goes wrong for me.  The difficulty increases introduced by the artifacts make the game virtually impossible by the end.  It was not unusual for me to start a game and the very first card would be a combat against a prior boss, 9 of their minions, on a trapped battlefield with an accompanying totem.  There were so many high powered threats my brand new out of the box adventurer had no chance to win.\n\nWhat makes it worse is that there's no going back.  Once those difficulty spikes are unlocked, they affect the whole game, retroactively.  If I go back to the very first boss of the game, my first encounter on that level might be the aforementioned impossible fight (and was, the time I tried).  The fun of the game, of running around kicking bandits in the face and solving problems for townsfolk became overshadowed by a constant string of deaths brought on by unwinnable fights.\n\nThere's an easy mode that gives the player some benefits, but activating it disables achievements (gotta punish those filthy casuals) and you can't access any of the other character archetypes in the game, which locks out almost all of the games replayability.\n\nCurrently the only solution to get rid of the difficulty spikes is to use the 'Erase Progress' feature, which you don't realize until it's too late.  Now, after playing for 12 hours, I'm forced to decide to either erase everything I've accomplished or give up because the game is unplayable.\n\nNeither of those choices make any sense, and are a big part of the reason I can't recommend this game.  There's a great premise here, and the underlying system is really, really cool, but it becomes difficult to the point of impossibility and I've got better things to spend my gaming time on than dying forever.\n\nShould the devs put in a way to disable the artifacts, or otherwise customize the difficulty of the game in a way that doesn't lock out every other character option, I will revisit this review and hopefully change it to a positive.","June 26, 2015","false","13.3"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

If you want to make an action combat game, then do that.  What you have here is a very mediocre card game and an extremely mediocre action combat game put together.  If they had given up one concept they might have had enough resources to devote to the other to make it good.\n\nHere's how it works, you build a deck of equipment, bonus cards and encounters.  And then the game master lays some encounters on the table face down and your game piece "walks" across them, you pick the next card to walk on, and frequently you have only one choice.  Each encounter is either a choose-your-own adventure style multiple-choice question with a bit of random chance thrown in, or a "battle" if you can call it that.  Each battle is a mouse mashing clickfest.  The mechanics are stunningly bad and you can't even rotate the camera which is very annoying because some of your opponents will run off camera where you can't see them.\n\nThat's pretty much it.  Card after card after card, monotonous battle after monotonous battle, all accompanied by the narration of the game master, whose mouth is masked but unfortunately not gagged.  The lines are delivered by a capable voice actor, but they are so vapid, uninspired, and ultimately irrelevant that eventually they just become annoying noise that you have to sit through.\n\nSadly, there is no "shut up" button in evidence, maybe somewhere in the options?\n\nIn any event I only played about a half hour or so... if you're bored in 30 minutes it's a really bad sign I figure.  Anyway, I guess it's not a game for me, and listening to other people rave about it, I am clearly in the minority. You may enjoy it, I recommend going on youtube and watching someone else play it for an hour.  If after that you are still interested, you'll probably love it.","June 29, 2015","false","0.7"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Hopefully with some dev tweaks - it could be really excellent.\n\nIt's very innovative and well done. Graphics are pleasant, the concept is refreshing and the execution is...well...it's ok.\n\nSome of the positives:\n1) Great concept. This is a card game and a button masher. It's not an RPG. There's no levelling of your character, no stats to decide in which to invest, no classes, no abilities.  It's a card game that unfolds into button mashing sequences based on the cards that are randomly drawn. The mix of card and action elements combined with a fantasy/D&D type setting are neat and are done well.\n2) The game is polished. The graphics are nice, the voice acting is very good, the presentation of the encounters are well done, etc. It's a well put together game with nice artwork, GUI, sounds, etc.\n\nSome of the negatives:\n1) The cards PART 1. For me , I dislike the card designs greatly. The devs chose to go with a basic brown card with black text - and it's drab. The rest of the game is graphically very colorful and interesting. I realize the card design is going for an old parchment feel - but it just seems uninteresting to me. I could have done with some interesting edge work, slight color tints, or edging...something. There are tons of card games out there and the cards themselves are always something of great time and effort in the design , sometimes even with collector editions, gold versions , etc.\n2) The cards PART 2. For some reason, the devs thought it would be interesting to "lock" cards. When you get them, you don't know what they do until you come across them in your journey. This makes the whole part where you get cards at the end of your journey nearly pointless. When you complete a card/journey, you can get a token , and at the conclusion of a journey your tokens are exchanged for cards. The cards turn over on your screen and all you can do is look at the title and picture and wonder what they do....unless it's something you already unlocked. Perhaps this is fun to others and not to me, but I compare to Hearthstone - when you open a new pack - you can instantly read the description of the card - and start understanding if you should be excited about it or not. For a portion of the game where I feel getting new cards should be very rewarding and exciting - it's not. It's actually quite tedious as I have to turn in all my tokens, get my cards (which I don't know what they do) and that leads me to #3.\n3) Deck building. The same issue rears its head in building your deck. You can have many cards that are locked - that you don't know what they do - but if you want to know what they do - you put them in - hope to draw them during a journey - and hope you like it. That's really not a design choice that is rewarding to me.\n4) Help. The game is easy to grasp once you play - but at the start - nothing is explained - and there is no good on screen help. An example are the tokens. It wasn't at all clear that a token was on the card, and that upon completing that card - you get the token - and that at the conclusion of the journey and beating the boss - that you get all the tokens you collected along the way and turn them in for cards. It also wasn't clear initially that you lose food each time you move, or gain health each time you move. You learn this super fast, but a tiny popup or something would be good. In fact, there's a couple different token shapes - still not sure the differences between them all.\n5) Easy + Repetitive. The game is fun, but so far, it's very repetitive. After just a couple journeys - I've run across the same cards over and over. It's also the same pattern - card, battle...card, battle. The battles are also the same for me...roll, x,x,x....roll, x,x,x....roll,x,x,x.....win.  I'm about half done with the game, maybe it gets more complex , but so far -it hasn't.\n\nIn summary, it's a neat game...it's solid. There could be more done with the cards and the deck building to make it more interactive, but its repetitive and the card element isn't rewarding enough to compensate.\n\nUpdate: Saw there is DLC 1 month after release - so , since game is decent, but was on the fence, am going with not reccomended since DLC immediately after release is a money grab.","February 18, 2015","false","11.0"," 11 of 27 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","11","27","0","0"

Nothing you can do about it, except retrying and hoping for better luck.\nEquipment is not balanced. The most important piece is the weapon.

It draws you into the world magnificently. The dealer is perfect.. however that's not the whole game. What destroys this atmosphere is the gameplay..\n\nOnce you're about 2/3rds into the game you'll realize why people left negetive reviews. The combat remains simple and unrewarding, however the monster HP goes up as you get better items to your deck. However you don't start with those items, you have to be lucky enough to find them. So monsters are now punching bags, and every time you run into a combat card you sigh from exhaustion. The end game is just brainless masochism (and I've beaten the castlevania, ninja gaiden, and Ghouls n Ghosts trilogies). You lose because of dice rolls, and the odds aren't in your favor. The final battle is depressingly boring- just a repeat of old bosses and the final boss is just a QTE.\n\nI gave the developers months to change it, but they haven't.

Unfortunately I was left with a feeling of dull disappointment and a small hole in my pocket after just over an hour of learning the mechanics. Don't get me wrong I'd happily pay my last cent for something enjoyable and the concept is refreshing but everything else was just overwhelmingly average.\n\nGameplay was OK\n\nAtmosphere was OK\n\nIt looks OK\n\nControls were OK (if not a little clunky)\nThe music and narration are well put together with the aid of a great fantasy style voice actor but even after just over an hour play time the gameplay quickly became repetitive and irritating.

Hand of Fate lays deckbuilding card games, roguelikes, action brawlers and choose-your-own-adventure books onto the table and shuffles.

However, as the end draws close, the difficulty is suddenly amped to eleven and the game turns into a grind. During the last few rounds the deck is so stacked against you that even with immaculate play, you can still lose terribly.\n\nYes, I understand that the game is a roguelike and you're supposed to die a bit, but going from not dying at all for 90% of the game to losing twenty times in a row is just poor balancing and design. A shame really, since with a bit less punishing difficulty curve Hand of Fate would've been a surefire recommendation.

Its innovative card / action battle structure has all the makings of a totally addictive and fun experience. I want more cards, want to find out what they do, and am on the edge of my seat with every move forward onto the next encounter.\n\nBut there are two really big flaws, which I suspect will limit how much time I put into the game. The first is a clunky and sometimes non-intuitive interface, with lots of unnecessary and repetitive micro-pauses. Every time you hit a merchant, you have to wait for a few seconds as the game transitions to the same 3D rendering of the merchant cart, before you are allowed to get on with the transaction. Fine the first time, really annoying by the 20th time. Ditto with shuffling the cards before making one of the game's very frequent 4-hidden-card choice routines.\n\nThe second big flaw is the tactical combat. It just feels fuzzy, with a lack of precise control over your character that it already turning me off. It's not like Diablo 3, with it's crisp and immediately responsive controls. It's more like playing Diablo 3 drunk while wearing ski mittens. I would have preferred a crisp isometric 2D action sequence, or even a turn-based battle approach, rather than the sluggish and woozy 3D battles here.\n\nMaybe some fine tuning is all that's needed to turn this into a very fun game.

I enjoyed playing it for approximately one hour, at which point the novelty wore off. The game became extremely repetitive and offered few, if any, chances for succeeding because of strategy. Combat is a little clunkly and not enjoyable. I found myself getting agitated every time I encountered a combat situation not because it was difficult and I didn't know if I was going to survive, but because I had no desire to endure yet another few minutes of spamming the left mouse button, q key, and space bar.\n\nQuite frankly, there's not much left to say other than after your 60 minutes of enjoyment you will experience a prolonged bout of depression stemming from the money you just wasted on this game.","April 20, 2015","false","1.6"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","6","0","0"

Completely unbalanced random BS utterly destroys any momentum you can build on your own. Too much the game is bogged down with random curse cards that leave the outcome entirely up to chance. Too often I have a good run going, then randomly I get attacked with three curses that destroy my health or give me a stupid handicap like making it so everytime I block I use up food (WHAT!?).\n\nAnd the combat, ugh the combat. First of all, it's basic Batman combat, but it's done rather poorly. Many times (EVERY BATTLE IN THE END GAME) I'll be evading one attack only to have another enemy attack me mid-evade, which I cannot avoid. Screwing me over. And the arenas are so small that in many cases divide and conquer is impossible.\n\nOh, I'm pretty sure this game would be impossible to play if you're red/green colorblind. So keep that in mind.\n\nA great idea destroyed by lazy design.

First off, there's a big RNG element in the sense that you often get 'encounters' that are decided from 4 cards, some of which may be 'successes' and some of which may be 'failures.' The cards shuffle and then you pick one. However it's not *really* RNG as you can follow the shuffling of the cards with your eye. I found this pretty onerous: I would have much rather it just be true RNG because it becomes quite tiresome to closely watch cards that you can sometimes follow but just as often not.\n\nFurthermore, the core aspect of the game - the combat - failed to satisfy. There's a lot of minor annoyances that serve to break up the flow of the combat. For example, you can knock enemies prone and then repeatedly hit them over and over. Seems reasonable enough but it really breaks up the free-flowing feel of the combat (which is heavily reminscent of the Batman Arkham games). The ratmen emit poison when they fall and countering the scales messes up your combo counter. EDIT NOTE: Patches appear to be improving some of my complaints with combat flow.\n\nI really could go on and on for minor issues. There are too many button pushes and after any lengthy period of time playing you start to rapidly push buttons out of impatience.\n\nOne of the bigger issues is the promise of 'deck building.' Technically, yes you build a deck. In application, not so much. Mostly you'll want to slot new cards in order to unlock their 'token' which unlocks further new cards. I did this thinking I'd be able to build a deck once I finished the story mode and started endless mode. Nope. I beat the story mode (in ~8 hours or so) and loaded up endless mode, only to discover you don't get to build a deck at all. It's random. Well that's disappointing.\n\nIn short, Hand of Fate is a fun imaginative game that, for me at least, failed to deliver deep satisfaction.","February 22, 2015","false","14.1"," 6 of 19 people (32%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","32","6","19","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Varsoon/recommended/266510/","Varsoon","Varsoon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Varsoon/","71 products in account","TL;DR:\nHand of Fate is two repetitive, hardly innovative, unfortunately vague, sometimes-working games stuck together in a way that's at least pretty. Don't buy it without doing your homework.\n\nFULL REVIEW:\nHand of Fate boasts an aesthetically gripping melding of two unlike games into a single experience that varies from unplayable to underwhelming. On their own, each of the ‘games’ of Hand of Fate fall far from being worthwhile. Together, the card game and the three-dimensional fighting game intermingle in a way that works just enough to keep players invested in a fairly transparent skinner box.\n\nPlayers are subjected to a deck-building card game that rewards repetitive play with a larger card base and challenges players through proper resource management. Game-to-game rewards are meted out through a shell game that is either too easy or too hard, an aspect that belies the RNG nature of the card game. Overarching rewards are given after successfully completing ‘token’ cards, which have a variety of conditions to complete (some of which are obvious, some obscure, almost all of them lacking explanation). Common issues of RNG exist and are easy to overlook, but there are some more severe instances such as stumbling upon very difficult encounters too early on that force a player have to quit a run of the game or even completely reset their progression overall. Card balance is a huge issue, with several cards being outright stronger than others regardless of situation. Furthermore, the encounter deck that the player must create is a vague collection—there are no indicators of what the encounters do, and some encounters seem variable in their options and outcomes. This makes constructing an encounter deck a chore of either looking up each card online or simply not knowing what each encounter brings in terms of challenge and reward unless the player has drawn that encounter several times. Hand of Fate seems to beckon players to experiment to discover what works and what doesn’t, while punishing players every time that it does not work out both in their current game played and across multiple future games.\n\nThe fighting game, unfortunately, has even more severe issues. Combat is without weight, several mechanics of the system go unexplained, difficulty of encounters has to be inferred, some arenas are far too unforgiving, and so on. There is a simple system of click-to-attack, click-to-counter incoming moves that’s been popularly attributed to the Arkham series of games. Here, it barely works, as most encounters find the player vastly outnumbered by enemies that constantly attack. It is often difficult to even land two attacks in a row on an enemy without being interrupted in some way, giving combat a hectic and choppy flow. Camera angles can be a detriment to properly positioning the character, especially as some arenas feature traps and enemies can attack the player from off-screen. There’s a rolling maneuver that the player is intended to use to avoid several of the heavier attacks in the game, but the roll often comes out too late and does not offer much in terms of defense thanks to aforementioned issues along with painfully awkward hitboxes. Enemies take far too many hits, with the exception of when the player has specifically itemized to defeat an enemy type, and then combat becomes laughably easy against said enemies. There simply is no middle-ground, though. To further frustrate things, rewards are tied to number of monster cards drawn rather than individual monster difficulty--sometimes beating four skeletons can be just as fruitful as overcoming ten skeletons and a boss you fought before. Overall, combat is a mess, ranging from repetitive and easy to punishingly difficult thanks to a culmination of issues that are out of the player’s hands.\n\nThroughout the whole of the game, there simply is a lack of clarity—how much damage am I actually doing? How much damage does my gear reduce? What does an ice-cone attack even do? Is holy damage only extra-effective against undead? Who are these various characters? What does this encounter card even do? What is the purpose? Too many aspects are left to be inferred, both in terms of narrative and mechanics (an appendix would help, even). Oft-times, I find myself recursively fighting through boring encounters, hoping that I actually win the shell games this time around, so that I can unlock more shell games and progress to just being done. There isn’t a gripping narrative arc that makes me want to continue to play to the end. The gameplay from moment to moment is droll and forgettable. There’s nothing that stands out.\n\nThis all goes without mentioning the several issues the game has just running. It outright crashes on startup, it crashes when loading some encounters, it sees framerate dips on some machines; so on and so forth. Thankfully, the support team for the game has been working on patching out and addressing these issues, mostly via their forums.\nThis isn’t to say it’s all bad. I’d be kidding myself if I said the style of the game and the goals it sets out for aren’t awesome. There’s a very strong aesthetic that permeates the game just as there’s something refreshing about having these two genres put together in such a way that one doesn’t get too boring before the other takes over. Sure, dialogue gets repetitive and lore is a bit sparse at times and obfuscated at times, but it’s charming and interesting when it isn’t.\n\nAll in all, Hand of Fate is promising, but lacks polish. There are plenty of options that can be fixed, plenty that can be clarified, and several aspects that can be advanced. Sadly, it seems that a complete overhaul would need to be done to each of the games that exist within Hand of Fate for them to work on their own. If you’d like to pick up two flawed, repetitive games that can distract from their flaws and repetition by means of alternation, go for it. If you’re a sucker for how a game looks rather than how it plays, buy the game like I did. If you want a worthwhile playing experience that’s rewarding outside of just earning more stuff in the game, though? Look to spend your money elsewhere.","March 8, 2015","false","21.2"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","5","17","0","0"

In both cases there is some thematic resemblance to some other genre, but really the core mechanics are thoroughly different and in order to enjoy yourself, you need to understand what the game really is.\n\nIn order to qualify as a "card game", the primary device of the game should be cards. In a typical card game, you might have a hand of cards to select from, or you might play cards to achieve certain effects. On a mechanical level, Hand of Fate is instead more like a roguelike beat-em-up. A game consists of a series of randomly-selected encounters, most of which culminate either in a 3d third-person combat scene, or in a "select the good outcome" shell game. Your goal is to plow through the encounters, managing your resources of health and food, to get to the end, where you fight a boss. Hand of Fate uses "cards" as its theme and narrative -- encounters and equipment are represented by cards, and you can customize the "decks" before play -- but otherwise it bears no similarity to card games whatsoever.\n\nBut despite that, it's still an enjoyable game. Some encounters unlock other encounters, and there's a certain charm to trying to focus on some resource like food in order to try to be in a good position to "win" some encounter. Of course, it can be extremely frustrating when you're all set up, only to get wiped out by an unlucky "draw". Like most roguelikes, it can be punishing and it has quite a bit of replay value.\n\nThe biggest problem with the game is tedium, which sets in around the 400th combat. I'm not sure if it's something about my computer or what, but it takes a long time to "load" certain of the (admittedly quite beautiful) encounters, and many of the combats cease to be challenging after you've played them enough. Because so few of the encounters give you resources, you need to be pretty lucky to have a round where it's even possible to "beat" some of the final encounters. And of the encounters that do give you resources, many of them are combats, which (again) lose their charm after a while.\n\nAll in all I'd probably give HoF a 6.5/10. It's entertaining (and somehow I'm addicted to it), but you can safely skip it.\n\n[N.B. This is before the recent update adding "fates", so maybe things have changed a little bit.]\n","April 18, 2015","false","45.7"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","5","17","0","0"
