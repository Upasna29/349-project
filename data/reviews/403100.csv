"http://steamcommunity.com/id/callistawhite/recommended/403100/","callistawhite","CallistaWhite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/callistawhite/","137 products in account","Rescue Team 3 is the third game in the Rescue Team series, which anyone familiar with it by now will know that it's a time management game.  Thus, the gameplay is the same as the previous two games with an addition or two.  The most noticeable one is that there is now a police feature since thieves will be involved in certain levels and try to take over a building, like the lumber mill or restaurant.  However, I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nThe story is quite different from the previous two games.  You are part of a team that has been hired by a corrupt mayor to help restore his island community.  It's pretty obvious from the art that he isn't on the up-and-up.  I had mixed feelings about this story since in the previous two games, the stories were tamer and this one kind of changed the feeling behind the Rescue Team games.  Regardless, I decided to keep an open mind and see how this one would play out.\n\nUnlike in the previous games, there is no house to reconstruct.  So even if you earn an expert score in a level and earn extra money, it's only there for bragging rights.  However, in absence of a house, there are now in-game achievements. Certain levels will require you to complete certain tasks such as gathering all of the wood, etc.  Also, there are fewer levels in this particular game.  The previous games each had 50 levels while this one had 40 playable levels.  (There are actually 41 levels but the first one is an introductory cutscene so it doesn't really count.)\n\nDespite the questionable storyline and fewer levels, I did enjoy this game.  One thing I forgot to note but now when you rescue people, you can put them to work in various buildings which can earn you more materials.  Of course, you do have your usual workers who will gather materials, clear rubble, etc.  Even though I wish there were Steam achievements, especially as there are now in-game achievements, there are Steam trading cards although they do take a while to drop.  Overall, though, if you do enjoy time management games, Rescue Team 3 is a good addition.  ^^","April 28","true","7.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

But it is way too simple and there aren't any real options that seem to change the gameplay by any noteworthy amount. Really, the only thing that might be different on a second play through is how fast I complete each level, or meeting the criteria for an achievement. Otherwise, there is no structure placement, only stuctures that already exist which need repairs to function.\n\nIts just too basic for me and everything is the game is predetermined. But if you like to get a game so that you can complete it with all achievements, then it might pose a challenge in that area.\n\nYou collect gold, wood, and food mostly because your characters need the supplies to do things. You click food supllies so you have the points to assign a character to collect wood, click a broken building when you have wood to repair it, click gold bars so you can assign someone to remove rocks, click wood again so you can assign someone to repair the fire station, click fire so the new fire station can send a guy to put the fire out, click food again, click gold bar, click wood, click building, level over.\n\nOn a positive note: The music aint horrible, the graphics are fair, and the interface is better than some.","April 22","false","1.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
