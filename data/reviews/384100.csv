The stealth mechanism is very new in this genre and permits different style of gameplay and the three different game types give us a vast array of options.\n\nProbably it needs maps with above-ground paths and a game mode where players have limited lifes with no crystal to capture. I think it could be more interesting with these options.\n\nSometimes it remembers me of an old game that I was using to play on PlayStation with friends: Blast Chamber.\n\nCan't wait for online multiplayer... I hope they will implement it soon!","October 1, 2015","true","6.8"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","0"

It's a fun top-down shooter that is best played on a couch with four friends, beers and a lot of pizza. At the moment there are 3 modalities and 8 well-designed stages (please note that are more than Splatoon). Even though the game is currently in early access, it's very polished and has a charming soundtrack.\n\nAlso it has been translated in Neapolitan dialect, because the developer is an handsome southern guy who drinks a lot of Italian coffee and has a mustache.","September 25, 2015","true","0.2"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","16","22","2","0"

FATAL ERROR IS DEATH.\n\nFatal Error is a bundle of fun with your loved ones that you want to kill in a virtual environment.\n\nThe game contains many promising aspects that will over time develop into a really polished yet simple gameplay that will bring your friends and family together at the same time as dividing them as you slaughter each other and gloat like a drunken goat. Better bring those apples.\n\nThe current state of the Early Access is limited to only quick match with three maps and only a few settings but the developers seem like the productive type and will give out updates every two weeks based on feedback and their own design. Mighty fine and dandy!\n\nLook out for this game in its later stages for sure. If you want to jump in and play with some friends on a night where all you have is each other then be my guest. There will be a lot more content and stuff to do later on so thats cool.\n\nI recommend this to anyone who wants to help shape the future of its gameplay and especially if you have some spare time to bash out on your friends or overpowered computer bots.\n\nThank you for you time. Here's some gameplay my girlfriend and I recorded for ya'll:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtGRxQbA5s8","July 13, 2015","true","4.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","9","10","3","2"

Please keep in mind that this is controller-only so far, and by the time you are reading this they might have updated the game to use keyboard + mouse.\n\nThe game offers 4 player local multiplayer and co-op game, where you can hide, mele-hit or used range weapons. There is power-ups and weapons on the ground to pickup. Currently the game has 3 maps to be played and quick match where you either can turn on AI, with 3 different difficulty on or off for playing with friends.\n\nBesides being a tired monkey under the review and forgot to turn on the in-game music, the game can be really fun agens your friends. We all know that moment where we were alot of kids infront of the same monitor spamming those keys. Be in mind, that you can add controllers to your pc and play together on the same monitor. - I managed to do this preview with a PS4 controller with inputmapper.\n\nWe all hope in the future, that they are adding online multiplayer so we can play with people around the world. I would really like to play with my viewers etc.\n\nOverall Fatal Error is a bomberman replacer.\n\nHere is a demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2jw5eRLl6Y","July 13, 2015","true","1.9"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

Considering it's still in Early Access, it's looking very promising.\n\nCurrently there's only one local multiplayer mode (capture the flag), but they're promising 2-3 more. It can be played solo or in teams, and both options are quite fun. The matches are VERY intense, and the stealth options make the game really cool. The robot-boxes are a great idea! :)\n\nEDIT: I played some of the single player stages, and while Fatal Error is best played in multiplayer, they're enjoyable too. There's only a handful of them but the dev team is promising around 20-25, so fingers crossed (check their trello board, google "fatal error game trello", to see the whole plan!)","October 14, 2015","true","6.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

I'm looking forward to playing it with friends :)","October 19, 2015","true","0.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tuftyindigo/recommended/384100/","tuftyindigo","TuftyIndigo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tuftyindigo/","87 products in account","I got this hoping to play it at lan parties with my friends, but after playing bots a couple of times I don't think I will. The idea for the game is great, but the execution really doesn't live up to that promise. The visual design of the game is too busy, making it hard to see where you're shooting, where you're being shot from, and what's going on. Even with the lava pits, which ought to be clear, it's hard to see where you can go safely and where will kill you.\n\nI don't like the control mechanic either. It really needs the ability to shoot just by pointing with the right stick, without having to press RT as well. I tried it with a Steam Controller, which is abysmal, and with an XBox 360 controller, which is less bad but still pretty cumbersome.\n\nAll of these factors mean you never really get to the point of using the stealth mechanics, which just makes the game feel simplistic and pointless. Overall, I'd say this is a great concept, but it feels more like a game jam game than a refined commercial product.","May 11","false","0.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You could easily make this the only game in your library and be as happy as a dog with two  willies.\n\nIt's the smashing lovechild of being the Companion Cube from Portal and a Cardboard box from Metal Gear Solid. And then arming them to the teeth so they can kill eachother is sneaky, leathal  & imaginative ways.\n\nIf you're a crappy multiplayer, get ready to rage quit. Your mates will hand your ♥♥♥ to you in a paper bag. But if you're good at that kinda shizzle; turn on, boot up and jack in!
