It has a steep learning curve and the controls are very clunky but once you take some time with it, it's surprisingly fun. I was expecting broken phyics but so far failure feels deserved with my own terrible engineering skills. I especially enjoy being able to drive the truck in the full 3d environment instead of simply pushing "play" like in other bridge builders.\n\nI'm still scratching the surface of it, slowly getting through the 3D Bridges content before tackling the more advanced 3D Engineers stuff but I have to say I'm enjoying it all way more than I thought I would. I put a video up where I go over things in more detail: https://youtu.be/W17rZ4FFS90","July 10, 2015","true","5.8"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","24","30","0","2"

You are very free in what you can do, of course sometimes you have to improvise, but you can!\nThere is 3d Bridges included, what is very different to other bridge constructing games. Its no simple click around, you have to be a bit wise.  The levels will keep you for many hours.\nEven if you are not good in spatial awareness or architecture, you are able to practise here.","October 19, 2015","true","58.2"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"

So far I have went through the tutorial in the bridge part. Tutorals are good and once you get through them you have a good grasp of the controls and the game. I played a few missions after the tutorials and they are very good as well. I think this is definetly a buy. Do not listen to the people talking about how bad the graphics are, they have little to no impact on the game and they are not that bad. The controls are a little off but you get use to them quickly.  I love how you actually drive the vehicle.\nThis game so far is way better than all the other bridge contruction games I have played and I havent even tried the engineer part of it. Great game.","October 19, 2015","true","1.5"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","1"

I am a big fan of bridge builders and designing games. This one even lets you actually drive your vehicle across it, but the resolution is awful. Even if you max it out, it looks like something out of windows 98. Keep an eye on it, but wait for it to progress. The controls are difficult as well but mostly because of the graphics.","May 28, 2015","false","0.2"," 17 of 32 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","17","32","0","1"

With that said im sorry to say that this game is just not upto par with  more modern games. The graphics are just god awful with only one setting for shadows. the controls are very un-intuitive. dont expect to be blown away by the level details (the levels are small squares). I can see they are still releasing updates for this game, idk why. The develeper (im guessing there is only one) should honestly start from scratch or make some major graphics and UI overhauls. In the end i could probably spend an hour or two learning the controls, but i dont have time for that. If you have the time and money, support the developer by buying this game (good luck finding a torrent for it).","January 24","true","0.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"
