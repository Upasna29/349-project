Even if it was free, there are still a lot of other FREE Half-Life 2 maps and mods which are way better than this.\n\nThis mod is so terrible in EVERY way. The only things which are fun in this mod are not made by the developer of this mod, but by Valve, because the only things that are fun about this mod are the weapons, enemies and sound design, all of which are made by Valve. There are almost zero custom assets.\nThe level design is extremely bad most of the time. The encounters are either in open areas with no cover at all fighting at really long range, Or in tiny corridors where 100 combine soldiers rush you. 95% of the fights are against combine soldiers, there no variety at all, no pacing, its alway the same dull way you fight the enemies. There is no progression too. At first you have no weapons and you have to just go along the path. After you get the crowbar you also get some suit out of nowhere for some reason, and then the game immdiately gives you almost all of the weapons and starts to throw 100 enemies at you. The fights at the start of the game are exactly the same as at the end, the way the fights are designed, their difficulty level and everything about them. There are no highpoints, its always the same monotone.\n\nSome things about this mod really boggle my mind. There are some really basic mapping mistakes, for example when you open double doors, only one of the doors will open. Stairs dont have invisible ramps on them. Stuff like that every mapper knows. The lighting is extremely bad sometimes, some areas are extremely dark, others are way too bright and full of lights.\n\nMost of the areas in this mod dont make any sense, they feel like completely random combine facilties. And most of the time you will be in the same looking combine facilties. How much of Half-Life 2 was combine facilties? Just the last half hour of the game maybe. And the level design is so cheap too. There is no world, you are most of the time indoors and at the end of every area there is a portal which brings you somewhere else, there is ALWAYS a portal, which just shows how lazy the level design is, there are no believable connections to other places, which is even more ridiculous because you are always in combine facilties anyway! Also the areas dont seem to serve any purpose, there are always some random energy things and other machines. Also why are there so many ♥♥♥♥ing soldiers anyway? Do they expect a war or what? Why would the combine place so many troops in places like that where they wouldnt expect any person ever.\n\nWhat pisses me off the most is how the mod throws some really cheap wannabe fan service at you. For example why the ♥♥♥♥ do we even play as Shephard? There is no ♥♥♥♥ing reason for it. Your name could be Han Solo and it would be the exact same game. The developer just made you shephard so you can think "ooh we are shephard how cool is that!". Why would the vortigaunts or gman or whatever choose shephard anyway and why help Gordon, he doesnt need help, you dont affect Half-Life 2's storyline at all, so it doesnt make sense. Also if the developer really wanted me to be shephard, he could at least put some effort into it and give me a wrench instead of a crowbar, but that would mean that he has to do custom content so of course not.\n\nFor a short time in the mod you visit Xen, also, doesnt make ANY sense, and Xen looks ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ TERRIBLE!!! It looks even worse than in Half-Life 1, it doesnt even look like Xen, just some ugly rocks, and again, why are there combine soldiers? What are they doing there?\n\nYou know, I could go on and on why this mod pisses me off so much, but it pisses me off SO MUCH, that I wil just stop.\nThe icing on the cake is that it costs 10€. Do you know how many awesome indie games there are for 10€??? This game is even hard to recommend if it was free. There are so many free Half-Life 2 maps and mods which are WAAAAAY better.\n\nOh btw, the writing, voice acting and story are ♥♥♥♥ing terrible and completely pointless.\n\nDont buy this.","February 18","false","1.2"," 631 of 748 people (84%) found this review helpful 67 people found this review funny","84","631","748","67","113"

FREE MOD have better immersion than this one overpaid. Its not bad but not worth the price - wait till sale.\n\nWhy bad?\n1) regular boring combine shooter (some antlions at start)\n2) well done but still boring locations\n3) teleports, teleports everywhere\n4) Xen? Whats the point to go there?\n5) Broken subtitles\n6) no achievements, empty menu option\n7) too short for such price\n\nEDIT:\nI would like to lighten some of the issues about my quick review (It took me two minutes to write).\nI was overwhelmed by s***post comments, which I removed for good of authors who when they grow up they wont be ashamed of what they wrote. Now to the point:\n\nAnnotation to point 1)\nThe game is one hundred percent shooter and offers nothing more than a continuous shooting at combine soldiers. Sometimes hordes of enemies on higher difficulty levels are quite a challenge.\n\nAnnotation to point 2)\nMaps are done well but... Boring! Incredibly boring and overexposed while initial levels are in turn very dark. Prison looks like HL2 prision nothing to add here but rest of game is like never ending nightmare with ugly textures from the last chapter of HL2 and narrow corridors. There are no oryginal puzzles. At one stage, we have to overcome the obstacle course made of lasers. On the others simply press the button to open the door. All about puzzles.\n\nAnnotation to point 3)\nStages in the game are divided by portals. As the main character without much purpose you runs in random portals. No one explains you in any way why you do it and what you have to do on other side to help Freeman. Yup you are helping Freeman. Dunno how.\n\nAnnotation to point 4)\nXen is ugly and I do not understand why there is a squad of fully geared soldiers. They should die of boredom in there. One of s***posters wrote me something like "Its a continuation of OpFor and that why main character goes to XEN" and something about that i never played OpFor. Ok now its all clear.\n\nAnnotation to point 5)\nSubtitles and main character. Subtitles are different from what we hear, especially and only when we hear schizophrenic flashbacks which are intended to inform us of who we play. I dont get it. I still pretend to play He-man dressed in a green hev suit. it really does not matter who you play because you absolutely wont feel like Adrian Shephard.\n\nAnnotation to point 6)\nIf there is no achievements why keep this option in the menu? I got the idea for achievement: Beat game in less than two hours and for up to two weeks after purchase. After that go refund.\n\nAnnotation to point 7)\nFor just only music, randomly combined levels and some particles the price of 10 euro is overrated. As i wrote before many free mods are much much better. Starting from Black Mesa (free mod), Riot Act, The Citizen, Human Error and many more. Even similar mod The Awakening looks better with its plot. The argument that the game was made by one person in no way explains the very high price. Even if the game would be done by a disabled child and the amount of the sale will support the orphanage its still does not make the game good.\n\nP.S.\nYes i refunded and I am happy that I did it","February 18","false","1.6"," 258 of 317 people (81%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","81","258","317","11","2"

However, the fact that this mod was made alone shows A LOT.\n\nLet's start with the plot: You take control of Adrian Shepard, the same person tasked to hunt down Gordon Freeman during Half-Life: Opposing Force. After being saved from the G-Man by the Vortiguants, (much like they did for Gordon in Half-Life 2: Episode 1), they give you the rundown on what you've missed since being put into stasis. After giving you your mission, you're dropped into Nova Prospekt. For the record, this game takes place during Half-Life 2, when Gordon is trying to rescue Eli Vance. However, the only problem is that you don't make much of an impact. The only reference you get to Gordon's presence is the destroyed teleporter him and Alyx used to get to Kleiner's Lab. After that, the mod goes nowhere. So the plot isn't that great.\n\nNow the voice acting and gameplay: The voice acting is great. It shines in 4 ways:\n\n1. The Vortiguants when they free you from G-Man at the beggining of the game.\n\n2. The US Marines in Shepard's squad that you have memories of throughout the game. (Think of them as the Cortana cutscenes you see throughout the Halo 3 missions.)\n\n3. The Combine throughout the game.\n\n4. Your Powered Combat Vest. (Yes, it has it's own unique voice)\n\nSo in terms of voice acting, in my opinion, is on par with that of an actual VALVe game.\n\nThe gameplay is great too, but there are a few gripes. Specifically, the Combine. When the developer says "New AI improvements" he was NOT kidding. They just eat your bullets, even on Easy. And I think Richard Seabrook, the creator of this mod, intended that because you're given extra ammo reserves (Ex. In Half-Life 2, the Pulse Rifle ammo caps at 90 bullets, or 3 clips, with on clip holding 30 bullets. In Prospekt, it caps at 150 bullets, or 5 clips) So he most likely knew this.\n\nThis game also has same length as Half-Life 2: Episode 1, so it's a decently large mod.\n\nNow, for the Locations: You visit 3 locations, not counting the areas you're teleported to for a short period of time:\n\n1. Nova Prospekt\n\n2. An Orbital Facility\n\n3: Xen\n\nWhile the first 2 are done well, the return to Xen was an extreme letdown. You're only there for only 5-6 minutes. You spend more time at Nova Prospekt and the Orbital Facility.\n\nFinally, the Music. Holy Crap, the music in this is amazing. Every track in this mod fits with it's location. I'd buy this off of iTunes if it was avaible.\n\nOverall, this mod is a mixed bag, and isn't really worth the $9.99. Unless you're really thirsty for a new Half-Life game, I'd wait for this to go on sale. Richard, you did a great job and I did have fun playing it; but for your next project, try and get a few more people to help you.","February 19","false","4.6"," 158 of 183 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","158","183","4","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trupayne75/recommended/399120/","trupayne75","TruPayne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trupayne75/","168 products in account","Prospekt is a standalone game based in the Half-Life universe running on the Source engine with assets granted by Valve and created by one man: Richard Seabrook. I was very excited to try the game out, it is roughly 3 hours in length and the player controls Adrian Shephard, the protagonist of the Half-Life: Opposing Force expansion originally created by Gearbox Software.\n\nIs Prospekt worth its asking price of 10 USD? My answer is no.\n\nProspekt suffers from a few fatal flaws: First the familiar Combine soldiers have increased health and feel like bullet sponges now. A double shotgun blast doesn’t always kill them and battles can be very frustrating, further exacerbated by the next flaw, the level design: there are too many places with no cover. Most areas are either narrow hallways that make for great chokepoints for enemies to swarm you, or they are too open and have little to no cover. There is one battle in particular:  in the area where it's revealed that you’re on a space station orbiting Earth  where you get attacked by lots of soldiers at once and the only cover is one small spot at the foot of two staircases where you can easily get trapped and die as I did several times before I eventually got through after much frustration. If the crossbow was included this might not have been so bad. There was no good long range weapon besides the magnum and in the areas where the levels were long and narrow the omission of the crossbow was keenly felt. Xen didn’t need to be included either, the 5 minute jaunt through Xen felt shoehorned and pointless. The story is also confusing, we’re told that Shephard is being teleported to Nova Prospekt to aid Gordon Freeman in his attack on the prison during Half-Life 2, but after that this plotline is dropped completely and what’s left are just flashbacks to Shephards time in HECU leading up to the fateful day of the Black Mesa Incident. The ending left me quite confused as to what I’d just accomplished.\n\nSo what was good then? The music was good, the voice acting was competent, and the added particle effects were a nice touch. In my opinion the “City 17 citadel interior“ is one of the Half-Life universe’s blandest settings so I didn’t love the look of the interior levels with that aesthetic, but I will admit they were well designed visually and looked as good as the citadel interior in Half-Life 2.\n\nMy final score of this game is 5/10. It’s very average. I will say that since this is a paid game and not just a free mod, me and others are going to naturally judge this more harshly than we would a free mod so don’t get discouraged Rich. I hope my review was helpful and I wish you the best of luck on your next game.\n","February 20","false","1.7"," 92 of 105 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","92","105","2","3"

The game, which I speeded through admittedly, took me 82 minutes. An hour and 22 minutes. One of the things I can appreciate in this game is the skins of the Combine soldiers, the level design in the later levels (Specifically past Xen) and the voice acting in the flashbacks.\n\nThe Vortigaunts sound like a half-hearted job at replicating Akama from WoW, and sound horribly wheezy. The Combine Soldiers have a strange filter that is nowhere close to the one in HL2, it makes me wonder why he even bothered to add the new ones. They sound like Super-Battle-Droids from Republic Commando, in all honesty. On top of that, some of the gameplay even on Normal is straight up unforgiving.\n\nThe Xen chapter, which is I believe a single level, looks quite bad. It is a combination of three to five asteroids that float about in empty space, along with horribly transluscent crystals attached to unexplained Combine apparatuses.\n\nThe particle effects, however, are outright beautiful, admittedly.\n\nThe viewmodel hands, which should naturally be new, are the same. Nothing different sans the color, which is just desaturated.\n\nThere are no new weapons in this game. All of them are the same. There are no new models for the weapons, nor any replacements.\n\nThere are no new mechanics in this game either, the only redeeming factor for this point is the end battle, which is pretty satisfying from my standpoint.\n\nTo sum up:Pros\n+Good level design and attention to detail in the later levels, specifically the Combine base\n+Somewhat engaging final battle\n+Beautiful Particle Effects\n+Alright Flashback cutscenesCons\n-Poor level design in most other areas, some even seems to be pulled and retouched from HL2\n-Downright too challenging at times, either due to a lack of ammo or health, or too many enemies\n-Poor voice-acting in some cases (Vortigaunts)\n-Poor sound design in others(Combine Soldier voices, Overwatch(Why is it male??!?!?!))\n-Horribly short playtime for a $10 game\n\nI do not recommend this game unless it is on sale, and even then am I reluctant.","February 18","false","1.4"," 89 of 111 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","89","111","6","3"

Just like most mods it takes the incredients of the origianls and build some basic levels for you to shoot your way through but gives you little else. The levels are rather bland and somber really every time you open a door you give a sigh of despair. Not another corridor. Not another huge room.\n\nDo not expect anything like the level of writing of emersion that Half-life 1 & 2 have though. The intro is long, poorly written and over the top in its set up of the game. It lost my interest before I started playing which is not a good thing. There is no story really you get annoying flashbacks that make it seem like Shepard is having an epileptic seizure whilst never really knowing why you are doing what you are doing or going where you are going. It's more like Sonic than Half-Life just get to the end of the game. Thats it.\n\nThen you get into the game quickly gather weapons and encountering enemies fast, too fast. To be honest the difficulty level is rather high early on again a problem with the writing and pacing of the game. You get enjoyment from games by building up your skills from easy in the start of the game, maybe getting killed a few times along the way but you learn and feel you are improving. This game totally ignores this.\n\nNew players will stop playing in out right annoyance at being killed again and again. One of the best things about all Valve games is that they make you feel like a gaming genius for completing tasks even though what you are doing is easy. This game just throws hot s*@# at you and if you don't like it then well tough s*@#. Throwing endless enemies at you with no ryhme or reason is not rewarding and not clever. It's annoying and lazy.\n\nAnother example is this game would have us beleive that Shepard is basiclly killing most of the Combine soldiers in Nova Prospekt while Gordon is chilling out with the ant lions smoking a cigar. The Combine would throw everything at Freeman not Shepard he is Anti Citizen One. Therefore logic dictates that Shepard would have a slightly easier time of it than this game suggests and the Combine certainly would not just throw endless numbers of troops at him. Lack of logical thinking.\n\nTo be honest I'm suprised this game has got the hype it has and am even more suprised its been released on steam. Black Mesa deserved its realease for all its bad points it did at some level feel like Half-Life even if it was only in a few places.\n\nI didn't have high hopes for this dispite some saying it's cannon but I'm sorry to say it's only a mod and not a very good one at that.\n\nI wouldn't spend money on this if I were you even though it doesn't cost much. Your far better off just replaying the old games if you need a Half-life fix.\n\nHats off to Richard Seabrook for trying and I hope he gets his job at Valve but I'm sorry this game is poor. Depressing, boring, repetative and annoying are the emotions I felt playing it. Maybe I'm just getting old.\n\nThe hype around this game and the fact that it was made in the first place is a direct result of the absence of the game we do not mention.\n\nThe biggest and most worrying issue that this game has is not that it's rubbish. It's the fact it has been attached to the greatest game franchise in history and is now considered by many to be cannon. Crap HL mods are made all the time but why in the name of sanity has this one been given special treatment by Valve. Very worrying.\n\nWe are still waiting Gabe.\n\n5 out of 10 - Good effort but don't give up the day job.

Bad level design: There is a lot, like 98% of the game, that consist in arena gunfighting on every map, or at least, stretch corridors with bare to none cover when there is fight of 5 combines vs. the player, with impasses to refill health, shield and ammo. Also, there is a lack of explanation or player guidance to do objectives, its blindly pushing buttons and see what happens.\n\n2. Bad distribution of difficulty: The game starts slow paced, with some puzzling elements, the first 10 minutes at least, when you get the crowbar and pistol, you need to fight Antillions (but they have less HP than a headcrab) and then on a tiny tiny tiny space, 3 zombines with grenades, only to get right away the Shotgun and the SMG.\n\n3. Bulletsponge Combine: It was really necessary to raise the HP of the Combine soldiers at a point that a MOUSE2 headshot with the Shotgun or a FULL magazine of SMG can't kill them? And was really necessary to do encounters with 3 to 20 combines at the same time waving from all places?\n\n4. There is NO STORY: At the start you are on stasis by Vortigaunt and they say "Go, help Freeman on Nova Prospekt", and then poof, there you are. There is a lot of annoying bloom effects that interferes with the gameplay and some voiceover of the fellow marines of Shepard. Ending with a neverending fight running in circles pushing buttons and killing waves and waves of Combines, just to get teleported and then Gman appears, kills the Vortigaunts with his "super bubble of reflection" then boops you and makes and evil face. THE END. No explanation, no prisoners on the cell blocks, no Freeman cameo, nothing. Even at Opposing Force, Shepard gets a quick look at Gordon, but here... nothing.\n\nI bought this at pre-order just because all the ♥♥♥♥ of: "I spent two years working on them, and I was alone." and my inner game developer soul felt the need to support. Sadly, right now, I feel this was a SCAM.\nThis is clearly a mod that needed to be FREE not PAID. Even Black Mesa had the decorum to first launch it free and then at EARLY ACCESS because they know they need to improve it.\n\nMost of this mod its a lot of rooms made with a "Copy + Paste" technique and plastered a lot of enemies on them, and somehow this will had better reception as a Sven-Coop kind of campaign or Garry's Mod thing more than a standalone paid game.\n\nSadly, I can't ask a refund because the time I played and the time I had it on my library, but If I can, I will ask my 8 dollars back.\n","February 23","false","5.8"," 54 of 67 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","54","67","2","2"

Finally, what could be considered a new game in the Half-Life series! Greenlit by Valve themselves and considered to be a sequel to Opposing force! I’ve always been an advocate for paid mods. Some people pour their heart and soul into a mod, and I have no problem with them being paid for that hard work. But with Prospekt, I honestly can't say its worth the price tag.\n\nWhere do I begin?\n\nFirstly Il start with the positives. This game looks, and sounds amazing. The environments look incredibly detailed, and work well with the overall atmosphere. I especially like the Combine areas which I honestly think look better than some of the Combine areas in Half-Life 2. The voice acting is also pretty good, which is a rarity with community made mods for Half-Life games. It’s clear to me that the developer knows how to create some beautiful looking environments in the Source Engine.\n\nUnfortunately when we look at the overall level design, this game is pretty poor. I have three major complaints about this game. Firstly, it’s incredibly boring. Pretty much the entire game is just run through corridors and rooms shooting combine. That’s it. I have seen a few people saying that "Well isn't that what Half-Life is anyway?" not really. If you look at Half-Life 2, it has a variety of enemies, environments and different situations that the player has to progress through. Even Half-Life 1 had a more varied cast of enemies which all fought differently. for pretty much 90% of this game you're just shooting combine with the same weapons, in the same situations, in the same poorly designed levels. Which brings me to my next complaint.\n\nThe levels are horribly designed. They look pretty don’t get me wrong, but they are so poorly thought out. Most of the firefights are done in big spacious rooms with little to no cover at all. The tactic I had to employ with pretty much every fight was either, fire at will and just hope I kill all the enemies before they pump me with too many bullets, or wait around the corner to bottleneck them into coming at me single file. Which leads me onto the final big issue with Prospekt.\n\nThe combine AI. One of the impressive parts of the combine soldiers in Half-Life 2 was how they worked in battle. They would use cover effectively and take turns to pop out and shoot the player. They would try to nudge you out of cover with grenades, and generally worked together as a squad. The combine in Prospekt however, instead decide to just charge straight at you, all guns blazing until either you or they are dead. This leads to some very silly fights where I use my previously mentioned “Bottleneck” tactic where one combine walks around the corner, and gets killed with my shotgun. Then the next soldier walks around the corner and gets a shell to the head as well. So does the next, and the next, and the next, and none of them seem to question “Hmm I wonder if he’s waiting round there to kill us? Maybe we should try a different tactic?” To be honest there isn’t much more you can really do with the combine in these environments. Theres practically no cover for them to utilise and sometimes theres just so many combine piled into one room that they might as well just charge straight at you.\n\nThere are a few other niggles I have with the game as well. There are several flashback sequences that happen throughout the game, where we hear some of Adrian’s past in the military. These begin to happen less as the game goes on but, to be honest there doesn’t seem to be much point to them other than at the beginning.\n\nAnother gripe I have is that for some reason the developer has changed the skin for the shotgun combine soldier to look either the same or very similar to the regular combine soldier. Half-Life 2 originally had both types of combine look the same, but Valve eventually changed the shotgun wielding ones to have red eyes and wear a slightly different looking uniform. That was done so that the player could differentiate between the different types of soldiers, as the shotgun ones can deal quite a lot of damage. Which makes me wonder why the developer has decided to reverse this decision for what seems like no reason.\n\nThe final thing I want to talk about is the final battle. If you don’t want any spoilers then feel free to skip next few paragraphs. The final battle had me so lost and frustrated I had to resort to using god mode and noclip. The whole premise is that you have to overload this reactor thing. I’m not sure what it was exactly because the game didn’t really make it clear to me what it actually was. And to be honest it didn’t really make it clear what I was supposed to do either. There are four buttons spaced out around the core and you have to press all of them to overload it. However combine soldiers begin to flood in and they will try to press the buttons again and turn them back on.\n\nThe problem I have with this segment is that, I’m not exactly sure whether I am doing it correctly. I press all of the buttons down and the screen flashes white about 50 times blinding me, but I’m not sure whether the combine have unpressed one yet or not. It seems that when they do, they don’t unpress immediately. They seem to take a few seconds which in that time you can’t go and press it down, until the lights have gone green again. I’m also not sure if you have to keep the combine from unpressing them for a few seconds afterwards, or whether you just have to press all the buttons at once and that’s it. Basically the game didn’t really communicate what I was supposed to be doing very well.\n\nThe other issue with the final battle is how ridiculously difficult it is. As the battle goes on, more and more combine flood into the reactor and it eventually gets to a point where theres just too many to fight off. It doesn’t help that there is pretty much no cover at all, and the narrow platforms you have to walk across to get to each button have no hand railings, so one false move and you fall to your death. And the screen flashing white every few seconds doesn’t help either.\n\nIn conclusion, Prospekt is not worth the money. I have played much better community mods than this that are free. It makes me start to wonder what Valve is doing with the Half-Life licence because honestly, this is not the kind of game that they should be giving that licence to. Any developer from Valve could see that this game has some serious design issues, but then again considering Steam’s awful lack of quality control, I wouldn’t be too surprised if the only thing Valve looked at in this were the visuals. It just worries me that Steam’s zero quality control is now spilling into Valve’s own licences. Especially Half-Life. I understand that this is developed by one man, and to be honest, he’s done a good job with what he’s clearly good at. Environments. The visuals in this game actually rival Half-Life 2 in a lot of ways. But I think this game would have been considerably better if there was another person on the team who was good with level design, as that seems to be this game’s main flawl. Overall, I cannot recommend.","February 25","false","2.9"," 39 of 49 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","39","49","3","2"

I guess the best thing I can say about Prospekt is that its concept is well executed, and that there is at least a portion of the game that really ties in with the Half-Life 2 spirit...\n\nBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT\n\n1) The game is too hard, even on normal. I couldn't count how many times I double-barrel shot a combine in the head TWICE before he had to die...\n2) The level design, is ludicrous. You are being pitched against waves of combine after every door and elevator with NO WAY TO HIDE.\n3) The voice-overs, although high in quality, sound too amateur to be convincing and disconnect the original Half-Life spirit from Prospekt.\n4) Buttons, buttons and buttons.\n5) The story, which each time triggers an incredibly annoying effect as you recall flashbacks from the past, is underdeveloped, but it's not the main part of the game as it focusses heavily on combat, just don't expect a satisfying tale that will move or motivate you in any significant way.\n\nThe ending is mediocre and almost a carbon copy of the beginning if you look at it from a distance. I have to say I really welcome and applaud the additional combine machinery design that can be found across the levels, and the smart use of the cubemaps. My favorite level was the teleport level, even though it just repeated the same button idea all over again.\nSoundtrack is excellent, one of the closest things that could absolutely fit in an original Half-Life game, as much as the actual sound design.\n\nI would rate this game a 6/10.

I am an Opposing Force fan and i really loved the idea that there would be more story for Shephard in this game. Sadly there isn't . Most of the time it felt like there was no story at all. You are just running through rooms full of combine and pressing buttons and going to another room full of combines and then teleporting to a next area and repeating all that again.\n\nThe flashback events about Shephards past were interesting yet annoying as they screw up the screen with the photonegative filter. Also the bright flashesh at the end were really frustrating as those got me killed multiple times simply because i could not see where i was going or where the enemy is.\n\nI don't recommend paying the full price for this game since there really isn't anything special in this one.

The author wasn't accepted but Gabe liked the mod so Valve ended up helping him and ended up being a paid HL2 mod after buying the licenses. Now on to the review.\n\nMy first disappointment is going to be the level design. I expected the maps to reach the same quality HL2 had or even HL2:EP2. I think I good portion of the maps could be recreated within GoldSource with "env_model" and sometimes there are no "clue" or "hint" to guide the player. For example, you arrive at an area where you have to press a button, then you have have an infinite antlion spawning behind your ♥♥♥ and you end up wasting 3/4 of your ammo before running everywhere and finding out you have to play Super Mario Bros to reach a ventilation shaft.\n\nSecond disappointment is the gameplay, you just run, shoot a lot of Combines, solve puzzles, listen to Shephard's flashbacks, repeat. There are very few variety in enemies, 98% of Combine, 2% of Headcrab, zombies, antlions. I was playing in Hard but I had to go down to Easy because the mod's author had the "great" idea of giving twice health to NPCs and not a little bonus for yourself. Seriously, emptying a clip of pistol in a Combine's head don't kill him on Hard. And speaking of weapons, the only arsenal you have is the standard HL2 weaponry without some weapons like the crossbow and RPG. I've finished the game (almost by speed-running) in almost 2 hours so I expect professional speed-runners finishing it in 1 hour and 30 minutes.\n\nThird disappointment is the story, you are told at the beginning to help Freeman stuck in Nova Prospekt and you just hear some Shephard's flashbacks of his story before he get involved in the Black Mesa incident, that's all. Where is the powerful narrative element that we all loved in Half-Life ? There is none. There isn't a single friendly NPC.\n\nFourth disappointment concern technical aspects, I've already tried to validate the game cache and all but it seems that when you run the game on Low settings, you get the magnificent black/purple texture of Source, and let's not forgot how my eyes just bleed when looking at the game files.\n\nI tried to find positive things to note but I didn't found any. Prospekt is just a paid map pack and a huge disappointment for those who liked Adrian Shephard and wanted to have a good time with him.","February 18","false","2.3"," 44 of 62 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","44","62","0","0"

That means no new enemies, weapons, or characters, and if there were new props or textures, I didn't notice them. On top of that, there is very, *very* little variety in the map design and enemy encounters; I hope you really like shooting down endless numbers of Combine soldiers in metal hallways, because that is 95% of what you do in Prospekt.\n\nThis lack of character permeates the "story" Prospekt (barely) trys to tell as well. There has been a bit of hype flying around that this was, finally, a real narrative sequel to Half-Life: Opposing Force, and that we would finally get to once again lace up the combat boots of Marine Corporal Adrian Shepherd after the disaster at Black Mesa. Yeah, no. Prospekt opens with an introductory sequence telling us that we are Corporal Shepherd, and we must assist Gordon Freeman at the Combine prison complex Nova Prospekt. From there, we are dumped into an environment modeled on the Nova Prospekt maps from Half-Life 2, and the story proceeds to go absolutely nowhere for the entirety of the mod's runtime. There are some well-acted flashback sequences in which Shepherd recalls conversations with fellow Marines prior to the Black Mesa deployment, but they go over only information we already know, and add nothing but a little bit of production value to the proceedings. If you want an Opposing Force 2, this is not it. Not even close.\n\nSo essentially, you have an average, hobbyist-quality Half-Life 2 fan mod, except that to play this one, you need to fork over $10. That makes Prospekt an absolutely terrible value, especially when you consider that you can download longer and more interesting mods, with more original content, completely for free.\n\nSkip this, and play any of the high quality, free HL2 mods instead.

This game has so much potential but has simple problems that really hold it back to make it a really frustrating experience. The biggest one that everyone talks about is the doubled health of all of the enemies, it really is a big problem that makes combat drag out more than it needs to. I dont mind more difficulty, but it should be a fun creative hard, not just a simple health ugrade. Another problem is the level design, it really makes the shooting sections drag out even more; a lot of the areas were just corridors, a hall full of enemies, more corridors, repeat, without the tasteful design that makes Half-Life 2 so great. There isnt a lot of variety here and I was more tired of going through the game then I was looking forward to it. The story is simple but it works. I really liked the voice overs from Shepards past, even though it is not canon it does at a lot to Shepards character and just the overall lore, it was a neat idea, I really liked the music too, I would definitely get this in a soundtrack form. Overall this game just left me disapointed, its ten dollars but its designed like a poorly done Half-Life mod. Its crazy that there are some fantastic mods for both Half-Life and Half-Life 2, yet this one, over many other greats, get greenlit.

Even then, afterwards there is little to no context as to what is going on besides flashbacks and Gman occasionally pretending to jump scare you for a split second.\n\nThe Gameplay?\nIt can be summed up in one way: Run, Gun, Press Button, Enter an Exit, Repeat. With the occasional puzzles that are only intended to make sure you die in the game at least once or twice to them if you weren't already killed enough by the machine gun posts that you encounter in Nova Prospekt.\n\nThe Graphics?\nWell besides everything having unneeded reflections, most of the game is just re-used Half-Life 2 assets, with the exception of the many fancy particle effects that have been added, while pretty neat, is let down by how old the Half-Life 2 assets really are in terms of quality.\n\nThe Characters?\nThe only form of characters you can get from this game are from the flashback moments while moving through the campaign, which explain about the events of Sheperds career until the Black Mesa incident, although, I don't recall the Black Mesa VO for Barney being present in the military and the VO for the Vortigans make me believe that I've been summoned into an ASMR.\n\nThe Conclusion?\nOverall, this game is average at best, it felt like the first part of it was just tacked on to get Valve's attention, afterwards it just turns into a generic HL2 mod, while it's harsh to hear, that's the impression I got. I only recommend getting this if you really cannot withstand your thrist for more Half-Life related content as it's honestly just a let down to the game's name.","February 20","false","1.9"," 25 of 34 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","25","34","2","0"

The mapping is often blocky and inelegant, although the environments do get fairly pretty later on. There's a lot of gorgeous Combine architecture on display, and Xen makes an all-too short appearance. That aside, nothing about the map design suggests anything more than a utilitarian urge to drive the player further and further into incredibly difficult gunfights.\n\nYour main reason for avoiding this should be to save yourself the frustration of having to play it.\n\nIf you insist on paying for this, please play it on normal. Or easy. You will save yourself a few headaches. I had to cheat in order to prevail during the last fight on Hard mode, and I was seriously tempted to cheat earlier on but managed to save scum my way through until the end. You will often be in critically short supply of health, armor, and ammo, while having to face nigh-inexhaustible hordes of Combine troops. I try not to exaggerate - Prospekt is intense and unforgiving. You can easily find yourself in a losing battle if you don't carefully ration supplies, or even if you're simply unlucky. Actually, if any of that appeals to you, go ahead and get it, but be warned and all that.\n\nStory? Meh. There's a threadbare plot about you helping Freeman through Nova Prospekt, which is advertised as though it makes up the bulk of the mod. That is a vicious lie - you will spend most of your time fighting through Combine facilities which all look suspiciously similar. You'll also experience the joy of Adrian Sheperd's post-traumatic reminiscences about the lead up to the events of Opposing Force, wherein his squadmates complain a lot and speculate whether the G-Man is gay. Once again, I am not kidding. None of this is relevant in any way to what goes on during the actual game, which is really the biggest issue here.\n\nThe voice acting is good, though.\n\nWhat else? Nothing, really. I found this profoundly exhausting to play. I felt like I'd been physically assaulted once I was done, and almost automatically sought out the refund process on Steam; but alas, I had been playing for just over three hours, and am now stuck with my regret. Let that be a lesson to you, fair reader, and keep browsing!\n\nIn fairness and in closing, I'll once again say that if incredibly difficult combat appeals to you, definitely get this. You'll find a battle worthy of you. If not, give 'er a miss.\n\n6/10","February 18","false","3.3"," 31 of 45 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","31","45","2","0"

Apart from some narration in which the player is referred to as "Shephard", this could be any HL2 mod. There's nothing to tie ito OpFor in any real way.\n\nCongrats for the guy who made it single handedly over two years and got it for sale on Steam, but... it's really not that good. The Combine Citadel is the dullest part of HL2 - catwalks and shiny metal hallways, and two types of Combine enemies. Imagine that for basically the whole game. There's some Nova Prospekt prison areas, but none of the expansive exteriors of any of the HL games, episodes, or addons. A brief Xen area. A handful of headcrabs and even fewer headcrab zombies. Some antlions to shoot.\n\nNo new weapons or enemies, no friendly NPCs, no dialogue barring narration "flashbacks", no direction or plot, no idea what the goal around the corner is other than a long hallway and a button. Then another hallway, a gun battle, a button. I finally lost interest and god moded through just to see the end.\n\nThe closest things to bosses here are rooms of soldiers, or one encounter with Hunters. That's it.\n\nSorry.

It is not the latest installment of half life and there is no reason to judge so harshly on how the game was being developed, in my playthrough the only bug I could see was when the glass stairs turned invisible when you went behind them. I have to say the developer really did put a lot of hard work into making this game for the community which by the way he didn't have to continue the story of shepard, if he made the game as a custom story for the half life universe it still would have turned out great. The voice acting was very well done and so were the visuals with it being the source engine. I'll talk about xen and how suprised I was when I saw it, yes you weren't there for very long and it seemed to hold no purpose to the game itself but it is showing you how capable the engine is into making beautiful scenery. This is not the best mod out there and I do agree it would be worth less than $9.99 but I'm not going to go off and refund it if this guy plans on using the money to further his abilities into making games.

This developer needs all the money he can get so he can broaden his game design knowledge.\n\n\nIf you expect a semblance of coherent game design, do not buy this game.

There is a sign of passion from the creator who made this game that wanted to be shown here. I pre-ordered this when it first came known to the public. Sadly, I cannot reccomend this game at $10. The idea of playing Cpl Shepard is a really good idea but the idea fell short for many reasons. My biggest problem was the story felt very uncomplete, you are one place to another and you have no idea what is going on. The background story of Shepard hearing his past is scripted and voiced very nicely, but does not feel that it adds anything to story. I went in with questions about the story and I came out with more questions. How did this help Freeman? What was the backstory for? Too many unanswered questions for a 2 hour game.\n\nGame play feels like Half-Life 2 (which is good), the maps were very cool to look at, and I love the voice acting.

Shepards arms are just a reskin of the HEV suit, no new guns, nothing new honestly. except the voices.\n\nI really wanted this to be good for the creator, but this feels unpolished and very borning due to the not big changes in the game.

You have no idea why you are there and what your end goal is.  I am not even sure what I did in the last level.  I blew something up, but no idea what it did or why I blew it up.\n\nBugs\nI had the game crash a few times.  Also ever time there was a load, it would have some kind of error pop up about a no more graph or something.\n\nAmmo/health\nAmmo is everywhere but only for about 3 guns.  Want to use that rocket launcher?  You can't because when you get it there are only 3 shots and there are no more around until the end.

It really captures that "Half-Life" style.\n-There were some really great parts, such as the beginning and when you see Earth. These parts made me feel like I was playing a Valve game\n-The flashbacks to Shepard's friends were cool. They gave him more character.\n\nThe Bad Parts:\n-It's too short. If the game had more time, then maybe it's parts wouldn't seem so rushed.\n-It's very repetitive. All the fights were ambushes and you only fight combine.\n-Too much fighting. You never have time to rest and take in what's happening.\n-There's not really a story\n-The story has no affect on Half-Life 2\n-Why was Gordon in trouble and how did the events of this game help him?

Being me, I decided to invest my money into a preorder of the game and sadly, the game turned out to be very disappointing.\n\nProspekt starts off strong with Freeman’s vortigaunt allies requesting Corporal Shepard (you) to help Freeman in Nova Prospekt (The prison from Half-Life 2). After a while of navigating dark corridors and an underground sewer that houses a power generator, you reach a point in the game where the game is no longer story focused but becomes a single player shooter which derails the storyline goal that this game has tried to achieve.\n\nOf course, Prospekt does try to bring you in the story element into the game by having occasional flashbacks that the character (you) experiences, these flashbacks mostly range from members in the army (from Opposing force) telling about their normal life, training and even the Black Mesa incident (where Half-Life: Opposing force begins). But other than the flashbacks, this game could be easily mistaken for a first person shooter.\n\nAs well as this, the mapping of Prospekt is mostly bad. The only maps are good is once you reach deeper into the prison and then go and get teleported to another dimension and then to a huge combine space station. But this being said, the scripting elements of the maps are just as bad; During Prospekt, you will witness some bugs with the maps - such as map scripts and triggers being put in places which make you go back and forth to a location just for the game to recognise that you have done something - and some logical errors such as buttons being too small or placed in an akward angle for the player to interact with. The only good thing with the scripting is that the enemy NPCs undo some of your actions which is ok.\n\n(Before reading this part; Of course, I do not want to hate on Richard for sacrificing his fulltime job to do this - he has clearly shown that he is dedicated and has built the game from the ground up which is good) While this may seem bad, Prospekt’s developer - Richard Seabrook - had quit his fulltime job to work a smaller hours job in order to get the time and funding he desperately needed to create the game and had even created a briefcase with the lambda logo spray painted onto it and shipped it to Valve's HQ containing the first version of the game (this may explain why Valve gave its approval).\n\nMy last word on this game is that it is disappointing to see what was a good storyline from opposing force to be ripped away and derailed to become a first person shooter with hardly any storyline (apart from the flashbacks).","February 19","false","4.0"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

Hope they are useful.\n(+) The majority of the levels is really memorable. The design of the locations is outstanding! Best I've seen so far in Source. Even a short low gravity level!\n(+) It's 100% Half Life but from a different angle. I mean although you recognize the general combine design and the HL2 models it feels very fresh and unique\n(+) Combine Soldiers throw grenades at you more often. The mechanic to throw them back becomes very important!\n(+) Sometimes good, sometimes even great voice acting\n(+) Music and Soundeffects are really fitting. At one point I actually paused to think "Man, he'd chosen this really good"\n(~) You're gonna kill more Combine soldiers than in the entire Half Life series. It's just intense\n(~) It's an incredible challenge. Increasing difficulty with each level. Everytime you think that this was the final you proceed into the next level\n(~) Focuses more on action and visuals instead of a coherent story("~" means it's up to you wether this point is a good or bad thing. I liked those.)\n(-) No new great über weapon that spices up the combat. It feels like it is a SMG/shotgun only game. Hope someone is going to mod it (Replacement for shotgun maybe) EDIT: There is such a HL2 mod that also works in Prospekt. It worked for me.\n(-) [For non native speakers] The sound filters used on the voices made it very hard for me to understand. Captions are broken. [26. Feb. 2016]\nI think this is the second best HL2 - like game out there. Black Mesa and 1187 are better\nbut they lost resemblance to HL2.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thepastisbeyondrecovery/recommended/399120/","thepastisbeyondrecovery","Vic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thepastisbeyondrecovery/","690 products in account","Where to start with Prospekt? It's great to see another Half-Life game/mod on Steam, even if it's paid (there's no problem with that, though). It's not exactly a bad game, but it does have issues that leave it on the whole, rather lackluster. But in light of the recent update released on the 21st of April, it's gone from a very poor and unsatisfying experience to something a lot more consistent and a lot more presentable. Kudos to Rich for taking player feedback into account. And for all its faults, it has remarkably solid pacing and overall satisfying gameplay.\n\nThat said, there are a few aspects worth mentioning. First of all, the story design here is nothing to write home about it. The Vortigaunts' dialogue is poor, inconsistent, and simply doesn't sound like anything a Vortigaunt would say. Brevity is in short supply here, and the intro lasts much, much longer than it should, and gives us too much exposition we already know or don't need anyway.\n\nThere's also a blatant disregard for several story points in HL2, which the game contradicts without even explaining, and generally shoddy writing. Also, most of the opening scene seems to have been designed in keeping with a compulsive desire to spray copious amounts of post-processing and particles in your face. It's not eye-candy; and in fact it kind of hurt my eyes on top of going on for too long. Not good.\n\nThe voice acting is okay, but the writing really brings it down and while the new Combine soldiers' voicework sounds good, I don't know why all of it needed to be replaced (just so they could say "Shephard" once every combat scene?).\n\nLevel design suffers from a shortage of decent lighting and an abundance of poorly placed fog. Certain areas also haven't been logically or architecturally thought out very well. It's also poorly optimized, with frequent hangs and freezes, and every single map needs to have its nodes rebuilt at map launch. Visually, overall, there's some good ideas in there and sometimes it does work. When it does, it's not half-bad.\n\nOverall, there's not enough medkits and ammo in the levels and the ones that are there require you to go way too much out of your way. The game also throws a few too many soldiers at you in battles that take far, far too long. It also ends up feeling like a corridor crawl at times - all you do is enter another room, shoot 4 soldiers and then press a button. It's way too repetitive. In general, all you really do is fight soldiers and there's not much variety here.\n\nWith that in mind, I'd say that for a Half-Life mod, Prospekt is not much to write home about. In fact, it's mediocre. But since its dreadful state at launch, it has improved and it is an entertaining and fairly fun experience. It's not a golden standard of modding, but it gets the job done.","April 12","true","3.9"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","15","26","2","0"

No, this game has no like no plot at all. Fairly simple puzzles and alot of what feel like grind battles. There is no a single other character in the game you actually see..you do hear a few soldiers talking in flash backs...but you never team up with or even talk to anyone which for me is one of the things that make Half-life great.\n\nThere is no Opposing force weapons and it lacks most of the Half Life 2 special weapons...you get the basics..shotgun, AR, submachine gun...but no grab gun or portal gun...or any alien weapons. The Opposing force weapons like Sniper rifle and Light machine gun do not feature. You may have heard there is a trip to Xen well that's true but it lasts like 2 minutes and features none of the mobs you fought there before.\n\nIn short...for one person it's not a bad feature at all...but he really needed to team up with a few other people to add the depth needed to charge money for.

There's allot of really great set pieces, and as well there's a bunch of incredible new textures and particular effects used throughout the game. The soundtrack is great too! It captures the HL feel very nicely. I like the soundtrack in this game is much better than the tracks from Black Mesa imo.\nLighting was an issue. There's a dark ambience feel throughout the game, but there's allot of areas that are way too dark! So dark it's hard to see enemies or where to go. Also not enough usable of light to guide the player.\n\nGame PlayThe gameplay and map layouts are pretty bad. There's allot of very large and flat battle areas where you're being shot at from across the map. I've found there's consistently too much open space and not enough options to take cover. There's also parts of the game where there's way too many enemies to fight at once, especially when there's respawning enemies. it can be overwhelming and not very fun. Also didn't like how most of the fights you're start out by coming out of a elevator or doorway, which makes you feel cornered. imo not enough breaks from combat for puzzle solving, which is a staple of HL games. Lastly, come on.. no gravity gun ?!\n\nThe Story(minor spoils) You learn more about Shephard's past through flashbacks of conversations he had with he's Marian buddies. The flashbacks don't add to the current events in the game's story nor do they really build up to anything too significant. I thought the concept of flashbacks to discover Shephard's backstory was clever and had some potentially, but it doesn't really go anywhere. So It's abit of a letdown. The voice acting is pretty good though.\nOther then that the story is abit hard to follow. You start at Nova Prospekt, then teleport all around the place, to a Combine power station, an arctic setting, the window outside Dr.Kleiner's lab, stop off at Xen, and the Death Star.. where along the way you kill lots of Combine.\n\n\nPet Peeves:\n- You use the crowbar, not the wrench like in Opposing Force.\n- How do the combine know your name if the G-man just took you out of a stasis??\n- Character's call the G-man by his name.\n\n\nI actally had a good time playing through this game but, I have more negative things to say about it then not. It definitely does not have the superb 'Vavle quality' feel, but might be worth a playthrough if you're a fan of HL.  I'm honestly surprised Valve even approved this game to begin with..","February 19","false","3.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I appreciate that tons of hours have gone into making this game and yes it is full of Half-life goodness but no new goodness, same old Combine, headcrabs, Zombies and Nova Prospekt looks the same but has different areas. What I mean is - expect to see the prison almost exactly as it was in HL2 but obviously the maps are different.  There are a few very simple puzzles. Same weapons and controls. I was hoping  for something totally different like Opposing force was compared to Half-life. The developer is very talented and the game is polished with some new textures (I think) but nothing surprising in the way of exploration. Again a very linear experience as were previous Half-life games. Zombies with grenades running at you. The HUD is green a la OF because of the Shepard character but he shouldnt even have a crowbar. He should have a pipe wrench or Stilson wrench as it is known just like  Shepard had in OP.  Very dissapointing in many aspects but as I said, well made with almost no glitches. Its hard to criticise a game when you know the developer has spent many many hours of his time trying to bring a great game to us but the truth is that well... Its just not OP2. It doesnt feel like opposing force2 . OP1 had different creatures different weapons, it was a whole other experience but sadly this is not. Wait I havent played the whole game so hopefuly it will get better. I would not have paid for it if I had known it was just another HL2 Mod. I wonder what happened to that full mod of OP that died?  Black Mesa on he other hand was a totally new version of Half-life and really deserved to be greenlighted. Sorry if I sound harsh but I am a huge fan of HL1, 2 OP and Blue shift. This just isnt Opposing Force 2. In short. Dont waste your money although if you have never played a Half-life game then yes it is well worth the dollars. I saw many negative cmments about the Xen part f this mod and well I actually liked it although the health spa did not work as it did in HL1. You jump in and immediately your health is fully restored. No you should have to wait to be restored... gradually and it (the map) was very short. A couple of Grunts were frozen so I just plugged em till they dropped. This is where some new creatures would have made a great difference. I think this could have been a great game had the developer employed a team rather than just do it himself.","February 19","false","5.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

The author does a good job of balancing the need for interesting combat arenas with creating the feeling that these are real, working facilities. There's also a surprising amount of new assets.\n- The vast majority of the game is spent fighting Combine Overwatch troops, who I personally find more interesting than any other enemy type in the game.\n- Conforms to established Half-Life canon in all respects, as far as I can tell.\n- Balanced combat challenges mixed with occasional environmental puzzles. Lots of big, set-piece encounters. I was playing on easy, and I only died once (due to my own stupidity). Some of the larger battles would be quite murderously difficult on Hard, so there should be a good challenge if you like that sort of thing.\n- Weapons and ammo are fed to the player with great care, forcing you to vary your weapon use. This keeps things interesting.\n\nCriticism:\n- Voice acting is adequate at best. The Combine radio messages and the Vortigaunt dialogue is actually well-done. The problem lies with the periodic audio flashbacks where Shepard remembers times with his fellow Marines before Black Mesa. Those are well-written, but the actors voicing them lack a certain force of speech. In short, they do not sound like Marines; they sound like guys self-consciously trying to sound like Marines. Not a deal-breaker.\n- Only one encounter with Hunters in the whole game. Two or three more would not have gone amiss, IMHO.\n- Flashlight instead of night-vision. I actually preferred Shepard's NVGs to Gordon's and Barney's flashlights in Half-Life 1, so I was slightly disappointed. I'm guessing that it was too problematic to program in Source, so it's all good. :)","April 19","true","2.0"," 22 of 41 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","22","41","2","0"

Every bit as good as the original HL, HL2 and Episodes 1 & 2.\n+ Some excellent new graphics. The Source engine is really beginning to show it's age but Prospekt pushes it to the limit.\n+ Decent sound effects. As per spec for a Half Life game.\n+ Decent length for a HL mod. This won't be over in a couple of minutes (lost coast I'm looking at you.)\n\nAnd now the negatives:\n- Quake 1 called, 1995 wants its game design back. Large rooms filled with Combine soldiers. Find button or vent to crawl through. Enter corridor to next room. Fight hordes of Combine soldiers. Find button to enter corridor to next room. Rinse and repeat. Rooms, corridors and crates. This is game play straight out of Quake 1 or even Doom 2. Nothing remotely new or modern here at all.\n\n- Enemy soldiers have vastly increased health levels. Even an enemy grunt is now a massive bullet sponge. Other than making the large-scale fights in rooms pointlessly difficult, I'm not sure what the purpose of making all the enemies very difficult to kill was.\n\n- Lack of direction. Often it's necessary to find a button to push or a vent to crawl through, but what you need to do next is never adequately sign posted. Press-this-button-to-enter-this-room-then-press-this-button-to-enter-the-next-room. Again, game design straight out of the 1990's. Apparently the story in Prospekt is carefully integrated with HL2. Really? What story? How am I supposed to be helping Gordon by killing endless hordes of Combine soldiers?\n\nIn all fairness to the developer, Prospekt is far from being the disaster that some have described it as. It's fun for a couple of hours and really showcases the limits of what the Source engine can do, but the truly prehistoric game deisgn ultimately lets it down.

While I ain't sure if this canon story or not, I found it plausible and interesting, albeit the lack of characters, enemies and interactions with other aspects of the game.\n\nYou are "awaken" by the Vortigaunts in the start and sent into Nova Prospekt prison. Then, you mainly go into battle with Combine soldiers... except a few minutes of fights with Ant Lions in the Prospekt prison. Talking about that prison, the first 2 or 3 levels of this game, it is way WAY TOO DARK. Even with brightness to the max, it was hard to navigate. After the prison, you travel into a few portal, Xen (you get to visit Xen... for 5 minutes top... sadly.) and then the Orbital Station orbitting Earth.\n\nAnother gripe was that the Combine soldiers always were ready to fight you and ambush you. They come in waves against you all the time. I would have preferred if YOU, the player, could've have ambushed a few or taken a few soldiers unprepared alas, it wasn't.

The entire game is running through corridors, flipping an occasional switch, and shooting enemies that survive unrealistic amounts of firepower even on Easy mode.  The story beyond what you see in the opening is nonexistant; there are no puzzles or tricky points (unless you count how to survive being shot by Combine soldiers).  The high point of the entire thing, what this seems to be marketed on, is the return to Xen - but don't expect anything but Combine soldiers, or more than a single map that has you flip a couple of switches to return immediately to Earth's vicinity (okay, it's a space station - and it looks -exactly- like the location you left moments ago).  Unsurprisingly, it is filled with - you guessed it - Combine soldiers.\n\nThis is the only product I have ever purchased on Steam that I felt required a refund request, and I strongly recommend no one waste their money on this. No creativity was involved in the making of this 'game' and it shows.","February 21","false","1.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Why Valve did this? Because Valve wanted to put the player in a new situation that you can pick the weapons in an new order, put the experienced gamer with few weapons in new situations that can be harder. In the beggining of the game, the player dont know the basic commands, or the pourpous of each weapon. Each weapon serve for a thing in the game, and the game progress with the weapons you acquire slowing in the game.\n\nHere is differente, you fast have all the weapons of the game. You loose again at the mid, but 5 minutes later you have all again. What is the point? The point here is simple, you just use the best weapon until you lost your ammo, do the same with your second weapon and son on. Its a wave shooter with just one type of enemie shooting you. You dont use this weapon because its better for this situation or another, why RPGs here if there are not big vehicles, tanks, helicopters or others things such like that? And the pistol? uselees againts a billion of combines using better weapons against you.\n\nI cant recommend. Its the first time in years that I bought a game and finish on the first day. Its too short, lack variety of enemies, level design, lack everything. I like some wave shooters like Doom and Serious Sam, but on these games the variety of enemies force the player to use the variety of weapons they have, in a inteligent way, this game dont. In some parts of the game I just pass cause of my luke, even the final. No sense of acomplishment in this game, because I cant see the real strategy I have to make to pass in a difficult part. Its just try to keep alive before the combines kill you, sometimes you die, and sometimes you dont, its just random.","February 18","false","3.9"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/calebtrapp117/recommended/399120/","calebtrapp117","NovaPixel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/calebtrapp117/","46 products in account","First things first. If this mod was free, it would be a fairly good mod. The level design is well crafted and the textures look like they were updated. But unfortunatly, this mod is $10 which just isn't worth it. The are free mods that just as good as this and even a few that are better.\n\nGameplay:\n\nI'm very mixed with the gameplay. While it is fun, it can get overbearing at\ntimes, and not in a good way. Too often you are fighting waves of enemies with no clear goal of what to do, with very little health. There isn't very much to the fighting, no new ways of trying things out, no tactics. Just fight your way through and try not to die with very little health.\n\nThere are good parts to it, and the levels look good while playing it, it just feels kind of lack luster. The locations are kind of boring in my opinion. The great thing about HL2 was the variaty of locations, and different ways of play. Here you are just playing through Nova Prospekt and a combine facility. And while they are well made and look good, it's just generally boring to play through. Also you will have a very breif trip to zen. Why? I don't know, does it matter to the story? not really.\n\nI should also say that while the level design looks good, it doesn't always flow well with the enemies your fighting and can just be a detriment to your situation.\n\nStory:\n\nI'm not entirely understading this story. Why am I here? The vortigaunts explained that we have a common enemy, and that we are now allies, but I still don't know the reason I'm here. I just feel like I'm fighting just to fight. These problems may have been able to of been fixed if the G-man could have explained. But because the Vorts have to tell you, they have to explain why they are there, and why you shouldn't kill them, and then explain the combine. The beggining scene has the g-man, but he doesn't talk, which just makes his presence more confusing. I understand why He didn't attempt to voice act the g-man, but having him there just seems confusing.\n\nDuring the gameplay, shepards backstory is told through custom voice acted flashbacks which is just him remembering things that were told to him. The voice acting, while not terrible, is still not good enough to be relied on for the story of the game. While it does this, the world goes black and white and can be very hard to see. Not only is this annoying but it isn't very well timed. Several times I was going through a flashback when I would stumble upon enemy soldiers, unable to see well because of the flashback. I could stop walking to listen, but what is going on isn't really interesting enough to stop and listen to.\n\nThe ending just comes out of no where (admittedly HL2 kind of did too), without much explaination of what just happened. Again g-man appears at the ending, but because he can't speak, it only makes the story cring worthy and confusing.\n\nI feel like one of the biggest problems is that it tried to be Half-Life, but the story was told in a very un-Half-Life way.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis mod is a good mod. It is well crafted level design wise, and there is stuff to like. But the $10 pay wall just isn't worth it. Therefor, I can not give it a good review. If it was free, I would be impressed, but if you put a pay wall infront of something, escpecially a mod, you better make sure it is good and well ready. And in this case, it just wasn't ready.\n","February 18","false","4.0"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","10","18","0","0"

It's a great experience.\nI'm not gonna right a pros and cons list like everybody else; I'ma straight up tell you what can be improved...\n-Custom weapons; a sniping weapon would be great, but the Crossbow wouldn't do since it's from the rebels and the combine wouldn't have it but you could use the the cut Overwatch Pulse Sniper Rifle from the leaked 2003 Half-Life 2 Beta. Also, having the Pipe Wrench and Combat Knife like from Half-Life: Opposing Force would be nice. Also, just more generally Combine-themed weapons would cool like the Stun Stuck, but all guns are welcome! (Assuming they're not from/used by the rebels).\n-Make the enemies have SLIGHTLY less of an advantage -- In a lot of the levels where you're "swarmed" by the Combine's soldiers (which is completely fine, mind you), the only advantage spots you have are below stairs/slopes usually,\n-I personally think that you just stick to the original Valve-styled credits. Also, THERE'S A GRAMMATICAL ERROR IN THE CREDITS THAT I'D LIKE FIXED! Don't remember which line, but towards the end there's a line that reads something like "Its back to making games" or something, but YOU FORGOT THE APOSTROPHE! HOW COULD YOU? Jokes aside, it's small thinks like that that dim the experience.\n-Add a little more lighting in the earlier sections.\n-Add more indication on where to go in Xen -- It took me ages; then I watched a video because I was stuck, but kept falling when trying to jump to the islands (did I miss something) and had to noclip.\n\nThe end is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing and I love this game.

TERRIBLE! Horrifically bad!\nVideo Review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbE6i12T9do\n\nList of Reasons TO NOT BUY:\n1. Enemies are obviously buffed to stupid compared to normal half-life while their AI is dumbed down to the point of literal aim-bot with one setting, "Charge Player"\n2. Infinite Enemy Waves are never a good idea in a game where you don't have regenerating health. Also, infinite enemy wave while you are on a timer that they can reset is a terrible final boss.\n3. Voice Over is too quiet, the way it is applied is irritating and disoriented, not immersive and once I actually got a chance to read it, it makes no sense for the context of what you are doing.  It literally adds nothing, no plot, no character development, nothing.  With or Without it I literally feel like I am playing a mindless shooter, I would rather play Wolfstein 3D, which has a more in depth plot than this.\n4. The way voice overs are presented, White Out Blairing White like you've been hit with a flash bang screen + white enemies = Oh wait, I can't listen to the voice over because I'm being shot at, the subtitles only work in certain areas and then stop, so I can't read those, and Wow, I can't see what I'm shooting at or doing!  I would remove the white out all together!  Re-normalize the voice over and then re-normalize the game sounds while the voice over plays so that the voice over is at least 10+DB higher than the game sound when it plays, also the subtitles need to be OMIPRESENT!\n5. Infinite waves of enemies while solving platforming is not okay.\n6. No lighting on a chainlink fence opening that I'm suppose to go through when my attention has never been drawn to that fence in any way (Level 2) All the combine are on the right, the stuff on the left, YOU NEVER HAVE A REASON TO LOOK AT!  All the shiny stuff, with lights and illumination is on the right.  The left is drab and blends into the environment so well, you can't ever see the fence opening standing across the crater.  Much less make the platforming puzzle to get to the vent while you are being rushed by infinite bug swarm.\n7. Hidden ammo caches are a nice idea, in later game, but in early game when we have nothing anyway, you constantly run out of ammo unless you find the hidden cache\n8. Number of enemies are too many for how much damage and health they have.  The player is constantly reloading while they just rush forward and spray down the player, this is clearly geared to be hard on the level of Dragon's Dogma or Dark Souls, but in a first person shooter where death just resets to the last checkpoint, that is pointlessly frustrating.  Even on easy they will eat you alive in seconds.\n9. Instant death traps in an FPS while doing platform puzzle solving?  Are you seriously that stressed for difficulty and artificial game length?  Because if you are, this is sad.\n10. Not counting the deaths, death traps, and bad platforming which if you fail you instantly die and go back to last checkpoint, I played through the entire game in literally 1 hour.  1 hour is not worth 10$. 1 hour of gameplay isn't even worth 5$ and without any replayability at all, no story to engross myself in and nothing to keep me there, I would never buy this.\n","February 18","false","2.9"," 60 of 120 people (50%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","50","60","120","8","16"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gar1onriva/recommended/399120/","Gar1onriva","OzymanGeran","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gar1onriva/","301 products in account","I must admit that the premise of this game intrigued me; a Valve-approved sequel to Half-Life: Opposing Force, return to Xen, carefully-integrated to the HL2 timeline, higher resolution models... What a lie. I'll break it down using quotes from the Steam store page\n\n"13 new levels...all carefully integrated into the Half-Life 2 story"\n"he's teleported in...to help fight back"\nFor a start, this game is only loosely connected to Half-Life 2. Yes, it takes place in a couple of HL2 locations and you see the aftermath of Freeman's passing, but you in no way actually help him. I expected a cleverly done story where you cause some of the good fortune that allows Freeman to escape Nova Prospekt in the original game...instead you faff about in the back rooms of the prison, fighting through a progression of open areas and turret-filled corridors that don't work given HL2's gunplay. I'll come back to this point.\n\n"Continues the story of Opposing Force"\nI haven't played OF, but I've read the plot and mechanics as I am a big fan of the franchise. I can safely say that the only connection to OF is having Adrian Shephard as the protagonist and an increasingly disruptive series of auditory flashbacks that impede your vision...for some reason. The terrible sound balancing in this game, lack of different sliders for voice and sound effects (like ambience and shooting) and incredibly unreliable dialogue captions mean that it can be hard to hear a good 50% of what's said, if it's even relevant. Most of these seem to just recap OF which, as this is a sequel, shouldn't really need to be done. And that's AFTER a long, slow monologue at the start.\n\n"New music"\nGranted, this one is true. There is music that I recognise as new. Unfortunately, it is very loud and THE MUSIC VOLUME CANNOT BE CHANGED. There is a slider for it and it does absolutely nothing. I can only assume that the background music is lumped in with ordinary game sounds and thus can't be changed separately.\n\n"Substantial graphical updates over the original"\nThis one is a bit harder to pin down. Aside from a different Combine skin (I've played enough HL2 and G-mod to see the difference), I could honestly not tell between the new and old textures. Perhaps that's a testament to how well it's integrated, but I'd say it's more likely that the changes were not needed if they're present at all.\n\n"Return to Xen"\nYou 'returned to Xen' once for a brief fire fight and then a platforming section. And we're talking basic platforming. That's it. Given how it's one of the selling points, it's shockingly overselling it.\n\n"New AI improvements"\nThis is another addition of which I can't really tell the difference. This game is filled with so many vast open areas and long range fire fights, populated by so many enemies, that the AI will just sprint at you and fire at point blank range. The HL2 gun system is NOT designed for open areas like that; even the more open levels in HL2 are brilliantly designed so you don't have to shoot across large spaces much and always have an appropriate weapon on hand.\nMultiple times I found myself against 5 or 6 Combine, each armed with the SMG or AR2, charging across a courtyard that offered NO cover. They'd get to a close range then shred me. I'd always resort to backtracking to the previous tight corridor and headshotting them one-by-one as they came in.\nThese are not good fights. When I die three times to one bit in CHAPTER 2, it's not me being bad at the game; it's a case of terrible pacing and a miserable understanding of HL2's mechanics.\n\n"Substantial, highly-polished"\nThis is the real kicker. While playing through (I'm currently doing a full let's play series on my YouTube channel), I consistently refer to how the game feels unpolished. Aside from the sporadic subtitles and the lack of music volume control, the levels are poorly designed so I am either lost as to where to go next or I am not informed that I am supposed to run instead of fighting.\nThe quantity of enemies thrown at you (the aforementioned stuck bit is a fight against 16-20 soldiers in a room with no discernible cover) is nothing short of shameless. Those numbers were reserved for when you had the Super Gravity Gun; a weapon that could defeat that many enemies at once by throwing them at each other. Armed with an SMG, shotgun and terrible body armour, you flatly do not stand a chance even on Normal Difficulty.\n\nThis game is not polished. This game feels like it was never playtested by anyone but the creator. This is the Dark Souls of Half-Life, but acts like HL2: Episode 2.5.\nIf you like your games on hardcore mode where the difficulty comes from poor design rather than challenge, play this. If you like Half-Life and just want to experience the world in another way, try Black Mesa or even HL: Opposing Force; the clever variety of weapons makes the latter distinctly different to HL1 and not like a fanmade level pack that should not cost money.\nThis isn't worth the price tag. There is a reason even games like Portal Stories: Mel are free; even the brilliantly designed ones have flaws that mean they cannot stack up. This one doesn't even come close.","February 20","false","4.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

TERRIBLE! Horrifically bad!\nVideo Review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbE6i12T9do\n\nList of Reasons TO NOT BUY:\n1. Enemies are obviously buffed to stupid compared to normal half-life while their AI is dumbed down to the point of literal aim-bot with one setting, "Charge Player"\n2. Infinite Enemy Waves are never a good idea in a game where you don't have regenerating health. Also, infinite enemy wave while you are on a timer that they can reset is a terrible final boss.\n3. Voice Over is too quiet, the way it is applied is irritating and disoriented, not immersive and once I actually got a chance to read it, it makes no sense for the context of what you are doing.  It literally adds nothing, no plot, no character development, nothing.  With or Without it I literally feel like I am playing a mindless shooter, I would rather play Wolfstein 3D, which has a more in depth plot than this.\n4. The way voice overs are presented, White Out Blairing White like you've been hit with a flash bang screen + white enemies = Oh wait, I can't listen to the voice over because I'm being shot at, the subtitles only work in certain areas and then stop, so I can't read those, and Wow, I can't see what I'm shooting at or doing!  I would remove the white out all together!  Re-normalize the voice over and then re-normalize the game sounds while the voice over plays so that the voice over is at least 10+DB higher than the game sound when it plays, also the subtitles need to be OMIPRESENT!\n5. Infinite waves of enemies while solving platforming is not okay.\n6. No lighting on a chainlink fence opening that I'm suppose to go through when my attention has never been drawn to that fence in any way (Level 2) All the combine are on the right, the stuff on the left, YOU NEVER HAVE A REASON TO LOOK AT!  All the shiny stuff, with lights and illumination is on the right.  The left is drab and blends into the environment so well, you can't ever see the fence opening standing across the crater.  Much less make the platforming puzzle to get to the vent while you are being rushed by infinite bug swarm.\n7. Hidden ammo caches are a nice idea, in later game, but in early game when we have nothing anyway, you constantly run out of ammo unless you find the hidden cache\n8. Number of enemies are too many for how much damage and health they have.  The player is constantly reloading while they just rush forward and spray down the player, this is clearly geared to be hard on the level of Dragon's Dogma or Dark Souls, but in a first person shooter where death just resets to the last checkpoint, that is pointlessly frustrating.  Even on easy they will eat you alive in seconds.\n9. Instant death traps in an FPS while doing platform puzzle solving?  Are you seriously that stressed for difficulty and artificial game length?  Because if you are, this is sad.\n10. Not counting the deaths, death traps, and bad platforming which if you fail you instantly die and go back to last checkpoint, I played through the entire game in literally 1 hour.  1 hour is not worth 10$. 1 hour of gameplay isn't even worth 5$ and without any replayability at all, no story to engross myself in and nothing to keep me there, I would never buy this.\n","February 18","false","2.9"," 60 of 120 people (50%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","50","60","120","8","16"

Not like Value was doing anyting with him anyway. Overall layout of the game was nice, however it did suffer a few problems. For starters, PTSD flash backs are a good way to tell a story, that is when there is a story to tell. At first I followed things quite well, but then things happened so fast...I was left wondering just what the hell was going on. Then there was the difficulty. Even on Normal...I was getting my butt kicked. But it wasn't too hard that I gave up. No...it generally ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off to the point of wanting to beat the game to prove a point.

A sale target.\n\nVideo Review:  https://youtu.be/TQ6yuxBAHpA\n\nSummary:\nA hard call. I appreciate the effort by the one man project here: there's obviously a bunch of work that went into upgrading the graphics and making a whole new campaign for people to play. Those who really want a trip back to HL's past will get what they pay for here in the gameplay element: I feel like it's 2004 again and I'm playing another set of levels in the franchise. But the gameplay's flaws show a game that is out of its era, and sadly it doesn't have a lot to show outside of that. While the environmental storytelling is great and does a great job of showing and not telling, the dialogue sections can be pretty awkward at times, and for me don't add to the lore significantly. But the biggest issue here is the lack of punch: the game doesn't really have that moment that makes it stand out, with no big set pieces and anything new to offer the gameplay. It is a mod, but even mods can have a bite to them, and this one doesn't have any: you'll forget about the game in a couple of days time. That's what it comes down to: it doesn't have the staying power. It's still worth a look at when you get some free time, and the nostalgia trip is fun. It's just more pyrite then gold, but there still is some value here.\n\nLists:\n+:\nWant a trip into gaming past? The Half-Life gameplay does feel like you're time travelling into the past, and you'll get some of the rush that the original game had. You can get a reasonable adrenaline rush.\nIn particular, when running for your life and using all your weapons to keep yourself alive.\nThe game does a good job with environmental storytelling, with little elements here and there explaining what happened in the battle.\nSeveral of the non-combat sections of the game do a good job of providing a nice change of pace.\nThe graphical improvements added to the engine are nice.\nThe voice acting is reasonable when you can hear it.\n-:\nOompf. The game lacks staying power, it lacks a KO punch, and I'll forget the game in a couple days time. Even if the gameplay is older here, a lack of Bosses, significant plot events, or anything note worthy makes it mundane.\nTwo particular difficulty spikes will have some people throwing their mouse across the room. A big element of this is the level design: it's too open and with too many spawn points.\nThe AI is very exploitable. Again, this has to do with the engine in question, but they are dumb compared to modern day standards.\nEven with the options of some more “fun” weapons like the Gravity Gun, the basic weapons are all that is here.\nSome of the dialogue is just....awkward. Now I didn't play Opposing Force so I might be losing some context, but some dialogue was cringe worthy.\nThe game can only do so much with the engine of years past.\nI would have loved to be able to change some of the audio in terms of in game voices, and it gets drowned out by gunfire. But the engine doesn't exactly have the option.\nA lack of headcrabs. It needed more headcrabs.","February 19","true","6.4"," 15 of 31 people (48%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","48","15","31","3","0"

It's a short play of Xen but definitely looks good in my books for the Source engine.\n\nI don't want to give any of it away but there aren't really any Opposing Force weapons which I won't fault since the gameplay makes up for this.\n\nAmmo is scarce when it needs to be, but when you do have ammo you do find yourself running for cover to try and spare those last rounds. This created a really great combat experience.\n\nThere are recycled materials from Half-Life 2 but when you reach the whole Combine base you come across really really futuristic stuff.. I mean like  COOL  stuff. Some combines are reskinned but you have to wait til' later in the game to experience some of the new things.\n\nNo bugs were found in my experienced gameplay. Just headcrabs, manhacks and hunters.\n\nOverall I would definitely say give this game a try if you do not want a mod, it's a stand-alone game that gives you a really good Half-Life 2 reboot experience, but in an Opposing Force point of view.\n\n\nHopefully I'll be seeing myself doing a walkthrough of Prospekt.

First of all, the game at this price seems a bit too much, it feels that this game could be more enjoyable if it was free. Most of the game is good, but I feel it would be more acceptable to be free. There are many parts in this game which are seen to me as repetitive, too much "defend yourself while the enemy arrives from multiple entryways". Plot-wise, this game is lacking. The story is told that you must help Gordon Freeman in Nova Prospekt, which seems pretty good. The rest of the story is seen through blue and trippy Black Mesa "flashbacks". Then the Nova Prospekt idea is thrown out the window, as it is revealed you were sent...to space? Yeah, a bit weird. All in all, the game is once again, okay. Worth the price? No. Good plot? No. Does it look nice? For the source engine, sure. Music? Pretty average, some tracks are good. Basically, the points cancel each other out in my opinion.\n\nI will say though, at least he did it for his nan.

However, they often came out stale, too symetrical and too perfectly organized to really feel alive - which is probably why the levels felt at it's best during the combine sections of the game where the sterile, lifeless and too well organized really reflected the combine philosophy.\n\nBut even though the levels were great to look at, from a gameplay perspective they didn't really provide any sensible props such as covers considering it was an experience focused on hectic battles with waves of enemies.\n\nAs far as the Half-Life experience goes Richard made an outstanding job with the feeling and atmosphere.  Outstanding sound design, new voice overs, voice acting and music made the game feel fresh, professionall and intriguing.\n\nThe gameplay does however suffer from putting the player far too often right in the crossairs of turrets and multiple machine guns with no cover or escape in sight, forcing the player to press the f9 button just a tad to frequently even on the normal difficulty.\n\nA nice and well polished experience, but a bit too pricey considering the content.\n\nI am however  looking forward to future projects from the developer and would welcome some updates with fresh content and covers thrown into the levels, making the price totally worth it!\n\n","February 19","true","5.3"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

"Opposing Force" was by far my favorite of the old "Quake" engine "Half Life" games. Now I know it was made by one person, and I'll give them that to their credit.\n\nAfter playing the game, I must say that I'm conflicted. While it's clear some effort was made to make a true to "Half-Life" experience, there's a lot that undid the main goal. First of all, is the premise that Shepherd is freed by the Vortigaunts in order to help Gordon Freeman. At no point did I feel like I assisted Gordon whatsoever, like at all. A trip to Xen made me feel like I was playing on my Nintendo 64 again with all the fogging and little draw distance. A lot of the directions in the game were unclear, as was figuring what I had to do at some points. Don't get me started at the "core" sequence which still confuses me now. All the settings felt recycled, the enemies waiting by every door became predictable and used a lot of cop-out elements that the main source materials "Half Life", never used.\n\nGraphics are noticeably tweeked, and while a lot of other gamers didn't enjoy it, I thought the flashbacks in Shepherd's mind were well done. The return to familiar areas and seeing alternative views was interesting at first. A lot just felt like it was tacked in because, why not. The Hunters felt forced, out of place, and were actually easier to kill than the Combine soldiers...which leads onto the next point. How can they all of a sudden take clips after clips of ammunition into them, while they hit me a few times and I am near death?\n\nIt's not that it's a terrible game, it's just not what anyone would expect for a paid experience, especially one in which we were finally expecting a cool return of the Corporal.\n\nOverall, at half the price, it might be worth it, but as is, it's a 5/10 from me!","February 18","false","2.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Some of it does seem good at the beginning, but it quickly tosses you every weapon, has way too much shooting and rushing at you, and offers no plot.

He has a bright future ahead of him.\n\nHowever, even though he achieved a mammoth undertaking, this particular game is not high on my list.

Overall, it seemed like the course of the game was basically "Go into a big room, listen to irritating alarm sounds, and shoot bad guys. Then go do it again." Also, every few minutes, the game is interrupted by a flashback where the video looks like a photo negative and you hear voices. I'm afraid it gets rather irritating, like trying to watch a movie as your TV screen glitches and the audio turns to another channel.\n\nI don't mind paying for a mod if it will keep me entertained for a while, and there are mods I've played for endless hours.

Prospekt is pretty interesting. This is an average mod for sure not worthy of blind praise and not deserving of may anger. It's just an average mod that got too hyped up about. I think people were expecting Half Life 3 quality. For a game made by one guy it was alright. There were some really neat ideas in the prison, like when you come across the aftermath of battles that happened in Half Life 2. The attention to detail is pretty nice. The level design is good early in the game. The latter portions are pretty bland, but due to the "facility" you are in it makes sense at a thematic level but I admit it's not fun design for these sections. I can see where this part of the game gets criticism for being hallways, but it does make sense based on the environment you are supposed to be in. I mean the game has all the Half Life staples: cameos by the G-Man, a few in the levels too, some puzzles (there are a few in the early game, but they vanish near the two thirds mark), interesting ideas. The big downside here is the difficulty. Holy crap was this hard. Like, really, really hard. I can see that being a turn off. It wasn't for me, but I can easily understand why it might be.\n\nAnyway, that is my two cents. It's an average mod that has some cool ideas, some level design that starts pretty good bit goes downhill, and is quite difficult.\n\nThe price isn't too bad. For $10 you could go to McDonalds for lunch or you can spend 2-4 hours playing this. Not a bad trade, especially because it was all made by one guy. But it's all about what you want. I don't mind paying $10 but many people will. Just know what you're buying.\n\nIt's not amazing, it's not abysmal, it's just average from a rookie developer.","February 20","true","10.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The Aesthetic. MAN! The design of the levels and a lot of the effects and particles used are WAY COOL! Really pretty game! Animations were unique and well done.\n\n2. The game play hit head on with what you would feel in any other Half-Life game. This game is a lot more challenging however and a lot of people disliked that but I loved it!\n\n3. I was really surprised at how good the soundtrack fit the setting of Shepard. Really tense and awesome.\n\nCons.\n\n1. Now there's really only one or two that I can think of, and it was the voice acting for the combine. It wasn't bad but it's not like the stuff you'd hear from the actual Half-Life games themselves. The pitch was kid of off and the filter for the radio chatter was too clear. Also, how do they know Shepard's name? (Not that it's really an issue, it was kinda cool)\n\n2. The opening of the game could use a little polish with the vortigaunts talking to you, I don't feel like it really sets the atmosphere of the game. The ending was kinda cool and ambiguous but Gman's animation or scripted event in general could use a little work.\n\nWHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE IN FUTURE UPDATES:\n\nMore HL1 inspired weapons maybe? (A little ambitious but sounds SUPER cool :P)\nMore enriched gameplay and integrated levels would be REALLY nice. I thought the soldier dialog from bootcamp was a really nice touch and would like to see more of that kind of integration.\n\nOverall 8.5/10 on the game and I have and will continue to recommend this mod and I am very excited to see where it goes!","March 26","true","2.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DivisionaryLeaderID3/recommended/399120/","DivisionaryLeaderID3","Combine DvL ID:3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DivisionaryLeaderID3/","51 products in account","POSSIBLE SPOILERS\n\nProspekt is a game for architecture lovers, hardcore NPC fighters, Combine enthusiasts, and the ones who loved Half Life: Opposing Force. However, the game REALLY requires improvements on its final stage, occurances of puzzles, and some loose ends tied on some of its script timing and lore.\n\nScript timing - The flashback audio starts too late on some of the elevators, so the audio gets drowned out after being shot at once the elevator has arrived.\n\nPuzzles - It felt like there was only 4 puzzles to the game, it would make it feel more like Half-Life if there was at least 2 to 4 more puzzles.\n\nLore - Freeman was Gman's wild card. Why would he take Shepard from his oh-so-important stasis just to help Freeman because he is "cornered by Combine and needs help", and why would his actions in the game affect if Freeman was cornered by Combine or not?\n\nThe final stage - The final stage was really rediculous, as even turning the AI to easy did not help. The amount of health kits is too low, and the amount of Combine is too high. Nobody could survive well at all with barely any cover, especially when it's the elites your talking about. The combine ball knockoff attempts feels original to what HL would do, but providing only 4 health kits and a constant swarm of Combine soldiers and elites? Not very fun.\n\nOverall, with the constant support shown by the author (which I adore), I believe this game can be among some of the best out there, especially if theres custom textures, skins, music, and gameplay! (It was a shame there was not a custom weapon. All Half-Life mods have those.)","May 31","true","4.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

However what seemed novel and interesting in the begginging of the game quickly became boring and repetative. The shock reveals in the game did not do enough to take the story forward and the game on the whole lacked purpose and pace. The gameplay was significantly harder, and whilst I always enjoyed a challenge in the actual Half Life Games the challenge in this game was down to an increase in health for the protoss and being vastly outnumbered at all times, and no real change in tactics or units from the enemy.\n\nI appreciate this was all done by one guy, and in some ways the maps were very impressive but I feel like I ended up paying money for his CV for a future job. The game had potential but by keeping the project to himself he lacked a bit direction, and I have to conclude that the game certainly isn't worth the money.","March 13","false","6.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I have played around 40 minutes so far and I think that most haf life fans will enjoy this game and quite a lot of other people will too. For one person to have made this it is quite an achievement.\n\nIt is NOT a mod- it is standalone and does not require Half Life 2\n\nThe first chapter is very atmospheric and eerie- it reminded me of the feeling I got playing Ravenholm in HL2 for the first time.\n\nThe second has a lot of combat. The combat is okay but on normal difficulty I found the marines hard to kill with the SMG especially when they often have mounted machine guns. In HL2 you kill Cps first and by the time you are mass killing marines you have lots of ammo.\n\nThe chapters were also quite dark and the flashbacks whilst interesting did sometimes get annoying.\n\nSteam achievements might be a nice addition.\nAlso the subtititles were either no always correct, didnt appear etc.\n\nOverall it has potential and is well worth buying to support similar creations being brought to steam!\n\nso far 7/10 :D\n\nEDIT:\nI have almost finished the game- it has taken around two and a half hours which is not really comparable to HL2  Ep 2 like the dev said but I guess no one plays quite the same.\n\nThe next chapters got better.\nThe combat was more enjoyable as I got further and ammo/health was given out more.\nThe Xen level was great- I love jumping from one island to the next and it was nice to see Xen under combine control. I hope the dev will expand this level more in the future, include some of the xen creatures- there was only combine which is a slight disappointment, and perhaps feature the caves and bounce pads from xen we all loved in half life one.\n\nThe darkness hasn't got much better and I feel that certain areas of the game need brightening up. In contrast many need reducing in their blinding flashes. You may note that I said that I have only nearly finished the game as I am unable to beat the last level. That may just be my skil but I had to turn the difficulty down to easy and that didn't help. The light is blinding and most of the time you can see next to nothing. The screen is also shaking too much. A bit adds to the atmosphere but the dev has gone a little to overboard to the point where the last level is virtually unplayable. It is also made worse by the fact that there are TONS of combine and very little health.\n\nIt would also be nice to see in the future some of the unique opposing force weapons.\n\nI really liked  The reveal that you were in space when you see the earth  however seeing as this game is called PROSPEKT about NOVA PROSPEKT we only get a little time in that prison. I thought the idea was that we were assisting freeman- I saw none of that! Perhaps if we could see freeman running around on computer screens and then we pressed a button and opened a door for him or diverted some combine to our position instead of his and took them out that would fit the idea of the game? As it is there is little story or defined objectives meaning you do not know what you are supposed to be doing other than that the freeman needs your help and you never seem to be helping him.\n\nApart from that I enjoyed the game quite a lot\n6.5/10 :D\n\nI will probably make a forum post where people could suggest things to the dev- for example I got glitched into a wall at one point causing death and sending my character back very far as I had not many saves.","February 18","true","8.6"," 21 of 44 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","21","44","0","0"

Expendable.\nIt's probably quite nice to play it while in a call or so to occupy your hands and have something neat to look at (that's not meant as nasty as it sounds like..), for it really does not require much attention. But real game experience... Meeeehhh...\n\nPros:- Really beautiful colours and textures\n- Lovely combine reskins\n- Awesome music\n- The ideas of the places you visit/re-visit are generally quite nice and creative. (Would have loved to have more chance to explore them!)\n\nCons:- Light and darkness more be like: Pitch black vs. burning out your eyes.\n- The story basically felt like 'Fight Combine mob, grab ammo/health, fight Combine mob, grab ammo/health, fight Combine mob, grab ammo/health...'\n- Everything (non-combat-related) IMO was way too easy to solve.\n- The flashback sequences got annoying and repetitive. Plus they tended to interrupt the flow of game with all that vision-blurring.\n\nAll in all I'd give it a well intended 4,5/10.\nWhile I disagree with the people stating that this was waste of money (For I've played worse 'full' games paying more), I too think it could have been way better without investing much effort. Basically: More story, less repeating patterns.\n\nMy recommendation would be: Give it a try - even if it's just to get an own opinion, for it's at least neat eye candy!

It's confusing where to go but its not like that other game *cough* Wilson Chronicles *cough* only two times it was confusing thats it. Well other than those 2 reasons this is really good go check it out (but be careful because the Combine are difficult) Anyways probably rate it 7/10.\n\nEDIT: Just saying the rating of 6/10 of Prospekt makes sense (I probably give it 7/10 look see I changed the rating so).","February 18","true","11.1"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","6","14","0","0"

Right off the bat, nothing is really new. It feels like a half-life mod. I guess i was sort of hoping for more of a total conversion than half-life with a couple of custom skins. I mean, you dont even get a wrench. Just the same old crowbar. The other thing that feels kind of weird is that all the rooms just feel like these massive rooms with huge celings but they are rather bland. You will enter a oom with about 30 enemies and maybe a wooden crate in the corner. There just doesnt seem to be a lot of work going into the cosmetics.\n\nAlso, i wouldnt call this a negative but its a very hard game. Save often. If you liked that the old Oposing Forces game was hard then youll feel at home with this.\n\nAnyways, i wont downgrade this game because i feel like its not bad. I wouldnt tell my friends to go out and buy it unless it was on a real good sale but i cant say that i dont recommend it. If youre looking for a challenge and want to continue the Oposing Forces story then go ahead and get it.

But I am impressed with the quality of this venture, and sincerely look forward to his next projects.\n\nPROS:\n* Music. One thing I love is how fitting the music is for the situation. Whether you're trying not to be found, or whether you are breaching a Combine base, the music just feels so right for the situation.\n* Backstory. I'd never really played Opposing Force, and was going in blind with who Shepherd would be. But after playing this game, and seeing his flashbacks to his life before this, I feel like I've known him for as long as I have Gordon Freeman.\n* Execution and engagement. Not everybody can make a good game, but Richard Seabrook is not one of those people. I was invested the whole time, and never once thought about getting up and taking a break.\n\nCONS:\n* Missing captions. It's hard to tell what exactly the flashback sequences are saying, and the blaring siren doesn't help, either.\n* Contrast. Early on, the game was way too dark to make anything out, and later, it was just so brightly lit, I thought my retinas would melt.\n* More hints on where to go. The game, while beautifully made, is not exactly well laid out. I remember hunting for a vent for about twenty minutes trying to dodge antlions, before realizing that it was on the wall, requiring some climbing.\n\nOverall, this is an incredible mod to an already amazing game, and I guarantee it won't be a purchase you'll soon regret.","May 2","true","2.6"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

It had some effects which made its presentation stand out and a well directed narrative that ties it in well with the original Half-Life expansion it borrows the protagonist from. The voice acting, while not identical to the voices of HL2, is still well done and in no way distracts from the gameplay. The short play time is my only complaint, as I would have liked to see even more. However, the short play time does allow for a quick full playthrough if you can spare roughly 2 1/2 hours.

OK, first of all this is not worth $10 at least at this point, when you consider the free mods out there with high replay value. But I will not compare this to free mods. If this game is on sale, pick it up if it's at $5 or less, the way it is right now.\n2. There are differences between Freeman and Shephard. To be a true Opposing Force sequel, Shephard must start off with the wrench and not the crowbar. I mean, that's just basics.\n3. The game is very repetitive. Combine computers everywhere, pushing the same button to open door after door of combine soldiers. It's a prison, I get it. Prisons are built very much in this way, and Nova Prospekt is probably no different. However, teleporting to different areas, such as Xen (which only lasted 5 minutes) should bring about some surprises. This game does not.\n4. The Valve support and greenlight convinced me to buy this game. I would have probably skipped on it knowing what I know now. Talking as if this is some sort of Opposing Force sequel is a good way to get someone to buy this game, but when you play it, you realize that it does not give you the feeling that it really is a sequel or even related to Opposing Force at all. The voice acting does barely OK, however there is more pointless trash talking than actual Half-Life semantics going back and forth.\n\nThe game's soundtrack, overall level design (besides the massive amounts of combine computers), and trading cards save the game from getting no review at all from me. The soundtrack is awesome, and fits well within the gameplay. The overall cubemap design is decent, minus the lack of creative mechanics within the map design (such as repetitive computer buttons from room to room). Also, as I am writing this review, trading cards are available and I hope they come frequent considering the price of this HL2 mod rehash. I will reboot a new game on this at least once a year to acquire trading cards simply because I bought the game, and that's about it. If and when this game sees some available achievements, the replay value of Prospekt will grow.\n\nI hope this game sees more improvements and updates. Trading cards already give this game value.

This game will give you a new, unique Half-Life expirience like never before. The Combine soldiers have much more complexity in their AI, and offer a small challenge, and a great new experience. The creative, distinct level design always throws something new/well-made at you. Finishing this game on March 30th, this game took me 3 hours to complete. This game's levels are very memorable, and finishing the game is satisfying.\n\nIs there anything I should be worried about in this game?\n\nI disagree with many of the negative reviews out there, and I don't understand how so many people found this to their disliking. I don't think there is anything you should be worried about in this game. I preordered this game on a 10% sale, and I think this game was well worth the price, even if you don't buy this game on sale. It is full of many chapters and content. Also, the flashbacks aren't bad, and visiting Xen is very fun, which does tie into the story! Oh yeah, and the story is very well written!\n\nWith that, I tell all Half-Life fans to buy this game. Even if you are not a Half-Life fan, I reccomend giving this game a try. Every reason why you should purchase this I said above. This was one of my favorite Half-Life games, and I hope it will be one of yours!","April 4","true","4.1"," 15 of 33 people (45%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","45","15","33","4","1"

I actually enjoyed the story (which I will admit I was only loosely able to follow for lack of pretense) and I thought the level design was awesome. That very brief return to Xen was enjoyable (although plot wise it was pointless) and that was the only section of the game for me that seemed in any way buggy, I started lagging slightly there.\n\nThe only things that should have been improved was the level design of the areas where encounters occured and the difficulty of the AI, though if the AI was more like the Half Life AI in terms of how accurate they are and how hard they are to kill then there may not be any issues with the level design. I managed to play 2/3rds of the way through the game on Normal before I was forced to push it down to easy.\n\nOverall I'd probably give this a 6.5/10. I would definitely recommend it to any other die hard Half Life fan as something they should play.","February 19","true","2.6"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","6","15","0","1"

It looks prettier then Half Life 2, which is always nice.\n-There is a decent story relating to Half Life 2 at the beginning and the end of this game.\n-Some dialouge plays every once in a while where Shepard's old marine buds are talking, giving backstory from before HL:OF.\n-In the beginning, and in some parts throughout, it really does feel like a new Half Life game. Mostly just the start.\n-Has lots of combat, which is a nice change, giving HL a new spin.\n-Xen is back!\n-Half Life 1 style of level design.\n-New Combine Spaceship that you get taken too, adds a cool new area to look at, a different view of a combine facility.\n\nNow, onto the cons.\n\n-Too Short\n-Random Level Cuts.\n-No HL2 style story during any gameplay.\n-Feels like an endless wave shooter in a few sections, not like a Half Life game.\n-"Boss Fight" really wasn't a challenge if you figured out what you were doing.\n-On any difficulty other than easy, you will die atleast once every time you see a Combine.\n-The only diversity in the enemies is art the beginning. Otherwise, it's just Combine.\n-Doesn't bring many new things to the table, besides the two already mentioned areas.\n\nThis game will not fill that Half Life 3 sized hole in your heart. No way. But, atleast it is something new. Something Half Life, with a story that could actually be canon.

I don't know what the whole fuss is about, i played the game even after reading the negative reviews. Sometimes people don't know how to appreciate the time invested in creating the levels, setup, puzzles, etc... I really loved the several big scale/large arena fight scenes with limited weapons. it forces you to be more creative and use quick reflexes.\n\nI noticed some references to the first Half Life, some of the sounds were also form the first half life game. new textures, walls, floors, doors, that galaxy projections, and portals were pretty astounding.\n\nno one can ever appreciate the storyline, everyone expects something; that's why i will not comment anything regarding the storyline. perhaps showing a sequence to "how Shepard actually helped Gordon directly or indirectly" as the Gman asked of him. But still, this is a mod, and people going apesh*t to why didn't they pick up a pipe wrench instead of a crowbar is just plain dumb.\n\nhowever, a constructive view at the con is the series of flashbacks. like, i get it, he keeps remembering stuff, but each cut lasts too long, and the fashy screen is just annoying. there's one scene where an army of combine shoot at you while you're still day-dreaming. lol. it was funny, but please don't do that mistake in your future games :P\n\nFinally, my condolences to your nan who passed away fighting cancer in 2015 (as your credits stated); Kudos on the game, this does help sink in for the big HL3 wait. $10 well spent.\n\nCheers,\nAmjo (finished in 2 hours)","February 20","true","2.0"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

The gameplay, as others have noted, is pretty difficult. Running-and-gunning isn't really an option here and you'll need to take advantage of explosive barrels, carrying obstacles as cover, and simple hauling ♥♥♥ to get through. As such, there's a heavy weight on the level design which is often missed by indie developers, but he's done a pretty good job here.\n\nUnfortunately, there's usually just one "good" way to handle a room full of dudes and only a couple ways to do it poorly. I can't imagine anyone getting through an area and thinking "I wonder if it could have been done -this- way." Small gripe, I know, but felt like it should be mentioned. The levels as-is are pretty solid, especially when compared to Half Life's.\n\nGraphically it looks fantastic. The higher-resolution textures really shine through and isn't a huge encumberance on my hardware. Since it's technically (on the hardware level) a re-skin of Half Life 2, SLI support is already in though I had an issue getting VSync to actually stick. I had to force the frame rate to be less than 60 through NVidia Inspector. Can't say for ATI GPUs, though. My only complaint on the visuals is some odd colouring that takes place here and there but it's minor and ends soon.\n\nAudio-wise I can't complain. Custom indie voice-over is usually a guaranteed cringe for me but this isn't that bad. The music is pretty intense during the tougher action areas and really fits the game well. Remembering back to Half Life 2, you'd get that nice pumping music infrequently and when it started, you knew you were in for a rough time. This does it the very same. Not too much music, but when it's there it's good!\n\nOverall, I highly recommend it! For ten bucks you're getting a really unique story in the Half Life world and it's just different enough to make it feel completely new. Definitely can't complain too much here.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXqZHW9fXSw","February 18","true","2.1"," 10 of 24 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","10","24","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DinoGeek65/recommended/399120/","DinoGeek65","DinoGeek65","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DinoGeek65/","51 products in account","Prospekt is a Valve approved sequel to the Half-Life: Opposing Force DLC. Unsurprisingly, it takes place in Nova Prospekt, presumably before or around the same time that Gordon Freeman gets their. One of the first things I noticed as I started playing the game was its graphics. They look noticeably better than the other Half-Life games, except Black Mesa of course, and as well as being a welcome improvement, they dont do anything to change that nostalgic feel of existing in the Half-Life universe (looking at you CM13), something which I really appreciate. Another thing that I am glad Richard Seabrook kept in this game is the way the story is presented. Just like every other Half-Life game, for the first 15 minutes or so of playing, you have nothing, and are required to get from A to B by using the surrounding environment, which I personally think is a great game mechanic, as it allows you to take in this games amazing atmosphere, as well as allowing new and old users of the source engine to get used to its controls and mechanics. Another thing I liked about this game was its music. While its certainly isn't to the standard of Kelly Bailey's amazing soundtracks, it definitely makes an epic firefight or nervous crawl through a vent that extra bit more special.\nSo after these first 15 minutes or so, the game soon turns into the nostalgic and classic FPS that we all know and love, (with a few puzzles here and there to mix up the gameplay), and reminds me of how LITTLE the gaming industry has come with not just FPS, but gaming as a whole since the Half-Life series.\n\nConsidering that this game was made completely by one person over the course of 18 months, I am genuinely astonished that Richard Seabrook has managed to make such a well polished game, and there was never a moment in this game where I felt it was tremendously lacking in any form of content. That being said, I managed to finish this game in just over 2 hours, which is far short of the "Episode 1" length we were told, which (for me anyway) took almost 6 hours for me to complete the first time. I also found that the variety of gameplay did become lacking as I continued through the story, from Headcrabs, Barnacles, Zombies, Zombine, and Antlions, to just the Combine...yay. No awesome boss battles against Dropships, Gunships, Striders or Advisors. Whats even weirder is that you get an RPG a long way into the game, hyping up my anticipation that soon there would be an epic boss battle, but...no. I didnt even need to use it, as from the moment I picked it up the only enemies I would continue fighting for the rest of the game were, you guessed it, the Combine. Also, while the return to Xen in this game was certainly cool nostalgia-wise, once again the only enemies you are fighting their are the Combine, no Houndeye, Bullsquid, Alien Grunts, Alien Controllers, Gonarchs or Gargantuas, and you are literally their for 5 F*CKIN MINUTES.\n\nJust incase you think I forgot, I know this game was only made by one person, and the amount of action packed fun, detail and nostalgia inducing atmosphere Richard Seabrook has managed to cram into this game over the course of 18 months is incredible, and for that I can definitely reccomend it to anyone. But... this IS a Half-Life game, so it should be reviewed like one, and in that regard it lacks in certain areas.\n\nIn conclusion, if you are craving some more Half-Life, you've come to right place, but don't expect anything more than that.","February 18","true","4.4"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","9","22","0","0"

It's hard to understand the Elder Vortigaunt in the intro without captions.\n~Not all captions work, they only appear sometimes.\n~Influx of Particles which cause extreme lag on lower end PC's.\n===================\n----------\nCONS:\n----------\n-Enemies are insanely overpowered.\n--All enemies health are almost trippled. Really?\n\n-Useless Story.\n--You're supposed to go into Nova Prospekt to help Gordon Freeman escape, yet he's already left Nova Prospekt and you're just saving you're own skin throught the game.\n\n-No original Half-Life enemies.\n--No returns of Houndeyes, or Bullsquids. Nope.\n\n-No Original weapons.\n--Not even the wrench.\n\n-First-Person is just White-rextured HEV Arms.\n--It's not even the PCV Vest. Though, the suit does have unique voice acting.\n\n-No exploration through Xen.\n--Since the player gets thrown into Xen out of the random, why not have the player explore the ruins of Xen (since the Combine obviously dominates there), and show the ruins of Nihlanith's chamber.\n\n-Ending is confusing as all hell.\n--I still don't understand it; I just click random buttons until I win.\n\n-Boring Gameplay.\n--All the gameplay is essentially the same; run around shooting ♥♥♥♥ in the same rooms over and over again.\n===================\n\nSadly, since I don't want to bore the reader with 30 paragraphs, I think the pros and cons list summed up everything.\nI was so excited for Prospekt, and I was disapointed. I ran the game in Godmode out of all things half-way through due to the sheer unfairness of the game.\n\nI really hope the developer can continue with something better in the future.","March 20","false","4.1"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

The story was told as you progress throughout the game, the story of Adrian Shephard. The music is appropiate and very beneficial for the immersion and intense combat sequences. I had goosebumps from start to finish, and I couldn't recommend this game enough for all the Half life fans out there. A few things worth noting regarding the combat however; The main enemy you will encounter consists of Combine Overwatch Soldiers of all types. Shotgunners, elites and so on. While I can appreciate the idea of increasing their durability, It's a tad bit obnoxious with entire squads of soldiers pinning you up against a corner, absorbing humongous amounts of abuse before going down. However, there are certain spots at which you can stand your ground against multiple soldiers at once. The supplies are also relatively generous considering the game's increased difficulty and I noticed that the AR2 has an increased ammunition reserve from Half life 2. The addition of a few tricky puzzles and revamped overwatch soldiers is a welcome change and adds a unique dynamic to the Half Life category. The voice acting is good, although it does not always accurately correspond with the subtitles, which is only a minor flaw. Fantastic work by Richard and company, I would like to personally thank you for this title, the game has exceeded my expectations, I couldn't have thought of a better way to spend my ten dollars. After completing the game, I crave for more. Good luck in your future projects, and thanks again, Richard!","February 18","true","3.9"," 21 of 48 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","21","48","0","2"

What's not easy to develop within a level is a story, and great design.\n\nSomething that's quite clear within the whole game is that Prospekt is made by a Modder, and not a Game Developer.  A Modder tinkers with a game, making it more difficult or more fun by adding things or changing configs, making a new stage maybe.  A Game Developer wants to share a story, create a experience the player has.  While a Mod can breath new life into a game, a Game Developer makes the game that gets played to death in the first place.\n\nAnd that's the difference.  This feels like a mod, a challenge, extra things to a great game.  Not a game of it's own.  And to that it's a highly developed one, one that shows potential in a future game designer, one that shouldn't have full creative direction mind you, but someone who designs levels for players.  And like a mod made for challange, it adds it artificially, by changing a config for the enemies to be made tougher.  Instead of making you fight tough enemies with lots of bullets and a weak gun, you have strong guns to kill a tank.  Actually scratch the whole mod part, it feels like a lower level mod doing that, higher level mods, like the Long War for XCOM: EU/EW actually make the game more exciting by making a higher level tactical play that wasn't in the original, and that to me makes this feel like it's not quite worth it's full $10.00 tag.  It's a lower level mod based around level design and a poor story with good music for what it is and decent voice acting, the actors may be able to actually do fantastic things in the future if they're given proper direction.  To be honest this game doesn't feel like the worse for the price tag, hell better then some indie games with higher reviews an price from what I've seen.  But you should pick up all the original games first, and then some other games on sale and such before even considering this one.

Instead, it mostly revolved around a combine shooting gallery, and awkward flashbacks of quotes Shepard had heard from his colleagues in the millitary, which didn't really add much to the game. Plus, it was very short for a Half-Life game, and didn't bring back any of the special weapons & NPCs that Shepard had in Opposing Force, which kinda bummed me out, but hey, I guess the world went to ♥♥♥♥ after Black Mesa.\n\nSo TL;DR, if you're expecting Half-Life 2: Opposing Force, this isn't quite what you're looking for. But if you enjoyed the combat aspect of Half-Life 2 more than the actual story, then this game might be something you'll enjoy.","February 28","false","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/1upD/recommended/399120/","1upD","1upD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/1upD/","183 products in account","I really wanted to recommend this game. When I first heard that a mod was going to be sold as a standalone game, I was kind of skeptical. There's so many other good mods, what could this one do to stand above the rest? As I read more about the game and watched Richard Seabrook's interviews, I started to get excited. It's not every day that a new Half-Life 2 episode hits the Steam store, and Prospekt looked like fun return to the series.\n\nWhere do I begin? Prospekt has a few really good ideas but they're ultimately outweighed by its glaring flaws.\n\nI really enjoyed the level design in the opening chapter where Adrian wakes up in Nova Prospekt with no weapons. The puzzling and exploration elements were handled really well and felt like a Half-Life game. Early encounters with xen creatures and zombies were paced very well. As soon as the player runs into the Combine, everything goes wrong. The very first encounter with Combine puts you in a corner staring down a squad of soldiers, one of whom has a mounted machine gun. There is no cover in the room. I hoped that would be the last encounter like that, but unfortunately there were numerous scenes just like it in the same chapter. Mounted machine guns are everywhere and there's never any way to advance on them without leaving cover. Even in later chapters it seems like every time you're in an elevator, it will open to a firing squad. There's no where for the player to go and it just doesn't feel right.\n\nI wanted to play the game on hard, since I'm familiar with the Half-Life series and generally find normal too easy.  It became immediately obvious that this game simply is not balanced for Hard Mode. It seems the combine have been given more health than normal, and that took away the impact from all of the weapons. I wasn't prepared to have to expend multiple grenades or magnum rounds to take out a single combine, and it made a lot of the combine fights into a chore. The game got a lot better once I changed my difficulty to normal, but a lot of times I still felt like I was at an unfair disadvantage. The final fight was the worst of all. With no cover, very few health pickups, not enough ammo, and infinitely respawning enemies, I could not complete that section without cheating. In its current state, I can only recommend anyone play this game on the easiest difficulty.\n\nUnfortunately, Combine soldiers are virtually the only enemy the player will fight. There's one or two zombie encounters but the game really needed more enemy types to change the pace. The Combine soldiers were always fun to fight thanks to Half-Life 2's brilliant AI system and enjoyable weapons. Sadly, there aren't as many weapons available to the player in Prospekt. With no new weapons, nothing like the gravity gun, and no crossbow, and with the increased health Combine are given, only some of that enjoyable gameplay is retained.\n\nOne of the selling points of the game is the trip the player takes to Xen. A lot of people complained that the Xen sequence didn't have any point, but I would counter that it isn't much different than the Xen sequences in Opposing Force, which were just a way to get from point A to point B. I really liked this sequence but I don't know if it should have been listed as a feature of the game. It only lasted about ten minutes and the player still only fights Combine soldiers. Visually, Xen looks very interesting but relies too much on fog and doesn't have enough interesting textures. I think overall I would have enjoyed that section a lot more if it had been left as a surprise rather than advertised on the Steam page. What really redeemd the Xen sequence was the soundtrack, which did an excellent job of setting the atmosphere of wonder.  The soundtrack is all-new and generally very good.\n\nVisually, I was pretty impressed by the game. At it's best, it has some very interesting environments and makes good use of improved textures and shaders. The revolver model and Combine soldiers look particularly good with the added specularity. At it's worst, it's lit strangely and just a little bit too shiny because of the improved shaders. Some of the lighting in the early game wasn't very good, with very dark rooms and no illumination on the way forward. There was a door the player needed to find to proceed in one of the earliest puzzle rooms that was completely shrouded in darkness.\n\nI'm not quite sure how I feel about the story. The opening sequence went on for far too long and I think it killed the mood it was trying to establish. I think the same story could have been introduced with just the opening shot and one or two words from the Vortigaunt. There's no need to dramtically introduce Nova Prospekt. It seems like the exposition provided wasn't sufficient to inform the character of Adrian Shepherd of his situation, seeing that his last memory was Black Mesa being destroyed and the Gman putting him in stasis. He doesn't know what the Combine are and only associates the name Gordon Freeman with a scientist he heard was killing a lot of marines. The blindingly bright particle effects that blocked the entire scene were pretty bizarre as well. Ultimately I think the game would be a lot better with a shortened intro.\n\nThe flashback voiceovers that told Adrian Shepherd's story were a good idea, but most of them seemed totally irrelevant to the events of Prospekt and didn't really seem necessary. At one point Shepherd remembers another marine telling him how to use a suit charger. I thought to myself, "Oh, this is like a tutorial on how to restore your health and armor." Looking around, I realized there was no suit charger and the flashback was completely random.\n\nThe second and third acts of the game don't feel very purposeful. The protagonist is just sort of carried along to different locations without any reason for going there. I did particularly enjoy the environment of the last third of the game. I love the idea and I'm glad it made it into the mod, even though I think it should have been established earlier in the game rather than just thrown into the story. Not only were the visuals in that section really interesting, but there was a brief timing puzzle section involving lasers that I think was really good for pacing. I wish the game would have included more puzzles.\n\nI can't complain about the length of the game. The store page clearly states it is about the same amount of content as Half-Life 2 Episode 1, and it was definitely about that long. Especially for a one-man project like this, quality is much more important than play-time, and Prospekt was up front about that.\n\nI think it's amazing that modders can now sell their work as full games on Steam. The story of the development of Prospekt is really inspiring and it helped encourage me to keep working on my Half-Life 2 mod in the hopes that it might go on Steam free-to-play someday. I wish the best to Richard Seabrook and hope he continues to make games independently.\n\nHowever, in its current state, I can't recommend anyone buy Prospekt. The gameplay balance is all wrong, levels are set up to punish the player, and the frustration I felt at certain points just outweighed the enjoyment I got from the things I did like. Sequences like the first few fights with the Combine and the ending fight had me so frustrated I wanted to stop playing, even on the normal difficulty. I hope that the game will continue to be updated and maybe some of these flaws can be improved upon.\n\nIn summary:\nPros:\n* New environments\n* Overall good visual design\n* New soundtrack\n* Interesting first level\n\nCons:\n* Lack of variety in weapons and enemies\n* Story lacked direction\n* Poor level design gives the combine soldiers an unfair advantage\n* Barely playable on hard mode, frustrating on normal","February 20","false","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Instead, it mostly revolved around a combine shooting gallery, and awkward flashbacks of quotes Shepard had heard from his colleagues in the millitary, which didn't really add much to the game. Plus, it was very short for a Half-Life game, and didn't bring back any of the special weapons & NPCs that Shepard had in Opposing Force, which kinda bummed me out, but hey, I guess the world went to ♥♥♥♥ after Black Mesa.\n\nSo TL;DR, if you're expecting Half-Life 2: Opposing Force, this isn't quite what you're looking for. But if you enjoyed the combat aspect of Half-Life 2 more than the actual story, then this game might be something you'll enjoy.","February 28","false","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's too short and the "story" has no impact on Half-Life 2 AT ALL. In fact it's not even worthy to be the sequel to Opposing Force. If it weren't for the horribly bright flashback segments (which I feel is out of place in a Half-Life game), the player chracter could've been anybody. It might as well have been Gordon because the HUD is the normal HL2 one and you get the crowbar/flashlight instead of the wrench or knife/nightvision. This game also lacks references to it's parent game like Opposing Force does with HL1 (where you would see familiar locations or hear things from the main game like the famous Surface Tension cliffside or air strike radio guy and such). The only familiar scene you get here is what's left of the Entanglement telporter after Gordon and Alyx use it.\n\nDepite all the faults, the visuals and music are great and the sound effects are typical Half-Life 2, but sadly it's not worth the money.\n\nSidenote: also does there need to be this much swearing in a Half-Life game?","March 2","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not massively long, and is (like HL itself) a bit "on rails", but it's quite amazing given that it's the work of one developer (congrats to Mr Seabrook).\n\nThe title, setting and backstory had me expecting moments where I (as Shepherd) would encounter Gordon and/or Alyx - or maybe see them in the distance. There was IIRC such a moment in Opposing Force. Not so in this case. And the final battle was, well, a bit familiar.

Instead of boss battles you get combine gauntlets and wave battles. The "flashback" voiceovers were a nice touch, but there were no cohesive story elements. Shepherd wakes up, and shuts down the power plant. No new guns, no open world exploration, it felt claustrophobic in the citadel.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirgalahad/recommended/399120/","sirgalahad","A train","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirgalahad/","90 products in account","Prospekt is a game that feels more like a mod in the sense that prospekt focuses on the combat against the combine, because that's a easy thing to develop in a level.  What's not easy to develop within a level is a story, and great design.\n\nSomething that's quite clear within the whole game is that Prospekt is made by a Modder, and not a Game Developer.  A Modder tinkers with a game, making it more difficult or more fun by adding things or changing configs, making a new stage maybe.  A Game Developer wants to share a story, create a experience the player has.  While a Mod can breath new life into a game, a Game Developer makes the game that gets played to death in the first place.\n\nAnd that's the difference.  This feels like a mod, a challenge, extra things to a great game.  Not a game of it's own.  And to that it's a highly developed one, one that shows potential in a future game designer, one that shouldn't have full creative direction mind you, but someone who designs levels for players.  And like a mod made for challange, it adds it artificially, by changing a config for the enemies to be made tougher.  Instead of making you fight tough enemies with lots of bullets and a weak gun, you have strong guns to kill a tank.  Actually scratch the whole mod part, it feels like a lower level mod doing that, higher level mods, like the Long War for XCOM: EU/EW actually make the game more exciting by making a higher level tactical play that wasn't in the original, and that to me makes this feel like it's not quite worth it's full $10.00 tag.  It's a lower level mod based around level design and a poor story with good music for what it is and decent voice acting, the actors may be able to actually do fantastic things in the future if they're given proper direction.  To be honest this game doesn't feel like the worse for the price tag, hell better then some indie games with higher reviews an price from what I've seen.  But you should pick up all the original games first, and then some other games on sale and such before even considering this one.  There's much better bang for buck ratio around on steam.\n\n=== Video Review ===\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6M4b2n1wvd8&feature=youtu.be","February 20","false","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The issues I've mentioned before seemed to be fixed. Paths seemed a lot clearer, especially the figuring out of the ventilation shaft in that one area with the antlions, there is now a neat little monitor that points you in the right direction (practically a neon sign and very hard to miss this monitor), though figuring it out wasn't hard. The updates definitely made the game more clear to understand story wise... or maybe that was because I've replayed it the few number of times I did that made me understand it better.\n\nThe annoying filter on the flashbacks is gone, and replaced with a slight contrast tone which is much nicer and actually makes the flashbacks more enjoyable.\n\nMaybe my aim improved, or the patches updated the health of the Combine, but they didn't feel too much like bullet sponges, especially when there were waves of them, on my latest playthrough.\n\nWay to go on improving the game, also I thought the addition of commentary was a good addon to address some neat objects in a room or environment, or simply explain the thought behind something.\n\nOverall a much better experience.\n\n\nOLD REVIEW BELOW:\n\nIt's okay.\n\nStory needs more story so it can make sense. Flashback moments get annoying due to the weird filter of things, but the flashbacks were a nice touch nonetheless. I commend the game for having a single guy put all of it together and it's pretty good by that standard. It did something good, and that's all the game really is, just good. While the voice acting, and music stand out as great, as well as a couple cool new models that were cool (New Combine soldiers), it wasn't all too impressive.\n\nThe damage dealt was ridiculously low even on normal, and made the game feel a bit unbalanced, especially at some points when there would be waves of enemies that just seem like bullet sponges.\nSometimes I didn't know why I was doing things, like the small teleportation to Xen and back. Seemed a bit forced and could ahve done without it, as when I got back to the space station I noticed I could have just walked around if it wasn't for a shield wall.\nIn general I jsut felt like many moments in the game didn't really make sense as to why things were happening the way they were. The jail cell breakout was a bit confusing, and I don't understand why everyone left to go check out an alarm. The place where the giant thumper machines were turned off and the limitless antlion army started to appear I was a bit confused as to where to go and wandered around and back trecked for a few minutes before seeing the ventilation shaft and thinking I could go that way, which of course was right. Another moment was running around the giant portal area wher eI had to turn off the three buttons, I honeslty don't know why I did that or what the point was, besides opening a door, if I was going to just going to blow up the station anyway.\n\nAlso Richard, my condolences on the loss, and I hope your next project will be better.","February 20","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Prospekt was that sandwich. It was that perfect sandwich, the perfect next sandwich in the perfect Half-Sub trilogy. It wasn't Half-Sub 3, but it was good enough. You'd wanted to eat an official Half-Sub sandwich for years. It was that sandwich you'd crave all day, and finally pay $15 (!?!?) for. And then you'd take a big, juicy bite of it... and realize it was made of ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥. And then die.\n\n1. There are tons of useless, ugly, annoying effects, "flashbacks", etc. it doesn't help that these come up in the middle of fights and stuff. They make no sense, they're annoying, and they ♥♥♥♥ing hurt your eyes and give you a headache.\n\n2. There's no damn story! Well, unless you count the cheesy dialogue that tells me everything I already know, and the flashbacks going through shepherd's day before the incident, which by the way contains "your mom" jokes.\n\n3. There's not even any gameplay. No, wandering aimlessly, killing huge hordes of combine soldiers and pressing buttons that open doors is not gameplay. In Half-Life 1 & 2 at least there's story or context or something to guide you so you're not completely lost. I get the feeling this guy only played the original games once, and didn't even pay attention to the dialogue.\n\n4. Countless other things, including bad level design (he fires the flashback lines on a ♥♥♥♥ing timer), a magical crowbar that gives you an HEV suit, pointless, annoying, endless effects, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ "gameplay" and "story"... Ugh.\n\n5. I hate almost everything about this game except PARTS of the level design. The layout of the maps are complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t but the detailing is actually quite nice. It's essentially the only thing that's on-par or maybe even slightly better than what you'd see in an official Half-Life game. But of course it's completely ruined by everything else. I can only imagine what whoever at Valve first saw this thought when the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Vortigaunt impression came on.\n\n6. The crap it says in the description about there being new assets, high resolution (whatever), etc. etc. is true. Yeah, all the assets are different. FROM THE ORIGINAL OPPOSING FORCE. They're there to make you think they replaced the Half-Life 2 assets, but they actually ARE Half-Life 2 assets and they just mean they used higher quality assets from the original Opposing Force. This right here, I think, proves that this guy was totally just in it for the money. And he flopped right on his damn face. That description is such ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t it makes me angry.\n\nTL;DR This is not the Half-Life game you've been waiting for. This isn't even a game. It's not even a mod! It's a damn Half-Life 2 map pack. If you however just HAVE to play it, at least get it on a sale for like $0.50 or something.\n\n2/10\n","May 27","false","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
