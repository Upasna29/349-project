"http://steamcommunity.com/id/obibun/recommended/336300/","obibun","Obibun.tw","http://steamcommunity.com/id/obibun/","99 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI've only put a few hours into this game, but can already tell there's a mountain of possibilities here. Definitely BUY this, support the developers and follow it closely!\n\nIf you like classic RTS games like Settlers, Majesty or the Anno series, this is a very well-produced hybrid of those in progress. You build a city, manage resource production / distribution, train a military and fight off monsters / other cities. There's also a roguelike, sandbox element in that your city exists on an overworld map with other cities who will trade with you, invade you, or be subject to invasions/raids.\n\nThough it's not complete yet, it's clear that the developers have done a good, solid job of building the engine and foundations -- that is to say, from here it seems like a lot of the groundwork has been done and the rest will simply be adding content and features.\n\nFeatures I would like to see implemented in the future:\n\n- Greater varience of buildings/skins, or random rotations (at present there is only one "look" for houses, for example, which can make blocks of houses which you need lots of, look somewhat bland or boring)\n\n- More supply/demand dynamic for trading. Resources often have a relatively set cost that hardly deviates at all. I would like to see something implemented where resources will fluctuate more heavily in price, even between other cities. It makes trading more exciting/dynamic, as currently if two other cities want to buy your resource, they will both largely offer an identical price. I would like to see this fluctuate, so that a player would have to pay attention to trading -- and could even mean that a player running a "trading village" could be economically viable, as buying resources low from certain cities and selling high to others at a profit could potentially work.\n\n- More permanent overworld map changes as the game progresses. i.e. other cities going to war and "taking over" rivals, which would in essence form small "kingdoms" (say, a certain NPC city will then own 2 or 3 cities). Also perhaps something like "invasions" of other cities from monsters, so that cities would become "monster citadels" or "lairs" if they are taken over.\n\n- More military options (siege weapons, different units (perhaps using shields and swords as resources as well))\n\n- Better "fortification" options. Right now there are stone walls and stone gatehouses, but only wooden stockades and no wooden gatehouses. This would be a valuable addition.\n\n- More monsters, though I think the devs have already mentioned wanting to do this. Goblins, orcs, dragons, etc. etc. etc.\n\n\n\nOverall though, great game, one of my most favourite in recent memory, and I can't wait until the content starts being more fully fleshed out. There's so much potential here.","December 12, 2014","true","15.0"," 34 of 37 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","34","37","0","0"

It has a learning curve, and the game is unforgiving.  It is a fun city building game with elements of pre-built in conflict.  Neighbors WILL invade.  you have local unfriendlies that will compete for city space and block access to resources.  but the worst enemy is you.  i had to restart multiple times to get the "right" build for my city.  some of the problems with design only become apparent later on in the game.  for example, i built my city in such a way that my peddlers (a food resource distribution node) would not cover the area needed, and i was out of resources to create a new node, but i need more houses to house more workers to.... you get the idea.\n\nThere are things in the game that are not intuitive (mostly UI issues) that are annoying, more than game breaking.  so be prepared for some tedium.  Overall, i had fun :)","September 2, 2015","true","61.3"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","17","17","0","0"

Did not expect much of it, because, you know: "those greenlight games". Actually - so much fun!\nThis is a decent village simulation game which is drawn greatly, easy to understand, yet hard to master. You got to keep a lot of things together - food, water, bunch of different resources, trades, quests. You build hollow buildings and villagers come to your village looking for work and housing. Forgot about food supply - two hundred starving peasants just pack their stuff and leave you a ghost town behind. Planned a lot of farming and focused on prosperity? BOOM! Plague comes to your village! A lot of tweaks and different structures. A lot of ores to mine. A lot of plants to gather. A lot of Alcohol to brew.\n\nAt its current state I'd suggest a newbie tutorial, because there is none. I've built 3 or 4 towns to their bancrupcy just because I didn't figure out what should I build to provide food to mah citizens. Great game. I'd lower a price a bit and then it would be a great deal for all sim-city fans.","December 15, 2014","true","1.8"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","22","27","2","0"

Those complaints come from people who play on "normal" setting and can't deal with it. Hint: You can set it to "very easy" and adjust every other aspect in the settings!\n------------------------------------------------\n\nHearthlands must have come a long way in the past couple of months because I can't see any of the mentioned negative points. This game is pretty fantastic by now. People complain about the difficulty. Well, that's more of a misunderstanding. Your neighbours will bully you and eventually invade you if you don't build up defences. That's how it should be btw.\nSo don't just build a farming community and expect to be left in peace. Build some troops.\nIf you don't feel like fighting, then you can comfortably set the a.i. to passive mode. You can also improve relations by trade and other means.\nYou can also select a sandbox mode. You can set up the game any way you like. Difficulty, number of opponents, kind of dwellings...\nYou can select 1 of 4 cultures to play as. The options are huge.\n\nHearthlands even feels polished by now. You finally have a zoom function which I imagine must have sucked without. The game runs absolutely stable. There's so much to do and it's just so much fun.

I'm surprised how well it runs, it hasn't crashed once since I got it and I've seen no bugs so far. To be honest, this is the best EARLY ACCESS game I've ever bought. This is how early access should be done. Either way, the game itself has a lot to offer I've only played it for a few hours and still I'm far from reaching the "end game". This game is totally worth 15€ but it gets very frustrating when failing at the easiest difficulty and with not a lot of rivals on.

I haven't had this much fun since "Sim City 2000," and this game is superior.  Better than "Banished" as the end-game isn't pointless economic tedium, but RTS / TD feudal city building.  I love this game.  I have spent 100s of hours playing before launch testing and on Desura, & still can't wait to play again.  The progression from city building and farming to battling graveyard ghouls feels right.  The pacing is pleasing, not overwhelming like an RTS.  One can actually get to know their villagers a bit before they are destroyed years later.  "Hearthlands" also lets the player design their city a bit more openly, providing awards for evironmental prowess and properly spaced villages.  The restrictions are still there, but the player has room to add a few trees and such without it hurting the economy;  it in fact boosts it.  If you miss the good old days of simulation cities but don't want to deal with the new age bullsh!t being pushed by the AAA publishers, this is a great game and company to support.  Very few games make me smile, give me glimmers of happiness... this game does just that by evoking my childhood imagination for sim cities once again.  "Hearthlands" is the perfect compliment to my other work -art- as it inspires & amuses.  Just how many little villages didn't make it?  How many millions slaughtered just so that we could survive on?  This is a great break from the intensity of "Crusader Kings" yet still one can entertain the same novel characters & events in their own storybook style sandbox.   --  Oldschool Respect -- Critics of the graphics should understand the homage to the early era of sims & keep in mind the appeal to a generation which utilized their imaginations more than their eyes.  Tolkien's favorite rendering of his books was of the Hobbit and Golem doing riddles in the dark, an abstract with few details.  Tolkien said he loved it because it left more to the imagination of the beholder.  That is why I love "Hearthlands," how it inspires me to a better state of mind.","December 16, 2014","true","18.6"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

Most things work exactly the same way but there are several different industries, different buildings to built and material chains to construct. Though if you like Zeus then you are sure to like this one too. Definitely enjoyed building new types of industry and gathering resources. Tutorial could use more expanding though, needs explanation about how trading and military work. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys more town building focused rather than military focused town building games, as you can choose to pretty much turn off any kind of fighting, and to anyone who likes Zeus, Pharaoh and Emperor: Rise of the middle kingdom type of games.","May 28, 2015","true","2.9"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

I liked the fact that nords can't grow crops. The resource management is great and factions are well ballanced.

At its core, it plays similar to SimCity, but it takes the concept in new directions.\n\nIt's easy to get into, and there's a lot of depth.  The tutorial is straightforward and quick, which is nice; it doesn't hit you with unwanted dialogue like many tutorials do.\n\nThe gameplay is set up in a way such that new concepts are introduced at just the right pace: after you've produced enough food for your townspeople, they start asking for other luxuries like alcohol, furniture, and boots.  Amusingly, they put alcohol at a higher priority than everything except food.  Once you have a production line set up for the resources they want, their houses automatically get upgraded, and you continue onto their next wishes.  The pacing is great.\n\nAs time goes on, AI-controlled opponents will start to interact with you.

It's cheaper, way more features, and succeeds everywhere this game fails.\n\nI would like to put a huge disclaimer here before writing a scathing review. Some points..\n1. The game is in alpha, there still can be a huge amount of improvements made and the game will only get better.\n2. I don't really hate the game it's not really that bad. See my review for Skyshines Bedlam, now that is a crappy game! But given the option to put a only a thumbs up or a thumbs down, I have to choose thumbs down at this time. but it's barely a thumbs down, mind you. I'm simply comparing it to other games (like Gnomaria) and it just falls short is all.\n3. The dev is very active, working his ♥♥♥ off, and I do have hopes for this game. Plus I love supporting small companies, so don't regret buying it.\n4. I bought this game simple for the fact it had a 90% positive rating. That's why when playing it and finding some glaring issues, I was a bit surprised.\n5. $10 is pretty good value. Once it get's more polished I can see this being quite favorable. So I can't hold that against it. In fact quite the contrary. I wish more games in this price range existed.\nOk now for stuff I don't like this game.\n\n-Music. It's simply horrid. you turn if off immediately. There is this chicken noise also that chimes every 5 seconds, making you pull your hair out, especially if you're wearing headphones.  2/10\n\n- Combat. First, there is a goblin that takes a beeline path from his base to yours. The same exact path every time. At first you have to chase him with the couple troops you can muster, but then you just end up placing a tower in his path to destroy him. Next, a sewer opens up in some random spot near your town, and 3 jelly monsters pop out of it. You just park your troops on top of this to stop them. But since everything is on 5 minute timers, you just leave some troops on top of this forever and let them level up. Then unless you pay out the nose to the other factions demanding constant crap from you, they will eventually attack. This isn't much of an issue though, because they just show up on the edge of the map and stand there until you can get around to killing them. Or you can just leave them out there and completely ignore.\n\nAfter you raise an army, you think "Hey I should go attack my enemies". So you pull up the combat screen, say which enemy you want to atatck, how many troops you want to send, and then receive a message you lost. You don't actually get to see the battle or know how you lost, you just lose. It does say the power level of the enemy to be "35" and mine to be "65", but how many troops you need to send after a level 35 enemy or why you even lost is a mystery.  I can conceed that perhaps if I played long enough to get to power level 300, it may be possible to beat a level 35 enemy, but not seeing battle or anything other than "you lost" is kinda a turn off and not much fun. Plus you can only have 10 (I think) total squads, and I was at the max. But perhaps you can send in only expensive horseman to win and not a a mix or archers, axeman, and pikeys like I did. But honestly it was so infuriating sending my entire army in to squash an enemy and just getting a message "you lose", I never actually attempted it a 2nd time. I just never saw the point.\n\nThen a troll spawns on the map and starts killing your new arrivals as they walk right by his hole and you think "Okay, now it's on!". Did I mention there is only 4 troop types? You send the troops in and attack the troll. you notice one guy getting pummeled is an archer and maybe he should retreat. Nope can't move him. Hey I should have my swordman form a defensive line in front of the archers. Nope, everyone just stays in some ramdom cluster jumble, zero control. You basically just watch it unfold and do nothing.  2/10\n\n- Resource Management. Now this is where you would expect the game to shine but sadly it doesn't. You quickly learn that you need to be around metal, and you need to get rank 3 mining (underground) before you exhaust the metal or you will never get any more, ever. Then you basically err on the side of caution and stash as much food and wood away as you can while slowly building up commodities like boots and pillows. There was a couple others, but I cant recal. oh yeah chairs! There aren't a lot of options. If you do get a surplus of anything, you just sell it off, but the interface is so clunky and tedious, it's usually easier to just toss up more storage as you will eventually need the goods. But this is definitely the funnest part of the game.  5/10\n\n- Graphics. Meh they're simple but unless you didn't look at screenshot you expect this. But sprite based animation is so easy to change you really get upset that nothing is done, they walk around and that is it. Nothing like planetbase where they put their hands up in a storm to shield their eyes, or Gnomaria where they get injured and bleed or lose a leg and walk around with a pegleg or... you know... status changes to make it interesting.  But I do like the house designs and artwork, so would rate this the highest part of the game honestly. And it's alpha, so I say it's off to a good start. For what it is, I would go   8/10.","October 19, 2015","false","17.4"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","14","24","0","3"

And I think that's a good thing.  The first three games I mentioned are all still very playable, and just as engaging as they were years ago... and Hearthlands is carrying on that tradition.  The graphics are charming if a bit cartoonish... as soon as I saw the red/white mushrooms I thought of Smurfs and a flash of horror crossed my brain... but that's fine.  The tutorial is quite helpful, and does a good job of easing you into the increasingly complex world of city-building and chains of production.\n\nI can already feel myself reaching for some graph paper to plot out optimum city planning, which is something I did with Caesar... which in itself is a pretty big compliment.

Well, at least, I will recommend it in the future.\nHere's a few problems:\n- Since this is still an unfinished game, there isn't any good tutorial\n- The game's civilizations are not balanced. I have found that playing with Eastern is by far the easiest way to play.\n- Some limitations of the game are a bit annoying. For example, everybody should be able to fish. There is no geographical exceptions to fishing usually. Everybody used to fish because it was available as a source of food.\n- The game is EXTREMELY HARD or COMPLETELY EASY. The difficulty meter is broken I'm telling you. Unless nothing costs a thing, it can get really hard. Everybody starts being mad with you all at the same time, even if you trade a lot.\n- I often feel like the guys that deliver the stuff just deliver food or something. Everybody needs beer or something and since there's only 0.1 of food left, he decides to deliver food instead, which ends up causing the houses to devolve.\n- I have seen a few bugs in the flag colour selections. I try to switch colours, but then it switches the logo, and when I want to select white and I'm at black, I need to pass by yellow, which switches the other colour, so I have to go all the way back to black, select the other colour, etc.\n- Getting a steady income is actually really hard. When you start making soldiers, making enough money to pay for them all is really hard. Apart from taxes and trade, there's no income, if you're an Easterner.\n- Sometimes, I get overloaded with a bunch of resources. In my last gameplay, I had over 500 wurst. I was selling all the meat I could, but I had to make wurst to make my people eat it, but then there was too much food and all. The problem here is that, we can't throw away resources or sell them at a reduced price to "nobody".\n- Other countries start with soldiers and get a lot of them really fast, whilst it takes ages for us and we have none in the beginning.\n\nThe list goes on and on, but as I said, this is an alpha. However, at the moment, it is playable, enjoyable and really challenging. I think it is paving its way to a really good game. This could be an awesome game if it could be played in multiplayer too.","October 12, 2015","true","1.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

In Hearthlands it actually allows you to have a bigger world, so you can have a capital, you can invade rivals/Dragon's lairs, or enemy fortresses. The game is a bit to brutal so I don't know what happenes if you send troops to attack an enemy, I have no clue if you can command your units or see your opponants base once you've sent troops.\n\nNegetives----\nSupply and Demand: I swear the supply vs demand "system" is broken, or glitchy in some way, I constantly find myelf missing food for my people or my farm animals. As an example, on the "stock" tab it shows you how much of X resource you have stored, and it shows how much you are making or losing, in 1 game (even though this happened for ALL my games) I had 0 turnips in stock, yet It said I had +79, I don't know how the system works, or if it's even a supply and demand system, if this is a Supply Vs Demand system it needs some heavy fixing, as in game's like Hearthlands, Anno, and Settlers I can never get into the game due to a lack of Supply Vs demand systems.\nGraphics: I don't like to nit-pick on graphics most of the time, commonly i'm fine with any art style, but Hearthlands is...well.. "Mobile" looking, I feel like it looks like a mobile-game, and some things (like the female characters) look almost out of place.\nUnit variations: The unit variations are very lacking, to my knowledge there are only 4 units:Axemen, Spearmen, Archers, and Horsemen... That's it? No costumization, no siege units, No magic units, (even though magic is an element in the game) not even knights/swordsmen?\nUnit requirements:This is my opinion, others might think differently, but I really hate when in order to build 1 unit, let's say a Axeman, you require a iron spear, and chainmail. It makes sense, but it seems like I have to waste my time to buy ores/build a mine, build a smelter (or buy ingots) and then build a workshop to make weapons and armor, I perfer a more simple system, like Age of Empires, where you require 300 food, 100 gold, and 250 wood for an example, maybe Hearthlands could include a "quota" system, where If I want to build 8 Horsemen, it will get all the needed supplies (if I have them) and store them till we can build the Horsemen.\n\nI hope that they will fix these issues, and the game is still playable (to a point), I recommend you get it if your into strategy games, City-building, Anno games, etc, if you aren't into those types of games I recommend you look up other reviews to verify if you want it or not.\n\nThat is all I can think of at this momment, sorry if my review sucks lol.","February 16","true","6.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's simple in the way that up until around the 7th year all you really have to worry about is keeping your villagers fed and plague-less and you'll be fine. Around the 8th year prepare for a ♥♥♥♥ storm because woops your sewers just broke and there are monsters climbing around your city that look surprisingly similar to hounds from Dont Starve but instead bounce like fuzzy balls and, most probably, smell like ♥♥♥♥. You will be attacked by wizards, trolls, other kingdoms and then when you think you've gone through it all; the elements will rise against you and you'll wonder why on earth you ever purchased such a game that is so pretty and basic-looking but pretty much ♥♥♥♥s you from every angle.\n\n10/10 well done on this game, seriously.","May 1","true","16.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The progression of the city is way to quick, and since you can't rotate the buildings yet, you normally want to start on the left side so everything can look right!

Before this update invasions where a real challenge and to survive on easy setting you still had to prepare defense structures and have at least 3 armies pretty early in the game.  This beat me down a ton but I learned as I lost and adjusted accordingly.  Now the invasions seem totally pointless as I never lose them and suffer no consequences for the battle, a battle it should be noted again that I never get to see.\n\nAlso of note is that getting a notification every time a new trade route opens or a current one ends does not serve me much in terms of usage.  At least compared to how frequently they occur.  I check trade routes regularly as is and don't need to be remind.  However, it would be really nice to be able to jump to the spot on the map where my citizens are being killed!  Nearly every game I have played has put me in the spot of scowering the map over and over trying to find where a citizen or merchant has been killed.  It can be something as silly as a sewer monster hiding behind a build (and hard to see even with the transparent building setting on) and completely ruining my towns reputation.\n\nPopulation growth is still off balance imho.  It seems that my town rep never becomes positive no matter what I do.  Have a walled in, protected town with a booming economy and no enemies on the map?  Still terrible rating.  It either is a flaw in the game or I'm too dumb to figure out something right in front of me.\n\nAs usualy my complaints sound ungrateful considering how much I absolutley adore this game.  It truly is a hidden gem of the citing building genre and I can't stop playing it for too long.  I hope the end game content sharpens up as the devs continue to tweek.\n\n\nTRIPLE UPDATE:  Not even at V1.0 and this is one of my favorite games of all time.  80 hours in and I finally have a grip on the very easy setting game.  It's kinda awesome figuring a game out with nary a wiki available, at least not in English.  I can't wait to see what the devs add next (will Magic be useful?  Zoom function?  Better pathfinding for military units?).  This is the city building/resource management game I've been waiting for since forever.  Thanks!\n\n\nDOUBLE UPDATE:  I love this game.  Don't buy it.  You'll never want to stop playing.\n\n\nUPDATE:  I think I love this game, I'm sure I'm terrible at it and I know I'll lose many many more hours into it.  HOW DO I EVEN SUSTAIN?\n\n\n\nI've put in almost 5 hours since I bought this game the other night, so I really really like it.  However, I'm having a terrible time keeping everything straight.  This is probably my own shortcomings, but when I go to make military units I'm never sure if I have enough leather and feather (ha!) going to my industry buildings instead of food.  I would love, LOVE a zoom in/out attached to the mouse wheel.  Being able to get a bird's eye view of the developing city would help a ton as it gets bigger and bigger.\n\nAs is, the placement mechanizm is great, the art work charming and it's basically a deeper, less combat and mission reliant verison of Majesty.  Which is pretty damn awesome.\n\nTL;DR\nYou need military units or everyone dies.\n10/10 will fail more over and over.","July 14, 2015","true","131.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
