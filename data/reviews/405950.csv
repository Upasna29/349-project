This time I absolutely made the correct choice.\n\n“Lowglow” is a casual, meditative puzzle game composed of colors, lights and sound. Lights fall from the “sky”, and must be guided by the player to that puzzle’s target, somewhere on the screen. This is done by placing, and angling, one or several “bouncy” lines. There is no time restraint, no rush (except for one specific achievement.) The lights fall, and bounce, and change direction and speed based on color and type of the object they contact. “Lowglow” is, in fact such a simple game, conceptually, that I find it difficult to produce an interesting review, though to not make the effort would be tragic.\n\nSometimes it seems the object of “Lowglow” isn’t necessarily to simply reach the target, but to create the most beautiful, and musical, pathway of flowing and singing lights in the process. I suspect there are “best” methods, but the presence of achievements based on supra-par success indicates that there are many, perhaps dozens, of winning choices for each level. This is also a strong indication of replayability. The line(s) must be placed and angled very precisely, so a knowledge of physics and Newton’s laws of gravity will certainly come in handy. Lines can very easily be placed, changed, moved and deleted. Controls could not be simpler.\n\nI don’t know how long “Lowglow” gameplay lasts, but after about 2 hours I have only 2 of 12 achievements, so I suspect the increased difficulty of further levels will add quite a lot of time to game completion. (As levels are locked until accessed, I can’t speak further at this point.) As well, there is an editor in the works to add even more interest and wonder. Sometimes I find myself grinning from amazement at the complexity of a winning scene.\n\nAlong with “Lowglow” gameplay is a pleasant and entertaining story of exploration, and (one presumes) spiritual growth. While interesting to some, this can be easily skipped by those that wish, as it doesn’t seem necessary to the puzzle mechanics. The puzzle mechanics themselves seem to be such that as soon as it seems the game grows easy, something new is encountered that must be investigated thoroughly through vigorous investigation of the effects of gravity and propulsion.\n\n“Lowglow” is a wonderfully entertaining game with a superior learning curve and significant challenges. It’s a bit more expensive than most conceptually similar puzzle games, but by no means excessively so, and quite possibly the editor will add completely new dimensions to explore. It can be played very easily while doing almost anything else that you may find to be of less interest (such as meetings or conversations.) At this stage I can only express a feeling that this game was created as a labor of love, and to play it is no labor at all.","December 5, 2015","true","7.7"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","21","22","0","1"

I personally like the the art and sound design. Some of the dialog is so-so but the atmospheric mumbling noises in the background help to mitigate that, once again a praise to the sound design.\n\nThe levels are not that hard at first, then they start to require quite a bit of trial and error to get it just right. It's fun as even a slight change in one of the lines can totally change the trajectory. Around the green area, some of the puzzles seem like impossible without using the help lines. Oh, and the feeling when you get a level completed off the bat by just drawing a single line, awesome.\n\nSo, the game has some bad moments but a lot more enjoyment than dissapointment. Totally worth the price if you enjoy puzzle games.","December 3, 2015","true","3.6"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

Each stage is set up so that there is a max number of lines to be drawn in order to accomplish the goal. Which in the case of this game is to get a glowy bit into a blackhole repeatedly. It's not enough to get just one you need to get multiple in and additionally they need to be successive.\n\nThe lines you draw are bouncy and they fling the glowy bits relative to their polarity. There are gems. Lets call them gems, I'm not really sure what they are called. But they exist as obstacles in the stage. Their color has great significance as everything starts as blue. Pulling the glowy bits toward the bottom of the screen. The glowy bits adopt the last color gem and its properties that they have touched. There is also yellow, red and green. Yellow, as you might have guessed pulls the glowy bits up. Red, cancels the or destroys the glowy bits. Green however, not seen until later stages has no arc and go strait. So as stages get more intricate you must take into account the changing properties of the glowy bits.\n\nThere is also some strange narrative thrown in the form of gods being left in the dark and some pylons needing to be re-lit to recover the city or world. These are told in the form of some, being honest, creepy faces that float ambiguously in the sky and speak in very low incomprehensible dulcet tones. Of course that is on purpose as there is text directly underneath.\n\nI found the game to be extremely relaxing as there is no timer or no penalty for moving, changing reshaping or destroying lines. As the glowy bits recede and cascade across the gems into the night that make it a very ambient “wind chime in space” effect that is rather pleasant in that when making minor adjustments to your lines is very soothing not not all taxing. The game is instead scored by how many lines you use to accomplish your task. There are on some stages the chance to obtain “golden lines”. There are a finite number of these and should you use one of them in a difficult stage you lose it forever. The game says something to the affect that they remain there forever which scared me to use them at all because I didn't think I could readjust them but you indeed can. However once the stage is complete you loose the golden line. The only real loss is that these golden lines are also used for unlocking bonus stages outside the city.\n\nTHE GIST\nA really great relaxing puzzle game that is great for in between games as a palate cleanser as well just something nice and enjoyable to play for atmosphere.","April 25","true","5.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/keohookalani/recommended/405950/","keohookalani","keohookalani","http://steamcommunity.com/id/keohookalani/","2712 products in account","Lowglow is a tale about restoring light to the world. As the last surviving member of your species, you must traverse an area, bringing light back to it, while harnessing the lowglow. At the end is the Darkness who must be defeated at all costs.\n\nLowglow is a very relaxing puzzler that takes you on a journey of physics while introducing some fun mechanics along the way. The music is very calming and can even bring you out of a rage after playing Linea, the game. :P\n\nMusic: Extremely calming and relaxing. For a change, I didn't put anything else on in the background. I was very soothed by it and even when I was having issues getting the puzzles right, I didn't mind because the sound effects and music were just so peaceful. This was right after playing Linea, which is highly rage inducing, so that is a consideration in how calming the music is.\n\nGraphics: Fairly simple, but well designed for what it is. Not much more than what is presented is needed. Nothing is too intense, and it also helps to create a rather peaceful atmosphere.\n\nStory: Pretty simple. Not very deep or exciting, but then this is mostly a puzzle game. I would have been fine without a story to be honest. But that it has one at all, is just a bonus.\n\nControls: Mouse driven. Nothing else is really needed. Easy to work and is intuitive.\n\nGameplay: Pretty simple, bounce the light to the end goal. Using physics and some mechanics you'll get it there. The game slowly introduces new ideas in each chapter and they are fairly easy to understand, but a bit harder to master.\n\nOverall: 7.5/10 - Seriously as a nice calming puzzle game, this game is really good. I thoroughly enjoyed myself over the course of several hours. While I haven't 100%'ed it yet, I have beaten the main story and look forward to going back and mastering the rest of the levels. Once you complete the game, there are extra bonus levels to complete. The base price of $8 honestly isn't a bad thing. I mean, sure you could get it on sale for cheaper, but it's not a bad way to spend your money, just know that it has been bundled before.\n","June 5","true","8.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I doubt there should be any "motivation" of the solution for some of them.  I solved vault 1 by first noticing a chaotic behaviour in the intersection of two forcing fields, then putting the line there and adjusting for around 100 different angles (subtle adjustments, obviously). And not surprisingly, even the smallest adjustment of the position will lead to a completely different outcome.\n\nI think when you have two constant force fields acting in the opposite direction with possible reflections (as in vault 1), the system becomes highly chaotic. I mean not even normal dynamical systems like a double pendulum but much more complicated governing systems. It is therefore almost impossible to know what should work out - you just have to keep trying.\n\nMore surprising is vault 4, it has a constant forcing field and an electric field (as the particle gets repelled), I believe the system should be 100x more complicated that the above case and have not yet figured out the correct position of the second line. You need a huge acceleration from the forcing field, but I don't know whats the initial condition.\n\nMaybe I am just not playing in the correct style, but aside from the bonus puzzles everything work out fine for me.\n\nAlso, it will be extremely helpful if there is a replay mode - Some of the curvatures are amazing.","December 9, 2015","true","6.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This wasnt an exception.  Gameplay is simplistic, bounce the ball from a to b, using a predetermined number of lines.  I didnt find much of a difficulty curve as the levelled progressed which disapointed me, however I play a lot of these games, so it may be due to prior experience.  A new player may find the added challenges more, well, challenging.  The bonus content levels however, definitely upped the difficulty quite a bit, and those were by far the most enjoyable/frustrating puzzles of the game.\n\nI could've done with out the cutesy defeat the darkness story line, but thats a personal preference, it wasn't overbearing, and didnt detract from the game much, (and theres the option to skip all cutscenes), I just prefer to grind games like these from start to finish, no story needed.  The ambience of the game was nice however, nothing amazing, but the minimalistic graphics and surrealish audio was a nice switch from most physics games.  Overall I'm going to give this game 7/10, I personally wouldnt pay 8$ for it, but I'd buy it on sale for 5$ or less.","April 5","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Game provided by Rockodile social media.)\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=631864806\n\nPrepare to cast your Magic Missile, because you're about to face off against the Darkness.  (...no really, that's pretty much the story)\n\nEnjoy a game of "Bounce the ball of light to the exit by drawing lines" on an overworld that mimics a Simon board. (well...not exact, but very similar)  A decent puzzle game that'll take about 8-10 hours of gameplay before you reach completion without guides.\n\nThe game is pleasing to the eye and ear, but can get frustrating on later levels and bonus levels. (Which will pretty much require that bonus golden line you end up collecting)   However, this game is not without bugs.  I've found a few areas where my lightballs would squeeze into tight crevices that seem sealed and on one occassion, I completed a bonus world to be greeted by a non-existant level after the last level of the sector called "Level Name Here".\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=631864609\n\nThere isn't much to say about this game, but I will say that for the most part, the game was a pleasant experience.  Sadly, though, there isn't much replayability once you've finished aside from difficult bonus maps.\n\nIs it worth paying full price?  To be honest, $7 is a little steep for this game.  If it was $5, that would be a fair price.  Though, $2.50 would be ideal.  Wait for a sale before you nab it.\n\n6/10  A good, casual experience.","February 24","true","9.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When the light hits a block of a certain color, it's behavior changes. (Red destroys the light, Blue makes it gravitate downward, Yellow makes it gravitate upward, and Green makes it impervious to gravity.) Every time the light hits a block, a musical chime plays, so it reminds me of the old DS game Electroplankton. The levels are very 'trial and error' heavy, but there's no time limit, so you can just relax and play your way through. Its a pretty short game, but definately worth the $4 I paid for it on sale. :)","April 28","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Glowingly beautiful graphics combined with a dynamic audio environment make sure that Lowglow is an unforgettable, mind-bending experience for you!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G49zPRYoU6w\nComments+Graphics are very simple, yet colorful and fit well with the puzzle theme. The lighting is well done with multitudes of light sources casting shadows across the levels.\n\n+Soundtrack/ambience are incredibly soothing and makes for a deep atmosphere.\n\n+Puzzling involves drawing and managing lines that make small light particles bounce. The goal of each level is to get enough light particles to the target. As the particles bounce, they produce musical notes and small pathways; you can make more music by providing the particles with a longer, more complex pathway to the goal.\n\n+Mechanics are simple and yet charming to the point where you feel like messing around trying to find all the different ways to complete a level. (producing a variety of music while doing so)\n\n+Difficulty: There is a strong learning curve: you must find new ways to get the light particles to the goal. This gets increasingly difficult when progressing to new stages. New colored blocks are introduced, as well as other obstacles in the environment.\n\n+Story is quite the interesting one. As you complete levels, you will encounter dialogues that shed more light on what is happening in the game.\n\n-Dialog is a little out of place at times, and sometimes a little awkward.\n\n-May be a few bugs, but other then dialog, this game does not have many negative connotations\n\nFinal OverviewLowglow is a great little atmospheric puzzle game boasting crisp graphics, soothing soundtrack, and simple yet enjoyable mechanics. Furthermore, at a sale price or normal price of $7.99, Lowglow is worth your money. As a bonus, the developers are planning on adding level editor and steam workshop, which would both immensely help the game with content.\n\nVerdict: 8/10","December 6, 2015","true","4.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

However, the story itself seems pretty short and the achievements are pretty simple and few.\n\nI would reccomend this game on sale but, at its current price, I would suggest finding many better things to use your money on.","May 3","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You also get a Golden which is a once only use on any level/stage and carrys over if  you don't use it in the last level/stage. They can also be used up to unlock those vaults.\n\nThere are five stages and from three to five or so levels in the stage. There is story, well lets just say it wasn't all that interesting. I think audio is stereo only, and graphics are fine.\n\n================================\nPlayed on Raikou (Gigabyte P35x V3): i74710HQ, 16GB RAM, GTX 980M, 128GB SSD mSATA, 2TB HDD, Win 7 Pro x64, BD-R ODD, FHD display; resolution 1920x1080","April 19","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You need to move 1 (or more) lightlets from Point A to Point B, using "bumpers" and the terrain. Different colours affect the way your lightlet moves (straight, up, down, etc.). It does not have a lot of content, but the theme would wear off too quickly, so get this during a sale. I think I spent like 4 hours on it at most.","May 22","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles get really tough, but there's never any penalty for failure. You are free to experiment and move any of your lines around on the fly, watching how the slightest tweak to a line's angle or position will alter the trajectory of the bouncing lights. The visuals, music and sound effects are gorgeous, completely absorbing and endlessly soothing. And the satisfaction of stumbling on a solution that you never thought would work just never gets old. Recommended to anyone who loves puzzle games.","May 22","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
