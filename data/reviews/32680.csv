Simple but good. Many custom missions to download that are just as well made as the offical story line ones. The multiplayer is still somewhat active at times.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dfactor/recommended/32680/","dfactor","Dfactor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dfactor/","1000 products in account","Delta Force is an oldschool budget tactical shooter franchise and Black Hawk Down is the 6th installment. Team Sabre is a big expansion pack set in Colombia and Iran. The core gameplay stays the same, but the locations and the difficulty has increased.\n\nThe Visuals.\nSame as in BHD. BHD has it's own engine and runs at DirectX8, 4:3 aspect ratio resolution. I managed to get it up to 1200p, it refused to go above. All widescreen solutions stretch / cut off the screen. Considering that it's budget titles made in 2003 the visuals are fine. Decent textures, fine poly count and nice drawing distance (like in every other DF title). Framerate is unlimited. Game is compatible with pretty much all Windows versions.\n\nConsidering this is an expansion the mechanics and AI haven't been upgraded and are pretty much the same as in the main game. The only minor complaint is that some objectives are buggy and there are some minor friendly AI bugs.\n\nThe Audio.\nJust like BHD Team Sabre offers nice background music and nice team dialogues.\n\nThe Gameplay.\nWith the expansion you get 5 missions set in Colombia and 6 missions set in Iran. Some new weapons have been added. Unlike in the main game these missions are way longer and more difficult (you get less saves too). The shortest mission is around 10 minutes and the longest one is half an hour+. Missions include village, airfield, jungle, island, oil rig, oil pipeline and even stronghold raids with various insertion methods. Some of these mission offer far more complex maps with lots of buildings and enemies which easily makes this far more interesting than the main campaign itself.\n\nIf you liked Black Hawk Down then you'll most likely will like this expansion even more.","December 11, 2014","true","23.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

With each game there are a bunch of missions to complete and things to blow up. The graphics in these games are old school. The shooting in the games can get frustrating at times because you might get headshot from a AI that you can't see. Just take each level slow and steady and for the most part you can kill enemies really far away since there is no bullet drop. The missions can also get frustrating since if you fail something in the mission you might be put right back at the beginning of the level and might rage quit because it was hard to get to a certain point. Just remember quick save and save alot while playing to avoid frustration. The online portion of these games are still alive, but you might have to go looking in some of these Delta Force games. Ive really enjoyed playing these classics from beginning to end and I know you will too if you are a army buff and enjoy a good old fashion First Person Shooter.","April 2, 2011","true","5.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Black Hawk Down and Team Sabre is actually the same, only difference is Team Sabre has more contents when purchasing Black Hawk Down.

Shortly after the assault began, Somali militia and armed civilian fighters shot down two UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters. The subsequent operation to secure and recover the crews of both helicopters drew the raid, intended to last no more than an hour, into an overnight standoff in the city. The battle resulted in 18 deaths, 73 wounded, and one helicopter pilot captured among the U.S. raid party and rescue forces. One Pakistani soldier and one Malaysian soldier were killed as part of the rescue forces but other resources claim there was greater loss of life. American sources estimate between 1,500 and 3,000 Somali casualties, including civilians; SNA forces claim only 315 killed, with 812 wounded. The battle is also referred to as the First Battle of Mogadishu to distinguish it from the Second Battle of Mogadishu of 2006.\n\nDate	3–4 October 1993\n(1 day)\nLocation	Mogadishu, Somalia\nResult\nPyrrhic tactical U.S./U.N. victory[1] Strategic SNA victory\nU.S. withdraws 25 March 1994\nU.N. withdraws 28 March 1995\nBelligerents\nUNOSOM II\nUnited States\nPakistan\nMalaysia\nSouth Korea\nItaly\nSomali National Alliance (SNA)\nAlleged:\nal-Qaeda\n\nStrength\n160 military\n12 vehicles (9 Humvee's, 3 M939 trucks)\n19 aircraft (16 helicopters – 8 Black Hawks and 8 Little Birds)	4,000–6,000 militiamen and civilian fighters\nCasualties and losses\nU.S.\n18 killed\n73 wounded\n1 captured\nMalaysia\n1 killed\n7 wounded\nPakistan\n1 killed\n2 wounded	SNA Militia and civilians\nSNA claims a range of 315 to 500 Somali casualties, 812 wounded.
