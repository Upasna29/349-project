Well done! Seriously, this new character is refreshingly different from the other classes to make it an interesting play. It will be good to see what it can do when everyone else stops playing necron! Releasing it for free is a nice touch for fans but I fear within a few weeks it will disappear into history and be forgotten by all but the die hard fans.\n\nYou've (now refencing the creators) made this new character from scratch prooving that it's not that hard. So why not continue to make content for this brilliant game mode? It wouldn't require much effort to copy in some of the campaign weapons, or say add a new character for each race would it? Hell you could even just copy across the multiplayer classes, techmarine, plaguemarine, ravenor, lictor, ork warboss... or make new ones like kroot shaper or eldar aspect warrior (with different sets of armour).\n\nI feel it must be pointed out that whoever currently owns and operates this game is sitting on a CASH COW/GOLD MINE as this might make them pay attention to the community who desperately want more stuff! It is truely baffling that companies don't pay attention to the gaming community when there is clearly demand for stuff.\n\nYou've done really well with this necron overlord content, now please continue to make additional content annd the community will love you!\n\nPLEASE THUMB UP THIS "REVIEW" TO ENCOURAGE THE PRODUCTION OF MORE CONTENT!","March 12","true","012.1"," 163 of 171 people (95%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","95","163","171","10","4"

You make a stand alone expansion that is six times the original game and streamline it for an excellent online experience. Good guy Relic.\n\nReal Time Tactical Roleplaying Game. That is how I would describe Dawn of War Retribution. It is focussed on character building, and using special abilities to clear obstacles and objectives. Clearning these obstacles rewards you with gear and other sweet loot to use and to adapt to circumstances. However, unlike the original Dawn of War 2, this one does it with more than just the Space Marines. This time round the campaign is open to the zealous Space Marines, the dogmatic Imperial Guard,  the enigmatic Eldar, the barbaric Orks, the horrific Tyrranids and the eldritch Chaos Marines. Each faction proceeds through the same story and events, but does so for a different purpose. The Space Marines need to clear their name, as their chapter master allegedly has fallen to Chaos, while the Eldar pursue the same cause to prevent their planets from being destroyed by the Inquisition. The Orks just want to fight and the Tyrranids hunger. The voice acting in the game is top notch and delivers the ruminations of each character with gusto and panachel; Slightly over the top, yet in tune with the material. The overal experience is entertaining and diverse, allowing for many hours of gameplay on your own, or with a friend.\n\nThe game also features and extensive multiplayer component to go head to head. It plays like your ordinary RTS, but allows for so much customisation in regards to outfits and paintjobs. You might be forgiven for thinking that Valve made this game. The overal experience is a fast paced stratagem, with more focus on skirmishes between parties than massive clashes between armies.\n\nThe last mode, and perhaps the most entertaining is Last Stand. In this mode, you and two others try to fend off twenty waves of enemy hordes with customised hero units. The mode is amazing for its many options and rewarding gameplay. No matter how far you come, the game will always reward you with points or items for your effort. Get a friend to two and tackle this beast. You will be entertained.\n\nI could go on to muse this game for another while, but if you're not really into the compact rts style, or Warhammer for that matter, then this game might not be your cup of tea. It can also get a bit boring after five campaigns. Especially the more human oriented races do feel a bit stale after a while.\n\nWhat? Of course not! Humans? Stale? Art thou mad? Humanity shall prevail. The Emperor wills it. The day that Chaos rules the minds of men shall never come. Stand fast fellow warrior and join us in the eternal battle against the foul beings that the vile warp hath unleashed. Forget you money; human lives are the Emperor's currency. So spend it well, and pay your debt to his Greatness!","September 23, 2014","true","75.3"," 70 of 75 people (93%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","93","70","75","6","0"

You can now choose between Space Marines, Eldar, Orks, Chaos and the Imperial Guard. The campaigns are the same for everyone, however each race has their own agenda. But the goal of every race is to eliminate Azariah Kyras. That means even though the campaign feels redundant, it is refreshing to be able to change tactics and play the campaign as other races.\n\nRetribution also brings some diversity to the campaigns, such that unlike the previous Dawn Of War 2 installments, you can now further diversify your forces by replacing your regular deployable hero units with other honor guard units, depending upon your play style or according to what sort of opposition you expect to face in the campaign. You can also now field a larger number of squads by capturing Relay Beacons (or equivalent for races other than the Space Marines) and call in additional squads or vehicles subject to the amount of Requisition you have captured during your battle. This makes your campaign similar to a skirmish game albeit with campaign like objectives.\n\nYou can also gain traits for your hero units faster since you get a guaranteed trait every time you level up, unlike previous Dawn Of War 2 installments, where you have to level up 2-3 times before you get a trait.\n\nThough I feel its somewhat inferior to DOW2 and Chaos Rising story-wise, it is nonetheless interesting to see how the story ends for the Blood Ravens in the Space Marine campaign (which I believe is canon for this series).","May 18, 2015","true","63.3"," 66 of 72 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","66","72","5","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/56400/","miyumiayase","Miyumi Ayase","http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/","288 products in account","INTRODUCTION:\nDawn of War II: Retribution is the third and final expansion to the Dawn of War II titles. (Also see my Reviews for Dawn of War II and Dawn of War II: Chaos Rising).\n\nThe story takes place after the events of Chaos Rising where Gabriel Angelos and his followers were labeled as renegades by their own Chapter Master Azariah Kyras. With the Tyranid invasions, Ork assaults, Chaos Incursions and Eldar Raids, the Imperium has had enough and has now sent the Inquisition to wipe Sub-sector Aurelia from the Galaxy. The player assumes the role of Captain Apollo Diomedes of the Blood Ravens Honor Guard in his quest to uncover the truth about his Brothers and the Chapter Master he serves.\n\nPROS:\n+ More Factions in the Singleplayer Campaign: -  It is refreshing to see that Relic decided to bring back their old formula where other factions are now playable. This includes, Orks, Eldar, Chaos, Imperial Guard and Tyranids. No Tau though.\n\n+ Active Multiplayer Scene: - I normally don't care about Multiplayer in games but I found it very impressive that there still exists a very active online multiplayer community. Last Stand is always fun to play.\n\n+ Imperial Guard: - This faction is the latest addition to the multiplayer / skirmish mode and is very fun to play. Well balanced in my opinion and has added new and interesting characters with likable personalities like Sergeant Merrick.\n\n+ Hero Replacement: - You can now field special Honor Guard units rather than the Hero units you are given. Example: Leave Scout Sergeant Cyrus and deploy a Terminator Honor Guard Squad instead.\n\nCONS:\n- Dumbed Down Action RPG Element: - What made the Dawn of War II Campaign unique was its RPG elements. It was seriously disappointing to see it virtually stripped to its bare minimum with only 10 levels as the cap and severely limited wargear selections.\n\n- Poor pathfinding: - Some of the larger vehicles will literally block your army from passing through and will do some really strange movements when it tries to make room for them to pass through. This will result in a very disorganized troop movement specially in some of the smaller maps, or maps with very narrow bottlenecks.\n\n- Short Campaigns: - As a whole, the entire campaign is long if you play through all the factions, but individually, they are shorter than the previous titles with some very weak or hastily put together plot.\n\n- Some unresolved bugs: - At the time of this review the game should be 3 years old but still I encounter bugged missions or bugged units and sometimes out right crashes. Not game breaking but this should have been fixed a long time ago.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nGOOD EXPANSION BUT I WOULD RECOMMEND PLAYING THROUGH THE ORIGINAL GAME AND CHAOS RISING FIRST. Retribution adds new factions and units to the game both in Single and Multiplayer, it gives back life to the series with a lot of interesting new characters and story. It does suffer from a rather weak campaign when compared to the original, but makes up for it in a fun multiplayer experience.\n\nNew players might enjoy this more for the multiplayer / skirmish rather than the story so I recommend new players to try the original Dawn of War II and Chaos Rising first or even the first Dawn of War game if they want to be invested in the Story.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

It functions just like company of heroes, probably because theyre both made by relic\n\nOverall this is a wonderfull game to get if you like warhammer 40k.

Stand against an ork waaaahg, or a tyranid invasion, or fight against the ruinous powers as the guard or the angels of death. The games are just long enough, and the learning curve isnt too severe if you know how to play an RTS\n\nThe Elite mod for this game has kept the community alive, as it rebalences the game, adds new units and another faction (The Grey Knights) and is updated frequently. The community for it holds monthly tournaments, has a number of game casters, and is overall a great community\n\nPros\n+ 6 differnt factions that are very distinct from one another in how they play\n+ Lots of maps and worlds to choose from\n+ Graphics are pretty good\n+ Lots of different units for every army, as well as commanders\n+ good resource managment\n+ Multiplayer is amazing\n+ campaigns are pretty fun\n+ Elite mod has completely taken over as the official support and keeps the game alive\n+ AI is decently challanging\n+ Lots of solid DLC that isnt stupidly expensive and can easily be forgone if you dont want them\n\nCons\n- Only 2 multiplayer modes\n- Only can have 2 teams in multiplayer, so no massive 6 army free for alls, which was a wasted oportunity in my opinion\n- No more official support as THQ doesnt exist anymore\n- Controls are a bit wonky\n- Unit pathing can be weird at times\n\nOn the whole, this game is well worth the mere $30 it asks for, and theirs plenty of DLC for it that is great, such as more wargear for you campaign commanders, more skins for multiplayer armies, and additional gear for the last stand\n\ni give this game 10/10 Ork stormboyz rocketing into the imperial guard lines.

While this may seem initially like a dumbing-down from DoWI, the playstyle it encourages is more fast-paced, usually more aggressive, and leads itself to large armies splitting off across the map. This has ended up being a very fun way to play an RTS.\n\nThe campaign has benefited from this style in that in place of a Commander unit, you can have up to four Heroes that are powerful (typically single-person) units with Wargear upgrades and stat boosts while in a mission. These heroes can be substitued for an Honor Guard unit, which is a stronger version of a standard army unit. While building an army is fun, I also had a blast clearing the missions with only my Heroes and their witty banter.\n\nMultiplayer has become faster, which is usually a plus, as it allows us to play more games, or to boot up a match when normally we couldn't. I enjoy that gameplay feels more aggressive, with players capturing Requisition Points and Power Nodes in order to increase the speed that accumulate resources to purchase army units, and with holding the Victory Points, in which you must hold more than your opponent for a period of time in order to win. This leads to a very active playstyle, where you're balancing defensive capabilities with offensive, and mobility with firepower. Nearly every unit has potential upgrades, either as stat increases or new weapons, allowing them to be good against, and bad against, different types of enemies. Something as small as purchasing a few Flamers will make your unit that much stronger with melee engages, and constantly staying one step ahead of your enemy in upgrades, or creating units to counter their build, will often be the deciding factor of whether you fall from grace, or rise in glory as a successful tactician. The Hero system also carries into Multiplayer, as you select from one of six races, then one of three Hero units per race. These Heroes have different skills and Racial Abilities, and encourage different playstyles. Similar to the Campaign, these Hero units can purchase Wargear ingame once they have met the requirements (per game, no carrying over), to grant higher stats and capabilities against different enemies.\n\nThe Last Stand, also sold as an individual DLC package, is a great mode where three players try to survive, and conquer, 20 waves of enemies. Each player selects a Hero and their Wargear before entering queue, with seven different Heroes, and a LOT of Wargear options. Mirrors are possible, but do not generally affect gameplay, and will likely have different builds. Wargear is obtained through leveling up, where you gain experience points at the end of the game, or through special, sometimes difficult, achievements. Most Heroes have two achievement Wargear unlocks. The Last Stand is incredibly brutal, very unforgiving, and you may never beat it. Players have the ability to revive fallen teammates, though this immobilizes the reviver, and reduces their firepower greatly, easily causing their death as well. Also on the map are two Point Multiplying Nodes, similar in appearance to Power Nodes, that add a x3 multiplier to your team's score each. Certain types of enemies will try to capture these points for themselves. Each Hero is vastly different, and every team composition is as well, leading to immense replayability, especially if you haven't beaten either of the two maps yet... (It's always that blasted Wave 20! ;-;)\n\nLore-wise this game is both engaging and genuinely gets the grimdark feel of the WH40k universe. As the story progressed, through the earlier two campaigns (DoWII and DoWII:Chaos Rising) and this one, I felt the tragedies come one after the other, and each victory feeling less and less impactful until you get that one killing blow that just brings everything you've done all together, and you can feel the weight just disappear off of your chest, and you sit back in the chair and let out this sigh of relief... until you are informed of another emergency happening almost immediately. It kept me on the edge of my seat with its grimdarkness, its surprisingly fitting comedy (especially playing as those 'ard Ork boyz), and my genuine interest in how it was going to play out. While a lot of people feel that the campaign is short, and it kinda is, it certainly isn't lacking in content or gameplay, and it was very fun.\n\nPros        Cons                Engaging campaign, interesting and fitting characters, fun take on an RTS.        Short campaign that may be a little lackluster if you haven't played the other campaigns in earlier games.                Fun multiplayer design that encourages constant action.        May take a while to get into the mode as there is a lot to learn, and a lot to manage.                The Last Stand is a great mode with high replayability and a fun premise.        May be repetetive, harder for lower-levels which may discourage Hero diversity, and one Hero is locked behind paid DLC.\nTL;DR: 9/10 A very fun game that successfully captured the essence of the WH40k universe, and gave me three fun modes to play. There is a modding community as well, keeping it alive, and encouraging its growth. I highly recommend it to any WH40k or RTS fan.","January 13","true","128.5"," 32 of 37 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","32","37","0","8"

Eight heroes(two of whtich are DLC) to choose from, 20 waves of enemies to fight off, and each of the two maps has special gimmicks to make the experience different.\nCan create custom color schemes for each race to use in Multiplayer and Last Stand\nPretty cheap when it goes on sale\nMods make it fun for those who play the Multiplayer mode by adding new units and increased pop cap (+300!)\nFinal boss is fun to fight\nLots of potential for a Dawn of War III\nYou cam wage a massive WAAAGH!\nTYRANIDS!!!!\n\nThe Cons  Campaign is repetative. Each race goes through the exact same missions with different dialogue, different commanders, different units, and different prologue and epilogue cutscenes.\nSome glitches have yet to be patched. Don't worry, there isn't that many\nMultiplayer is not as newb friendly as Last Stand.

Finally you can play as any race in the single player campaign. There is no carryover component from the previous games, and the game itself is standalone. The abilities and wargear are fairly fun to customize, and the game is not hard even on the highest setting. A second map was added to the multiplare arcade mode, which was harder waves than the first. There is a purchaseable arcade-mode DLC that adds a Tau crisis/broadside unit as a playable hero, which is very interesting.\n\nI guess overall this has to be my favourite series of all time, although I don't play this game at all anymore. Across the three games in this series I have logged almost 1000 hours of play, most of which was single player.\n\nMaybe it's a bad idea to review all three games under one title, but they are best viewed as parts of a whole. The vanilla game was really challenging when played on Primarch; there was an intricate re-deployment system that encouraged you to play every mission to the best of your ability, as well as a ton of wargear that wasn't guarenteed to drop at fixed points. Chaos rising was my favourite, offering maximal flexibility in squadmates, gear, playstyle and choices. Once the Chaos Rising patch is applied to the vanilla game, playing the vanilla part on hardest becomes really hard. The Corruption system in Chaos rising was great, decently complex, and have a bearing on the ending. Retribution was the easiest game out of the three, but you can play as any race you want and the ending is open-ended. Once again, Retribution does not require the first two games to play, and it has no carryover mechanic, although the storyline is officially continuous. If you don't like to play as space marines but like the single player aspect, just play Retribution.","September 28, 2014","true","252.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

The campaign is good, and well down, giving a good balance of missions to play through with different difficulties.

The campaign of Retribution is a set of cloned missions identical for each race; unit customization and commander/specialty unit progression is too simple and lumpy compared to DoW2 vanilla. This cloned campaign does not even have the charm of the set of same missions from DoW1: Dark Crusade or DoW1: Soulstorm, because there is no aspect of base-building or sufficiently different strategic playstyles. While the overall storyline is not bad, the cloned nature of the campaign makes it utterly predictable after the first time you've played it, and the only virtue to playing through it again is to earn more achievements or to cheer on your second-favorite race.\nGameplay in DoW2: Retribution is average; most units either suffer from a rock-paper-scissors balance mechanism, or are powerfully broken. Early game for a lot of races is slow and frustrating, as you must focus more on obtaining and securing resources than getting stuck in with your archnemesis. Whoever controls the power nodes wins. Between the focus on resource-gathering and the small size of the armies, this game could be reskinned to any other given RTS and you'd never know the difference; there is very little that sets this game apart as distinctly Warhammer 40K.\n\nOverall I can't give this game more than a 6/10. Relic and Games Workshop have quite a bit to make up for if they go through with DoW3.","February 28, 2014","false","312.2"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","12","18","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Swiftsabre/recommended/56400/","Swiftsabre","Commander Swiftsabre I","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Swiftsabre/","51 products in account","DAWN OF WAR II RETRIBUTIONDawn of War II Retribution is the second expansion and third edition of the Relic Entertainment RTS Dawn of War II (2009), following its predecessor Chaos Rising (2010). It takes the setting of the 41st millenium and lets the player experience it from a tactical combat perspective, controlling resources to build a better, more refined army than your opponent in order to claim victory.\n\nThe game consists of three main elements as well as side features. These are as follows:\n\nMULTIPLAYERThe meat of the game for most players is the dynamic multiplayer which allows for intense tactical combat in 1v1 to 3v3, free for all and team free for all. The mainstay is the victory point control mode, a system whereby the winner is the first to drain their opponent out of victory points, whereas annihilation mode, where victory is the destruction of the enemy base, is slightly simpler. The multiplayer has many strenghts that have seen it through a prosperous lifespan:\n\n- Very in-depth tactical combat\n- Asymmetrical faction balance\n- Dynamic map design\n- Well balanced commander mechanics\n- Unique flow and pacing\n- Tactical combat that does not require lots of APM but perfect execution and follow-up\n\nHowever it harbours some flaws:\n\n- The unmodded game has certain poor balance choices\n- The ranked multiplayer is mostly dead due to stagnation and broken leaderboards\n- A few maps are almost unplayable in their lack of quality\n- The game has not received a balance patch since late 2011\n- The multiplayer is incredibly challenging and thus very hard to get into\n\nThe game itself is very different to the one it followed up, Dawn of War, and this has turned many old DoW I players off it. I believe however the change is a necessary improvement to keep the franchise fresh, having been adapted from the Company of Heroes formula that proved to make a well established, well regarded RTS set in World War II.\n\nIt is well known that the game has mroe depth with mod, so you shoudl look at these in particular:\n- Elite Balance Mod: http://www.dawnofwar.info\n- Codex Edition Mod: https://steamcommunity.com/groups/DoW2-CE\n\nCAMPAIGNAlthough perhaps not as well designed as the vanilla game's campaignh, it allows for playthroughs with all factions and thus has replayability. Take the squad based combat to explore the story further in somethign that is worth looking at to grasp some mechanics.\n\nTHE LAST STANDSimilar to a MOBA, this PvE aspect takes individual heroes in an arena and pits them against waves of enemy hordes. Especially fun with friends when you can combo each hero's abilities and work together, however sadly it only contains two different maps, though both play out differently.\n\nFEATURESArmy Painter: Allows you to customise your warriors before going into battle to choose pre-loaded schemes or make your own, including allowing players upload their own custom badges.\n\nGame History: Tracks all multiplayer stats so you can see just who and what you are losing to.\n\nWorld Builder: A piece of software I have found myself in for many an hour which gives you all the tools the developers had when making maps, incredibly enthralling and I recommend Duncan's guide for working out how to use it: http://www.dowreplays.net/DOW-II-Map-Making-Guide.pdf\n\nCONCLUSIONIt is an intensely tactical and strategic game with large depth and scope better with mods, but suffers from a thinning community and lack of developer support.\n\nIf you like a challenge and an experience with something that is so unique, this is definitely worth ti if you can get in with the community.","August 11, 2013","true","052.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The focus becomes less on your heroes and squads, and more on the overall plot, and its race/faction flavor.\nMore linear than DoWII but still quite a bit of fun. Heroes gain more traits but the game becomes exceptionally stingy on wargear for them.\nMission rewards offer you either 1 piece of wargear(in addition to the handful of items you find on a map) or unlocks/upgrades for your army units. Still not as good as Soulstorm or Dark Crusade but again a worthy title.\nDefinitely worth it on sale, and I'll have to rate this one at 4 outta 5.

Soldiers can't be upgraded with every single thing.\nThere is no more armory/blacksmith upgrades. Upgrades are done specifically for squads. Level up system also serves as a bit of a HP and Energy upgrade, too.\nSpeaking of Energy, Energy system prevents massive spellspam then retreat.\nVoice Acting is wonderfully done, where some lines in Dawn of War I wasn't that well done, along with a bit of humor from characters' voice lines.\nShiny paint for the armies now exists.\n\nThe only bad improvements I've seen is;\nVehicles easily overpower most sorts of infantry, even if they do have anti-vehicle specialties. Vehicles are easily the meta unlike in Dawn of War II, where you use both vehicles and soldiers to their best course of action.\nPopulation stays locked at 100, whereas the cap in Dawn of War is increased by base levels or sometimes, other means (such as building another certain building, for IG, building an Infantry Command post raises Infantry cap). This annoyed me, as I couldn't spread my group all over the map, and it made some battles very little instead of one huge battle.\nThere is no longer base building, which removes the feel of having your own base to use as well as making things less 'homey'\nNo more Listening Posts, this especially frustrated me.\nRetreat functions can be especially annoying, where even if ranged hits do land a shot, they do very minor damage, where melee does significantly larger damage (Vehicles at least can't retreat, however)\nVehicle vs. Hero, guess who wins?\n\nOverall, however, this is still a very fun game, and I recommend trying it for it's humorous colors, well done voice acting, gameplay that still stays a bit true to the roots of the system.\n\nP.S. SEGA, please make Dawn of War III or more expansions that would include some more races, such as the Dark Eldar, and the Tau.","September 25, 2014","true","87.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

There's ranked play and Custom Games. I mostly play the Campaign and The Last Stand but this is somewhat entertaining.\n\nThere's also a game-mode called The Last Stand in which you choose a hero, equip him/her with Wargear and then fight against up to 20 waves of enemies. There are 2 maps which varies in difficulty.\n\nThe game got good graphics and the gameplay is great but it's somewhat lacking in base building due to the fact that you only got your main building and the extra buildings you got available includes Turrets and sometime bunkers.\nIt's not fully optimized but it runs close to perfect for me, my Graphic cards gets a bit warm in the menu which is weird but other than that it works good.\n\nI highly recommend it to players who enjoyed the earlier Dawn of War 2 games but for those who liked Dawn of War 1, don't expect the same building management.\n\nI still hope that Dawn of War 3 is being developed but the future looks dark.","April 11, 2011","true","236.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

While up front this game seems like a well built game, it has some wierd balancing issues. Due to this, the selection for armies is pretty narrowed-down.\n\nThe first example shows itself in the 'army painter', a utility for players to further customize their forces. It seems unassuming at first, but upon closer inspection, the issues begin to show themselves. When selecting colors, there are a few colors that end up giving boons in gameplay. To summarize, the only colors that make tactical sense is red, because it is more or less direct upgrade from all the other colors.\n\nMoving on to the army selection. This is where the balancing issues really start intervening with gameplay. The game includes many of the signature armies from Games-Workshop's tabletop game, most notably the Imperial Guard. Normally, each army has their own polarizations, such as one may be better at meelee combat, or one may be better at shooting. The problem here is, one of the armies, the Imperial Guard, is not polarized at all, and excells in all areas. This makes it the only real choice for players if they want to have a good experience. Some players actually try to cheat at the game in order to make armies like the Space Marines (the absolute worst faction) viable.\n\nDealing with both of these issues, I found myself very limited in my choices when actually playing. The only combo I ended up using were red Imperial Guardsmen (Guardsmen are the all around best unit in the Imperial Guard). Buy at your discretion.","June 27, 2014","true","369.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","2"

This is not a strict strategy game, its a MOBA+strategy, a hybrid. Its good only for 2v2 and 3v3 and that's what most players of this game play. Its well suited for Faction war meaning all 3 heroes of the same faction together in the same team fighting all the 3 heroes of another faction. Playing the game like that its fun so i recommend real life friends to get it as this is how i started this game. Dont get the game if you are to play it solo you wont have fun. It would be great if its campaign had 4 player cooperate instead of 2 so that's a big deal negative, if there is a patch  that makes coop campaign for 4 players that would be great. In general i only recommend to get this game if you have a real life premade team lets say or you plan to play it with online friends, its good for that.  DoW 2 Retribution is a poorly made mini CoH 1 and has nothing to do with Warhammer 40K. DoW 1 mods are WAY BETTER and are 40K SOLID. To a casual gamer i recommend this game, to someone who wants 40K no i dont. This is a review for both DoW 2 and DoW 2 Retribution. This game is over-simplified that's a major con of it.\nBUT\nThere is a mod called The Elite mod which added more units to the game and rebalanced it to a much better degree than retail and added in its strategy value, so if it is to play  DoW 2 get Elite mod, it has way more SOLID gameplay.\nPersonally i dont like DoW 2 for it could have been WAY BETTER but this is my personal opinion, many other pro gamers like it and find it real fun to play.\nAlso there is another important feature of this game, the quotes, for every type of attack and direction of the attack a unit receives it quotes that attack so you know what it coming and from where and you can react fast and accurately, this is a great feature this game has. The game has very good graphic as well and it is beautiful. I dislike it cause of the gameplay meaning it COULD have been way better than it is, which is good still.","May 25, 2015","true","569.2"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

Let me start out with saying that in this game, contrary to Dawn of War +expansions (All respect to those as they're plain awesome), you actually get the feel of the Hero type you choose, and you get that feeling of being totally BEE AYE. You get to integrate a Hero, such as (And one of my personal favorites!) the Inquisitor, into a full on battle, and at last those herotypes get the venerable strength and versatility they deserve according to the lore.\n\nThe gameplay itself, albeit lacking the whole base expansion thing as far as I've seen, as many other games got, this game makes up with it with on-the-go deployment whilst getting to fully fledge the units of yours into defensive postures much like the Company of Heroes style of games and you get to really unfold your tactical knowledge and strategic flair to their full extent, and put these to the test. So if you're a selfproclaimed master tactician, this is a game where you get to test it, without having humongous unconfined levels where the enemy can literally hide behind a bush and stay alive in that way. Not to mention, you get the opportunity of fielding your factions most devastative vehicles and infantry short of a full on exterminatus.\n\nThe graphics are good though at first a tad confusing overlay wise, but aside from smaller nitpickings, I love the setting the game sets for each individual map and the level of details compromising the rather blocky HUD.\n\nIn short: If you're in for a thrill and want to see some De&De up close, and get to feel like you're actually a commander in WH40K, this is the game for you.  Now have me excused while I go back to wreak more havoc on those xenos!","December 22, 2015","true","1.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

(The last stand is that you group up with 2 more players and try to survive waves of enemies up to 20 waves)\nThe game also has many dlc's many of them are skins for the multiplayer or some wargear for the single player, except one DLC which is the Tau commander, that one DLC might be expensive, but if you really like the last stand which I mentioned above you might want to consider buying it. The DLC will give you a new commander to play with in the last stand and he is damn powerful, but as powerful as he is, it doesn't mean he is more powerful than the other commanders, he has his pros and cons.\n\nOverall the game is amazing, the story is nice, really fun single player campaign and the multiplayer is active.","November 15, 2015","true","380.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

The story does continue like it should with some epic graphic cutscenes that surely don't disappoint. The main reason I rate this so high and recommend is due to the multiplayer/Last Stand\n\nMultiplayer- The multiplayer is very fun, having a few different modes that you may play with several tiers of units that you must micro manage to get that advantage over your opponents, strategy is critical to your victory. Sacrificing 50 points just to create your most powerful unit to then turn the tide of battle is one of those decisions you may have to make.\n\nLast Stand- Last stand is my favorite part of this game and is where most of my hours have gone. A strategic survival battle where you and 2 others last against many waves of enemies while using your unique skills which propose your role to the battle. Some are more AoE and taking out infantry where you may die fast, whereas some are bulky armored and focus more on the bigger tougher enemies on the battlefield.","December 29, 2013","true","183.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Personally, I love base building, and to find out that it was removed was a real kick in the teeth. I've played multiplayer with a group of friends on both games, and they all agree that this seems watered down due to the absense of base building, but agree that the game feels much nicer. One other thing that bothered us was how easy the game\nseemed, even on harder difficulties. Yet, the original Dawn Of War is insane and very difficult.\n\nHowever, Last Stand is amazing. I play with the same group, and we really enjoy the game. Currently, our go to game to waste time. Really enjoyable and for that, I'll rate this positive. Don't get me wrong, multiplayer is still okay but, not as good as the original.\n\nI've played the campaign with a friend, and it's very good. We both enjoy the leveling system. I'm quite disappointed the fact you can't have 4 people, considering you control 4 heros and squads which can be real hard to micro manage each of their movements, especially since you have different roles like tanks and healers.

While traditional RTS fans will dislike the lack of base building, i felt that the combat system was pretty well done, with shrubs and small pieces of rubble providing cover for infantry, vehicles taking extra damage from behind, and infantry suppression from weapon platforms such as the heavy bolter. In addition to the gameplay, the campaign is really about as good as it can get despite all the campaigns using the same map.\n\nFinal verdict: While I believe that you should play this game if you have the slightest interest in Warhammer 40,000, wait for a bloody sale. Do you really want Games Workshop to earn 20 buxx for every copy of this game sold?","November 25, 2013","true","224.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","3"

As soon as you start the game you are aggressively pushing forward and capturing resource points across the map. This style of play immediately puts you into the thick of it with the other player.  Which means fun right from the start!\nThe campaign is very different from the skirmish part. It’s more like a dungeon crawl RPG with hero units you and a friend can control that go all over the map using special abilities from equipment you pick up or skills that you learn when you level up. It’s actually really fun.\nBut this game shines on the multiplayer. The races are all very different and each race has 3 unique heroes than you take into battle.\nI can easily recommend this game to any RTS fan.

Last Stand is where you choose a hero (ork, space marine, chaos, imperial guard or  tyranid) and you try to last as long as you can against hordes of enimies that get increasingly difficult. The multiplayer is where you fight against other people online. All fine and dandy... but then there's the campaign. In the campaign you choose from any of the five races (the same ones from the Last Stand) and work your way through a story (obviously) and you give your heroes better armour, weapons etc. The only problem is all of the campaigns are pretty much the same except for dialogue, troops and the race that you are. Though the campaign is kind of fun when you play with a friend.\n\nSo it's a pretty good game over all and I enjoy it.

You produce everything from one main center.\n\nThe Pros:\nTyranids are playable, awesome.\nGraphics are excellent\nUnit animations are satisfactory\nStill can have good battles\nIts warhammer\nDLC makes a good impact on the game.\nThe Cons:\nMass battles are gone, like the old dawn of war\nDestroying the enemy base takes forever(think c&c: Renegade, remember shooting at the same building for hours?)\nOverall great game.","January 2","true","3.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It offers 6 factions, each faction has 3 commanders and each commander can have 1 or 2 different playstyles, including wargear that you can buy for them to make them more adaptable to different situations, so the game has a lot of variety in playstyle.\nBut the game still has some flaws, flaws that would have probably been fixed by THQ if they didnt shut down. For example the game can be pretty imbalanced in some matchups, for example chaos vs imperial guard, where the IG need to rush to tier 3 as fast as possible because every single tier 1 and tier 2 unit that the chaos forces ahve outclass the IG variant, the game is still fun though if you get a fair matchup, and i heard that the elite mod adressess a lot of balance issues and its pretty popular amongst the community, so if you dont like the base or get bored of it and want something else then you still have a good choice.\nOverall the game is still pretty good in its current state, its not a bad game, it can be a lot of fun at times, but it could be so much more, i wish relic would still bring new stuff to this game like they do with company of heroes, but if you are looking for a good strategy game in one of the most interesting settings in video game history, then this game might be what you need.\n","September 17, 2015","true","32.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

There are 6 factions to play. They include: Space Marines, Orks, Eldar, Tyranids, Imperial Guard, and Chaos Space Marines. The campaign takes place in a galaxy with numerous planets, representing your possible missions and various rewards. Your army consists of a couple heroes that carry over gamer after game and which you can level up and acquire new and better gear for. Playing through the campaign once is not bad. However, it is pretty much the same for each factions, meaning it will get repetetive after one or two walkthroughs.\n\nDon't want the campaign? How about skirmish against the AI to test your skills. It heavily revolves around controlling objectives to gain points and power to build your armies. The biggest downfall of the game was base building though. You start the game with one building. It's your command center that is responsible for spawning all your troops and researching all the tech. The goal of the match is to destroy the enemy HQ. It has a lot of HP and it takes more advanced troops to finally put it down. I have to say that I enjoy base building like Dawn of War Soulstorm had so this game was dissapointing.\n\nMultiplayer is largely as described above, just against players.\n\nWhat I really found fun in this game was Arena mode, also called The Last Stand. You can actually purchase it as a sepparate game and avoid paying the Full Price all together.\n\nThe Last Stand mode lets you pick your general. They all start with level 1 and level up until 20, with each level granting them unique weapons, armors, and abilities. Your general is then taken to an arena (currently 2 variants) with 2 other players and left to survive 20 waves. Each wave throws various galactic abominations at you from all different factions and your only purpose is th "survive".\n\nSo, can you?\n\n\nAll in all. It's not a bad game. Graphics are alright and the campaign is good for 1-2 run throughs, the last stand mode is a lot of fun, and multiplayer is action packed. I would definitelly play this game at least once for the experience, but if you are the kind of person who expects major battles with big bases, this isn't the game for you. The population cap limits your army to a specific size and the lack of base building limits the ingenuity that some players might have brought to the battlefield.\n\nGood luck!","March 30, 2014","true","228.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It takes away the notion for the need for resource micromanaging. Everything set in for gameplay revolves around your units using tactics and other crucial perks your Race/Hero is made for. It may come off as intimidating at first wtih a steep learning curve, but it gets pretty fun once you pick it up learning how to formally use the perks on the given units. It also includes a neat campaign and a Last Stand arena.

I like the theme/setting of the game. This is particularly ironic because, as a player of tabletop wargames, I do not like the Warhammer 40k tabletop setting at all. But in this video game, the factions and their units look and play great.\n\nI've touched the campaign and looked at last stand, but I really spent my time in this game doing multiplayer (1v1, 2v2, 3v3, TFFA, and, always to my everlasting displeasure, annihilation).\n\nI like how this game is not about base-building and sending unit after unit off to die on the battlefield. It's about keeping units, and improving units. Because of the time you spend with your guys, this game is about loving your units. It's great to see that Guardian squad that I started the match with 18 minutes later, rolling with the support of a Warlock, embolded,  and dropping effective grenades in the late game. Or that Banshee squad who even after seeing some extremely close, close calls thoughout the match and coming within just a few hit points of an untimely death, regrouped and putting the hurts on a dreadnought in the late game. But not everyone can survive, and when you lose a unit the pain is real! You find yourself giving micro-eulogies to your fallen squads, thanking them for thier contribution to the effort and reminding them that it was, hopefully, not in vain.\n\nThis is the aspect of the game that I like the most. But there are other cool things. I like that there are asymetrical maps (just like on my tabletop). I like how the hero characters (I've only play Eldar>Warlock) work in the game's mechanics. I like the suppression weapon platforms and how they work with arcs and set-up/break-down timers.\n\nI really like the timing of the game. I like how you have time to flank a turtling Techmarine who hides behind his too-many-turrets. Or how you can chose to just ignore his turret spam until you get to Tech level II and address it then. There's plenty of other places to attack. (Oh, how many times have I seen poor players, including my noob-self, continuing to attempt to push into turrets and pay the full cost for the choice when it could have addressed later?)\n\nAnyway. those are somethings I like about this game. I guess I paid $60 for this game when it came out and I've played for over 1500 hours, so that's less than 4 cents per hour.

I like this game because of visuals and Warhammer assets. It just looks awesome, sounds awesome. It also play smooth, but if there is a lagging player all other players lag as well and playing it becomes disgusting.\nThere are only 2 maps for this mode and 20 waves on each map. You'll need to play this maps over and over to get enough XP and be able to finish all 20 waves. At first I thought that it is lame, but the game is a pleasure to play and you enjoy to gain this XP and new weapons.\nYou can also get a dose of adrenaline when playing on the last waves. Co-op is not enforced(I mean that everybody plays mostly solo), but if you get to agree with other players you can have even more fun using some tactics(happens rarely).","November 26, 2013","true","173.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

When and if you do find a match you're going to run into the same issues Company of heroes 2 has in that your rarely going to get a game where not one person drops, robbing all players regardless of time played of their exp. Most do it out of spite, some just drop right at the start leaving you with a mess of a match as the ill equipped AI take over just goes around capping everything removing any fun or strategy from the game. Rarely have I enjoyed a good online match and 90% you will be met with nothing but frustration as players rage quit right at the end of the match to rob everyone of their rightful exp. The multiplayer is seriously flawed for this reason with no punishment system in place this will keep happening.\n\nFor those reasons even though I had fun for a while I can't in all honesty recommend it to someone looking for a good experience either single player or multiplayer. Even for 40k fans there's games out there that do it far better at the end of the day.","November 26, 2015","false","375.8"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","10","18","3","0"

Occasionally this is broken up by the mission prodding you along (the infamous BEHNBLADE), or having to deal with fortified strongpoints.\n\nThe gameplay itself actually seemed weaker than the previous DoW II titles - While it's still a very unit-centric squad-based RTT, there's a lot more units available to you and on the field in general, each with their own properties. Normally I wouldn't complain about having a lot to keep track of, but micro-heavy gameplay like slotting your infantry into good cover and placing/orienting heavy weapons squads works best when you're dealing with smaller forces rather than larger ones. This is especially amplified by the general trend towards smaller engagements; Fairly frequently, I'd be cramming 40 guardsmen into a space meant for a dozen Space Marines.\n\nBasic encounters tended to feel chaotic, but not urgent - Lots to keep track of, but not a whole lot on the line.\n\nBoss fights rapidly became repetitive. The nature of them, one at the end of every level, plus the limited unit selection brought about by 40k armies meant that, fairly often, I'd be fighting yet *another* Hive Tyrant, except this time in a jungle-themed arena rather than a gothic cathedral-themed one.\n\nHonestly, I think Chaos Rising is a lot stronger than Retribution, simply because it's closer to the overall design of the series. Retribution has a lot more units on the field to play around with, but Dawn of War 2 isn't a game that's designed for that and it shows.\n\n","September 11, 2015","false","5.6"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","14","26","0","0"

It is... It's fun, and fast paced... But I feel like it didn't capture the feel of the original dawn of war, due to the fact that they COMPLETELY take away the base building, which is something in RTS's I enjoy. However, I'm going to base this review in the style I did for the first Dawn of War, Speaking from a die hard Warhammer fan.\n\nLet's go over the positives of this game...\n-The action and pathing are improved, You are stuck right into it. and the fights are fun to watch.\n-The Voice acting in this game, is superb. And Very well done.\n-The campaign is very well made, However, this also contains a flaw, which I'll go over.\n-Multiplayer play is quite well, and still has multple game types, like the first Dawn of war game.\n-Each unit has to be treated like the table top counter part, such as, some are expendable, but if you keep losing too much, you will lose. Which has an immersion factor for me.\n-The soundtrack... Oh My God... The soundtrack for this game, is probably one of the best I've heard...\n-The developers added attention to detail, and added unit cries and announcer cries that differ depending on what race you are going against. for example, If you play orks, and then order an attack on an eldar, they might say something like "Eldar ar da squishiest.." Capturing the humor and immersion of the Warhammer universe.\n-To make the game more strategic, you have a small population, So choosing your units contains strategy to it.\n-The last stand mode is really fun, and it's a great idea. Holding off hordes of enemies with other players controlling your character is quite immersive.\n\nThat's the positive aspects of this game... now for the negative.\n-The campaign is only fun once. As you get through playing with your race, you'll notice it's the exact same missions, but just with different races, which hugely downs the fun factor to it. Which leaves multiplayer and skirmish the only thing that maybe can bring you back.\n-The no base building is quite disapointing... Many RTS fans, such as myself, loved base building, due to it allowing you to manage and macro, while this game just focuses on micro.\n-The races seem more similar this time around... I don't know why, but it feels like they share some of the same strategies, Which doesn't help this game much for bringing you back, and keeping you in. Of course, this is my opinion, comparing it to the original, which felt like you are playing a different race. Don't get me wrong, there are differences, just not as much as I'd like. More like a peeve I suppose, so if you feel they are different, ignore this.\n-Giving the small population, Which is also a good thing, but it has a flaw for me, I like commanding big armies, Having a swarm of tyranids, or a horde of orks is probably the best feeling for me, but this game downs the population, which I can understand.\n\nBasically, this game can be fun, but it lacks compared to the others imo... I'd say only try it if you are a die hard warhammer fan. But this is my opinion, yours may differ. If you want to get into the universe of Warhammer 40k, try the first Dawn of war instead.\n","September 21, 2014","true","35.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It possesses all the content of the previous two games, updated with the inclusion of the Imperial Guard faction alongside new units for every race. These include superheavy units for each race, and now your Space Marines, Orks and Tyranids will have something to fight those pesky Avatars of Khaine and Great Unclean Ones with the addition of Land Raiders, Ork Battlewagons, the Swarmlord himself and the Imperial Guard's newly arrived Baneblade.\n\nRetribution has its own campaign which serves as a conclusion for the storyline of not only Dawn of War II and Chaos Rising, but also for Dawn of War I and its own expansion packs. All that has happened in the games' storyline has led up to this game, and you have the opportunity to play as any of the races in the campaign. While the campaign is repetitive (all races share the same missions and overall story), it is nonetheless enjoyable to go around defeating armies of daemons with irish Ork space pirate captains.\n\nRetribution also wins because it has the best voice acting. Everyone has a british accent. EVERYONE.\n\nIN THE GRIM DARKNESS OF THE FUTURE, EVERYONE IS BRITISH.\n\nAND I LOVE IT.","October 15, 2011","true","145.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

But, I'm highly disapointed that each campaign has the same missions that you would get if playing with another "race", the only thing that changes is the dialogue so that really made me bored.

Moar like Dawn of War II, III and IV, amirite? Okay, it's not that huge, but it can make for really fun times, and really does happen to be more like three games than just one.  You've got the campaigns which play out as an action RPG. In Vanilla and Chaos Rising, you follow the exploits of a group of Blood Raven Space Marines, super soldiers out to save the day and stuffs. Retribution here lets you pick any of the factions available in the game for your campaign. The single-player/co-op is a lot like a Dungeon Siege style of RPG, where you get to handle squad leaders with ability points and items as you level up. Multiplayer is a fast paced RTS, with matches that last around 30 minutes and jump into the thick of it, without having to worry about base building at all. Lastly, The Last Stand. It's a game on its own. Play as heroes, and team up with others to survive waves of mooks. It's as fun as it is nightmarishly addicting. So yup.

It possesses all the content of the previous two games, updated with the inclusion of the Imperial Guard faction alongside new units for every race. These include superheavy units for each race, and now your Space Marines, Orks and Tyranids will have something to fight those pesky Avatars of Khaine and Great Unclean Ones with the addition of Land Raiders, Ork Battlewagons, the Swarmlord himself and the Imperial Guard's newly arrived Baneblade.\n\nRetribution has its own campaign which serves as a conclusion for the storyline of not only Dawn of War II and Chaos Rising, but also for Dawn of War I and its own expansion packs. All that has happened in the games' storyline has led up to this game, and you have the opportunity to play as any of the races in the campaign. While the campaign is repetitive (all races share the same missions and overall story), it is nonetheless enjoyable to go around defeating armies of daemons with irish Ork space pirate captains.\n\nRetribution also wins because it has the best voice acting. Everyone has a british accent. EVERYONE.\n\nIN THE GRIM DARKNESS OF THE FUTURE, EVERYONE IS BRITISH.\n\nAND I LOVE IT.","October 15, 2011","true","145.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The game engine is equally enjoyable as gore and destruction are gloriously detailed along with a almost fully destructible environment.

DoW2, much like it's predecessor, is a RTS set in the grimdark world of Warhammer 40,000. Unlike its predecessor however, your battles are on a far smaller scale. No longer do you have a huge squad of 9 marines per squad for example. Nor can you build more than one Land Raider. Instead squad sizes are far smaller(unless you're 'nids or orks in which case numbers wins the day), and focused more on flanking, tactics, special abilities and the like. In my opinion this actually makes the game more enjoyable for me. DoW1 felt too much like any stereotypical RTS wearing a 40k skin. DoW2 feels unique.\n\nThe campaign is basically an adventure, with a neat story, neat gear and the like. Done with campaign and bored of it? RTS battles await. Don't want to play it as a RTS? Last Stand. For a game that is this old now, there's plenty to see and do. If you're a 40k fan, then every now and then it's great to get your 40k kicks in.\n\nDoW2 Retribution is perhaps the last great 40k game. None of those released after it so far has been anywhere as epic a journey. Until Sega decides to make a DoW3, this game above all else, is probably THE 40k PC game I'd choose if I had to pick one to play for the rest of my life.\n\nAnd I guess it'd be remiss not to mention that I'm massively into 40k today only because of this game.","October 14, 2011","true","898.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

All of them lack the depth of the original Dawn of War 2, and its expansion: Chaos Rising.\n\nAll of the in game races are available to play. But in expense all of them are short and are copy and paste versions of each other.\n\n2. Multiplayer is amazing. Great maps, great balance and overall the best multiplayer experience of any of the Dawn of War 2 games.\n\nLast Stand is equally amazing. Unlockables, leveling, customization. Probably one of the best horde modes I've ever played\n\nIn conclusion, If you're looking to buy this game for its single player, go look somewhere else, but if you're looking for an amazing Warhammer 40,000 multiplayer experience then you've come to the right game.\n","July 21, 2015","true","743.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The campaign is great and multiplayer even better.\n\nThere's also the possibility to play the campign in co-op. I suggest playing the campaign from start (Dawn of war - Chaos Rising - Retribution) to get the most out of it.\n\nThe "Last Stand", which is a kind of arena-horde mode, is also co-op. Don't buy the last stand "standalone" if you already have the game, as it's included in the game. For some reason, the last standalone is also included in the collections which should be fixed...\n\nThere's a lot of DLC for this game, which is a bit tedious. Most of it is just skin packs though.\n\nIf you jump into multiplayer alone now it's likely you'll meet very experienced players as the game is a bit old. I recommend playing against (or with) your friends instead!\n\nI would've loved to see more playable races (Tau, Sisters of Battle, Necrons, Dark Eldar).","September 28, 2014","true","90.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even though you get to play as the factions, the game's almost cookie-cutter campaigns are hardly worth revisiting once playing throught the first time. I played through the Space Marine campaign and started the Imperial Guard. It should be noted, that the sound effects, score, and voice acting are wonderful. The game engine is equally enjoyable as gore and destruction are gloriously detailed along with a almost fully destructible environment. The multiplayer is the best part of the game, particularly The Last Stand mode. Overall the game is fun, even if it only seems like an excuse to get DoW multiplayer powered by Steam instead of Windows Live.","December 2, 2013","true","122.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is... It's fun, and fast paced... But I feel like it didn't capture the feel of the original dawn of war, due to the fact that they COMPLETELY take away the base building, which is something in RTS's I enjoy. However, I'm going to base this review in the style I did for the first Dawn of War, Speaking from a die hard Warhammer fan.\n\nLet's go over the positives of this game...\n-The action and pathing are improved, You are stuck right into it. and the fights are fun to watch.\n-The Voice acting in this game, is superb. And Very well done.\n-The campaign is very well made, However, this also contains a flaw, which I'll go over.\n-Multiplayer play is quite well, and still has multple game types, like the first Dawn of war game.\n-Each unit has to be treated like the table top counter part, such as, some are expendable, but if you keep losing too much, you will lose. Which has an immersion factor for me.\n-The soundtrack... Oh My God... The soundtrack for this game, is probably one of the best I've heard...\n-The developers added attention to detail, and added unit cries and announcer cries that differ depending on what race you are going against. for example, If you play orks, and then order an attack on an eldar, they might say something like "Eldar ar da squishiest.." Capturing the humor and immersion of the Warhammer universe.\n-To make the game more strategic, you have a small population, So choosing your units contains strategy to it.\n-The last stand mode is really fun, and it's a great idea. Holding off hordes of enemies with other players controlling your character is quite immersive.\n\nThat's the positive aspects of this game... now for the negative.\n-The campaign is only fun once. As you get through playing with your race, you'll notice it's the exact same missions, but just with different races, which hugely downs the fun factor to it. Which leaves multiplayer and skirmish the only thing that maybe can bring you back.\n-The no base building is quite disapointing... Many RTS fans, such as myself, loved base building, due to it allowing you to manage and macro, while this game just focuses on micro.\n-The races seem more similar this time around... I don't know why, but it feels like they share some of the same strategies, Which doesn't help this game much for bringing you back, and keeping you in. Of course, this is my opinion, comparing it to the original, which felt like you are playing a different race. Don't get me wrong, there are differences, just not as much as I'd like. More like a peeve I suppose, so if you feel they are different, ignore this.\n-Giving the small population, Which is also a good thing, but it has a flaw for me, I like commanding big armies, Having a swarm of tyranids, or a horde of orks is probably the best feeling for me, but this game downs the population, which I can understand.\n\nBasically, this game can be fun, but it lacks compared to the others imo... I'd say only try it if you are a die hard warhammer fan. But this is my opinion, yours may differ. If you want to get into the universe of Warhammer 40k, try the first Dawn of war instead.\n","September 21, 2014","true","35.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It possesses all the content of the previous two games, updated with the inclusion of the Imperial Guard faction alongside new units for every race. These include superheavy units for each race, and now your Space Marines, Orks and Tyranids will have something to fight those pesky Avatars of Khaine and Great Unclean Ones with the addition of Land Raiders, Ork Battlewagons, the Swarmlord himself and the Imperial Guard's newly arrived Baneblade.\n\nRetribution has its own campaign which serves as a conclusion for the storyline of not only Dawn of War II and Chaos Rising, but also for Dawn of War I and its own expansion packs. All that has happened in the games' storyline has led up to this game, and you have the opportunity to play as any of the races in the campaign. While the campaign is repetitive (all races share the same missions and overall story), it is nonetheless enjoyable to go around defeating armies of daemons with irish Ork space pirate captains.\n\nRetribution also wins because it has the best voice acting. Everyone has a british accent. EVERYONE.\n\nIN THE GRIM DARKNESS OF THE FUTURE, EVERYONE IS BRITISH.\n\nAND I LOVE IT.","October 15, 2011","true","145.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The wall of inaccessability which hobbles most RTS is absent here, allowing games against even experianced players to go either way with the right choices - rather than build orders and meta gaming dictating the outcome before the game even begins.\n\nProbably the best Warhammer game out there, and it deserves your attention.","August 24, 2014","true","172.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

DoW2, much like it's predecessor, is a RTS set in the grimdark world of Warhammer 40,000. Unlike its predecessor however, your battles are on a far smaller scale. No longer do you have a huge squad of 9 marines per squad for example. Nor can you build more than one Land Raider. Instead squad sizes are far smaller(unless you're 'nids or orks in which case numbers wins the day), and focused more on flanking, tactics, special abilities and the like. In my opinion this actually makes the game more enjoyable for me. DoW1 felt too much like any stereotypical RTS wearing a 40k skin. DoW2 feels unique.\n\nThe campaign is basically an adventure, with a neat story, neat gear and the like. Done with campaign and bored of it? RTS battles await. Don't want to play it as a RTS? Last Stand. For a game that is this old now, there's plenty to see and do. If you're a 40k fan, then every now and then it's great to get your 40k kicks in.\n\nDoW2 Retribution is perhaps the last great 40k game. None of those released after it so far has been anywhere as epic a journey. Until Sega decides to make a DoW3, this game above all else, is probably THE 40k PC game I'd choose if I had to pick one to play for the rest of my life.\n\nAnd I guess it'd be remiss not to mention that I'm massively into 40k today only because of this game.","October 14, 2011","true","898.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game averages about 2000+ active people per day. Most of them probably do 1v1 games. There is a rather steep learning curve if you are used to Starcraft because you no longer have to build a base. You have to claim requisition points and power nodes to purchase stronger squads or upgrade your fortress to unlock the next tier of units.\n\nStrategically, this game is king because it has you thinking throughout the entire match about where to position yourself on the map.\n\nI'd have to give it a 7.5/10 because the company hasn't been too active in updating a few things that this game needs. If your computer is fast but your opponents computer is slow, the game tries too hard to make it slow for everyone... until that player drops.

The game averages about 2000+ active people per day. Most of them probably do 1v1 games. There is a rather steep learning curve if you are used to Starcraft because you no longer have to build a base. You have to claim requisition points and power nodes to purchase stronger squads or upgrade your fortress to unlock the next tier of units.\n\nStrategically, this game is king because it has you thinking throughout the entire match about where to position yourself on the map.\n\nI'd have to give it a 7.5/10 because the company hasn't been too active in updating a few things that this game needs. If your computer is fast but your opponents computer is slow, the game tries too hard to make it slow for everyone... until that player drops.

Each player has a HQ from which they build units. Unlike a lot of strategy games, Retribution does not require the player to build structures to train units and gather resources. Rather, you start the game off with your choice of 1 of 3 of your chosen factions hero, as well as the basic infantry type of your faction. Then, to gather resources you command your units to capture Requisition (the main resource used for everything) and Power (a secondary resource for purchasing more advanced units and upgrading your units and their tech as well as researching the next tier) points. For each point you capture, the amount of Requistion/Power you earn per second increases. The only disappointment i have with all of the Dawn of War games is the very limited unit cap of 100.\nDon't let that stop you from getting this amazing game, perfect for new players and RTS veterans!\n\nJester's Rating: 8.5/10","December 28, 2011","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/56400/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","TLDR – Dawn of War 2 Retribution is a standalone Real Time Strategy game following the events of Warhammer 40k Dawn of War 2 and its DLC Chaos Rising.  This time around you actually get to manage some resources and build a few units instead of just commanding a team of heroes.\n\nI didn’t play Chaos Rising, and a bunch of stuff apparently happened in the story so I wasn’t sure of the timeline on starting Retribution (the stories are pretty much completely unrelated). Fortunately, the plot is cohesive and you should be able to follow it if you have basic knowledge of the Warhammer 40k universe. Note that despite the fact that there are 6 different races to play in Retribution, they all have pretty much the same story. Space Marine, Chaos Space Marine, Eldar, Ork, Tyranid, and Imperial Guard all play the same series of missions just with slight changes to the narration. Basically, no matter which team you’re on, you need to stop a bad guy from ascending to demon form before an Imperial extermination force wipes out the entire star sector.\n\nIf you’ve played Real Time Strategy Games like Starcraft, Warcraft, or Command & Conquer, you should be able to pick up Retribution’s gameplay almost immediately. But instead of building a base and harvesting resources, you start each level with hero units and need to work your way across the map while claiming resource “nodes” and command points. Do you remember the “commando” missions from Starcraft where you need to get your hero through the level relying on special powers while occasionally having backup appear? Well the whole game of Retribution is like that. The enemy is already entrenched in each level, and each of your hero units has special abilities gained through level ups and / or special items (war gear). The war gear is randomly dropped during gameplay and equipped between missions. So beating the game is mostly about managing your energy (mana) for using special powers and not biting off more than you can chew at once.\n\nThe game has a cover system where if you move near certain items on the map like buildings or busted up walls, your units will attempt to hide behind them for a defense bonus, but honestly with so many special powers flying around, the cover isn’t as important as blasting the enemy before he blasts you. Make sure you diversify the equipment and special powers of your team and take your time with each level. You will find the game is not very difficult, especially if you’re playing as the Tyranid race. The Tyranids seem to be unique in that you only get one hero in the campaign (but that hero is seriously badass). Along with your hero units, you have the opportunity to requisition additional units at command points throughout each level. These units are obviously much weaker than your heroes but you can build up a nice army and flank enemy positions. The army will never be too big due to the population cap, but it does make finishing each level easier.\n\nPros:\n+Fun game and not very punishing for casual gamers.  It’s pretty hard to actually lose, I don’t think I failed even one level. It just takes patience for your energy to recharge before you assault fortified enemy positions.\n+There is some variety in gameplay. Like the original Dawn of War 2, your units mostly have both melee and ranged attacks and you can gear up your units with particular equipment to enhance your play style. With 6 different playable races you shouldn’t be surprised to find that you’re occasionally fighting each of the six races throughout your campaign.\n+There are still people playing the game online if multiplayer is what you’re into. When I played there were usually about 300 other players though I didn’t really interact with them. I did try the Last Stand gameplay mode which is a 3 person co-op vs waves of enemies (took about 2-3 minutes to set up each match). I didn’t get very far but it seems to be the kind of game mode where you keep playing to level up, and hence get further and further along. Yes, there is also a co-op campaign mode.\n\nCons:\n-Like the original Dawn of War 2, there are a ton of Steam achievements that seem tied to multiplayer. If you’re mostly into single player story campaigns like me, you’ll beat the game with less than 20% achievements and bring down your overall stats :(\n-As I mentioned before, all the races essentially have the same campaign. This makes the game surprisingly short and you can be done with it in about 2 days. No point in continuously replaying the same missions unless you’re grinding for achievements.\n\nOverall the game is fun if you’re into real time strategy or the Warhammer universe. If you have a friend to play co-op or Last Stand mode with, even better. Just note that getting far in Last Stand will require a significant time investment. There’s not much luck and skill involved until higher waves, and to get there you need to be high level.  And again, if you’re playing the single player campaign as Tyranid, play it in Hard or Very Hard difficulty mode unless it’s your very first time playing a real time strategy game. They’re just too strong for normal difficulty if you focus on ranged warriors.\n","September 10, 2015","true","29.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Graphics are very good, gameplay is somewhere in between good and bad. When comes to Single Player/Campaign game is actually really good, it's a mix of RPG and strategy. You can build and customize your heros and armies and play in interesting linear campaign missions. Also a good thing to say, is that you can experience same story from angle of total 6 races, bad side is that all 6 races have same identical missions, only different is final goal. So once you complete campaign with one race, you have seen it all. But DoW 2 and expanision shine in Campaign gameplay but are total let down when comest to multiplayer and skirmish against AI.\n\nAs an old player of DoW: Soulstorm, multiplayer game experience was mix of huge armies and building a bases all over the map. DoW2 and this Retributin expansion offers you a small scale battles (in true meaning of word skirmishes ). You will lead maybe a 4 or 5 units max at the time, there is no base building, every unit comes from one building, which means you can't build two different units at the same time, which slows gamelplay drastically.

It is the sequel to the Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War video game series. Dawn of War II features a non-linear interplanetary campaign, as the Space Marines. The campaign can be played either as single-player or cooperatively with another player through an online connection.\n\nThe game's campaign departs from those of its predecessors in several key features. One of the most notable departures is that there are no base-building elements, unlike in previous Dawn of War titles. Instead, the player chooses the units to be used prior to beginning a mission, cannot build new units once the mission begins, and has only limited reinforcement options.\n\nWarhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II – Retribution is the stand-alone second expansion to Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II, part of the Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War series of real-time strategy computer games. Set in Games Workshop's Warhammer 40,000 fictional universe, the single player campaign is playable with multiple races.\n\nImperial Guard is introduced as a new race, and all races including the races from the original game and the first expansion (the Eldar, the Space Marines, Chaos, the Orks and the Tyranids) are now playable in single-player and multiplayer.\n\nDawn of War II: Retribution offers a campaign for every race, including the Imperial Guard. The campaign takes place across different planets in Sub-sector Aurelia, including the jungle world Typhon Primaris, the desert world Calderis, the arctic world Aurelia, the hive world Meridian, the derelict ship Judgment of Carrion, and the dead world Cyrene.\n\nfor more info:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HogeV6KQC7I\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeqPGmxnfvU\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIYhRLFS1EQ\n\nhttp://www.gametrailers.com/reviews/nxdq8d/warhammer-40-000--dawn-of-war-ii--retribution-review\n\nhttp://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii---retribution\n\nhttp://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii-retribution/pc-83766\n\nhttp://dow.wikia.com/wiki/Warhammer_40,000:_Dawn_of_War_II_%E2%80%93_Retribution\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhammer_40,000:_Dawn_of_War_II_%E2%80%93_Retribution","February 20","true","44.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","0"

Retribution tries to marry the two, giving you a four-man team of hero units to work with and providing the option to exchange them for less-complicated but weaker elite squads before deployment or even calling in larger forces on the field (back to the DoW classic formula, albeit with perhaps fewer unit choices, particularly in the vehicular department).\n\nBut honestly, the hero units (and/or their elite squad replacements) are usually enough to complete most missions by themselves. Where DoW was like the equivalent of a standard game of tabletop Warhammer 40K, DoW2: Retribution is more like playing a game of Kill Team. In fact, if you're planning to buy the Kill Team game on Steam, don't bother; just buy this instead.\n\nAlso, the Last Stand multiplayer mode is super-fun. It's probably dead nowadays, but if you can get into an active server or have a few friends with the game, give it a go!\n\n9/10 it okay, not subtle or nuanced but it okay","November 13, 2015","true","33.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It reminds me of RPG games, with strategy sprinkle onto it. (E.g. Demigod)\n++ No other game allows you customize your units' color.\n\nCons\n- Campaign. It reminds me of CnC4, a bit short, and a bit unnecessary. Wish it was the DOW I Dark Crusade's style of campaign.\n- Sometimes, units will not activate their skills. (Hive Tyrant's Bio Plasma, for example. He will stand there even though you issued the command.)\n- Seemed that spamming range units is better than melee units. Melee units are a bit underpowered in this game in my opinion.\n\nOverall, it's a great game.

(or at least no mention thus far has been made, considering the fact that youre using a "teleportarium" to move around, im going to assume you dont have a ship - this feels like a ginormous plothole.)\nNevermind that they changed the loadout system; energy based abilities for everything - which again, takes your mind away from conserving limited special abilities, while characters like Cyrus still shout "Do not waste what the Emperor provides!" when you order him to use a special attack.\n\nWhile, yes you do still have limited resources now in the form of power and requesition, it dosnt play like the same animal - you have an army beyond the confines of the original game, which imho was much more enjoyable the way it was - this has boiled it down almost into a generic rts clone.\n\nAlso, what annoyed me the most about this iteration of DOW II - having watched friends and family who are, like me all avid Warhammer fans (I even purchased that trainwreck Fire Warrior, i believed it was a decent game for a while fyi) was the fact that each of the 6 sides campaigns, pretty much played as if you were the same side - just subtle differences like the endings.\nOther than that, if you've played one side then you dont really need to play the rest, unless youre a cheev-wh*re.\n\nHonestly i could go on all day about what i, thus far have personally thought is wrong with this piece of the DOW II title, but ive always had a soft spot for Relic - theyve made some awesome games (*cough* Homeworld *cough*) but i feel that this iteration of Dawn of War is -NOT- one of them.\n\nPlainly and simply put; if you prefered Dawn of War II and Dawn of War II: Chaos Rising - dont even bother playing this one, even if you purchased it (like me) as part of a Steam sale package.\nIf you prefer the original Dawn of War and its myriad of expansions, then DOW II: Retribution is totally going to be your cup of tea.\n\n- Captain Soban.","April 3, 2015","false","7.1"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","13","25","0","6"

It was the fourth time it had happened. Feeling ridiculously exasperated, Civ 5 groped a sock, thinking it would make him feel better (but as usual, it did not). Unexpectedly, he realized that his beloved ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth was missing! Immediately he called his friend, Leroy Jenkins. Civ 5 had known Leroy Jenkins for (plus or minus) one million years, the majority of which were sassy ones. Leroy Jenkins was unique. He was intelligent though sometimes a little... dimwitted. Civ 5 called him anyway, for the situation was urgent.\n\nLeroy Jenkins picked up to a very happy Civ 5. Leroy Jenkins calmly assured him that most koalas yawn before mating, yet otters usually earnestly grimace *after* mating. He had no idea what that meant; he was only concerned with distracting Civ 5. Why was Leroy Jenkins trying to distract Civ 5? Because he had snuck out from Civ 5's with the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth only four days prior. It was a saucy little ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth... how could he resist?\n\nIt didn't take long before Civ 5 got back to the subject at hand: his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. Leroy Jenkins sighed. Relunctantly, Leroy Jenkins invited him over, assuring him they'd find the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. Civ 5 grabbed his desk and disembarked immediately. After hanging up the phone, Leroy Jenkins realized that he was in trouble. He had to find a place to hide the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth and he had to do it thoughtfully. He figured that if Civ 5 took the truck, he had take at least eleven minutes before Civ 5 would get there. But if he took the ♥♥♥? Then Leroy Jenkins would be alarmingly screwed.\n\nBefore he could come up with any reasonable ideas, Leroy Jenkins was interrupted by seven abrasive aligators that were lured by his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. Leroy Jenkins sighed; 'Not again', he thought. Feeling frustrated, he thoughtfully reached for his mitten and aptly backhanded every last one of them. Apparently this was an adequate deterrent--the discouraged critters began to scurry back toward the thicket, squealing with discontent. He exhaled with relief. That's when he heard the ♥♥♥ rolling up. It was Civ 5.\n\n----o0o----\n\nAs he pulled up, he felt a sense of urgency. He had had to make an unscheduled stop at Wal-Mart to pick up a 12-pack of pencils, so he knew he was running late. With a calculated leap, Civ 5 was out of the ♥♥♥ and went indiscriminately jaunting toward Leroy Jenkins's front door. Meanwhile inside, Leroy Jenkins was panicking. Not thinking, he tossed the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth into a box of mittens and then slid the box behind his piano. Leroy Jenkins was concerned but at least the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth was concealed. The doorbell rang.\n\n'Come in,' Leroy Jenkins sassily purred. With a careful push, Civ 5 opened the door. 'Sorry for being late, but I was being chased by some funny-smelling maniac in a Vette,' he lied. 'It's fine,' Leroy Jenkins assured him. Civ 5 took a seat vaguely close to where Leroy Jenkins had hidden the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. Leroy Jenkins cringed trying unsuccessfully to hide his nervousness. 'Uhh, can I get you anything?' he blurted. But Civ 5 was distracted. Without warning, Leroy Jenkins noticed a selfish look on Civ 5's face. Civ 5 slowly opened his mouth to speak.\n\n'...What's that smell?'\n\nLeroy Jenkins felt a stabbing pain in his butt when Civ 5 asked this. In a moment of disbelief, he realized that he had hidden the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth right by his oscillating fan. 'Wh-what? I don't smell anything..!' A lie. A insensitive look started to form on Civ 5's face. He turned to notice a box that seemed clearly out of place. 'Th-th-those are just my grandma's mittens from when she used to have pet bunnies. She, uh...dropped 'em by here earlier'. Civ 5 nodded with fake acknowledgement...then, before Leroy Jenkins could react, Civ 5 randomly lunged toward the box and opened it. The ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth was plainly in view.\n\nCiv 5 stared at Leroy Jenkins for what what must've been four seconds. Unexpectedly, Leroy Jenkins groped wildly in Civ 5's direction, clearly desperate. Civ 5 grabbed the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth and bolted for the door. It was locked. Leroy Jenkins let out a eccentric chuckle. 'If only you hadn't been so protective of that thing, none of this would have happened, Civ 5,' he rebuked. Leroy Jenkins always had been a little insensitive, so Civ 5 knew that reconciliation was not an option; he needed to escape before Leroy Jenkins did something crazy, like... start chucking mittens at him or something. All of a sudden, he gripped his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth tightly and made a dash toward the window, diving headlong through the glass panels.\n\nLeroy Jenkins looked on, blankly. 'What the hell? That seemed excessive. The other door was open, you know.' Silence from Civ 5. 'And to think, I varnished that window frame nine days ago...it never ends!' Suddenly he felt a tinge of concern for Civ 5. 'Oh. You ..okay?' Still silence. Leroy Jenkins walked over to the window and looked down. Civ 5 was gone.\n\n----o0o----\n\nJust yonder, Civ 5 was struggling to make his way through the pumpkin patch behind Leroy Jenkins's place. Civ 5 had severely hurt his arm during the window incident, and was starting to lose strength. Another pack of feral aligators suddenly appeared, having caught wind of the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. One by one they latched on to Civ 5. Already weakened from his injury, Civ 5 yielded to the furry onslaught and collapsed. The last thing he saw before losing consciousness was a buzzing horde of aligators running off with his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth.\n\nAbout seven hours later, Civ 5 awoke, his butt throbbing. It was dark and Civ 5 did not know where he was. Deep in the humid desert, Civ 5 was abundantly lost. A few minutes later, he remembered that his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth was taken by the aligators. But at that point, he was just thankful for his life. That's when, to his horror, a oversized aligator emerged from the cornfield. It was the alpha aligator. Civ 5 opened his mouth to scream but was cut short when the aligator sunk its teeth into Civ 5's face. With a faint groan, the life escaped from Civ 5's lungs, but not before he realized that he was a failure.\n\nLess than two miles away, Leroy Jenkins was entombed by anguish over the loss of the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. 'MY PRECIOUS!!' he cried, as he reached for a sharpened spoon. With a heroic thrust, he buried it deeply into his neck. As the room began to fade to black, he thought about Civ 5... wishing he had found the courage to tell him that he loved him. But he would die alone that day. All that remained was the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth that had turned them against each other, ultimately causing their demise. And as the dew on melancholy sappling branches began to reflect the dawn's reddish glare, all that could be heard was the chilling cry of distant aligators, desecrating all things sacred to virtuous men, and perpetuating an evil that would reign for centuries to come. Our heroes would've lived unhappily ever after, but they were too busy being dead. So, no one lived forever after, the end. :'(","May 15, 2014","true","516.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Yeah, it's not the first DOW where u spammed units until your enemies would die. Yeah it's not Starcraft 2 (and for the love of the Emperor, stop comparing the two) where you need the dexterity of a piano player; but it's a game where tactics and strategy blend nicely. learn to abuse the retreat button in multiplayer. The learning curve is kinda steep, especially against veteran players BUT (and that's a big but) once you get the hang of it, you will realize that there aren't two games exactly the same. Let's take for ex the orks. Deadly at close range, with the right upgrades, will ♥♥♥♥ anything from afar too. A little word of advice for the new players tho: use space marines/force commander. The strategy is simple: run, conquer the requisition points, retreat, heal, harass, overcome and overpower. The MOD that people talk about it's not that important. The title is solid as it is. The only question that remains is... are you a loyalist or a traitorous scum?","March 1, 2014","true","51.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.\n\nMulti-player Skirmish.\nThis is where things really heat up, and this is my favourite mode, be warned as with many game you will need to practice VS the AI before attempting to take on other players, but the huge arrange of units and sides and the beautifully done maps, animations etc all contribute to making this an unforgettable RTS experience.

So you can raise their stats and change the equipment of every hero in your squad.\nThe game is split up in more or less 15 missions, individualized for each of the races.\nOtherwise you can play the ,,last stand", where you and 2 other players try to survive 20 waves of enemys.\nLast aspect of the game is the multiplayer mode, where you can play solo or in team against other players.\n\nFor tabletop players: 7 of 10 stars.\n\nOf course the game is still epic. But there are a few bad mistakes in the game, which let your smile disappear....\nMuch of the equipment isn't codexconform, there are characters and Chapters that doesn't exist, an exterminatus that isn't an exterminatus ((it's an overkill in game.....first thousands of lances, and then a magmabomb which is much bigger than usual)(and although it's an planet with a great flora and fauna, there are no virusbombs)).\nOk, this could be called pedantically, but if you know the codex and the rulebook, you will notice theese things wether you like or not...\nIn spite of everything i advise you to buy this game ;)","November 20, 2014","true","51.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Yeah, it's not the first DOW where u spammed units until your enemies would die. Yeah it's not Starcraft 2 (and for the love of the Emperor, stop comparing the two) where you need the dexterity of a piano player; but it's a game where tactics and strategy blend nicely. learn to abuse the retreat button in multiplayer. The learning curve is kinda steep, especially against veteran players BUT (and that's a big but) once you get the hang of it, you will realize that there aren't two games exactly the same. Let's take for ex the orks. Deadly at close range, with the right upgrades, will ♥♥♥♥ anything from afar too. A little word of advice for the new players tho: use space marines/force commander. The strategy is simple: run, conquer the requisition points, retreat, heal, harass, overcome and overpower. The MOD that people talk about it's not that important. The title is solid as it is. The only question that remains is... are you a loyalist or a traitorous scum?","March 1, 2014","true","51.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I have a love for RTS games and grew tired of the old medieval era, even though that's a favorite theme of mine when it comes to video games. Though the space side of an RTS that is more focused on squad tactics and implements heroes is an excellent addition to the genre. Most RTS games are simply "a numbers game" meaning who ever has the largest force will win. However, this game allows you to win fights against larger forces. Being able to use squad/hero abilities allows you to be more versatile on the virtual battlefield. If you know what you're doing and can think before you make your move, prep your assaults/defensive positions, then you'll win without a doubt. Scout the terrain and pick the best positions available.\n\nP.S.\nThe boss fights are pretty epic too. Not to mention being able to loot wargear in game and select rewards to upgrade your heroes and honorary units is pretty slick too. It gives the game a personal touch.","March 10, 2014","true","14.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.\n\nMulti-player Skirmish.\nThis is where things really heat up, and this is my favourite mode, be warned as with many game you will need to practice VS the AI before attempting to take on other players, but the huge arrange of units and sides and the beautifully done maps, animations etc all contribute to making this an unforgettable RTS experience. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.\n\nOne of my favourite RTS games, recommended if you like both ACTION RPG or RTS or just W40K   - 8.5/10\n\nOne wish - that they included the Tau, fortunately there's a mod for that.","March 6, 2014","true","376.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Why they ever decided to throw base building and big-scale wars out of the window in a strategy game is beyond me. Command and conquer 4 made the same massive mistake as all of the Dawn fo War II series did.\n\nNo more big battles, no more base building, no more really epic units battling it out, no more epic long games. Just you and a handful of squads versus an enemy with a handful of squads in games that usually don't last very long. There's not much room for strategizing and diversification with such a small pool of things to do stuff with. The entire game feels more like you're participating in a few small-scale guerilla warfare missions rather than a real epic war.\n\nGraphics and sounds aside, which are actually pretty decent and a reasonable improvement over the original series, I really cannot recommend this to anyone who's a fan of the original series. If you are new to Dawn of war in its entirety, then sure, you can give this a shot. It can be an ok time sink. But in my opinion, you'd still be better off just going with the original Dawn of War anyway, rather than this one. Only the campaign is reasonably fun to play due to the storyline. but even then many of the things in the campaign (including the missions themselves) constantly repeat no matter which race you play it through with next, so it doesn't give you any reason to play it again after you played it out once.\n\nTL;DR - Overall, I just don't recommend it at all, nor do I recommend any of the other Dawn of War II games. I would much rather point people to Dawn of War: Dark Crusade or Soulstorm. Even when Dawn of War II isn't compared to anything, it still only reaches a 5/10 rating in my opinion, at the very best. An 'ok' time sink, but not much else.\n\nTrying to be innovative and new is all well and good, but that does not warrant completely annihilating a working (and fun) formula, which the original series was most popular for.","May 14","false","4.7"," 14 of 28 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","14","28","0","5"

There is none, and that might be ok, several games manage to stay fresh without basebuilding.\nBut here you've got nothing to do, you capture the objectives and it only goes downhill from there, there's no "escalation"- you're scraping for cash to get a unit early game and you're scraping for cash by lategame, except this time you do that even more because later units are more costy.\n\nRpg system? Sounds amazing on paper, in reality it just means you gotta grind to get better.\n\nIt's a worse game compared to dow1 not because dow1 was more "traditonal" (although pretty groundbreaking for its time) but because dow1 knew what it was, dow2 on the other hand tries to be company of heroes, an rpg and an arena game all in one. But fails at the most important thing: being fun.\n\nDo you recommend this game?\nOnly if you hate older graphics, fanatically disdain basebuilding or are legally forbidden from coming 10 feet near anything that resembles dawn of war 1 but still deeply crave dawn of war 1's sweet ♥♥♥.\n\nOtherwise?

Will continue to allow online play after the other DoW2 interations die due to the ending of Games for Windows Live.

Results in a far more enjoyable tactical experience than games like Star Craft 2, where holding ground and tactical expasion is much less important relatively. Factions are not all perfectly balanced, but there's a good number to choose from (not as many as in the final DoW 1 expansion, but I'm not sure if you can still play DoW 1 online).\nGameplay: http://youtu.be/YZspVqpbM4k","October 28, 2013","true","54.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Obviously with Dawn of War III coming out sometime in the near future, the prior games won't get as much mileage, but if you ever see this or any other DOW games on steam sale, just do yourself a favor and grab them up... for the greater good.","May 18","true","309.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

One the one hand, the small unit tactics and powerful feel of 2 and Chaos Rising has been preserved. On the other, there's no actual difference between campaigns. If I use Imperial Guard, for example, the campaign is utterly identical to the Tyranid or Eldar campaigns with the obvious exception of who I'm actually playing as. Most of the campaign missions are exercises in flooding the map with as many troops as possible in the vain hope of killing the massive monster with more health than a tank before it squishes everyone on the field. One late game mission comes to mind wherein a massive biological nightmare is attacking an unarmed APC that conveniently has your only way out on board. This thing has more health than most armored vehicles and can near instantly kill most infantry sent at it, and due to the mission itself, infantry is all you can send at it. One early mission has the player party of cardboard boxes intercepting and destroying a light armored convoy with no anti armor weapons avaliable due to how early in the game it is. Eventually the only solution is to barricade the exits with gun turrets and hope massed infantry fire will kill the vehicles. The best mission by far is roughly middle of the game, during which the player and party revisit a location from Chaos Rising and finally put an end to the big baddy from that game. This mission was certainly frustrating for a number of reasons, but it added a certain sense of closure to the whole plot line that wasn't present in Chaos Rising. IN short, this game is rather flawed but certainly playable if grinding is acceptable.","March 17, 2015","true","28.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is a very decent RTS games, with a great story in Warhammer 40K lore, which fits it's nicely. The gameplay is a mix between first Dawn of War(Which was great as well) and the new mechanics from DoW II. The arts and graphic of the game reflects the Warhammer 40K world as a real, bloody world where there is no peace.

One the one hand, the small unit tactics and powerful feel of 2 and Chaos Rising has been preserved. On the other, there's no actual difference between campaigns. If I use Imperial Guard, for example, the campaign is utterly identical to the Tyranid or Eldar campaigns with the obvious exception of who I'm actually playing as. Most of the campaign missions are exercises in flooding the map with as many troops as possible in the vain hope of killing the massive monster with more health than a tank before it squishes everyone on the field. One late game mission comes to mind wherein a massive biological nightmare is attacking an unarmed APC that conveniently has your only way out on board. This thing has more health than most armored vehicles and can near instantly kill most infantry sent at it, and due to the mission itself, infantry is all you can send at it. One early mission has the player party of cardboard boxes intercepting and destroying a light armored convoy with no anti armor weapons avaliable due to how early in the game it is. Eventually the only solution is to barricade the exits with gun turrets and hope massed infantry fire will kill the vehicles. The best mission by far is roughly middle of the game, during which the player and party revisit a location from Chaos Rising and finally put an end to the big baddy from that game. This mission was certainly frustrating for a number of reasons, but it added a certain sense of closure to the whole plot line that wasn't present in Chaos Rising. IN short, this game is rather flawed but certainly playable if grinding is acceptable.","March 17, 2015","true","28.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As I'm WH40K freak I had a big expectations to that game, especially after a very good Dawn of War II and interesting Chaos Rising. The campaign made me a lot interested as they wanted to let us play all 5+1 races (All that was in DoW II and CR + the one they added in Retribution) but all I can say, the game went through my expectations. It is a very decent RTS games, with a great story in Warhammer 40K lore, which fits it's nicely. The gameplay is a mix between first Dawn of War(Which was great as well) and the new mechanics from DoW II. The arts and graphic of the game reflects the Warhammer 40K world as a real, bloody world where there is no peace. Last stand mode adds as well very much to the game to keep it more interesting and the multiplayer is done really good.\n\nMy score for this game is 10+/10.","October 4, 2012","true","553.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That being said, this game is very different.\n\nFor multiplayer I would say this game is excellent, if you can get good enough to beat the skilled people who play. Quite a learning curve unless you're really good at RTS's .Also, the Last Stand Mode was amazing.\n\nIn my opinion the Campaign was quite weak, but I suppose that can be excused by trying to create a storyline for 6 races. However, Dawn of War 1 dark crusade did this with 7 races and made an amazing game, with a decent story.\n\nOne of my major complaints about this game is that it takes FOREVER to kill a unit, and more often than not, they just rout (run away super fast so you can't catch them) and regroup. I realize that does add some strategy to the game, but overall the battles are just not as fun or as dramatic as in DOW 1.\n\nSo here's the summary:\n\nGameplay:\n\nSingleplayer: 4/10\nMultiplayer: 8/10\n\nGraphics and Sounds are both about 7/10. I know people will say that i'm wrong with this, but I really liked the cartoony-but-cool graphics from DOW1 and the sound as well. This is, after all, my opinion.\n\nAnyhoo, that's what I think, thx for reading.","February 25, 2014","true","53.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There's also the "The Last Stand" gametype, a 3-player co-op defensive arena where you fight off various waves of enemies with your chosen heroes.\nInsipid lag compensation system aside, the multiplayer is fairly smooth.\nAnd yes, the original was better, you chuckle♥♥♥♥s.

I'll keep it simple.\n\nSingle player campaign feels like a rushed afterthought. No more cool planetary backdrops or watching your ship jump into a new system. Now you get a static map and dumbed down levelling system. DoW II is better if you want single player, unless you simply HAVE to play as Orks/Eldar etc.\n\nBut wait! Multiplayer is what it's all about anyway right? It could be, but seeing as finding a public game that doesn't boot you out after the countdown reaches zero is next to impossible, you're limited to private matches.\n\nThe Last Stand works fine, but if you only want to play that you can buy it seperately anyway.\n\nOverall it's a shame, as DoW II is good fun, especially in multiplayer, but without the ability to actually play public matches, all Retribution really brings to the table is a new race to play as. On your own. If you want a solid multiplayer strategy game with an active community and servers that (mostly) work, get CoH instead.","September 29, 2015","false","20.7"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","10","22","0","1"

You shouldn't have to pay extra for content that was IN PREVIOUS GAMES!\nThe Tau and Necrons were my favourite factions, and now I have to pay *extra money* to play as them because the publishers are such bloody ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n\nAnd what's more, they completely ruined skirmish mode! The gameplay is entirely different and it's the kind of thing I'd expect from something that ISN'T part of the DoW series. It completely deviates from all the games before it, and it sucks.\nThey also got rid of that sandbox-y campaign and it's now linear.\n\nLong story short: If you want to play Dawn of War, play Dark Crusade or Soulstorm.

See DoW should resonate two things: Incrediable heroes, and incredible single player experience. This game.... neither. The heros aren't "incredible" by any means. They lack the personality and story lines from the previous DoW's. In DoW 2, for example, I loved Aviticus's character. His **** everything attitude, his "no males, no females, just soldier's" look on gender, and not just his story or just him, I liked all of the characters, they were all unique and intriguing... this game... literally.... is just copy paste mentality gone too far. The campaign consists of the EXACT....SAME....LEVELS..... OVER.... AND OVER..... AND OVER..... NO MATTER WHICH RACE YOU PICK.\n\nSPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"Well how can that be? The Space Marines have to fight a giant demon for the end where they and chaos are the only races that ever go to that planet at that time"\n\nMan ♥♥♥♥ your logic, we're LITERALLY gonna put in a 30 second narration that says durring the tyrinid campaign "Yeah that demon is bad news we better just break the space/time continuium and make a battle that should never have happened happen.... cause we dont want to spend the time or effort actually writting a ♥♥♥♥ing story that makes sense for each individual race."\n\n"Well fine...ok... thats one race.... but what about the other's?"\n\nRepeat my last comment but input the name of whichever race you want.\n\n"What about the battle sisters? the necrons? the Tau?"\n\nWe'll have one sentence of dialauge that mentions each race and how we chalk up their lack of existance to "they arent around." But the tau can be a playable race in the Last Stand Stand Alone game... just no story or any real relevence at all.\n\n"So... you took the time and effort and money to develop the Tau models, and weapons, and unit actions.... and then just said.... '♥♥♥♥ them and their story?'"\n\nYep\n\nDawn of war 2 and Dawn of war 2 Chaos Rising were a little dissappointing but I would still recomend them. They were very fun and surprisingly had decent character story and plot. This game is terrible.\n\nAnd if you want to get the game just for "The Last Stand" game mode, dont.... you can get it stand alone.","September 18, 2015","false","126.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

You bring some units and on top of that you can buy more units, so you do not get that "personal" relationship, with your units as you did with your heroes.\n\nAll in all, I do not recommend this expansion.\n\n5/10","December 29, 2014","false","5.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Which is not a bad game, but I was hoping, when i bought a couple years ago as a disk (which i still have..) that there was going to be base building in this game. There's none and for me it was such a let down. I mean i know a bit about the 40k universe, you don't paint buildings, you paint armies which i absolutly respect not adding any of that stuff but to me, RTS rhymed with bas building and i was disappointed to be honest.\n\nNow i reinstalled the game because devoleppers gave a new playable character for free, the Necron Overlord, for the game mode called The last Stand, so i gave it a try. First of all, i was happy to get something new, and free, after all these years i bought the game, it was a nice surprise out of nowhere. So i tried the guy, didn't really liked it, but i stayed for the game mode... And now i play almost everyday the damn thing.\n\nAs i read in the reviews, came for the Dawn Of War, stayed for the Last Stand. But it's not worth the price tag. I know a lot of of effort is behind this game, lots and lots of detail, beautiful visuals that still looks amazing after the years but the Campaign is boring, and repetitive (all the races have almost the same story, if not the same) Customization is still limited in my opinion (from the point of view of the hobbyist who paints his figurines, this game is not giving the same freedom , at all, but still holds proudly the title of Warhammer ..), Multiplayer is so ♥♥♥♥ing hard, the matchmaking is a pain, I'm not playing to be the best, I'm playing to have a good time but i just can't in this game. So all i'm left with is a nice little game mode, which i wish i could've bought, if it was possible, seperatly.\n\nSo yeh, not my favorite, but still partially fun to play.

However, it seemed that Relic Entertainment didn't provide any updates to resolve the slow load times or co-op multiplayer issues. It could be due to the free weekend overload but I doubt it.\n\nPROS\n1. Theme\nInteresting story about the Blood Ravens, Exterminatus and how all the different factions play a role in the overarching story. I like how they made sure all the races melded into one main story.\n\n2. Wargear & Skills\nI like the customisation of skills and equipment. The 3 different skill trees (Combat, Health and Energy) add a small change in playstyle.\n\n3. Multi-Race Campaign\nNice to know that each race has its own campaign.\n\n4. Last Stand\nFun. Gets a little boring playing the same match though.\n\nCONS\n1. Load Times\nFor some reason, the game requires one to wait for 2 whole minutes before one can start a map and another 2 whole minutes before one can close the game. This is a major downer for me. For a 2011 game, it is quite odd.\n\n2. Server Issues\nWhile trying to play Last Stand, the game hangs after the countdown finishes. It is only during some rare occasion that a game starts up.\n\n3. Repetitive\nControl your leader and his honour guard, attack or defend, break open crates, capture points and bases. Every single location seems to be exactly the same. The only major difference tends to be a boss fight, other than that there is nothing unique.\n\n4. Overly-Simplified Campaign\nThe way you capture the bases at fixed locations is quite odd. It's as if a base was magically planned to be there. Sometimes, the bases are redundant as your hero can just summon units. E.g. Hive Lord calling in Genestealers\n\n5. Cover\nUnsure if it's even necessary. While it is possible to hide behind cover, there isn't a real need to.\n\n6. AI\nThe AI is just silly, it can't path around simple blockages or auto-attack enemies. E.g. Genestealers don't know how to go around an obstacle to attack. You have to break the obstacle with your Hive Lord before the Genestealers know how to attack.\n\n7. Unit Supply\nI really do not understand why you have to capture a supply building. I can understand capturing Requisition and Power but the whole idea of a satellite dish providing supply seems odd. The theme just doesn't sync with the idea of unit supply.\n\n8. Redundant Heavy Units\nYou don't really have to destroy bases in the campaign, so it makes you wonder why you need vehicles/heavies at all. You hardly see turrets in except in the early stages of the campaign and even then you can deal with the turrets without heavies.\n\n9. Resource Crates\nYou have to manually Right Click on the Requisition and Power that appear after a crate is broken. It's quite tedious and does not provide any fun. Why couldn't they just automatically collect the resources when they fall out? The same problem applies to dropped Accessories and Hero Equipment.\n\n10. Abilities\nLots of visual effects but no impact.\na. The casting is not smooth. There is a long windup before certain abilities trigger, which may result in misses. E.g. Hive Lord's Plasma Barrage\nb. Inaccurate E.g. Doombolt from the Chaos Sorceror\n\nThe best executed abilities seem to be those that do not require aiming and are centred on the hero. E.g. AOE heal or Doomblast.\n\n11. Last Stand Lack of Diversity\nWhy can't we use all the commanders? Why is it restricted to 1 from each race?\n\nNEUTRAL\n1. Unit Design\nI'm a bit aghast at how some units were designed. This is a personal preference but I thought I ought to write it out. E.g. Tyranid ranged units (Termagaunts, Hive Lord) and their "hose gun" concept.\n\nSUGGESTIONS\n1. Ping Column for Multiplayer\nI can't see the ping to another player. I would prefer a lag-free game instead of a 200-400ms lag game.","September 27, 2015","false","35.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","2"

And of course, the campaign, as I am one of the many players who actually care what the campaign has to offer, like backstory, or just some great sequences. Do I get any of that?\nNo. I don't.\n\nInstead, I get a "Squad-tactical shooter" with the worst population cap I've EVER seen. W-What the hell is this? At first, I thought: "Woah! 100 population cap?! Time for some war!" Nope.  Each unit takes up so much damn space, that by the time you progress farther into combat in skirmish, or multiplayer, you won't even be able to build the powerful units, as the units you had to build to defend your crap, are now obsolete, but still there. When I think of a game that has amazing   cover programming, for the units that you control, I don't think of the most boring, and bland skirmish/Multiplayer that I could possibly conjure up. It feels. So. Dumbed. Down.  Hell, even a 2006 game, "Star Wars: Forces of corruption" was more fun, and enjoyable, than this! That is just pathetic! And the worst part, is how desperate I was to have fun with this game, In fact, I'm still trying! Now lets get to the issue that really bothered me. The dammage output of some of the units. Here's my squad, of Imperial troopers. The basic, but upgraded to the maximum. And there's a group of reapers. REAPERS. My squad unloads mags, after mags, at the reapers. To the point where they retreat. With only one of them actually dead. One. Did I mention the squad had a grenade launcher sentinel? ONE. CASUALTY FOR THE ENEMY. ONE! What is up with this dammage?! It's TERRIBLE! Some factions have the dammage the equivilence of the Halo 1 pistol! Meanwhile the others, have the dammage of a old man poking you with a cane. IT'S PATHETIC! THIS ISIN'T HOW YOU BALANCE A RTS! THe worst part, is that I REALLY liked the more expensive units! They wreaked havok, but were unable to take cover. BUT. They took up SO much space..So..Much..Space. What else? Oh yeah. The bloody energy production. IS HORRIBLE. At least make it so that we can customize it for multiplayer/skirmish! I tested how it would play off in a easy match against the AI. GUESS WHAT? I HAD TO STALL THE AI SO THAT I CAN EVEN GET THE BIGGER THINGS! COME ON! And even by that I've REACHED the "Population cap" nonsense. UGH! I tried SO HARD to have fun with this!\n\nNow that we got that out of the way...Lets get to the..Campaign. Oh lord..\nWhat campaign? It's the same damn thing for every faction! Great creativity, 10/10!\n\n"I coudn't even bring myself to finish a campaign the moment I realized it's exactly the same for each faction."\n\nCome on, I know for a fact other games in this series had more than..THIS.\n\nAnd that's all there is about the campaign!\nHahahaha! Serious sam 2 had a less boring "Campaign" than this. What's that, it didn't have a actual campaign? Just a killing simulator? EXACTLY. STILL more fun than..Than..THIS.\n\nNonsense!\n\n\nI don't recommend this at all. I might get one of the older versions just to compare. This was extremely depressing and dissapointing to play.","September 27, 2015","false","22.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","3","0","0"

But now, after two expansions and many update, it slowly became a great game.\n\nNow we need a Dawn of War III, with a gameplay based off the first game (i want WAR), another rpgish coop campaign and more races (Tau and Necron first of all).\n\n","March 1","true","7.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It is a poor and feels like a rush and sloppy continuation of the series.\n\nPros:\n1. You can play 6 of the Warhammer 40K races in campaign and multiplayer\n2. Co Op campaign with a friend\n3. custom color your army for multiplayer\n4. new DLC skins for troops and Last Stand\n5. The Last Stand is fun\n\nCons:\n1. The multiplayer takes far to long to find a ranked game.  Likewise, there are very few NonRanked games avaialble at times.\n2. The races are always unbalanced, despite the amount of updates released.\n3. The units LEVEL UP makes it impossible to fight back or even start a counter attack near the game's end.  This only makes the opposing side quit early or just lose interst in playing any further.\n4. Campaign is linear and has the same story arch, with no variation for either race.  Every Map has no freedom of movement, which forces players to go in ONE direction.  This was never a factor in the previous DOW II installments.\n5. People who bought hte Collector's Edition were cheated out of their money for rubbish cards and a small poster.  For the same price I expect an art book, a soundtrack or more.  I purchased the C.E. upon pre-order and I was utterly disgusted by what was offered.  Their advertisement for the items was very misleading.\n6. Units are expensive, you spend more time managing them than playing the game.\n\nToo add: I have been giving this game so many benefits of a doubt that I just finally said, "it fails". A Game is ment to be fun and exciting, DOWII: Retribution kills that by making you feel RUSHED, TENSE, & ANGRY.\nIt takes a lot to get me mad, and this game has pushed that button. Other RTS games were challanging but at least they were fun and had preferable replay value.\n\nDOW: Retribution is so unbalanced it's annoying. Every race is expensive, even for weaker units. You spend more time trying to amass resources that you when you finally buy that 400 gold +250 Wood super unit, when it dies out just 10 seconds after purchase, I just say "F@ck it!"\n\nDawn of War 2 Retribution is a poor sequel to its predecessor, Dawn of War, in terms of multiplayer, unit management, combat and most importantly FUN. I have more fun at the table top than I do with this...thing. (It doesn't even deserve to be a game, let alone have a Warhammer 40,000 theme attached to it.)\n\nThis game feels more like it was rushed and lacks any sign of polish, enjoyment or a supportive staff.","October 22, 2011","false","140.0"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","0"

When I heard that there were different campaigns for all the playable factions, I was hyped. I thought it would be reminiscent of Warcraft in that they'd all tie into each other - nope. They're all the same missions, just with your faction. They all play differently, but not to the extent of Dawn of War 1. You never really "feel" like your faction is all that different from the others.\n\nSpeaking of Dawn of War 1, Retribution really feels like it wants to recapture the massive, awesome battles that took place there. Does it succeed? Not really, no. All it did was take the squad-based mechanics of 2 and took the scale of 1 to make some overly-simplistic, watered down mess. And despite what Orks may say, "bigger" isn't always "best" - the game doesn't seem to know what to do with big armies, so if you're at a choke point or narrow walkway your units will kind of just crowd around and get stuck. That is INCREDIBLY frustrating. Be an RTS or a squad-tactics game, you can't be both.\n\nAnd I don't know if this is just me, but I have a hard time telling some of the units apart. In DoW1 it's never an issue because the lighting was better and each unit just seemed more unique.\n\nOverall, this isn't a bad game, just a disappointing one. Some people may not feel the same way I did about some of these things, but I personally just found it to be a frustrating experience.","September 5, 2014","false","9.4"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","1"

NEVER!\n\n\n던 오브 워 시리즈의 최신작이 벌써 나온지 4년이 됩니다.\n워해머의 팬에게... 준수한 워해머 전략시뮬레이션은 가뭄의 단비 같은 것일텐데요.\n\n이 게임의 문제점을 따지자면 끝이 없지만, 가장 큰 문제점은 동시접속자가 400명도 되지 않는다는 점과 사후처리가 전혀 되지 않는다는 점이 있겠네요. 벌써 보고된지 4년째 되는 버그가 아직도 고쳐지지 않고 있으며, 앞으로도 고쳐지지 않을 것입니다. 동시 접속자 400명 중 당신을 제외한 399명은 전원 10년간 워해머만 플레이 해온 사람들이구요.\n게임에 접속하는 순간, 당신의 유닛들은 기지에서 벗어나지도 못한채 포격을 받고 수류탄을 맞고 기지 방어 터렛들이 불타오르고 HQ가 폭발할겁니다.\n\n사지마세요.\n그냥... 차라리 제가 아미 빌려드릴테니 미니어쳐 게임을 하세요.","February 28, 2015","false","868.8"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","25","4","16","8","8"

There are a few really good missions but most are tedious and/or too easy. Uneven difficulty and a short campaign makes it hard to justify playing on higher difficulties. Besides that, you basically have Chaos Rising's MP modes and units. Unless you are a big IG fan I would recommend getting the original and/or Chaos Rising (which I loved but I'm a huge Chaos fan) instead.","November 6, 2011","false","20.2"," 0 of 9 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","9","0","0"
