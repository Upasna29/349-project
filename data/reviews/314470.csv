In that time I've put more than 200 hours into it and now I'm ready to review the game.\n\nHOBL combines the Civilization world map and its exploration, with first person dungeon crawling, and multiple party management familiar to RPG fans. It tacks on some light town management. I love it so much I had to wear boxers for the first three months each time I sat down to play it.\n\nIts easy to get into, offers meaningful choices, requires good strategy, and benefits from a minimalist UI and retro aesthetic that all the kids are into these days. Like many other turn based strategy games it carries the risk that "one more turn" will mean that you'll be late for work tomorrow. Despite this risk the game plays well as a quick "cool down" from your Calls of Battlefield Honor binges right before bedtime. Its fun to play in short bursts, but can can consume your attention for many hours. The game is procedurally generated so each play through is different.\n\nKeeping your parties equipped and trained, allying with distant towns, and running short RPG quests (which usually involve diving into one dungeon or another) presents plenty of variety to hold your interest long term.\n\nI once emailed the developer with a support question and was pleased at the promptness of his response and his willingness to engage in conversation. Even the gift of a Steam key was unexpected and demonstrates the developer's commitment. The game has been consistently updated in the year I've been enjoying it and each patch polishes the action further.\n\nThere is a woefully-out-of-date-and-not-really-representative-of-the-final-product demo on the developer's website for interested parties. I highly recommend this game to all fans of RPGs and/or turn based strategy games.","August 6, 2014","true","157.7"," 181 of 201 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","181","201","4","4"

Is there? Uh.\n\nIN GENERAL:\nBasically, you create parties of adventurers and take them out to different dungeons which you must clear of monsters.\nThe game is very exploration-heavy. As you explore the surface world, you will encounter towns, huts, villages, dungeons, fortresses, all sorts of stuff, all sorts of random encounters, some that are text-based and you have to make some moral decision (or immoral, hahahah). Some quests will have some goal, like rescue someone, that sort of thing.\n\nYou have a main base, which starts out with just your main party-gathering building, where NPCs will go to offer to join (for a price). You can build structures to support your overall adventuring, from merchant shops, alchemists, basically, places to buy gear and items you need to equip your party. Usually, basic stuff, since all the good stuff are random drops in dungeons.\n\nThe game puts a lot of emphasis on building up parties and their characters. Everything is pretty basic and laid out.\nIf you've played any RPG before, then it's familiar stuff. However, I really liked the multiple-party aspect of the game.\nYou can spent a lot of time just messing around crafting your perfect group of heroes (up to 6 per party), and then have another "line-up" ready to go in case your "main" party gets wasted in a dungeon.\n\nNot only that, you can take multiple parties into a dungeon, in fact, some require you have at least 2 or 3 parties with you. I wish it was possible to merge into one giant party, like a "raid" party, but you can't, and instead, they roam separately in different areas, clearing out different levels.\n\nStill, it's cool being able to have more than one, it's like having armies at your command.\nYou can send one group to deal with "the big foozle" in one area, and then maybe have another party go do a quest for some villagers. You can toggle between them with ease.\n\nPROS:\nAll that stuff I just said.\n\nCONS:\n\n-The music, while excellent, is repetitive. I'd love to have more tunes, more varied. It's all sweeping, piano-focused tunes, and very well done. But even so, it's repetitive.\n\n-Not a big con, but the retro-graphics are pretty retro. My main issue with this, is I wish moving around on the main map was smoother. I don't think the party icon/movement graphics needed to look so cheap, since everything else looks good.\n\n-Dungeons can get to be a real chore, with constant back-tracking to find right switch that opens this/that door, or wait, was it that/this door? The game's in-game dungeon map that builds as you explore is very helpful for navigating fast and helps mitigate this by showing you the switches you found, and showing which doors are now open/closed. IMMENSELY HELPFUL. But tedious running around, just the same.\n\nTIPS/THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT:\n\n-The interface is a bit clunky, and can take time to get used to (like how to equip your party members with weapons/items). Really seems harder than it needs to be, but when you realize the concept of having multiple-parties, it makes sense. You can easily accidently sell or fail to equip good items.\n\n-Game has a bunch of settings to customize the game, so you can make it hard, easy, whatever. Tons of choices, from XP gain, strength of monsters, amount of treasure, etc. I recommend playing on easiest settings first to get a hang of the game.\n\n-Permadeath-sort-of: once someone in your party dies, unless you have a priest that knows Raise Dead, they are permanetly dead! So you can spend a lot of time building a kick-butt character and then suddenly lose them.\nIf you lose all of your party, you start back at your base and can hire new heroes (you will reach of point of having multiple parties anyways).\n\n-Be prepared to spend a lot of time in maze-like dungeons killing stuff. Some dungeons are really large, and it will wear on you. You can always just leave though.\n\n-The developers are involved and make sure to do updates, the support is good.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nGreat game, definitely recommended.\nI think some people will be turned off by how "simple" it is, how it lacks detail, and the retro-look.\nIf you can get past that, like me, then you will get to enjoy all the depth it has underneath those things.\nFor me, it gave a real sense of accomplisment when clearing out a dungeon, going back, growing my party, growing my base. I think if they tried to make this too complex, the whole concept wouldn't work.\n\nThis is a rare type of game too, not too many like this around, so it's quite a novelty.\n\nLASTLY:\n\nThe developers were awesome enough to continue the old time-honored/fading tradition of offering A GAME DEMO.\nRemember that? When demos were the thing?\n\nThat was back in the day, when developers were proud of what they crafted, and were eager to show it off their beloved work in the form of a game demo.\n\nI think that the developer were willing to put out a demo, puts them in a very good light.\nHow many games have we bought, where there was no demo, and turned out the game sucked?\n\nSo don't take my word for it about this game, if you don't want to, you don't have to: go try the demo!\nI hope you enjoy it and reward the developers with a purchase like I did.","November 28, 2015","true","2.8"," 32 of 34 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","32","34","2","0"

Mostly what you find is roguelikes, and while I've played most of them and liked half of them, I'm always on the prowl for something.....more.\n\nEnter Heroes of a Broken Land. Ignore the generic fantasy name, this game is a MUST play. I'm not exactly sure how to pinpoint what makes this game such a potent mix of addictive awesome-ness, but I'll certainly try.\n\nHeroes of a Broken Land, (HoaBL), mixes a lot of different ideas together. It's taken elements of Civilization, Heroes of Might and Magic, Master of Magic, Wizardy, and various other classic fantasy games and melted them all down into one, all the while retaining what made those games such a pleasure to play.\n\nBut there is one major difference.\n\nHoaBL throws out the complexity and tedium that plagued those games, and keeps the simplistic ideas that made them so utterly addictive. It is fully aware of where its roots lie, and you can really tell the developer poured his heart and soul into this game. You can also tell the developer must have been an avid old-school rpg lover himself, because there is no way a game of this content and quality could of been made by some mainstream developer.\n\nOnce you start playing, it is very simple to set up your party and get straight to adventuring. Again, the simplicity of this game is it's strongest point. You literally watch a tiny backstory scene right when you begin the game, and then you are thrust right out into the open to play and learn for yourself. It's friggin' awesome.\n\nThere is something about this game though, something that is difficult to put into words. It just hearkens you back to a simpler time in computer gaming, that warm, fuzzy space before Call of Battlefield Duty Honor Warfighter 2.0 OMGGGZZZ existed, (if you get my drift). Before the handholding. Before the giant gleaming yellow arrows yelling "THIS WAY TO YOUR NEXT OBJECTIVE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T JUST USE COMMON LOGIC AND REASONING TO FIND IT YOURSELF." That something is what HoaBL has in spades. It's like finding an old, dusty, coffee ring-stained copy of the Lord of the Rings in your attic and cracking it open to immerse yourself in some classic fantasy. You really need to get it and experience it for yourself.\n\nTL;DR version: OH MY GOD HOLY ♥♥♥♥ BUY IT.","August 28, 2014","true","10.0"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","34","39","0","0"

I was a little uncertain that it was a good choice because it's a bit pricier than I would have liked =) however;\n- It's really really fun\n- Keeping track of and micro-managing my party's gear was a bit tricky and time consuming, my only albeit minor gripe\n\nhttp://youtu.be/ZZxvkvWs2yg\nhttp://youtu.be/FNaKmguSPO4\nThe world map you play on is randomly generated and you can adjust it's size and difficulty level when you start a new game. Initially hero stats are randomly generated. But you are able to choose the class for any level zero hero you recruit. I think it's best to choose a role which their stats most suit unless you really need a certain class. To begin with I took one of each class type. As your heroes gain experience by battling monsters and disarming traps they level up. Each level heroes gain attribute points which you can distribute into any primary statistic that you wish. I didn't stack these points into primary class attributes, I found that it was important to improve on the weaknesses of your heroes. For example sometimes I increased the defensive and evasive stats of my spell casters because they were really squishy instead improving their mana and spell power. Each level or so heroes also gain the choice of a new skill, the choices appear to be random. There are active abilities such as heal and passive stuff such as specific weapon specialties. Of course there are also different tiers of weapons and armor. Certain equipment can only be used by specific classes, some equipment is enchanted. Sometimes equipment provides a debuff (e.g. less health) as well as a benefit which have to consider, I like that sort of thing. The reason I found managing equipment a bit tricky and time consuming was that you have go to the town, see what's available in your shops, go out of the town, open your party screen, check what each of your heroes already has and then return to the shop in town while trying to remember what you needed. It's pretty typical sort stuff you see in RPG games. But I think it would handy if you had an overview screen so that you could just see quickly what everyone has equipped. So dungeons were really cool. It was easy to control movement and navigate them with the map. I liked combat, you can't select a target when you attack. heroes will attack the closest enemy to their portrait in the front line. Having your tanks at the front of your party didn't work to protect my weaker heroes as monsters appear to attack anyone in your party randomly. These aren't criticisms of the game I'm just saying how it is. One feature that I really liked about combat was that if you approach an enemy from the side or behind to initiate a battle it counts as flanking or a surprise attack. This allows you to take the first turn or even take two turns before the monsters retaliate. Dungeons are really fun to explore. It was cool to occasionally find a discreet switch on walls which open hidden passages. It's really satisfying to find a room filled with chests and crates of loot =)\n\nSo yeah the presentation is really basic. But it just doesn't matter to me. I still really liked how the game looked. Especially the introduction which is a series of images explaining background of the world.\n\nSo, I think this is a good game and I recommend trying it out. There are other games like this already out there but I haven’t played them all. So I unfortunately I cannot compare this to them to this. What I will say is that I think you could probably easily get your money's worth out of this title. After two hours I have only covered a relatively small area of the map.","August 7, 2014","true","6.0"," 32 of 44 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","32","44","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TehDruid/recommended/314470/","TehDruid","TehDruid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TehDruid/","387 products in account","Heroes of a Broken Land is one part TBS -in the vain of games like Heroes of Might and Magic- and one part turn based first person dungeon crawler lootfest. It promises infinite replayability with its randomized content and highly customizable world generation settings. It suffers from a similar manner of issues as A Valley Without Wind. They're highly ambitious rpgs with quite a few shortcomings, sadly. So, why am I giving it a "Yes", you ask? Well, enjoying the game depends on what you're doing, and I enjoy it a lot. There IS a lot to discover (things you unlock through buildings and special map locations spice up the game quite a bit). I'll present the different aspects of the game that I consider good, bad and some which I feel do not have a positive or negative impact on my decision. Onward!\n\nThe Good\n+  Randomized heroes, equipment, quests, dungeon objectives, dungeon events, etc. Increased replayability since every world's layout is different than the last's.\n+  Greatly customizable heroes (Want to teach a warrior to heal? You can! Want to make your cleric tougher or more deadly in close combat, or even teach him elemental spells he wouldn't learn normally and have him play like a mage/cleric hybrid? You can! Want to teach your characters to sense monsters, making them appear on the minimap so you don't have to look for them and waste your time? You can! Just experiment a bit. ;) )\n+ You choose what buildings to build and upgrade in your town, it's an importan decision what to build because building spots are limited.\n+ You can "control" more towns by earning their favour (so you can have different buildings you couldn't fit in your starting town)\n+ Contrary to popular belief, you CAN customize your characters (you need a specific building in town)\n+ Options to speed up exploration and combat in the game settings\n+ Fast-travel within dungeons\n\nTo me, the last two are very important in games like this, since dungeons tend to drag on forever if combat and exploration are slow, I'm running at max speed on both. Fast-travel is also great for when you want to walk to a place you've been before within the same floor but would be quite tedious to go manually.\n\nThe Bad\n- Features a really small monster variety in contrast to the game's huge scope. This is the biggest issue at the moment, imho\n- Wandering monster groups are a pain in the ♥♥♥, since you either have to run to them with your main group, or have a reserve party to dispatch of them, but they sometimes are too hard for your reserve party to defeat, so you need to train them too and that is something I really don't like, sadly. I wish they would add an option to disable wandering monsters. Also, monster strength estimates seem to be quite off, I beat a group of "impossible" wandering monsters with my group relatively easily, but I guess impossible doesn't mean IMPOSSIBLE, just very hard\n- The world map doesn't feel lively, there's no competitors other than the aforementioned wandering monsters which are just an annoyance to me. Adding things like gods, civilizations/factions and hero dwellings where you can hire certain types of heroes could probably make the world map more fun.\n- The game lacks a proper tutorial but then again I consider it to still be a work in progress, so a proper tutorial might be in order at some point, I guess\n\nThe ???\n* Grindy gameplay. Some people swear by it, others hate it with a burning passion. Your pick.\n* You have to run at least 2-3 parties to do some dungeons/bosses, some of which are mandatory to progress the main quest... :( That's really annoying to me, managing a group of 6 is a pain already, 3+ groups is just too much work to do for me atm.\n\nEven though I love this game a lot, this is a tough recommendation. I'm going to give this game a YES due to the fact that recently the devs have taken initiative towards making gameplay more fun, with an increased enemy pool and more friendly UI updates. I really hope they keep making the gameplay less stale and convenient, because this game really is a flawed gem that deserves to become something better and I think a lot of people that like games like Eye of the Beholder, Dungeon Hack, Wizardry, Grimrock would be interested in it.\n\nP.S: I will probably return to this review to edit it in case there's new stuff to comment on.","January 4, 2015","true","17.0"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

In their individual parts, each "genre" of the game presented here is average at best - the options and classes in combat are reasonably limited, and you'll find yourself performing the same actions over and over again, with the exception of using particular types of magic against particular enemies.\n\nDungeons are procedurally generated, giving "limitless" adventure, but lack any real depth or charm - you'll see the same few traps, the same secret button in the same spot on the wall in each of the dungeon types. Within a few hours, I felt like I was treading the same ground over and over. I'm all for a "retro" presentation, but combining that with a retro interface that can't be scaled for modern resolutions that requires multiple, often unintuitive clicks to get things done wasn't the wisest of design choices.\n\nThe overland map lacks any sense of direction or purpose. There didn't seem to be any competitors or threats, even on the harder difficulty levels - meaning having things take "turns" on the map didn't make a whole lot of sense - if I acquire gold each turn and need X gold to hire a hero, buy something or build something, there's nothing stopping me from just clicking "next turn" until I have the required resources.\n\nMaybe this penalises a "score" count at the end - I don't know, I'd lost interest by the time my characters were level 12 or so, and felt no real impetus to continue.\n\nHOaBL is far from the worst in its class, but it's certainly not worth the $15 asking price. Pick it up on sale for ~$5 if you're bored, otherwise give this one a miss.","August 14, 2014","false","8.8"," 37 of 56 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","37","56","0","0"

You don't have to, towns are the old Rogue style towns, except you decide what goes in them (buildings, level of buildings and what they have to offer, etc).  Only commodity in the game/town creation is the gold & crystals.  Both are found in dungeons or on the map.\n\nBut wait!!  There are quests!  And then there are events!

The randomized dungeons are large and fulfilling, and even on the standard normal difficulty it remains to be a challenge to overcome, that does not feel like artificial difficulty. The enemy types are slightly sparse, but otherwise the gameplay is top notch. One downside is that it is slightly clunky to cycle through your potions and skills, whether in combat or outside of it, but it has that retro charm to it, as most games that inspired this one felt that way anyways.

Multiple hero parties and some dungeons even need multiple parties as each has to unlock areas for the others to continue to move further. Solid turn based combat with up to 6 heroes per party, or even 3-4 parties of heroes fighting one boss.\nIt covers small amounts of town management with overmap strategies and a nice turn based combat/dungeon crawling experience. Huge amounts of weapons/armours/spells and items to equip and learn. Multiple classes to branch into as your heroes advance.\n\nA nice feature is that you can import your own portraits to replace the generic ones. You just need to create a 'Portraits' folder inside the game one, should look something like this depending on where you have steam installed.\nD:\Steam\steamapps\common\Heroes of a Broken Land\Portraits\nInside here you place any .png image you want and the game recognises them, there appears to be no size limitation to what the game recognises, works great :) Side note steam screenshots are by default saved as PNG images, want your favourite skyrim hero leading the charge? Sure thing quick screenshot toss him in the folder and you got yourself a winner.\nTo find the portraits ingame, just go to your adventurers guild (once purchased) and you can edit your heroes there.\nPersonally I really like this feature.\n\n\nSummary.\nReplayability- Excellent, with fully randomised, worlds, town types, dungeons/caves/towers etc you keep getting drawn back in for another game, hour....what do you mean it's 4am.\n\nUI- Simple but effective. Easy to jump around and get to what you need, nice quick move feature inside dungeons too.\n\nCombat- Solid turn based party combat\n\nGeneral gameplay- Multiple parties, town management and good hero advancement systems with multiple class choices as they advance.\n\nGraphics- There are what they are, the gameplay more than makes up for the 'classic' look of the game. With being able to import your own hero portraits I find I don't even really notice them.\n\nI really recommend this game, I will continue to play it for a very long time yet, it's a nice time filler, easy to jump in and out of if you don't have long.\nIf anyone needs assistance with setting up and using the portraits just PM me and I'll help as best I can.\n","October 12, 2014","true","95.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

You're thrown into a world with enless dungeons, but they all look the same, which would be forgivable if there was variation in the monsters you fight, but you will fight rats, bats, slimes, skeletons, and elementals over and over. Each encounter will be the same as the last, and it will all blur together in a forgettable experience, which is a shame because there is a lot to like but in the end I quickly found myself dreading heading back into another dungeon or, even worse, defending my city from endless hordes of very easy but time consuming to kill armies of rats and skeletons that roam the open world portion of the game.","November 12, 2014","false","10.5"," 22 of 39 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","22","39","0","2"

The characters have randomly generated stats and I like how you decide what class they will be. They are not born into a mold of a generic class. You have to judge which they will be be suited for and choose their class for them(on the level 1 characters anyway, there are also higher level recruits that have already settled into their role).\nI like the speed of the gameplay.

It's an excellent game and deserves your attention. It's a nice twist of a simple, yet fun, city builder and a classic Might and Magic rpg. The graphics are as simple as they come, yet it oddly adds charm to the game. It reminds of old DOS games, games that I use to play as a child. You can (and should) set up different parties to fight across the land. It will help with exploration and defending of cities from attacking monsters. On your travels you might find different races to join your parties. Each race seems to have something different about them. One example of this is the Lizard people. They are pretty useful, yet they don't listen to your commands and will attack the creatures on their own. The only complaint I have with the game is the amount of different monster. The game has a pretty boring selection that consist of: Elementals, skeletons, slimes, and such. It's pretty generic, but it gets the job done. The Wind elements are really annoying at later levels. Lastly, I want to say the dev of this game seems to be a great guy. I had some questions about the cities and the guy was prompt and very polite.

As someone who has been struggling for a while to get into first person dungeon crawlers, I greatly enjoy this game so far. It combines the hard as balls first person dungeoneering rpg elements of games like Wizardry and Grimrock with the open world, city management and infinite adventure of A Valley Without Wind, a game that's also high on my like list.\n\nOne thing that makes me a bit iffy is the emphasis on having multiple parties at once. In the game's current state, as far as I know, dungeons can only be cleared once, and the enemies never respawn. This means that training up a fresh party can be very difficult depending on how much of the world map you've cleared with your main party, but the thing is, you actually NEED multiple parties, because one of the main "plot" dungeons in the game are special towers that can only be cleared when 2 or more parties enter at once. I'm still new to this game, so I MAY be wrong about enemy respawning, though.\n\nAlso, the stat system is kinda wonky. The stats for your heroes are based entirely on random dice rolls, and oftentimes this can lead you to have a fighter with horrible attack and defense but great intelligence and willpower, or a mage/cleric with the opposite problem.\n\nAll in all though, Heroes of a Broken Land shows great promise, and is an incredibly well done experience you should try at least once.","August 12, 2014","true","10.4"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","2"

I was an early adopter and have been playing off of steam for hours longer than my record here shows, so don't let that fool you.\n\nAnd yet, as someone who craves endlessly huge maps, I've never actually finished a game.  I'm not even sure what happens when you conquer a map.  I hear the developer says that whatever wizard you choose at the beginning will increase in power.\n\nAnyway, all that aside, this is a game that, if you like old fashioned dungeon crawlers like Eye of the Beholder and so on, this will definitely satisfy whatever itch that game satisfied and then some with procedurally generated maps and dungeons that offer near endless replayability.  It's really been amazing what the developer has accomplished with the RNG here.  I've not played a whole lot in the past few months, but in all the time I've played, I've never ever gotten to a place where I was stuck in a dungeon.\n\nThere are a number of tilesets here for various types of dungeons that are filled with different kinds of enemies with all kinds of skills.  Shrines that can increase your characters stats, heal, or renew their mana, or curse them by lowering them just the same.\n\nFor each hero, there are branching advanced classes from the main four you've come to expect of games of this sort:  Mage, Warrior, Thief, Priest.  It's just a shame you have to say goodbye to your lovngly raised adventurers at the end of a game, and can't transport them to a new world.

The city building is very simplistic and not very clear on how it's helping. The graphics and fonts are very outdated, even for 1990s standards.

There are some dungeons that require multiple parties to clear, and those are fun.\n\nI definitely recommend this game.","September 4, 2014","true","13.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

To be honest, on my first look it seemed to simple for me, like you could not specialize your characters at all. The combat seemed odd to me too and overall my opinion was mostly negative.\nBut i gave it a try and i was positively surprised, it made me stop playing Might and Magic to play this one instead.\nI have only played about 12 hours, but i can say the dungeon crawling and city building is fun. You can distribute status points for your character how you want it to be and searching for better equipment is satisfying in a way.\nAlso, the combat does feel good i think, its much better than i expected.\n\nThis game is addicting and i can just recommend it to people who like this genre.","October 17, 2014","true","45.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

This cause several problems :\n- There is no sense of progression in the dungeon, you start killing basic monsters and you finish the dungeon by killing the same basic monsters. Also, it seems like there isn't any boss in the game, sadly.\n- The exploration doesn't have much point. You find a couple of nice chests here and there, but you aren't moving forward, you are just scouring the dungeon for those last rats you need to kill to "complete" it.\n- There's a few traps, but not really any puzzle apart from a few hidden switches (that are most of the time useless since they just open a shortcut, when you can "fast travel" to any square anyway, they just make the map more confusing).\n\nBasically, I feel like every dungeon is just a "defeat X waves of basic monsters" quest, but in which you have to run around corridors for a while instead of the monsters coming to you. I'd love a dungeon where you go forward, and maybe even meet a boss at the end.\nMaybe some are like that later in the game, but no sign of that as of yet.\n\nEdit : Tried an higher level dungeon to see if there is any difference. It was 3 levels deep, but still with the same objective of "kill all basic monsters", and the same monsters in all 3 levels. Main difference is that once I had explored it fully and still had 1 monster left to kill, I had to run around all 3 levels for 10 minutes looking for it.","August 9, 2014","false","4.3"," 21 of 45 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","21","45","0","2"

He's been pretty good about keeping this game alive and kicking.\n\nIf you like 90's-style roguelike maze explorers like the old Bard's Tale and Wizardy type games, you'll love this. HoaBL adds some features I've never seen in other 1st person roguelikes, including a dynamic overworld map with many features remniscent of Ultima's I-III or perhaps Heroes of Might & Magic. There is a mini-game in that you have to build buildings around your starting location and this helps determine your overall strategy.\n\nPerhaps most innovative is the introduction of multiple parties. You can make several parties and have them each exploring different places, and some higher level locations require you to actually bring more than one party together just to get the doors open.\n\nVery enjoyable and one of my favorite roguelikes on Steam. Worth every penny, and I look forward to more updates from the devs.","June 15, 2015","true","32.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Their appearance and gender can be changed to your liking as well! The game isn't perfect, so I'll do the flaws later but as it stands I LOVE how you can chose how the world generates, RNG and customize fans that enjoy a good dungeon romp, jump in!\n\nThe graphics hit that sweet spot of being appreciable but also old school. Many games do this these days and I'm happy with that! The music that does exist in this game is good too! Has a very..."The world is over, we're just picking up the peices" feeling to it. The sound effects match what happens and have an extra "oomph" to them! Well done!\n\nOn to some minor flaws though!\n\nI found the music limiting, I want more tracks, more variety in music. Also I feel the enemy graphics are too small. I encountered bears that were a bit bigger than rats and the same height as skeletons my characters were fighting. My characters "feel" much bigger than the enemies. As if I was fighting teddy bears or smurf skeletons perhaps? Maybe make the enemies bigger if that's possible. If not, I'm a happy camper regardless.","July 30, 2015","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
