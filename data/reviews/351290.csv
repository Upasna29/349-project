For instance my character is on the verge of dying every 5 minutes. Be it dehydration or starvation, it should be less unforgiving.\n-It would be nice to have servers for english speaking players and for russian players. Till now I've only met 2 english players.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimateJaylord/recommended/351290/","UltimateJaylord","UltimateJaylord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimateJaylord/","75 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirstly, I would like to point out that the follow points are constructively criticising the game in order to get it out of that early alpha stage. NOTE: This game doesn't have zombies in it, so if you are buying it hoping for that then you're out of luck\n\nThe good points:\n• Considering how new the game is, the gun play is extremely 'solid' for lack of a better phrase to describe how smooth it can feel.\n• The game is very well optimized, I run it at 1080p on a GTX 750 Ti paired with an i7 4790 to remove bottlenecking and I receive a solid 60 fps on maximum settings without any FPS lag whatsoever.\n• There is a nice amount of guns already, it has overtaken the DayZ Standalone given the amount of time the developers have put into it and I have a feeling that it will grow exponentially as soon as big Youtubers hear about it and start to play it.\n• The map is quite a nice size, you will have to run for a while to reach the end of the map. Whether you recieve better gear or not is really dependant on your luck.\n• The weather is a very nice side feature as well as a *NON-BUGGY* (I can't stress that enough when compared to DayZ) eating, and heat system.\n• The servers are stable enough and easy to set up and ones which you join aren't too laggy depending on your connection. (The combat sometimes get's slightly laggy, but hey ho)\n\nThe Bad Points:\n• The only AI Enemies in the game are dogs, this by itself is fine, but there is definitely a problem with them. They spawn in packs in certain areas such as the military base and many other places far away from the generic new player spawn (very South of the map). Usually, this would feel nice and challenging but the problem generates when no loot is actually spawned at the military base apart from an odd M1911 magazine with 4 bullets in it. Whoopee.. This can be tested by creating a fresh server with brand new shiny loot (Dare I say), and you will see that there are too many dogs considering the lack of good loot. To improve, reverse their spawns and make them spawn in the wild and not near what was once human civilisation to encourage players not to wander off.\n• The melee combat is for one, dubious. It seems that the hit boxes on enemies and dogs in particular are very tiny, and in order for you to deal some damage, you need to be within licking range, fair enough for man to man combat, but when it comes to dogs, it's a big no no when you think about how many you will have to kill.\n• The heat system is too unforgiving. Staying inside with a jacket on still lowers your temperature, and once it gets to roughly 25 degress ᶜᶦᵗᵃᵗᶦᵒᶰ ᶰᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ your health starts to slowly decrease. The second part I don't have a problem with, but the only way to get your temperature is to create a fire which requires an axe to get firewood, lighter fluid (I think?) and a lighter. The chance of finding everything for that is pretty slim\n• Similar to the heat system, the health system is VERY unforgiving. Running into dogs and surviving will probably take your health down the the 'Wounded' or 'Severely Wounded' stage. The only way to get your health back up is to take medicine of some description which is recognised by a generic 'Bottle o' Peels' and those pills are.. Yes you guessed it.. Extremely Rare. To improve this, they should allow your health to regenerate slowly as long as your other basic needs are satisfied.\n• There isn't a full tutorial for noobs who have no clue what they're doing. Some people who have played a lot of survival games take to it very quickly, but they will soon come to a halt somewhere. For instance, the weapon reloading system in itself is quite complicated at first, but you can get the hang of it. What annoyed me is how some of the guns were in Russian meaning you couldn't understand what they were called and look up their calibre on Wikipedia. Adjacent to the name of the gun, the type of ammo should be displayed so you know exactly what ammo to look out for.\n• One teeny tiny point is that my guns seem to not fire exactly when I need them to, and ammo doesn't seem to stack very effectively sometimes. This is more of a minor bug than a problem.\n• When you die, sometimes there will be a spectator mode in which you can see everyone meaning if you know one area well, you can track them down if you're lucky enough. Fair enough if you're on other side of the map, but if you're in the spawn then it can become a problem rather quickly. No neeed to explain that one ;-)\n• The final point isn't too much of a problem, but the servers seem to sort depending on how many people are actually in them, meaning you can't join a game that your friend has created if it's just them in it. And no, there's no option to join via Steam. This isn't much of a problem but sometimes it's nicer just to have a game with your friends are gear up before venturing into the big, bandity world.\n\nEDITS:\n• The guns don't fire because they either 'need oil' or 'need repair' (or broken if heavily used but not maintained)\n\nThese are all of the points I have collected so far, and don't be discouraged by the sheer amount of negative comments I have hopefully successfully conveyed. There are far many more good points such as atmosphere and looting system that I could've writtne about, but they're so small individually that they aren't worth it, they do however create a massive difference when put together in an online game.\n\nOverall I definitely recommend this to people who enjoy survival games and are looking to support the developers in order for them to improve this already outstanding game. Dean 'Rocket' Hall can shove that so called effort he has been putting into the DayZ mod up his buttocks and salute these developers who are much closer to the community.\n\nIf you wish to ask me any questions about the game, feel free to message me on Steam, I'm not the most experienced person but i'll try my best to answer any questions\n\n-Jacob :)","May 5, 2015","true","52.1"," 236 of 247 people (96%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","96","236","247","14","5"

This is visually appaling, and combined with the horrible layout of the new maps, it is just disgusting.\n\nOn top of all of this, the number of servers and players has decreased dramatically. At any given time, there are only 3 servers online, each with 5 people or less on it. This is because now they made strictly russian servers, and strictly english, and one other language. This was a horrible move by developers, and this ruined their american player base. It also removed a fun element from the game\n\nThis game went from a solid 4/5 to, at best, a 2/5.

First of which is the dehydration mechanic.  For the rarity of finding water the dehydration bar drains much too fast.  It either needs to drain slower or more water/juice/soup needs to be spawned in the game.\nThe second major problem is the wolves.  Often times I spawn in looking for loot in a building only for a wolf to run in and start attacking me.  If I don't have a weapon there isn't much I can do to defend myself as the character runs out of stamina too quickly and the wolf can easily kill you.  Also the wolves can find you much too easily often I'll be on the second floor of a building and wolves will come from miles away outside, run into the building, climb up the stairs and run into my room.  Again if I haven't found a weapon by that point suicide is the best option because I have no way of getting away.\nAlso the hit detection seems pretty off, many times I've been in a firefight with someone and shoot them multiple times at close range with a shotgun only for them to switch to an axe and hit me once or twice with it and kill me.\nOverall this game is solid for the price.  I have had many fun moments in intense firefights; frantically trying to loot the bodies of the players I has just slain.  Unfortunately these moments are too far and few inbetween and some of the mechanics are so game breaking that I cannot recommend this game until they are addressed.","August 8, 2015","false","12.5"," 246 of 296 people (83%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","83","246","296","19","11"

Played just over 6 hours I think, and Im calling it a day. In those hours, I played on the busiest servers, about 8-9 players, and I only ever met one person.  We stood opposite each other, at around 20ft distance, unloaded our guns on each other, and neither of us took any hits!?  I have shot many a charging wolf before you say it is my aim :P\nThe wolves are a relentless pain, and sometimes you will be spawned next to some, which means you have to run and hope for the best, as you have no ability to punch or kick these hungry little cretins.\nLoot is scarce, you'll find yourself sprinting from building to building, searching endless empty cupboards and drawers, before you starve or dehydrate. If your lucky enough to find these resources, you'll probably freeze to death, as this is another element to contend with, and being fully clothed in winter gear and standing in a house is apparently not enough.\nTheres loads of bugs, screen goes black whilst the sound continues, getting stuck in floors etc, but I expected these to be fair.\nIf this game was free, it might be worth a couple of hours of your time, if you have the patience of a saint.

When I first picked this up it was pretty damn good, needed a lot of work but it was good, WAS. The recent transition into "Beta" had royally buggered this game. The map is too empty.\n\nI spawned at a petrol station and spend over 10 minutes walking along a straight road and found nothing. After I suicided I found a "TT" pistol, it took 1911 mags, I found some ammo and another empty mag and tried to load it, nada. I then unloaded the mag that I had in my gun to find it had .357 ammo, went to put it back into the clip, nada. I then had no usable ammo.\n\nI went to explore after this point and found that the "Jumping" sound effect was so much louder than the others that I nearly fell off my chair in fright. The effect of running on grass makes your character sound like he's running over shrapnel or bullet casing.\n\nTL;DR - The recent "update" has totally ♥♥♥♥ed the game, if I'd written this a few months ago it would have been a totally different review. With that in mind: keep an eye on this game if interested. The Devs have taken some wrong turns BUT the game WAS good so there's no reason it can't be good again, given time and a new approach to "updates".","August 30, 2015","false","16.7"," 71 of 82 people (87%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","87","71","82","13","0"

As soon as me and my friends load up we both started looting and met up very fast, in fact it is really easy to find friends because from what I notice you spawn close to each other at the start. But after that you can then make your way into the wild ^_^.      When I got on I found a shotgun with no ammo, so  I then started to walk around for more loot and bumped into anther player. He had an axe while I had a Shottie with no ammo even tho unknowingly he dropped his axe and begged bot to be shot. And so I took is axe and ran off.     The later on I met another guy in a small cabin and started talking to him, but suddenly 3 Russians came up and started shooting at our cabin.  My new companion said ''hey this is the end'', lets us run out there and Shout! Allu Akbar'' And so we did and managed to escape until I died from my wounds. My friend who bought the game with me in the first place met a guy and asked if he wanted to be friends, the new guy said '' Yes'' And so I and my 2 friends made are way to the construction site only to find a pile of guns from dead players in the woods on the way there. We then hunkered down in the construction site and started make a fire till I heard foot steps out side. We told them to drop there weapons after I seen them through a window upstairs, but of course they shot at us and we fought back, and I'm telling you now the way the game handles when it comes to PvP shooting feels so good and I actually thought I was In a big firefight, we were calling out info and places while hold up in the building and man is was good.

I have been playing this game since early development and have seen the many "improvements" that have been made by developers. However, there is one thing that I need to address, one thing that really upsets me about the recent update you made (2 months ago) with starting off each user in a Prison.\n\nTake into consideration the element of simplicity, prior to when you implemented the Prison into the game, the game was simple, me and my friend had a favored area that had a church, several small houses, a wood factory and what looked to be a temple. Roaming around this area, meeting newcomers and inviting them into our journeys or killing them on the spot was the thing that made this game great. But you completely removed that, and it hasn't been the same since.\n\nI've played this game alot. Really, alot. And I have tried to love the whole Prison concept. Don't get me wrong, I thought, originally, it was great. Although it was a bit confusing to comprehend why you're a prison inmate who woke up with a major headache with a sudden post apocalypse on his hands, but believe me, I tried to enjoy it.\n\nBut when I came to the realization that you removed the one area that I loved so much, my love for the game itself slowly disintegrated. This area was the common area for everyone to meet up and it was easy to navigate around, why remove it?\n\nThe simplistic nature of the game was ruined, you haven't made any changes to this game in months and a game with such potential is slowly dying off me.\n\nYou can also tell that this is slowly dying off others too, months back it was hitting online numbers of 470 to 600 and more, but now you'd be lucky if there were over 50 users online. This update and lack of improvements is evident now, surely.\n\nPlease listen to one of your most loyal players, please bring back that area, and please get rid of the Prison or something. It really doesn't make sense.\n\nI highly recommend this game, I think that it has potential as I said, if the developers update it regularly and listen to its consumers. I want you to fix this.

I am also really loving the way you search for loot (actually open drawers and cabinets to look inside it for loot). They also have a good focus on PvE in terms of body temperature and wildlife. I believe the player base is pretty dead, but I kind of like it as it feels realistically barren. Hoping to run into someone at some point however.

HELL NO they create an ENTIRELY NEW GAME that runs like crap because the whole map is covered with flowers that move in the wind, and devs obviously still havn't figure out how occlusion works. This version goes over like a lead baloon and in response devs DELETE THE ENTIRE FORUM! then they "re-release" the old version, which still works ok but they don't fix the bugs that people have known about for ever.\n\nCurrent (alpha?) version: Ok never mind that the devs don't know what way the greek alphabet goes ( beta comes after alpha) After almost a year of no communication at all with their community the devs announce the release of an ENTIRELY NEW GAME. Do they return to the best working most popular version of the game and fix teh known issues? HELL NO they release 3 tiny unfinished "sectors" and call it a game. Then they drop off the face of the earth for 2 months.. that brings us here. The game randomly bans people that can play it, doesnt' let many people play at all, and quickly gets old after you take an hour to explore everything that you can, get mauled by the packs of OP dogs, die from lack of water when surrounded by snow, or can't find any loot because other players have walled off all the buildings in protest (thats right you can build walls, but can't destroy them leading to the landscape being littered with imersion breaking impossible structures and sky grafitti. There is NO SUPPORT AT ALL for anyone who has an issue, and since it is EA you can not get a refund.\n\nOh yeah.. and all the while the devs are trying to get ANOTHER game with the SAME ASSETS green lit on steam.. for once steam makes the right choice and tells them "um how about you guys finish the game you started first?"\n\nI thought this was a good game, but now it seems like a cash grab with asset flip every few months to make it seem like its still being worked on.\n\nThis game has nothing but potential.. if only there was someone there to develop it.","May 9","false","96.5"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","34","38","2","0"

He turns around slowly, unsure of what was happening as if he was a newborn. He falls on the ground and drops no items\n\nI wander around the trainyard some more and I see a wolf approaching me, (which sounds oddly like a puppy rather than a wolf) I kill it with my axe and it drops a hunk of raw meat\n\nEventually I begin to get hungry, and I choose to eat the raw meat as there is nothing else around. My ears are suddenly assaulted with this extremely loud stock chomping sound effect, and then I am full\n\nI wander around the trainyard even more, still finding nothing. Then I hear my character say "my mouth is dry, I need something to drink". Unfortunately there is no source of water anywhere nearby, so I keep moving\n\nMy character is now literally saying "I'm thirsty" "My mouth is dry" and "Damn I really need something to drink" about every 2 seconds\n\nI try and look for water, but I find none, and now my character begins including the phrase "Damn I'm hungry" into his continuous 2 second mantra of complaining that he is thirsty\n\nAbout 5 minutes later I find a building in another town and I run in looking for something to make my character shut the ♥♥♥♥ up\n\nI hear talking and a flashlight and out of pure desperation run to it hoping to kill him and take his food and water\n\nI encounter a group of 3 fully geared men and they gun me down.

If you hear a wolf howling, it would scare you ingame, and the stress would rise..\nYou hear footsteps? Well, time take a deep breath, and prepare yourself..\nGunshots? RUN, or face courage yourself...\nThat way, the more stress you have, the more that your hands would shake..\nHow do you fix you stress?\nSimple, Lighter + cigarettes for the nerves, or a little vodka.\nOr, if you ain't a smoker/drinker, try to face your fears/stress, so that your used of your dangerous, that the word ''Stress'' doesn't mean nothing to you anymore.\n\n4 -> You guys need to implement a ''Suggestions'' Board on your steam game's forum, so that people would suggest things for you, so that the game would be well received for us all...\nEveryone loves to have their ideas posted, and replied by the game developers.\n\nFor now, this would be great addictions for the game, and I hope that the developers would consider my suggestions, along with others suggestions from the community.\n\nI hope, that in the future, I could add even more suggestions, a great hug/kiss for the developers, and I hope that you could construct a FABULOUS game!\n\n7/10 for a great early alpha game\n\nCheers <3","April 25, 2015","true","8.8"," 49 of 64 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","49","64","4","4"

Lost everything when I had to log out...bummer, had good loot...\n2. Mouse wheel changes between melee weapon and ranged weapon\n3. G key drops equipped weapon so you can drop revolver you found in drawer and pick up auto pistol you found in another drawer.\n4. double right click on ammo in inventory and click on matching ammo in inventory to combine.\n5. double right click on ammo in inventory and click on matching magazine in inventory to load magazine\n6. so far have not figured out how to put magazine into equiped pistol (maybe dont have correct magazine for the pistol)\n7. Do not know how to load rounds into revolver (maybe dont have correct ammo for revolver) R key should be reload, but with no control mapping layout hard to determine and with hitting random keys on the keyboard and no message coming up (wrong ammo for type of weapon equipped) hard to tell.\n8. Finding a backpack increases your inventory. YAY!\n9. Found gasoline/lighter fluid with second character\n10. Found lighter with third character\n11. Died by wolf with first character as I could not hit it with my barefists, respawn gave me a baseball bat to restart. Hitting random keys to figure out what key was reload logged me out of my character and sent me back to log in menu where I lost my whole inventory and had to start over (suck!) New character starter with baseball bat. Killed wolf, got meat. Cant cook meat...\n12. Found a map!!! shows the area, need to take a screen shot and print it out.\n13. Found lots of weapons, lots of food, lots drinks, cant carry them all, get hungry fast, get thirsty fast, cant find a place to rest...cant find a place to save so I dont lose everything when I log out, dont know how to log out without losing everything...cant use beds (or have not found a bed that is usable) found apartment buildings with doors that close, that are safe from elements and wildlife, but can not sit on chairs/sofas or sleep in beds.\n\nI recommend the game for the price, early access, but the game does need a booklet or a screen that covers keyboard commands and maybe a bit of a walkthrough.\n\n***just played after the patch***\nOkay, after patch, either I found the correct ammo or R now works to reload and I have correct ammo for the revolver, still dont have an automatic and magazines to check on that aspect yet. Getting cold too fast and this time around not finding any coats, however i did find an axe and hammer and started playing around with building a structure, then someone killed me, respawned and only found an axe so cant play around with the building aspect of the game anymore, but it is kind of fun. gonna check out the help system that was just implemented in the menu and see what that is all about.","April 17, 2015","true","12.0"," 38 of 46 people (83%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","83","38","46","6","0"

I'm not convinced the developer will support the game into a "finished" state; it may very well go the route of other Early Access survival games, and be interesting + full of potential but ultimately never achieve what it should've, and eventually be abandoned or have development slow to a crawl with tons of bugs a la The WarZ or a half-dozen other games in the genre. The developer stating:\n\n“Our game is almost in a finished state...\n\n“The game will stay in Early Access until we have a final polished version of it for PC, Mac and Linux. Probably a six months of polishing with the community feedback.”\n\nworries me the most. In my mind, there's no way that's achievable. If their plan is to push it out the door within 6 months, then the game will certainly have issues.\n\nWith that said, it's fun and promising, and for $5.50 CAD, it's worth a shot.\n\nMy first spawn/life:\n\nWithin 30 seconds of spawning I ran into a British guy named Tim clearing out a couple buildings. I told him over voice chat that I had just spawned and was new to the game. He gave me a backpack and some other stuff, and asked if I wanted to group up. I was like sure, so off we went looting buildings and ♥♥♥♥. I found a rifle, and Tim happened to have some ammo for it, so he gave it to me.\n\nEventually he afks for a sec or something, but while he's gone I realize I'm critically dehydrated, so I leave him in search of water. About 5 minutes later quite some distance away from where I left him, I overheard two people talking - one of them was Tim, and the other some random guy. They had just run into each other, and while they were being cautious neither was KoSing. So I'm still desperate for water, so I take aim from some shrubbery at the random guy, and headshot him. Tim starts freaking out, cuz he doesn't realize it's me, until I tell him on voice coms. then we looted the guy's corpse, and I got the water I needed.\n\nSo we went off again clearing buildings. I went into one, got shot once in the back as I stepped through a doorway, spun around and got 1 shot off, but then got hit again and died. Tim went in to investigate, and he swiftly got domed as well.\n\n\nInitial impressions:\n\nThe game is still painfully early on, but it shows potential. On the Steam Early Access store page, they say they're aiming at full release within six months. This is absolutely not a reasonable goal, considering how glaring some of the issues are. The game needs a LOT of work and polish, but I'm having fun despite the issues.\n\nSome of the problems I ran into:\nThe UI is ♥♥♥♥. total crap. There's no in-game settings screen. You set your graphics options pre-launch ranging from Fastest to Fantastic, with no detailed options at all. No volume sliders or anything. I think you can rebind some keys out of game, but again not ingame, and as far as I can tell it's quite limited (no hold ADS or crouch, just toggle, etc.). The inventory system is unintuitive and filled with typos and Engrish (or whatever the Russian equivalent of that is). No way to change mouse sensitivity. That's a big one for me. No way to turn off headbob, which I really, really hate.\n\nIt's kinda buggy sometimes. If your inventory is 1 spot from full and you try to pick up two items in quick succession, you pick up the first and instead of being unable to pick up the second, it just vanishes into the ether. I lost a couple guns this way. As far as I can tell, you can hold 3 weapons at a time, but you can only access 2 of them. Like, you literally can't swap to the third. You can't choose which two. You have to drop one of them to use the third. This might just be an issue with pistols, not sure yet.\n\nEngrish, lack of options, lack of accessibility. No user list to see who's currently in a server, only a total number count. No friends list or social options at all. When you're mildly thirsty, it says LowThristy (yes, that's thristy not thirsty).\n\nConfusing/unexplained items. Lots of items that combine with each other, but there's no indication of what combines with what or what an item actually does. For instance, radio/walkie talkie - initially had no battery. I found a battery and combined the two. Now the radio has a battery. Still not a clue how to use it or what its actual ingame function is. Lots of items that I had no idea wtf they were or what they did. There are different drinks/foods in the game, and they seem to have a varying amount of uses/amount of hunger/thirst replenished, but those numbers aren't indicated ingame. There are helmets and different types of clothing (and I think maybe armor too) but as far as I can tell they didn't say what they really did in terms of warmth or protection. Perhaps they're just cosmetic, but idk.\n\nSpeaking of, anything "on" you and not in your bag (clothes, helmet, hat, guns, bat, axe, etc.) doesn't show up on your inventory to interact with. It shows up on a playermodel that's open when your inventory is, but as far as I can tell you can't actually change stuff - or maybe you can and the interface is so poor I just couldn't figure it out. For example, if you pick up a shirt you automatically put it on. afaik, you can't drop that shirt on the ground unless you pick up another shirt (which is again, automatically put on and your current one drops.)\n\nUnexplained game mechanics; I died of hypothermia. I had a lighter and gasoline on me, tried combining the two, couldn't figure out how to make a fire. Maybe I need wood or something as well, but I didn't find any of that. I didn't know what to look for. oh, and when I died - you get a 60 second respawn timer, and during that time you can't do anything. You can't open the menu to quit the game, even.\n\nDespite these types of gripes, I still had fun playing it. I've put a couple hours into it so far, and I'm definitely going to play more. I'm looking forward to some of the kinks getting sorted out. I know I've focused a lot more on the negative than the positive, but it really is quite entertaining. and at the pricepoint, even if it were completely terrible it wouldn't be a huge deal.\n\nAs an Early Access game, I'm having fun with it knowing what it is, and I'm looking forward to the game being made better. At the pricepoint, with those things in mind, it's worth it. However, if this is approximately what the game launches as, with all the bugs and issues it currently has - then I'd say steer clear.","April 26, 2015","true","3.6"," 47 of 63 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","47","63","3","3"

Although the graphics may not look as advanced as those titles i just referenced, you get past the fact that they are not that great. Remember this is an alpha. With that being said, alphas are meant to be tested and improved, therefore if you decide to buy this game dont expect everything to work how you would like it yet.

The Russians who play this game kill you pretty much no matter what you do, even if you just spawned. Also please dont press the cheater button out of anger, a lot of people are getting banned when they didn't do anything.

The game is capped at 60fps from what i see and i don't know if they have plans to change that. This game also has a lot already developed into it like a variety of cars (cough cough dayz cough cough) and a lot of weapons, the problem though is it's really hard to find a gun atm because of people camping the places they spawn in giving them an unfair advantage. The spawns in this game should be different and you should spawn randomly on the map rather than spawning in the same area you died in, this would get rid of spawn killing. I hope if this game gets more popular they will add US Servers because 70% of the time you will find russian people and can't understand them so they KOS.

That is also another thing, you always spawn in the same general area, what I've come to call "freshspawn valley" where basically the game starts.  You move from area to area looting houses making it as far across the map until you die, if a player doesn't get you, its pretty much guerenteed a silent wolf, the cold, or accidently falling off a building will.  Back to the trailer thing, I haven't found many weapons beyond a 1911, 2 revolvers (which use the same ammo pretty sure there is no dmg diff), and a shot gun.  I've found ammo for other guns but I have searched and searched to find nothing, no mosins, no assault rifles, just double barrel shot guns, I haven't even seen an assault rifle mag..\n\nBut that is just a warning about what you see in the trailer is not what you will be buying, the game is still entertaining and its very fun to explore and loot.  There is a good voip system so you can talk to people, idk how many english speaking players there are though because every person I come across speaks russian and that language barrier is impossible to overcome and it normally ends with someone dying.\n\nWith the way the melee hit detection currently is and the glitches I've found in the game I'd have to give it a 6/10 in this early access state, not to say that rating won't go up, I hope the devs work hard to improve this game and make it the great game it should be.","April 17, 2015","true","20.6"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","20","25","0","3"

You manage to pick the locks out of the prison and make it to a trainyard where you can find some backpacks and other items on the shelves and a house. You head up over the bridge to find a helicopter and maybe some ammo for a gun in it, all this while being chased by annoying wolves. You make it into an area where the primary building is a school, now you might be thinking 'Oh a school, probably some pencils and notebooks".. WRONG, in there you will find the most russian kids you could ever find that are geared with AK-47's, shotguns and all they do is sit in the rooms and wait for people to come inside and that's when they strike. That is how my day went in this game, but there are other areas as seen on the map in the game, I havent explored those yet though. The game is not bad, far from bad, the game is acctually enjoyable and has a lot of good attributes to it. Anyways, the game is a foundation for what can be an amazing post-apocalypse/nuclear aftermath kind of game.

After several, SEVERAL hours I have put into the free version, I decided to buy the actual release.  If you haven't played any version of this game, I reccomend you to atleast try it. For $4.99, it is really cheap for a game now-a-days.  Especially for the survival genre. It may be difficult at first for some becuase of NO tutorial or any guaidance at all, but once youu get the hang of it and no what to do, this game can be a blast! From the free version before actual release to now, they have done quite a bit of stuff. At the moment, I would give this game a 7/10 becuase there isn't really that much to do right now but that should change as the developement goes on.

I carried on playing for over 2 hours and man was i impressed, The gun play is really good, better than dayz in my opinion, the game runs good however they could fix the issue with the rain because when it rains i get reduced fps, no zombies which is great, i am really tired of seeing survival games with zombies. The kind of threat now is wolves and trust me they are really annoying(ps their ai isn't too great). The game can be buggy like if you travel to a new zone it can crash your game, there can be graphical bugs, however they rarely happen to me however some people have experienced e.g my friend.

I know it's been rough for me and I've posted my share of complaints but, I do feel the devs are working on the issues at hand and are trying their best to fix everything. The feedback they've been getting from everyone has more than likely, been of great help. The posts about glitching, loot finding, placement of this and that and about all the hackers in game. This is being taken care of or, so they say. However, they have mentioned several times that, they know who all is hacking and it will be fixed and to add, all those that are hacking, will be permanantly banned from all, S:PAN servers once the final released is ready.\n\nMy most positive impression about the game is, it's definately running smooth. I've not had many games that run as smooth as this one does, even more-so, with an 159ms ping. No matter what server I'm playing on, the game runs great. Nothing concerning issues I've had with it are, per the servers the game is running on. They're up, 24/7 and have never crashed, that I know of? Switching from server to server is not an issue at all. Alt/F4 out, switch server and bingo, you're there.\n\nI'm not sure if this is true wth everyone though and I play it with a 64bit system, not a 32bit system. I also don't know if that has anything to do with it or, not? If I was having any actual connection issues with the game, I'd of quit playing it a long time ago and in my games profile, it would probably show you less than 30mins played.\n\nIt's an Old School type of game play configuration and perfect for PC/M & KB players.\n\nIs it worth the $5-6? Yes, even more-so at this stage. The devs have already stated that, everyone playing it now, will get the completed, full version at this price and if not, the rest will have to pay the full price for the game once, it's released.\n\nSo, if you got $5 to spare and want to help track down hackers, kill hackers and/or, all these frkn wolves/bears in the game, get it and when the final is ready, prepare to gank or, get ganked.\n\nAs an added note: This game is playable on XP for those of you who still use them for lower end games.\n\n.\n\nIt's not a bad game and I have over 200 hours into it. I plan to have more.\n\n===============================\n\nEdit: It is not advisable to play this game on XP. A friend got it and it really messed up his system. He was getting very low fps in game and couldn't even create/join a server. He tried changing screen reso and it messed up the system once he left the game. Now, he can't return his screen back to it's normal scale.\n\nIf you have a beefed up system with a version of XP then, it may work.","June 15, 2015","true","302.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","2"

I would write an entire speech about this game but a short what they can add in my opinion would be best.\nWhat the developers could add to this game is chests and beds!! You can build a lovly base with nice rooms but there is no point. You can't sleep there and you can't store your items anywhere forcing you to take the bare essentials.\nAnother thing the developers could add to this game is the ability to transfer your guns into your inventory. If this was implemented the game would be a whole lot better then it already is.\nThese are just afew things i thought the developers could have added to make this game Better. One last thing, Remove the Esc Key Log. I use the Esc key to exit my inventory with every game and when I do it with this game it goes back to the main menu. Remove that Please it's very frustrating when I do it.\nI hope this review was helpful and Thanks for reading!","June 3, 2015","true","9.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Game is fun, but from my experience it is also posessed by a ghost.  At first the game seems small but there are actually many maps.  Me and my friend were traveling from map to map finding many things, and doing well.  We eventually came to a point were we were scarce of food and water.  We decided to shoot eachother with our guns to end the misery, but we searched around a little more to see if there was hope left.  Btw, we were at a point were we saw no players. We eventually found a crashed plane and we deicde to search it. The dark travel screen came up that you get when you travel from map to map.  Me and my friend were quickly horrified as we enetered the area the plane seemed to turn into  a dark underground vault, where it was very creepy, it was like nothing else in the game.  Me and my friend were confused and scared so we exited the area and reneted.  On the second time we entered we found a man who was not there standingf there before, we shot him.  We exited again and went back in for the third time.  I quickly realised something was wrong as my friend was there a second ago, but now he wasnt.  We talked over skype about what was happeneing.  While i roamed the creepy room all of  a sudden in a blink of an eye i was in another room.  This room was creepy and dark and the floor was filled a ft. high with water.  What made the experience worse was i wasnt  alone in this new room, the same man we shot before was in the room was there too, so i bolted int a big room in the middle and ran into some sort of closet and hid. I then died of freezing to death and lost all my stuff including my gas mask,rifle,shot gun, and all my cool clothes.  While i was waiting to respawn, i saw the water splash next to my dead body, as i respawn i was scared to find my slef spawn in the dark water room again.  I quit scared out of my mind.  My friend died in the other dark room but trace back to his dead body.  i hope this was just a glitch because now im stuck in a dark room forever with a ghost.\n\n10/10 would play crapping myself at 3:00 in the morning simulator again.\n\nAll in all the game has its fun moments, but  can the game creators respond and tell me if the "water" room is supposed to be there.\n\nDay 1:I manned up and searched the water room.  It is literally the maze of hell.  I am stuck wandering the maze.  Pls send more russians with shotguns for backup.\n\nDay 2: I heard breathing, i got paranoid but it was my own...few.\n\nDay 3: I am currently going to keep writing logs until im saved, if you buy this, search for the crashed airline plane and help.\n\nBtw these arent actually days these are really just minutes.\n\nDay 4: I found an elevator! Im saved thank god!  But still, something was down there with me...But yay im out","November 22, 2015","true","17.0"," 32 of 55 people (58%) found this review helpful 41 people found this review funny","58","32","55","41","0"

However there is a downside to this game. Everyone who I have come across has CS aim. Don't know what CS aim is? No matter, the following paragraph will explain. After the first paragraph, I will talk about the game and a potential scenario you may find yourself in.\n\nWhat is CS aim?\nCS aim is referred to as Counter Strike aim, yes the game we all know and love. Basically everyone who shoots at you is probably a Global Elite; I say this because every battle I have been involved in always ends up with me being outplayed beyond, literally. I may be sitting in a bush (lots of foliage around me, basically impossible to see me) and people will locate my exact coordinate and fire at me, whenever I move, they will keep shooting without missing. So in conclusion CS aim is just the theory of someone never missing a shot no matter the situation.\n\nThe Game\nThe game overall is actually quite fun, you will find yourself with a gun (eventually) and some ammo, and when you have this almost instantly you will hear footsteps, loud footsteps. Your heart will race and you will try to outsmart whoever this is, but always remember my theory, CS aim. You use your knowledge of the CS aim philosophy, so you camp it out a bit waiting for the person to appear before you, and when they do, you shoot, only to find out you didn't load the gun. The person is now identified as a white male, Russian ex Spetsnaz Praposhchik. The man drops to the ground and lights you up within a heartbeat...

Honestly this game is worth every penny. It could even be put up against DayZ.\n\nOne thing I wish I knew before buying this game is that it is Linear. You work your way through a map of multiple areas. Each new area having a different enviornment and different loot. Some areas will be filled with weapons and ammo. While others are filled with Food and Water. Some areas can be unforgiving lacking in food or weapons to defend yourself.\n\nLike any survival game it's always good to have a friend with you. So i'd recommed you grab a buddy and explore this world. Plus for this game being so under priced why not.\n\nIn summary this game is worth trying.A great introduction into the survival game genre without dropping a $30 price tag. It's built quite well and I did not run in to any serious glitches.","July 9, 2015","true","6.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

What kind of person makes a game without a very simple, very basic options menu? I am not talking about changing keys, graphic details and such. JUST BASIC OPTIONS LIKE VOLUME - that's too much to ask? Seriously?\n\nAnyways, so after i lowered the volume via Windows my friend and I started playing. I hope you can see that the word "together" is missing, because there is pretty much no way to play together at the start, since you have no idea where you spawn. You don't even know where you are after you spawn since there is no map or anything like it. Let's put that aside...\n\nSo i spawned in some forest-ish place, nothing around, all by my lonesome. Walked around a bit and found a house, yay.. wait why is that guy with the gas mask.. no man, please.. no .. don't... Uagh.\n\nPRO: When you are dead - which you will be - you can skip through the players on the server and see what they are doing - awesome feature, i am sure no one will ever abuse that, ever. ever.\n\nAnyways, so I respawned and tried my luck one more time...\nOh look, a cabin.

So i was walking to the next house when suddently .. "a wolf, oh cool!

Not to annoy you, and not to be ignored forever.\n+Lots of loot, alive combat (magazines, rounds, weapon conditions)\n+ Very nice post-apocalyptic enviroment.\n\nCONS:\n-Full of russians.

Like, you cant have a base YET.\n-NPC enemies are buggy for the moment.\n-Weapons condition might be changing too frequently.\n-Instad of one-open-world there are these 'zones' that you pass.

I played the game several hours now and the more i play, the less fun it makes. But i will make a pro/ contra list, so see for yourself.\n\nPro:\n\n-For an Early Alpha Version it works pretty well. Stable ingame, sometimes hanging up upon switching between parts of the map, but all in all pretty smooth\n-5 Euro is really cheap, so if you dont like it, you dont waste much money\n\nThats it for the real pros...\n\nContra:\n\nEnvironment:\n\n- Snow everwhere...exept for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ marsh...else snow, snow, snow\n- the same 5 houses, with the exact same inventory everywhere, exept for a school, a church and an industiral complex\n- only 2 npc enemies, wolves and bears randomly spawning, even right after start where you just run for your life\n- a really bad and small inventory...if you arent lucky to get a bag sometime, you are just running around with 8 slots...gg\n- if you pick up a handgun and an axe, you can switch between them...then you pick up an shotgun and can switch between axe and shotgun, but to choose your handgun you have to drop axe or shotgun...and if you want to carry axe and hammer, to build something, you cant carry a big gun to defend yourself..gg\n- First half of the game is farming food n weapons in the first 2 villages...farm them, switch server to reset the villages and the loot, farm again.\nThen you can either go through an endless pretty empty marsh, swimming through icewater, so make a fire every 5 metre, or get 2 hit killed by a bear.\nOr you got lucky and get fuel for an engine in a bunker to use an elevator to get through...what will happen like 1 of 1000 times.\n\nBUT...you will rarely get that far. You waste an hour looting houses, just to get shot by anyone spotting you.\nI dont know what kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ play this game, but they dont get the survival part...working together or so...nah...kill anything moving, to steal his loot.\nYou could beg for mercy, but 95% of the players are russians who dont speak english and even if they understand you, they dont give a ♥♥♥♥.\n\nSo its just, loot, die, restart at 0....again and again and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥IT AGAIN.\n\n\nSo better spend 20 Euro more for a better survival game, like the forest.\n\n\n\nUpdate:\n\nAnother great job...now they added an prison as starlocation....so you waste 10 minutes running through an empty building with 5000 doors, finding no loot at all...at least nothing useful, like ammo for the imaginary gun you received yet or a portable radio without batteries.\n\nAnd after you managed to get out there, some russian ret.ards just sit outside waiting for some unarmed guy to show up, just to instantly kill you.\n\nGood Job, now the game is completly unplayable, since you always! (yes i tried it on 13 servers now, everytime, killed after prison) die by those no life inc.est bas.♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nI want my money back! Now!","June 3, 2015","false","8.6"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","1"

They are what they are. This is what I hated the most. Also if you have an axe, hammer, or whatever you can't use your pistol unless you drop it. You can only switch between your primary and melee weapon if you have a melee weapon. If you have no melee weapon you are free to use primary and secondary weapons, but for whatever reason melee weapon takes over for your secondary weapon.\n\nOther players are lagging all over the place which makes it very hard to kill hostile players warping all over around me... I've killed 2 players in 2 hours. Could have killed a 3rd... Shot him in the face twice with a shotgun then I think he quit. All you have to do is hit ESC to exit a server instantly. Easy to combat dodge and Server hop for loot. The only thing that takes a minute is respawning after a death which makes you wait 1 minute. So I can combat dodge and server hop easily for loot but I can't respawn instantly. Makes so much sense! Also I can see where all the other players are on the server while I'm dead! GHOSTING ANYONE!? Anyway...\n\nI've only been killed by wolves or freezing to death... The community can't seem to aim or I'm just as laggy for them as they are for me. So back to freezing. You need an axe to get the wood, lighter fluid to put on the wood, and a lighter. Most lighters have 6% fluid in them that I have found and that is not enough to light the wood. I will usually have wood and lighter fluid and no lighter or i have a lighter and lighter fluid and can't find an axe and I freeze to death.\n\nThe community is lame and annoying in VOIP... You can look at bushes with your crosshair to see if a person's name shows up so you know if someone is trying to hide where you can't see.\n\nI like the inventory system. All items take up 1 slot, you start out with 8 and a backpack only adds another 8 slots for a total of 16 slots. Meds are really hard to find and you can't combine anything together except for ammo. So I will have a lighter, lighter fluid, wood, 2 cans of food, can opener, 2 or 3 bottles of water, primary and secondary ammo, all the meds i can find, and still have room for more. You can't put weapons in your backpack for a buddy like in DayZ, but whatever...\n\nThere is a map but no compass in game, but the map shows your general location. It's a small location compared to other survival games.\n\nOverall the game is just alright. I don't understand this mostly positive score. These people must have only played games in the 90s because this game has about that level of detail. The gameplay feels more modern but needs a lot more work. I've never played Rust, but I'm going to go ahead and recommend a game I've never played for an extra $15 cause this is the internet you all do whatever someone tells you to do on the internet.\n\nRESPECT MAH AUTHORITEH AND BUY RUST CAUSE I SAID TO!!!\n\nOr you can just save your $5 for the next big thing... It's up to you. It's your money and you are in control.","May 31, 2015","false","2.8"," 17 of 31 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","17","31","0","0"

However, I did notice that the game itself is frequently updated so I wouldn't consider them to be Bohemia developers. The name is admittingly cheesy, however "Survival" really does fit in with the game well as there are no zombies or infected beings. Instead you get a cold, rough winter that you have to force yourself to survive in. You get that threat along with the threat over other players in need of gear to live themselves. The concept has been used many times of course, however the game does have potential over all. If the game were to serious up a bit and focus more on the effects of the cold, and hunger, and the threat of death in the mountains, I wouldn't find it that bad. However, this idea has been already taken by Garry Newman's Rust which is a survival game as well that is ALSO in the stages of heavy development. What I see currently is a shell of what this company intends to make. In all honesty I don't know if this game intends to be a quick way to make a buck or a serious attempt at making a serious survival game in the cold. All of the settings seem correct.\n\nThe reason I have changed my support on this game is because I see that it does have a chance of surviving, and if you go and buy it for five quid or dollars, then you are simplying supporting the game itself and maybe that will give it the chance to grow and continue to dev.\n\nThere are plenty of issues obviously, but why not try it out and have an attempt at it.","April 18, 2015","true","1.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I got it in a giveaway.\n\nI'm going to give my First Impressions of this game, if you just want to get a quick glance at what this game offers, skip the first Impression bit, and check out the Pros and Cons.\n\nFirst Impressions I begin in a lit prison cell, i immedietly grab a screw driver and a lighter laying in the cell. I quickly pick the lock, and walk out of the cell, into an almost pitch-black prison... Which had me frightened... Would another character be sneaking about to get a few fresh spawn kills? Well no. I ended up just waltzing about in the dark for ten minutes until I grew tired and looked up what I needed to do. Ah, the torch in the prison cell can be picked up...\nNow since I have a light source, I quickly pick a lock, and jump into a sewer. As I waltz about in there, suddenly lightning flashes, and it begins to rain...\nIn a Sewer, under the Prison...\nI soon manage to find a hole, leading to a loading screen... Taking me out finally into (What I thought hopefully) was the open-world. I waltz'd about for a little while around a trainyard, till I found a backpack. I left and followed a road... Which after five minutes of walking, took me to a loading screen. It was at this point I said ♥♥♥♥! Don't tell me this game has area loading screens! I found myself at what would appear to be a dinky little military outpost. As I would past it, I suddenly am flashed with another loading screen, as I then suddenly load back ALL THE WAY BACK THE TRAINYARD, WHERE I SPAWNED!?!? *sighs*\nMy character starts to complain about being hungry and thirsty... Nonstop. Then he starts complaining about 27.3 C Temperature to be really chilly... WHAT!? Maybe 27.3 F... But 27.3 C is a bit... Warm.\nI FINALLY come across something, a bear. I swing at it a f- Dead.\nW-What!? No!? NO! I have to do that stupid prison opening again!?\n*Flash forward...* Climbing up a mount- Wtf!? I just TELEPORTED BACK AT THE TRAINYARD AGAIN!? WTF!?!?\n*A little while later* How do I eat? How do I drink!? I am clicking left and right, spamming the E button... SPAMMING ALL THE KEYS TO JUST FIGURE OUT HOW TO EAT AND DRINK!!!\nTHIS was where I considered to stop playing.\nI mean... This game is broken. BROKEN. Empty as well. less then 60+ players total, and only 10 being on the most populated server. (Perhaps it would be best to remove a couple servers, and only have like 1 or 2 for the current population as of now.)\n\nPros -Devs just got back to working on this game! Will change the review as development takes shape.\n-Vehicles, including Cars and Helicopters... Apparently. I never did find any.\n-The Graphics aren't that bad, and the game runs pretty smoothly.\nCons -Broken... Just UTTERLY BROKEN. Ex. Spawning back in for me gave me double of all my items...\n-Inv. right now is a mess. (Update) The issues with eating and drinking was a glitch which didn't let me access any of my food or items.\n-No Character Creation\n-Voiced Acted Character... No, I think the characters shouldn't be voice acted. Just let the players do all the talking.\n(Seriously, the character just whines and moans non-stop.)\n-Very LOW playerbase.\n-More a recommendation, perhaps have an option to disable having to go through the long and dull process of the Prison.\n\nConclusion? Survival :Postapocalypse Now is a very EARLY Early Access Game, on the lines of development so far. This is one of those times I wish steam had a So-so option to recommend. The devs show great potential, but right now the game is an utter mess. I'll come check it out again after a couple updates and PRAY it improves. :)","January 19","true","0.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","3"

Poor design in my opinion for a survival game not being able to punch anyone. So new spawns don't have a ♥♥♥♥ chance at anything. Gun/ammo spawns are just as annoying as DAYZ, only without being able to punch you get ♥♥♥♥ed pretty fast. No item quickbar, and can only hold 1 weapon at a time. Very clunky and honestly not even worth $5 yet.","May 17, 2015","false","0.7"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","0"

Russian prison sewers end up in a trainyards? That seems like a bit of an oversight. I had not head or appendages to speak of, and i remember reading in a survival handbook that people can't see you when you are naked, so i did the only logical thing and stripped as naked as i could. I heared gunshots in the distance and decided to investigate.  I found three guys standing over a body, they were all speaking in Russian so i decided to practice some foreign diplomacy. I was halfway through apologizing in advance for my bad Russian, when one of them walked up to me and said "you have seen too much" and shot me in the head with a double barreled shotgun. I respawned in the same trainyard, got chased by screaming Russians, Americans, two wolves, and a bear for about two hours. I saw somebody commit murder suicide, three people die in a row because they thought a ladder was climbable (i think they were the Russians from before), a tractor used as a weapon of mass murder, countless cases of shotgun diplomacy, and a wooden skyscraper. This game is pretty amazing. It has awesome firefights, walkie-talkies, a better community than DayZ, Russians, and for the price of 5.99 USD or 5 Euros it can be yours. I honestly suggest this game to people who have 5.99 and nothing to do with it.","November 13, 2015","true","2.7"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","56","10","18","7","0"

That bear sounded like it was tearing through dimensions. Still better than H1Z1 at launch. Is it worth $5? Im still not sure. But Im going to keep playing it and say yes for now. Kind of. As long as you dont mind that nothing works and if there is one person on a server they have all of the weapons, can find you very fast, and just KOS you.\n\nSeriously, even in Early Access you need to be able to use the items taht you find. Out of all of the spawns Ive played now only one actually allowed me to select an item in my inventory. Allof the other times it was stuck on the same slot. So I couldnt select the food or water that I found to remedy my condition.\n\nPlayer who kept killing me was actually facing the wrong way when he shot and killed me (180 degrees the wrong way) and he was able to float across the whole map.

And I'm a huge fan of the S.t.a.l.k.e.r. series. So, I pick up this game thinking it's at least worth a go.\n\n1. Nothing like rust, got it. Building is shallow and for the most point useless. (no buildable storage to be found, no reason to stay in one place)\n\n2. Dayz built in a game engine built for a game like Dayz.  A military sim turned zombie survival is a great idea, but its clunky and never felt right. Unity Is pretty much built for it. Survival:pn is smooth and feels good when your playing it. But Dayz got the survival right, the scavenging felt right, the wandering felt right. Survival:pn did it better, without zombies.\n\n3. S.t.a.l.k.e.r. feel. Everything feels dark and dirty. Even on a sunny day the game makes you feel depressed (in a good way?) Its not cartoon-ish like fallout, it feels like 50 years after the world stopped spinning like it should.\n\nAll in all, Its worth the $5.\n\nWords for the devs:\nI've died two times by getting stuck (requiring suicide) for every one time i've died otherwise. For $5 I don't expect you to fix every little thing.

The thermal update to use clothes as well as other items is a BIG+ as in to not have to worry about dying so quickly searching for the other rare items to find that would help you with thermal protection. HEALTH !, as in there needs to be a way or more items in areas to keep you from dying from lack of good health including lowering the amount of dogs in an area would greatly help.  Ammo needs to be close by that actually works with the gun and descent amount when you pick up a gun, gas container for vehicles of all types as well as generators or machinery needs to be in more areas, and the constant putting you in the swamp when you are more then two areas ahead of it, needs to be fixed as in not fair to always spawn that far back from where you died, as well as a driveable boat or two needs to be put in the swamp, pre-fabricated traps (e.g. bear trap) and the ability to make a trap (e.g. nature tarp with spiked pit below) needs to be added into the game. Last but not least for now scuba diving gear for fun and finding items under water would be a nice new added feature. In closing thanks for listening to your customers and future customers of this great potential game that I believe will be the best survival and then some type of game in a long time when it's finally completed or completed enough for a final release that I'm sure will have updates even then ;)\n\n\nSincerely  ̿'̿'\̵͇̿̿\з=( ͠° ͟ʖ ͡°)=ε/̵͇̿̿/'̿̿ ̿ ̿ ̿ ̿ ̿\n\na fan of STEAM™\n\n","May 29, 2015","true","19.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

IF you could use them.\n\neven though these things have a big impact on a game like this i would recommend it. give it a couple weeks/months and this game will be amazing.\n\nIf you would like to see gameplay visit my youtube channel \/ \/ \/\n\nXEFFEX Gaming.\n\n\n\n","June 17, 2015","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That bear sounded like it was tearing through dimensions. Still better than H1Z1 at launch. Is it worth $5? Im still not sure. But Im going to keep playing it and say yes for now. Kind of. As long as you dont mind that nothing works and if there is one person on a server they have all of the weapons, can find you very fast, and just KOS you.\n\nSeriously, even in Early Access you need to be able to use the items taht you find. Out of all of the spawns Ive played now only one actually allowed me to select an item in my inventory. Allof the other times it was stuck on the same slot. So I couldnt select the food or water that I found to remedy my condition.\n\nPlayer who kept killing me was actually facing the wrong way when he shot and killed me (180 degrees the wrong way) and he was able to float across the whole map.

This is more casual. I started to play this game, didn't know squat about it. 4 hours in - me and my buddy are armed to the teeth and exploring the map. Making nice camp fires, roasting wolf meat and talking about those nice times when we had a car and were driving around (sadly some glitch took it away). We cleaned our weapons and eat some sardines (not only they feed you, you can satisfy your thirst from them - they are the best), added a nice red dot mod for my assault shotgun and onwards we went.\nIf I had to say it to you the easy way - this is going to be something like DayZ + Rust (but without zombies). You roam around and scavange for resources, but you can chop down the trees, craft items together and make your own little base building.\nWill see how it develops, it was really fun and really interesting for the first 4 hours, will play some more when I get the time.\nIf you have to ask me - at this moment, for 5 euros - depends on what you want. I bought it and I am happy with my purchase.

Myself, and a couple of my friends have experienced this same error and it can be super annoying (especially when playing together).\n\nFor $5 I have had more fun in this game than most $50-60 game. It is surprisingly polished for the price, but at the same time it is obvious there is a lot of room for improvement. I would consider this a much more simplified, fast paced,  version of Rust.

This is more casual. I started to play this game, didn't know squat about it. 4 hours in - me and my buddy are armed to the teeth and exploring the map. Making nice camp fires, roasting wolf meat and talking about those nice times when we had a car and were driving around (sadly some glitch took it away). We cleaned our weapons and eat some sardines (not only they feed you, you can satisfy your thirst from them - they are the best), added a nice red dot mod for my assault shotgun and onwards we went.\nIf I had to say it to you the easy way - this is going to be something like DayZ + Rust (but without zombies). You roam around and scavange for resources, but you can chop down the trees, craft items together and make your own little base building.\nWill see how it develops, it was really fun and really interesting for the first 4 hours, will play some more when I get the time.\nIf you have to ask me - at this moment, for 5 euros - depends on what you want. I bought it and I am happy with my purchase. I am sure that I will sink many many more hours into it.","May 7, 2015","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Such as how there is a random chance that when you phase into a new area that the game will completely freeze. You can hear your guy jumping around and moving, but it just sits at the "Connect to Server" screen. Myself, and a couple of my friends have experienced this same error and it can be super annoying (especially when playing together).\n\nFor $5 I have had more fun in this game than most $50-60 game. It is surprisingly polished for the price, but at the same time it is obvious there is a lot of room for improvement. I would consider this a much more simplified, fast paced,  version of Rust. I think the main thing that needs to be worked on at this point is the inventory management. It could definitely use some improvement.","May 22, 2015","true","34.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

( If you are deciding to buy then read this ) First of all get the game if you like russians,big firefights, and mass murder by wolves and tractors. Game is fun, but from my experience it is also posessed by a ghost. At first the game seems small but there are actually many maps. Me and my friend were traveling from map to map finding many things, and doing well. We eventually came to a point were we were scarce of food and water. We decided to shoot eachother with our guns to end the misery, but we searched around a little more to see if there was hope left. Btw, we were at a point were we saw no players. We eventually found a crashed plane and we deicde to search it. The dark travel screen came up that you get when you travel from map to map. Me and my friend were quickly horrified as we enetered the area the plane seemed to turn into a dark underground vault, where it was very creepy, it was like nothing else in the game. Me and my friend were confused and scared so we exited the area and reneted. On the second time we entered we found a man who was not there standingf there before, we shot him. We exited again and went back in for the third time. I quickly realised something was wrong as my friend was there a second ago, but now he wasnt. We talked over skype about what was happeneing. While i roamed the creepy room all of a sudden in a blink of an eye i was in another room. This room was creepy and dark and the floor was filled a ft. high with water. What made the experience worse was i wasnt alone in this new room, the same man we shot before was in the room was there too, so i bolted int a big room in the middle and ran into some sort of closet and hid. I then died of freezing to death and lost all my stuff including my gas mask,rifle,shot gun, and all my cool clothes. While i was waiting to respawn, i saw the water splash next to my dead body, as i respawn i was scared to find my slef spawn in the dark water room again. I quit scared out of my mind. My friend died in the other dark room but trace back to his dead body. i hope this was just a glitch because now im stuck in a dark room forever with a ghost.\n\n10/10 would play crapping myself at 3:00 in the morning simulator again.\n\nAll in all the game has its fun moments, but can the game creators respond and tell me if the "water" room is supposed to be there.\n\nDay 1:I manned up and searched the water room. It is literally the maze of hell. I am stuck wandering the maze. Pls send more russians with shotguns for backup.\n\nDay 2: I heard breathing, i got paranoid but it was my own...few.\n\nDay 3: I am currently going to keep writing logs until im saved, if you buy this, search for the crashed airline plane and help.\n\nBtw these arent actually days these are really just minutes.\n\nDay 4: I found an elevator! Im saved thank god! But still, something was down there with me...But yay im out","December 2, 2015","true","16.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Finding people is very rare to me in this game\n\n2. Wolfs and Bears are to op\n\n3. Critical Damage from falling off a little leadge?\n\n4. I think finding stuff in this game is a little to hard, thirst and cookies are quick to find but guns and ammunition are rare.\n\n5.Backpack space should could a little more thing just 2 more added layers........\n\n6.Ladders and stairs could actually should have a animation for both of them.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in conclusion i really LOVE this game, just a few simple mistakes in there.

Just have to say be on the look out for russians and american teens who enjoy saying "you got rekt". Be careful of who you let live around you espically people who say nothing and young sounding americans.  They enjoy stabbing you in the back.  I looked into the reviews of this game and saw everyone saying the same thing about the russian player base.  And in game I found this out to be true.  They are usally well armed move in groups of two and always open fire on you before talking.  I enjoyed hunting them down and every time I killed one they would say in a heavy russian voice "I not Russian".  All and all for the price, fun game to pick up and play.

I understand that the game is in early access but what I think is that they have tried to make a DayZ like pvp game, replacing the Zombies with glitchy wolves. There are barely any items scattered around the map and the map is also very small. We even joined one server and the main town in the map was all bordered of with wooden planks. I don't see any point to this game and if I was gonna recommend any game this would be at the bottom of my list. Waste of £3.50.

Recomended for all fans of postapocalyptic survival genre.\nFor newcomers it can be hard,especially solo players, because of other players who hunt you,but be honest guys,in real postapocalyptic life,people are merciles :) Who whatched Revolution or The walking dead, 12 monkeys  series will understand :)\nThe are couple problems and issues with this game,but I think developers will add them in the nearest future:\n-would be nice to see nicknames,add to friendlist on steam when meet somebody\n-give a handicap to new players or separate experienced from them who have a decent inventory(guns with bullets in particular)\n-add a tab,where you can see all the players in server and show stats ( for example how much hours in real time player stayed alive)\nDespite that,I recommend playing this with a friend or friends, it's hilarious :)","May 22, 2015","true","48.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Finding people is very rare to me in this game\n\n2. Wolfs and Bears are to op\n\n3. Critical Damage from falling off a little leadge?\n\n4. I think finding stuff in this game is a little to hard, thirst and cookies are quick to find but guns and ammunition are rare.\n\n5.Backpack space should could a little more thing just 2 more added layers........\n\n6.Ladders and stairs could actually should have a animation for both of them.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in conclusion i really LOVE this game, just a few simple mistakes in there. Plus the game is in beta to it's not fully finished. Overall, i learn from my mistakes in this game. That's why now i a auto machine gun and some good gear.\n\n\n\n\n\n9/10   Just like DayZ\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP.S.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/justfuckingkillmealready/recommended/351290/","justfuckingkillmealready","Plat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/justfuckingkillmealready/","104 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI'm not going to lie to you: This is a difficult game. It's certainly harder than DayZ and unturned.  But if you've played those games your knowlage should translate.  Here's what makes this game stand out:\n\nYou can die from so much more: In DayZ and Unturned, hunger  and players are your arch nemesis.  In this game you have hunger, cold, bears, wolfs, thirst, clothes, and even people that don't speak your language WILL kill you on sight.\n\nThis game is a harder DayZ with far fewer glitches (and a more bareable price tag).  So lets get down to my expiriences that will help you new players:\n\nThis game is NOT friendly to new players, but at least you can get a hang of the controls.  The most helpful one is Z, if you can tell the people around you not to kill you then that's a perk.  Now, don't expect to run around for five minutes and find everything you need to survive.  It might've been that way in the prison but if you die you DO NOT return to the prison.  So if you have some high hopes of it being easy if you die you should head on over to DayZ or Unturned.\n\nNext: If you don't want to be friends with someone you have an option: Kill them on the spot or rob them.  I prefer option two because it may save ammo.  Better yet: all guns you find won't have ammo, so if you simply point an unloaded gun at someone and threaten to shoot, they might never know.  Remember: once the robbery ends do not stick around. He might have friends.  If you feel like he didn't give you everything and you do have ammo: shoot him in the head.\n\n\nNext are animals: You have two threats in animals, they are wolfs and bears.  I've never seen a bear outside of the marshes so you shouldn't have too much panic.  The wolves are a different story, they are everywhere.  Good news is they're easy to kill, 2 axe swings or one shot will end them.  This doesn't mean they aren't dangerous however.\n\nBears on the other hand I've only had one run in with, I can't say I liked it.  It jumped out at me in the marsh and scared the living ♥♥♥♥ out of me.  DO NOT FIGHT A BEAR.\n\nNext is food:  Food is a necessity, and so is water.  Find them and charish them.  Some food will require a can opener so be on the lookout for them.\n\nCloths are vital.  If nothing previously listed kills you, this will.  Unlike Unturned or DayZ, you aren't in a habitable inviornment.  The enviornment of this game is norther Siberia.  If you aren't dressed right you will not survive.  You spawn in a pair of weird jeans (which I'm pretty sure have a swastica on the right leg) and some ♥♥♥♥ sneakers.  If you find a shirt put that ♥♥♥♥ on, you WILL freeze.\n\nPlayers: TRUST NOBODY!  If you have friends, trust them but not too much.  They CAN and WILL turn on you eventually.\n\n\nTO THE DEVS:\n\nThis is an amazing game but it needs some work:  I'd recommend slowing down the rate that you freeze to death and making more weapons.  Better yet: Let us be able to punch.\n\nHope this helps you new players\n\nEDIT:  You're going to want some music, I recommend anything by A7X if you like rock, Sabaton if you like metal, D12 Eminem Tupac or Kanye West if you like rap, Fallout boy if you like pop.\n\nEDIT 2:  I've since noticed that there aren't a lot of trolls, but when you find one they are very clever.  Always carry an axe with you so that someone doesn't block your exit with a massive wood wall.","July 6, 2015","true","10.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Lots of tedious and time consuming looting, typically only to then get blindsided by a stacked freak, or a group of them. The other side of that coin is that kills are meaningful and massive adrenaline dumps. It's actually a refreshing take on the value of a single life - while most games downplay the significance of a single life and create callused gamers.","September 14, 2015","true","13.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","5","9","2","0"

For the price, it's worth trying it out, even on a lower end PC, which is amazing. This is a survival game where you find items, combine them, and (if you're smart) survive the harsh elements while dealing with people who will either help you, or kill you where you stand. It can be a bit tough at first, but once you get to know what to do, you'll become cautious and acquire items to survive! As long as the minor issues are patched, and some different things (items, inventory layout etc.) are implemented, this can become a great release for the price! Keep up with the discussions, provide your feedback on issues, and hopefully the devs can help us out! I will definitely come back to this game and play it, and am excited to see what new features will come of this great little survival map in the near future! Trust me, it's bigger than it looks! ;)","April 19, 2015","true","10.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

But surprisingly, there are many friendly players, so even if you're playing solo you might end up in a group. Don't worry though, there's also a lot of hostile, lone wolf kind of players and raiding groups, so sooner rather than later you'll come across some crazy guy that'll try to KOS (which, IMO, adds to the fun). Playing with friends and facing another group of players is interesting and fun, sometimes they'll trade and offer their help, or simply shoot you out of fear. I highly recommend getting this game, really cheap and fun.","April 28, 2015","true","12.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I love the concept, I love the variety of weapons and items at the momen. For an early access game it has quite a lot of potential.\n\nPros:\n\nHuge variety of weapons\n\nQuite a big world\n\nNice calming/misleadingly calm scenery\n\nGood for lower spec computers (for now)\n\nFitting music\n\nVery nice price at £4.79\n\n\nCons:\n\nFor some reason dogs can walk through walls or no-clip through walls which can get annoying\n\nDogs stop moving but keep on animating, as if they were attacking you or someone if you're not on the same level as them\n\nThe edge of the world is a clear invisible wall instead of a mountain or buildings.\n\nFloating object such as trees and buildings. (which is a common glitch with this sort of game in this state so I understand why those sort of graphical glitches in a survival game such as this)\n\nNo climbing animation so if you look at someone climbing a ladder they'll just slide up/down the ladder.\n\nCan't find supplies most of the time resulting in starvation, dehydration or freezing to death.\n\nThe tutorial ain't easy to follow.\n\n\nThings I would like to see in this game:\n\nA single player mode so you don't have to worry about being killed by some random person.\n\nA more detailed main menu.\n\nThe ability to change FOV (field of view) and mouse sensitivity.\n\nA sort of creative mode or sandbox mode so you can test out equipment or vehicles.\n\n\nBut overall I really enjoy playing this game and I think it has a lot of potential.\n\nI would rate this game 7/10 for the moment, but to be fair this game is too early in production to judge at the moment.\n\n\nP.S I know I have only played around 2 hours of this, but I wanted to make a review because I disagree with all the people who don't recommend this game because of a few errors/glitches.","July 10, 2015","true","3.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faroff/recommended/351290/","Faroff","Faroff","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faroff/","228 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI wanted to like this game I really did...but the map size is really the killer for me. I assumed this would be an open world game where your choice to go from one loot location to another could be a death sentance if you didn't have enough supplies to make the trip....you know survival? Unfortunantly this is a series of very very small maps that you zone between and you can just camp one to two loot spots and just server hop for anything you need.\n\nAnother thing I felt they did very poorly was the fact the game tries to be "death matchy" by showing you the location of other players while you are dead. My problem with this is that it is easly exploitable and honestly if you are dead you should need to build back up before you just go rushing out nude trying to find the guy you saw on the death cam...who may have had nothing at all to do with your death.\n\nThe loot system needs a little work. Guns are never in your bags only equiped and if you have a pistol/rifle picking up a melee means you don't have the pistol untill you drop one of the other two. I see the realistic aspect of this, but in a game with death cams we aren't really going for realism here we want pvp action this feature isn't condusive to pvp. Also the survival aspect in relation to loot isn't that great either none of the status bars are hard to manage but the items required to manage those bars take up quite a bit of space in your bags. Not a huge problem considering guns don't go into your bag. I just feel if we are playing a game lets have fun and loot cool ♥♥♥♥ to play with not be forced to make choices about what to drop when I am full loot and my bag consists of very few items most of which require interaction with another item....gun + ammo ect...\n\n\nI do however like the combat system guns feel accurate and powerful, but I feel like the community was a bunch of kids that couldn't pvp in more popular survival games so they were looking to be a larger fish in a smaller pond, or they are guys that want to "team up and steal my loots" I mean be friends? because this is a base building team game not a death match survival game...lol   I hope this post helps both the devs and the people looking to buy this game as I would like it to improve to the point of recommending it to others.","June 19, 2015","false","2.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Has some bugs and optimization issues, but it's got potential.\n\nThe good:\n-Lots of different guns to find\n-Working vehicles (suck it, dayZ)\n-Crafting\n-Only five bucks\n-Loot isn't too hard or too easy to find. You can actually die of dehydration, freezing, and hunger without being just some complete noob\n-Unique winter setting\n\nThe bad:\n-Many bugs, including a black screen bug (never go to the Marsh. they may fix this, but I haven't found out if they did yet)\n-Lots of KoS\n-When your character starts to freeze, get dehydrated or hungry, etc, he becomes very annoying with his complaining\n\nI'll give this game a 7/10.

I had a good bit of food, and I was just surviving, ya dig? But that wasn't the highlight of my time.\nAt one point, I met another player with an awfully peculiar voice, kinda creaky and high. I don't remember our exchange, but I only remember using this text-to-speech app to speak through my iPod. Anyways, we went our own ways and I hadn't seen the guy for about ten minutes.\nI ended up at that large house by the side of a road, not too far from a boat at the bottom of a hill, and I entered the house. Suddenly, I hear a familiar, gritty voice that says, "Hey, I'm stuck in the wall!"\nI look for this guy, and I can't find him, and he's urging me to check the closet, so I do, and there's nothing there.

Also dayz in my opinion has less hackers and a better way of dealing with them than survival post apocalypse now. I recommend both dayz and survival post apocalypse now. If you want a ultra realistic zombie apocalypse, go with dayz, if you want a survival game that is easy than dayz but still challenging go with survival post apocalypse now.","July 25, 2015","true","0.6"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

I assumed this would be an open world game where your choice to go from one loot location to another could be a death sentance if you didn't have enough supplies to make the trip....you know survival? Unfortunantly this is a series of very very small maps that you zone between and you can just camp one to two loot spots and just server hop for anything you need.\n\nAnother thing I felt they did very poorly was the fact the game tries to be "death matchy" by showing you the location of other players while you are dead. My problem with this is that it is easly exploitable and honestly if you are dead you should need to build back up before you just go rushing out nude trying to find the guy you saw on the death cam...who may have had nothing at all to do with your death.\n\nThe loot system needs a little work. Guns are never in your bags only equiped and if you have a pistol/rifle picking up a melee means you don't have the pistol untill you drop one of the other two. I see the realistic aspect of this, but in a game with death cams we aren't really going for realism here we want pvp action this feature isn't condusive to pvp. Also the survival aspect in relation to loot isn't that great either none of the status bars are hard to manage but the items required to manage those bars take up quite a bit of space in your bags. Not a huge problem considering guns don't go into your bag. I just feel if we are playing a game lets have fun and loot cool ♥♥♥♥ to play with not be forced to make choices about what to drop when I am full loot and my bag consists of very few items most of which require interaction with another item....gun + ammo ect...\n\n\nI do however like the combat system guns feel accurate and powerful, but I feel like the community was a bunch of kids that couldn't pvp in more popular survival games so they were looking to be a larger fish in a smaller pond, or they are guys that want to "team up and steal my loots" I mean be friends? because this is a base building team game not a death match survival game...lol   I hope this post helps both the devs and the people looking to buy this game as I would like it to improve to the point of recommending it to others.","June 19, 2015","false","2.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It's pretty good considering it is still in alpha. If the developers can release new patches fixing the bugs and glitches that exist in the game, then this woud be one of the best survival games ever.\nIt's very challenging, and the game certainly doesn't hold your hand and help you navigate the vast map, but that's alright, as that adds to the challenge.

Has some bugs and optimization issues, but it's got potential.\n\nThe good:\n-Lots of different guns to find\n-Working vehicles (suck it, dayZ)\n-Crafting\n-Only five bucks\n-Loot isn't too hard or too easy to find. You can actually die of dehydration, freezing, and hunger without being just some complete noob\n-Unique winter setting\n\nThe bad:\n-Many bugs, including a black screen bug (never go to the Marsh. they may fix this, but I haven't found out if they did yet)\n-Lots of KoS\n-When your character starts to freeze, get dehydrated or hungry, etc, he becomes very annoying with his complaining\n\nI'll give this game a 7/10.

Whenever I picked up a new item, my inventory would cease to work, along with the escape menu. The only way to fix it was to alt f4 out of the game and relaunch, which was fine until i needed to pick up another item.\n\nThe other bugs aren't really gamebreaking but are really annoying and frustrating. For example, every 10 minutes or so the screen would go black and I would reappear at the edge of the area I was in, leaving me to run through wilderness and eventually die via wolf.\n\nThere are more bugs but I don't want to make this review too long.\n\nGOOD POINTS\nLooks nice\nRuns half decently\n\nThats about it.\n\nI will be editing this review after I play more of the game after some updates.","June 6, 2015","false","1.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Secondly, it's full, and I mean FULL of glitches whereby you get stuck and have to kill yourself or remain trapped.\n\nLoot is impossible to come by on the empty servers... I see people (who are probably hacking) with amazing guns and seemingly endless supplies of ammo, while it takes me about an hour or two of play just to find a basic gun in good condition.\n\nThe spawning system is particularly annoying: the prison spawn is ages away from anything good and takes too long to get away from. Also, players quite often ruin the game by boarding up useful buildings with the build tool. The devs claim that you can destroy player-made buildings, but you can't so if someone decides to do that (which they often do) the game is ruined. Oh, and they've ONLY JUST added in an option to change the graphics, although you still can't change mouse sensitivity, christ knows why.\n\nThis game needs much, much work before it'll be playable.","June 9, 2015","false","85.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Can't drag and  can't click right or left to even have an option to drop item.\n2) Smashed this 1 guy with an axe over 18 times, and he's still not even dead. Did the hits even apply or are the people just really durable in this game? I see blood coming out but they're not dying.\n3) Cannot fight or even defend yourself with your fists or kicks until you find a weapon that's melee or a gun that must have the exact bullets / does not require cleaning / fixing / etc....\n4) Takes 60 seconds just to spawn back into the game\n5) Cannot even select items, not sure if glitched or what...\n6) Glitchy graphics such as people legs running like it could bend 360 degrees.

Get more english speaking players that are active using the mic\n2.) Make it so you don't starve, dehydrate, or freeze to death as fast.\n3.) Put more Loot or supplies, or have them respawn faster in buildings.\n4.)Customizable character would be great too.\n5.) please nerf the damage that dogs do, or give more health to characters.\n\nIf these changes are made i will make a recommended review again.","April 29, 2015","false","5.0"," 18 of 37 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","18","37","0","2"

I played for 3 hours and really want to like it. It is different. I got frustrated by having absolutely no instructions listed anywhere and no way to what keys did what. It literally took me until the third hour to learn how to load a gun. I think it is because I didn't have the right ammo for any of the guns that i found. I eventually found a shotgun and found some shells. and reload was "R".\n\nI thought i had the right shells for the gun I was carrying but the caliber was not listed on the gun and the caliber listed with the bullets and clips were listed differently than I am used to. so it was hard to identify when I had the right ammo for the pistol I had. Also when you find thing you cannot carry enough items. this was very frustraing. Water is hard to find so I hoarded that....food was fairly simple to find but sometimes I would have to carry a can opener which I didn't want to carry due to inventory space.\n\nYou can die of starvation, hunger and hypothermia. You start off with 6 inventory slots If you find water then definitely take it. 1 slot used. Find another water....well definitely take that. 2 slots used. Find food......alright found a can......3 slots. Oh.....need a can opener....found one 4 slots used........I am getting cold. I need an axe.....well that is a weapon so it doesn't count in my slots...that's good so I chop a tree and got a piece of wood 5 slots but now I need a lighter and a can fuel to ingnite the wood. That's 7 slots!. I did eventually find a back pack which expanded to up to 12 slots but I write that out to describe the frustration I felt when I knew I was getting h8ungry and thirsty fast and needing tyo hoard things but having to drop them just to continue on. Then thinking I can just go back for them to find that it respawned withing minutes of me finding them. DANG! it's not there now I am screwed.....now I die......and I start over with nothing.\n\nI will try it again later and hope I will change my mind to give it a thumbs up. I certainly don't think I wasted my $5 because it is a really neat concept. I mostly wanted to offer feedback to the developers who seem to really be invested in making it a good game. IMHO......list some instructions like the basic key commands....it would have helped me out quite a bit.\n\n","January 21","false","4.0"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","7","15","2","0"

I got 30 hours out of the game before it went to ♥♥♥♥. I was addicted to playing it 24/7. Then they decided to implement a ""Tutorial area"" which was utterly pointless and confusing.\nThey also added a new map with the ""Tutorial""\n\nThis map ruined the game for me. It's the H1Z1 effect, you run forever just trying to find supplies, but guess what! There's not even zombies to fight. you explore the empty wilderness rarely coming across other players and that is the gist of this game.\n\nPlease don't purchase this game until they have made a smaller map that actually works. As always I will update my review in the future when I feel that this game has updated to a point worth mentioning.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI should have read the dev updates better. Apparently they seem to be changing the map to something else and updating tons of stuff, they just haven't implemented it yet.","May 6, 2015","false","34.6"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

Especially since you can't even punch the darn thing since the only thing you can use are weapons, which are few far and in between.\n-I actually found the help menu, which shows what buttons to push to do what, but had to exit the game to actually find it. No in game help menu at all.\n-The inventory menu is complicated to use. Not to mention you only have 6 free slots to stash stuff.\n-The combat is choppy and just plain bad.\n-You run across more ammo than you do guns(should be the other way around)\n-When you actually do come across a gun, you can't tell if you have the right ammo for it anyways since none of it is written in english.\n\n\nMorale of the story, don't buy this game. It has potential, but unless they make some MAJOR changes, it would be the worst $5 I've ever spent.","April 8","false","0.4"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","46","6","13","3","2"

But as of where the game stands right now, I can't recommend playing it. You're constantly getting killed before you can aquire any decent loot (either by players or wolves, since there is no melee attack). There doesn't seem to be enough loot for the amount of players on the server. Everytime you walk into a building there is more than likely another player in there, recently has been there, or walks in and kills you while you're in there.

Any ways - Over all a fun time even though it was short - The devolpers should work on a prone and crouch that are not on the  same button so like c to crouch and x to go prone - Get rid of the crafting all together since it can no clip threw walls etc - Add it in another time - They should work on a warming system since its mostly cold and windy - Something like The Long Dark -They should also add a better crafting system like a menu or something so you can make a bow and arrows easy by first finding an axe or hatchet etc then chop wood or be able to craft a stone hatchet by picking up stones and wood then opening the crafting menu with i or something instead of having q and i the same button for the Inventory. The sound i think is amazing like the wind and snow also add a snow effect outside say if inside or something because iv seen the snow goes away maybe to stop lag or something but your mostly out side so keep it out when in a house or something.

I will try to be fair here in the perspective as both a gamer and a fellow developer.\n\nThis is not a flame review nor a you guys suck review. It is more like some friendly critics that I hope you guys would notice in a good and friendly way. And take into consideration when you keep on developing on the game.\n\nGamer :\n\nI would not recommend this to anyone in its current state. Item management is clumsy, Wildlife is clitchy as ♥♥♥♥.\nSound and GFX (Even on Fantastic) gives you a migrane after a few minutes.\nGame seems way to small, i mean the few mins I have spent there it seems like i went from 1 invisible wall to another.\n\nWould not recommend even if it was free to play, and I dont understand why people would play this, when Dayz. Rust, Ark etc. is on steam.\n\nDeveloper.\n\nAs a "open world" survival game 40 km2 is pretty small. Ones you are ingame it doesnt feel like 40 km2 at all though. it feels a lot smaller. Even though you announced that the game have a "Giant world with ability to keep up to 40 people on 1 server"\nAs a comparrison DayZ chernarus (Mod) with 40 players felt small and that is 225 km2.\n\nYou currently announce "Our game is almost in a finished state"\n\nCurrent state of the game in a "normal" roadmap is alpha state.\nThe whole world need a redesign. roads overlapping each other in weird places, trees halfway inside buildings/floawing 5-10 cm over the ground.\n\nProps/assets needs a overhaul.\nwildlife ai, controls, UI and Hud needs a tweak, it looks like something that got rushed into greenlight.\n\nIt might have been. I cant say for sure.\n\nI can see the whole idea with releasing a "New" survival game, and with the right angle you would be able to do that with success, no doubt about it.\n\nKudos for the rain effect on the HUD. That is pretty neat though.\n\nAnd try and keep your facebook site up to date with the steam info.\nAnd avoid buying likes (Not sure if that is the case but the facebook meta on you page is extremely low considering there is 12k likes.)\n\n- Low Meta is bad for business, and fewer automatic adds posted in the "Sponsored" tab in facebook.\n\nThis is the info on Facebook.\n\n- Awesome 3D graphics.\n(When saying Awesome 3D graphics, I think back when I saw Farcry for the first time, and I was like OMFG it is pretty, But in reality the current graphics, on fantastic makes the game look like a poor mans Arma 1 mod.)\n- Game world of 7 km2.\n(feels right when I played)\n\nOverall I would say good job in selling 3200+ copies. thats around 20k Euro :)\nStill show that there is a market for this type of games even though it seems rushed.\n\nJoin "Indie Game Promo/Indie Game Developer & GameDev Beginners" on facebook.\nThat have helpded me a lot regarding promotions, roadmaps, changes that needs to be considered before greenlighting a game. Or you can add me and I will gladly help out with what ever I can. promotions, marketing tips etc. anything!.\n\nI wont charge a dime.\n\nI will stick around and give this game another try, in the future.\nCause I am a sucker for Post Apocalyptic survival games :D\n\nBest of luck and I hope to see this game develope to something awesome.\n\n\n","July 22, 2015","false","0.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I have a fairly decent gaming computer. I can run skyrim at max settings with no issues at 65 FPS and the fans barly have to move to keep the computer cool. This game is an enigma of programming a bugs. I first played it at my sisters house for an hour, her computer has similar specs, and this game was crashing, FPS was all over the place, and items, vehicels, and fun are no where to be found.\n\nI love the idea of the game. It has a great base that needs no further explaining other than " Its Russia, it fell, its everyman for himself, have fun". However the exucution was aweful. The devs simply gave up. The bugs won't be fixed. The gameplay won't be improved. People in their right mind won't play it. Don't waste five dollars. Hopefully someone else will take the game over and actualy do something with it. It has the potential to be a hit if they would at least try.","December 22, 2015","false","0.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Explored a pretty decent portion of the map, found nothing, ran in to a couple of others who seemed to be doing the same thing (just... walking around), beat two dogs to death with the torch, and then quit the game.\nFor an early access game, it's in pretty good shape. However, there were a good number of bugs that I encountered in my short time playing. In the prison, I respawned randomly to the cell you start out in. Walking up sets of stairs is not possible - you have to jump up them. The dogs I encountered had no actual movements, they just glided towards me and stood next to me, stationary, as I took damage. I went to the backside of a mountain range - which disapeared with the exception of the top portion. I could not close my inventory one of the times that I opened it, so I pressed escape, thinking that would solve the problem - it booted me from the server.\nThere is no tutorial for this game, they just throw you into it and expect that you know what to do. To be fair, it seems like it's easy to get the hang of, but you have to figure everything out yourself. The controls are fine for me, but from what I gathered from other reviewers, if you're not into using the traditional layout for FPS games, then you're out of luck as you cannot rebind the keys.\n\nSome good aspects of the game would be the overall graphics, which look decent for a five dollar game. The voice acting (so far - I've only heard my character speak) is decent as well. That's really all that comes to mind though, unfortunately...\nOverall, I just can't recommend this game. It looks like it would be really good, but it needs more time spent in development. The devs should really focus on implementing things for the player to do, rather than essentially making it a walking simulator. Hopefully I can come back to this game in the future and give it another shot.","June 25, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

With the price tag of 5.99 usd I figured I would give it a try even though I wasn't expection much from it. It started me off in a prison. After leaving there I traveled to two new locations. I starte looting stuff in draws, cabints, lockers, and such like other games do(dayz standalone). The game wasn't to bad until I started running into other players. Most had top tier gear and was just camping the noob area. So I died, died, died, and died so more. Couldn't leave the noob area and if I did, I would get killed by a player not long away.\n\n---Pros---\n-The loot system is good for a game of this price.\nGood amount of items/guns/tools.\n-When you go to other locations, it is it's own instance.\n\n---Cons---\n-Players camping new player locations with top tier gear.\n-Hard to play alone on servers with more players on them.\n\n\nSo would I suggest this game to anyone? If you like pvp survival games like dayz and just kos then this is for you. It's on 5.99 usd atm and if you don't like it after playing for less then 2 hours, you can ask for a refund like I did from steam.\nSo I give the game a 4/10 for the looting/instance travel.","July 7, 2015","false","1.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Absolutely horrible. It's like it was made by someone in high school over the course of a week. It's grotesquely ugly, sound effects are ♥♥♥♥, even if you're crawling you still emit the same loud footsteps as if you're walking, the only difference is that they come with bigger intervals. I looked at the reviews and went "Oh cool, this doesn't seem very generic at all besides the player base." And boy, was I wrong. Literally everyone I met killed me on sight and the ones who didn't manage to kill me only didn't because I ran for my life. I never found more than 2 pistols in my whole playthrough, barely any melee weapons, no real supplies and scarce food. Most houses I visited were looted and the houses are very repetitive. The map feels like it's 100 meters across or something, the graphics, once again, are UTTERLY CRAP, all text in the game is just plan white arial in all-caps, the icons look like they're made in paint and then scaled up to the point of blurriness, when you die you can see all players on the map and where they are, everyone shoots each other on sight and for some reason there are dogs in the game that you can outrun extremely easily. I regret so much buying this, that's 5€ I could have done something useful for. The mere thought of launching this game depresses me. Please, please, please do not buy this until it becomes a GAME and not just a 5 minute Unity project for a class in high school which is exactly what it feels like.","May 26, 2015","false","0.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

I mean yea game is early access and all and even cheap but the inventory slots are what really makes me bitter. to enjoy a game you have to be able to actually get the things that are in the game that are supposed to make a game enjoyable.","August 18, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Explored a pretty decent portion of the map, found nothing, ran in to a couple of others who seemed to be doing the same thing (just... walking around), beat two dogs to death with the torch, and then quit the game.\nFor an early access game, it's in pretty good shape. However, there were a good number of bugs that I encountered in my short time playing. In the prison, I respawned randomly to the cell you start out in. Walking up sets of stairs is not possible - you have to jump up them. The dogs I encountered had no actual movements, they just glided towards me and stood next to me, stationary, as I took damage. I went to the backside of a mountain range - which disapeared with the exception of the top portion. I could not close my inventory one of the times that I opened it, so I pressed escape, thinking that would solve the problem - it booted me from the server.\nThere is no tutorial for this game, they just throw you into it and expect that you know what to do. To be fair, it seems like it's easy to get the hang of, but you have to figure everything out yourself. The controls are fine for me, but from what I gathered from other reviewers, if you're not into using the traditional layout for FPS games, then you're out of luck as you cannot rebind the keys.\n\nSome good aspects of the game would be the overall graphics, which look decent for a five dollar game. The voice acting (so far - I've only heard my character speak) is decent as well. That's really all that comes to mind though, unfortunately...\nOverall, I just can't recommend this game. It looks like it would be really good, but it needs more time spent in development. The devs should really focus on implementing things for the player to do, rather than essentially making it a walking simulator. Hopefully I can come back to this game in the future and give it another shot.","June 25, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This game is kinda like any other survival game out there, but with very good fps! It is in early alpha so it might not be that freat of an experience right now as i think there are to much snow landscape and almost no cities. And that u have to teleport to other parts of the map. Otherwise it looks pretty good and in my opinion the best survival early alpha game right now!","April 28, 2015","true","2.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is now untrue. He has realised that people didn't like his decision and now he will continue working on SPN.\n\nThis game is basically a cheap DayZ, but it is great especially for the price and instead of needing a NASA computer all you will need is your grandma's old dusty desktop to run it. The graphics look good enough (especially on max), gameplay is suspenseful but repetitive, and there are many glitches (none are game breaking it seems). At the moment there are only 3 enemies. Wolves of varying colors, bears, and players. Sounds boring right? I know but its actually pretty fun/addictive imo. You will either love it or hate it, but atleast you can refund if you hate it.

Keeping in mind this is early access i hope more things will get add like easier access to drinkable\nfluids cuz that was one thing that annoyed me only finding one can of soup and one bottle of what looked like\ngatorade lol. I came across 3 people in the short time i played...2 friendly...1 very agressive russian that i couldnt\nunderstand and had to kill or be killed lol. Anyway..for the price try it out, i was unsure to and at this point i dont\nregret my purchase. Hope you enjoy :)","June 20, 2015","true","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I just played it 30mins did not see anyone in the server (where 40 people should be) and there was nothing to do or find.. graphics are ok but not new gen or so. I recommend getting an other survival game. If you want to build anything with allot of people and even underground then I would say play '7 days to die' thats fun!","September 12, 2015","false","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
