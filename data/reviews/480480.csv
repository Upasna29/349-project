But dont go expecting a 2D dark souls, this is not that.\n\nReally great to pick up and play for a short time and then come back to it again and again.\nReally nice progression system.\n\nThere really isn't anything to dislike here. And for 3 bucks. Hell yeah pick this up.","June 3","true","3.6"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","10","11","2","0"

Super Simple.\n\nDodge the enemies and kill them when you have enough stamina, nice (but small) soundtrack.\n\nCombat can be fun, though has a bug I think if you are to close when you attack at an enemy and you go right through them without dealing damage.\n\nProgression system is nice, collect souls of enemies you slay and spend on upgrades.\n\nBosses are a definitive plus, and when you kill them you unlock new playable characters.\n\nFor $2.99 you should definitly buy and play this.","June 3","true","5.3"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

If you fail to slash an enemy, and enemy slashes you instead, you die. Slash or Die.\n\nBut seriously, it's a fun casual action-rpg.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GrandpuhTy/recommended/480480/","GrandpuhTy","Grandpuh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GrandpuhTy/","52 products in account","Slash or Die is a fast paced, action arcade, hack and slash that seems deceptively simple at first but, definitely has a level of skill mastery associated with it.\n\nThe game features:\n+ Increasingly difficult gameplay\n+ Unlockable characters\n+ Character progression through upgrades\n+ Bosses\n\nAre just some of the key features of this game. Very 'pick up and play' but, also very punishing if you make a mistake. The trance inducing music, clean pixel animations, and the flow of successful combo massacres is satisfying to say the least. I would love to see this come to mobile in the future, but for now I would definitely recommend it if you're looking to kill time.","June 4","true","1.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shfisher/recommended/480480/","Shfisher","Goblin-Rat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shfisher/","324 products in account","Not bad at all. It's a bit slow in the beginning, and could use some polish (it feels clunkier than it probably should, and sometimes the slash doesn't hit enemies it should), but for this price, it's a very good, very simple little game. The bosses and later enemies add some strategy into the game, and it doesn't feel like a mindless clickfest. No real, major downsides like other people have already said. It succeeds well in what it does.","June 4","true","1.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I actually felt adrenaline rush every time successfully dodging attack and making mincemeat of a horde of monsters!!!\nNice graphics and animation, well-made soundtracks, balanced leveling-up system. And also a hardcore that doesn’t make you mad but makes you willing to go on playing and path the way to it’s end. That is what I liked in Slash or Die. Totally recommend!!!","June 3","true","1.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Droucil/recommended/480480/","Droucil","Droucil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Droucil/","53 products in account","Easy to pick up and a little masterpiece for simplicity.\n\nRoguelike game with ingame points to spent for upgrades, think about more health, stamina (which is used to attack), speed, damage and certain skills (depending on class).\n\nLeft mouse button to move, right mouse button to attack.\nThree different classes of which two have to be unlocked, so far I played the warrior and berserker and both feel very different to play, while still being equally balanced.\n\nGood to play for a while and to pick up later on.\nDefinitely worth the 3 bucks, even more so if it gets on sale.\nOh yeah and it has an awesome oldschool soundtrack which totaly fits the game!\n\nIf you wan't to see some gameplay with the first boss check the video below\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIIuuWBi00M","June 4","true","4.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The gameplay is fast and fun and the game walks the fine line between challenging enough to make you keep trying and being so hard you rage quit very well. This is not an amazing game but it is still pretty good and you would have a hard time finding a better game for $3.\n\nThe game does feel a like a bit of a grind at times and I have an issue with some of the mechanics but it was an overall enjoyable experience. The developers are constantly updating the game and actually fixed one of my biggest issues with the game while I was making this review. I expect this game will continue to get better so I suggest you try it out.\n\nIf you want a more in depth review, check out my video review: https://youtu.be/OaMDNOTGSnc","June 5","true","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Hopefully new charecters are on the way and maybe even some kind of mode just to play against bosses. But, any way the game is great for the price i cant wait till its complete if it isnt already since its an indie. Does have a few bugs but nothing serious at all. If you like Souls/borne games grab this its really fun to sit back and play as well as keeping you on your toes!","June 6","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
