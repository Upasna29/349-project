It's so great to see the developers take a real interest in what the players have to say, and it makes me feel like I'm being a part of the development myself. Definitely worth supporting to help an awesome team make a great game!\n\n---Original Review---\nThough it's still Early Access, Poly Bridge offers a fun and unique enough experience to make up for the bugs. And yes, there are quite a few bugs. Here's a nice pros/cons list to look at:\n\nProsNice cartoonish graphics\nFun gameplay\nFairly realistic physics\nGif sharing\nLevel creator\nConsBugs in level creator\nGifs get cut off in longer levels\nA few minor glitches in campaign\nThe gameplay is very fun, and I love the fact that there is no single "correct" solution. This game not only allows creativity, but it actually requires creativity because there are no guidelines at all, just some materials that you can use and a budget you can't go over. Overall, I would say that Poly Bridge is definitely a game that's worth supporting, and it's one to look out for once it gets fully released. As an Early Access game, I recommend it with a warning that you will be dealing with some bugs and glitches, mostly in the sandbox mode (level creator). The gameplay is very fun and extremely addicting, and there are already quite a few player-made maps available on the Steam workshop that add to the fun. The level creator itself is fairly easy to use, but the bugs make it very difficult to actually make a complete level. To be honest, I've spent most of my time in-game fighting with the level creator because it's just so damn fun to use, but it frequently locks up and I have to restart the game, and sometimes it won't save the level I'm working on. So if you can deal with a few bugs and want to support a really fun game, go ahead and grab it, but if you want a fully polished game with no glitches, skip the Early Access and wait until it's fully released.\n\nPS - the one thing that drew me to this game the most is the integrated .gif creator. After every level, you have the option of sharing a .gif replay, which is a ton of fun. The only problem with the .gif creator is that it has an undisclosed time limit on your replays, so it will frequently cut off the early section of the replay. To fix that, just hit "try again" and then finish the level on a higher speed.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you enjoy my reviews, why not follow my curation page?

The early levels introduce you to the basics, with the difficulty and challenge ramping up as the campaign continues.  Easy to learn, difficult to master.\n\nPoly Bridge has that 'just one more go' mentality driving it, challenging you to build better, smarter bridges.  Can you do make it cheaper, more structurally sound, even more elegant, or crazy.\n\nI had planned on playing it for around 20 minutes.  Over two hours later, it's still calling me back.

One of those mysteries is who in their right mind would put me in charge of bridge construction, or you? Well, in Poly Bridge that is your job and the lives of people hang in the balance. Okay, it really isn't all that dramatic but having a degree in Engineering does help. From suspension bridges, arch bridges, and beam bridges and more, you will have to balance cost, effectiveness, and sometimes hope for the best as you try to move cars, buses, and ships across multiple bridges.. What makes Poly Bridge so addictive and fun to play, is the games quality of life features. Everything is easy to nudge, undo, and tinker with. Poly Bridge is a game all about experimentation and the game gives you tools to accomplish this easily. It really reminds me of Besiege, if it was completely about bridge building. Additionally with the 60 levels planned, the game has in-game map editor. Allowing you to construct your own levels and challenges. Giving the game infinite replay value. This takes Poly Bridge to top of its genre, and with a very nice price tag attached as well. If you like physics challenges, bridge construction games. Poly Bridge is a must, if you're not a huge fan of those games but still want something fun to play, like me. There is still plenty for you to enjoy here.\n\nI made a video preview to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/AqLMFpPXhT4\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","August 23, 2015","true","2.0"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","91","29","32","8","4"

It has plenty of levels to play and it has an excellent Sandbox mode.\n\nThe Sandbox mode is the most interesting, though. If you have ever wanted to try a certain bridge or try to make your bridge look like a dragon or some ♥♥♥♥, than Sandbox is the best mode because it allows you to easily, quickly, and efficiently crack out a neat scenario for you to try out.\n\nThe only downside I can find is one you can reasonably expect to be fixed. There is a bug in the game at the time of this review that can basically destroy your progress in a level you're in. From time to time the buttons in the game's ui will not work quite right in that they will do half of the work. Sometimes moving on to the next level can load both levels overtop each other. Another time the level disappears entirely and I was forced to start over.\n\nHowever, the game is quick to pick up, and the devs were nice enough to give you a save/load system per level. That being said, the failure is avoidable for the most part.\n\nOverall, bridge/10 best bridge builder.","July 10, 2015","true","5.0"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","26","28","0","0"

Place road, then support it. The difference is the presentation. This game is beautiful. Its scenery across the 6 worlds are very nice to the naked eye, They have added more tracks in the game so now, there is more calming music for you to enjoy. There is a nice community, which also happen to give you challenges that make you want to pull your hair out, and even make things that are above just creative. It's sandbox has been fixed, a lot of the bugs have been fixed, and the difficulty curve is nice, and truly gets difficult. Honestly, If you think it is a bad game, give it a few more hours, and look at the community tab before giving a rash decition. Well done, and still more to come, as this is still a game in Early Access.\n\n9.5 out of 10, Still not perfect, but very good, and nicely presented. I know that as soon as this game is finally in a full release, it will be worth a 10 out of 10. Most of the problems in my first review have been fixed, and i thank you Dry Cactus for that.\n\nEdit 3: So its been a while since I played the game, and I saw it in my Steam Library and decided to play a few levels again. So whats my view on the game now? It is worse with the recent patches. I DESPISE the new layout. It makes it feel like every other bridge game, but when I first got this game, it felt like a different game, seperate from the other bridge building games. The music is still wonderful, and watching some of the funnier patches are entertaining, but the process is less enjoyable. The game can no longer hold my attention for more than 1 hour. Please, Dry Cactus, at least make an option to go to a different layout for the game.\n\nNow, for the sandbox. Oh, why did you change it. Now, you can still  create the levels, but I spent some time creating the terrain joints perfectly because the blueprint screen (Which, again, I despise although it makes sence) is harder to land. I thought that if it were exacly along the inside, but touching the terrain lines would make it on edge. No. Once again, the old layout was better.\n\nCall me a hipster, or say that I hate change, but the recent patches have made the game worse in my oppinion. The end result is still enjoyable, but Dry Cactus, PLEASE add a different option in the menu. It feels like any other game that you can buy. 6 out of 10. I still recommend it, but definately not as much.","October 30, 2015","true","141.0"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","27","30","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OttoNL/recommended/367450/","OttoNL","OttoNL","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OttoNL/","133 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nKinda rough around the edges. I discovered 10 bugs in 30 minutes. However, 90% of bugs are just small quirks, only 1 bug made it hard to complete a level. And within 12 hours of posting they have responded and started working on them.\n\nWhat makes this game a lot harder is the silly challenges. I expected a bit more serious challenges, instead of just levels where you have to build on top of a rock in the river without them giving you points on the rock on which to mount, so sometimes this game goes from a physics game to a how-much-patience-do-you-have-simulator. This too is something dev's are looking in to. (Update: The new levels are worse)\n\nBut unlike some software and games you can actually build a legit suspension bridge. And you can build squares and not only triangles, so the freedom is kinda great. 1/2 of The Campaign is just a bit 'meh' if you ask me. If you like silly puzzles that take 2 hours of small adjustments, you might love them though. There are also some great levels in there.\n\nSo for me, this is the only bridge building game that is somewhat interesting.\nOh yeah let's not forget about Steam Workshop support :D So there should be plenty levels when it's fully implemented.\n\nEdit: They did fix a lot of things relatively quickly but you still can't move nodes properly in some situations.","July 14, 2015","true","32.2"," 33 of 45 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","33","45","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/367450/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIntroductionPoly Bridge is a game currently in Early Access and it merges two genres (puzzles and simulation) into one seamless, addictive experience. I’ve seen (and played) plenty of games like this before, starting years ago actually, but somehow there always seems to be room for improvement. So here we have the big question: does Poly Bridge bring anything new to the table? And can it be enjoyed if this is your very first time playing such a game?\n\nGameplayI will begin by answering these questions first and will get to the more detailed analysis later.\nNo, the game doesn’t bring anything *truly* new to the table, but it does manage to improve upon (quite) a few aspects and all of these improvements definitely make the game more fun. The result of this is that anyone, new or experienced, can play this game with relative ease.\nPoly Bridge is just one of those games that makes you want to try again and again just to see if you can get better results or to see if you can build something the way you imagine(d). Granted, at first you’ll be limited to the game’s tools and therefore you won’t have access to everything just yet, but even with a limited toolset you can build brilliant bridge constructions.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=524290369\nTo be fair: the goal of the game is to build a bridge with as little money as possible (i.e. keep it below the budget) but the game still allows you to continue if you exceed this budget, as long as the vehicles have passed the flag. That, in my opinion, is an excellent way to pull in all kinds of players; you’re free to do whatever you want as long as you’re able to create and finish a solid construction. In fact, you can choose which level you want to play (almost) right from the start. There’s no set ‘story’ to follow.\n\nThe downside to this design choice is that the ‘true’ goal of the game (build a bridge with limited resources and money) gets lost somehow; it becomes kind of a secondary, optional, objective and I’m not sure if that’s the intention of the developer.\nSure, the main goal is to get the vehicles across the bridge, but let’s face it; the vehicles need to get across anyway. In order to do that you need to build a solid bridge in the first place. So the way I see it it’s some sort of secondary objective, really.\nStill, I like it the way it is currently handled and I’m sure there are many others that share that sentiment, but I just wanted to address it for a bit. Please keep in mind that it’s my point of view and you might feel different about it.\n\nThe interface is easy and intuitive: in the top left corner you have your usual menu, in the top center you have your budget and available resources (among other things) and in the top right you have the simulation controls that starts or stops the… em, simulation.\nNow, to start building you just middle-click on the screen and you can then select your tools from a radial menu. Right-clicking deletes and item and holding and dragging the right-click button lets you delete multiple objects at the same time. This works extremely well and it’s actually a joy to use, especially if a large part of your construction needs to be revised. Left-clicking obviously places the objects that you selected on the screen. Basically that’s all there is to it. It’s one of the easiest editors I’ve even seen.\nFinally, the building part is done from a 2D perspective, seen from the side, and it’s great to see your bridge come to life in 3D when you eventually run the simulation (where you can also move the camera more freely).\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=524290418\nAs we know the game is still being worked on, so we can expect more levels and features to be added in the future, but for now there’s more than enough content to keep you occupied for hours. Finishing levels will also unlock new vehicles for use in future levels. Actually, once you unlock a vehicle it’s almost always used in the very next level. And while they aren’t true collectibles it’s still a nice way to keep players interested and they add a bit of a challenge for the levels to come (because of the weight, of course).\n\nAll-in all I’m very impressed with the build so far. I’m happy to say that it’s also being actively worked on and updates appear regularly.\n\nAudio & VisualsThere’s not much to say about the audio; it’s a bit repetitive, but other than that it’s relaxing and non-obtrusive. It didn’t make me want to turn my volume off, which sometimes happens with other, similar, games. So, for that: bonus points!\nThe visuals of the game are amazingly beautiful. They’re low polygon and they have just the right amount of detail. It’s a nice combination of cartoony graphics and realistic objects. See it in motion and you’ll understand what I mean.\nSometimes the physics get a bit messed up (mostly because of collision detection) and so far I haven’t encountered any gamebreaking bugs, but do they affect the graphics. Parts of the objects just get relocated to a different position of that same object then, or ‘break off’ altogether. Still, it all worked fine for me personally, but it did detract from the experience. But I guess you have these sort of bugs and glitches in almost every physics system nowadays. It’s nothing noteworthy really, but still should be mentioned in case you expect a bug-free game here (which you should never expect, to be honest).\nOverall, nothing to complain here. Nothing but clean and stylish graphics.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=524290387\nLength/Replay ValueThe replay value for this game is amazing. You have a GIF creator that lets you save your simulations to GIF format. Also, Steam Workshop has already been implemented so that we can share all of our amazing creations with each other and, of course, this can not be done without the level editor, which is naturally also already included in this Early Access version.\nPotentially, you could play this game over and over again, just to beat your previous scores/budgets. In a way it’s endless (but in reality it’s not). Still, damn good value.\n\nConclusionPoly Bridge is an amazing game for young and old. It’s still needs a little work: right now it can be seen as a diamond in the rough, but I’m confident it will be fully polished by the time it releases, somewhere later this year.\nI have nothing bad to say at all about the gameplay, which is fun and invites you to try out different things. I do have some questions about some of the design choices, though, but fortunately these are kept to a minimum. It’s absolutely worth the current asking price.\n\nToo long, didn’t readPros:\n+ Easy to use editor\n+ Stylish graphics\n+ Plenty of levels\n+ Just plain fun and addictive\n+ Relaxing, non-obtrusive music\n+ Steam Workshop, level editor and GIF creator add tons of replayability\n\nMixed:\n+/- Budget aspect doesn’t seem all that well integrated\n\nCons:\n- Some physics glitches\n- A couple of bugs\n\nPlease note: a Steam key for this game was provided by the developer.\nRating: 7.9 (out of 10)\n\nWant to read more of my unbiased reviews?

So blame any gramatical/spelling errors on the fact that I'm tired)\n\nPoly bridge is a great, educational game! You have to build bridges to pass multiple levels that have different budget limits, materials, cars (They drive over the bridge. car[s] must get to checkpoint[s] to pass the level.) and scenarios. Sometimes, there's a boat that has to get past, so you must build a drawbridge or an overpass so the boat and car(s) can pass. You need a basic understanding of physics, structural forces (Tension and Compression), and gravity (Has to hold itself up, or the car cant get to the other side!) in order to do well in this game (I'm not very good). There is an amazing tutorial, however to make sure you know how to play! I would rate this game 7/10. It can be frustrating. You can spend two hours on one level (Sometimes because you need like ONE more cable or piece of wood)!

Some bugs but overall a good stable game.\n\nThe current early access version does feature the majority of the campaign mode. In the campaign you go through different landscapes known as worlds. Each world has several levels that increase in difficultly and complexity as you go along. The also has a sandbox mode where you can create your own levels, play them and export them online for others to play as well as playing other peoples yourself.\n\nThe premise behind each level in the game is simple, build a stable enough bridge over the water to allow a variety of vehicles to get across using the whatever building resources your given and remaining under budget. It’s a simple concept that in execution becomes a lot more difficult as you progress. Difficulty progression is key in a puzzle based game and Poly Bridge does it quite well.\n\nThere’s plenty of content to get into in the early access build, Poly Bridge is a well-built little game that would also be good for kids. It’s the kind of game that hints at what games could potentially do for education, in this case maths and engineering. One very gimmicky feature of the game is the ability to save replays of your epic bridge failures or wins as sharable GIFS that you can send direct to your social media. The game gives you the space to have plenty of creative flair but is fairly limited in terms of scope at this point however the developers are planning on expanding the game further with more content.\n\nIf you’re interested in the game you’ll get your monies worth in early access and since there will be no price difference between this version and the full launch version it’s a case of picking it up when you want.\n","June 30, 2015","true","6.5"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","11","11","2","0"

As others have pointed out, it's not strictly a bridge building game. Some of the objectives involve building jumps, swings, or any manner of contraption. If you are fine with that then it still represents a fun engineering type game. The main objective seems to be bringing the project in "under cost". You also get a rating for structural integrity, and material footprint (how many linear meters of material you used), but none of this seems to affect the campaign in any way. If you bring all the bridges in under cost then you unlock unlimited resources for the level.  Because a low cost seems to be the main objective, the bridges you build are often on the verge of collapse, and the more you can cheap out the better. The levels are challenging, and it can sometimes take hours to find a good solution.\n\nCriticisms:\n- The simulation is not consistent, between runs an identical bridge will perform differently with no real rhyme or reason. This is frustrating because you are often working very close to the edge of failure and engineering each part to take a precise amount of stress. The more complex your bridge gets, the more unpredictable the results.\n\n- There is no way to move a point with connected materials, so if you make a minor change in one place you have to rebuild a bunch of connected stuff.\n\n- There is no way to pause or slow down the simulation so you can see exactly where a failure is occuring. As a result you end up hitting space bar over and over again and watching different areas until you've figured out where the weak point was.\n\n- The tutorial doesn't cover all the ways they expect you to tackle problems in the game. A notable example is 2/12 "Land Brace" where you are expected to have your bridge partially fall and hit against the side of a cliff where it then becomes secure. There are other levels where you can let your bridge rest against a rock at the bottom of the river as well. In a game where your attachment points are clrealy defined large yellow circles, it seems questionable to throw in "hacky" solutions like this. It makes me believe they were originally bugs that were featurized.\n\n- There are UI bugs, sometimes you aren't able to click on things, sometimes the buttons get stuck off screen, just some random stuff that will probably be fixed in the long run. Exiting the level and coming back in has always fixed it for me.\n\n- The campaign is a simple series of challenges. There is no carry over of funds or reputation. There seems to be no acknowledgement of your performance except your own personal satisfaction. You can't go back and see your past solutions, and there is no record of how well you did on a level after you completed it.\n\n- I would like it if you could dig your own pilings or footings at different costs depending on the terrain.\n\n- There is no "stone" building material, so no stone bridges. Also no concrete.\n\nConclusion:\nGood and fun game for what it is. Worth my time and $$$.","April 15","true","45.6"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","2"

The physics is realistic enough to feel right and the levels are well-designed scenarios with a well-tapered learning curve. The game gives you enough freedom to do it right and while giving enough incentives to get creative and cut corners where you can. I'd love for all engineers to play this game as training.\n\nI also can't rave enough about the artistic design here. The color palette, the artistic style and the music all go together beautifully to create a kind of Americana-cute aesthetic that works surprisingly well for this kind of game. It has a very 50s/early 60s vibe to it, like a tribute to a bygone era.\n\nThis is early access though and there are some areas for continuing improvement. The general control scheme is good, but there are some missing options and features (like a simulation pause button!). You'll also come across bugs and unrefined bits, but none of this should dissuade you from buying this one now. I usually avoid early access for a number of reasons, but the core gameplay here is completely ready for users, and the developers have been good about responding to feedback.\n\nIn short, if you like puzzles, physics & strategy games, or ever had fun building a popsicle-stick bridge, buy this game TODAY.

For Poly Bridge, however, I broke my rule, and it was totally worth it.  This game provides many hours of fun bridge building, and many of the scenarios require creative "outside-the-box" thinking.  It's really fun to see what designs work and what ones don't, and you spend a lot of time learning through trial and error.  As someone who has a civil engineering degree, I can attest that this game also follows all of the basic engineering principles, so this game is a great educational tool as well.\n\nThroughout my time playing, I did not experience a single bug.  This game looks very polished, and I think the only reason it is still in early access is because the developers plan on adding a few more levels to the game.  This is an excellent game, and I recommend it to all budding civil engineers out there.","January 13","true","26.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

You have a large budget and you make static bridges that aren't too bad. As you keep going, bridges get harder to make and the challenge is nice. You end up having to be pretty clever for some of the levels.\n\nThe workshop is also nice. There are some real genius levels with genius solutions to match.\n\nAlso, the updates have been nice and have genuinely added to the game.\n\nIf I absolutely have to come up with some cons.... hmm... sometimes the levels can require a bit too much precision where you don't feel like you've learned something or have been particularly clever, but rather you've spent extra minutes doing nothing but optimizing with respect to cost. This is like for 1% of the levels and even as I say this, I note that when I look up how others did those levels, it was actually just that I was stupid... sooo....","May 19","true","57.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Nothing really wrong with the game except more levels (by develpers) can be needed but then the sandbox can be used to get other levels (from users).\n\nOne thing I really want to see is a kind of VS mode where two people have to compete to make the cheapest bridge across a area. I think it would be great and add a new aspect to the game + a multiplayer.\n\nOtherwise, GREAT GAME!","February 14","true","15.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Poly Bridge is the future of bridge building...if you can do it in Poly Bridge...then you can do it in real life! As long as you don't mind casualties. But never mind that we're talking about bridge building yes we are shut up. In Poly Bridge you build bridges to accomplish tasks...that's about it...But it is fairly funny and VERY entertaining. I think it's a very successful game with a long story to keep you occupied and the oppurtunity to try out OTHER people's creations! And you can have creations too! You can create your own map with your own start and finish and post it on the community! Or you could try someone elses' map!

The design is cute and very simple but building bridges can get extremely complicated. The physics of the game is on point and every single part you build affects it. If you decide to put 2 wooden parts under a 30 degree angle and the road under a 20 degree angle while using half of the max length of the parts, you will end up with a completely different thing in case you decide to put a slightly longer wood or road part.\n\nBuilding a functional bridge is easy at start, you can probably finish the first 10 bridges of the campaign in 20 minutes but then it gets insane, there are a few bridges that will take you literally hours to figure out. One wrong cable connection, a tiny mistake of placing a wood part can ruin your entire bridge and make you go insane.\n\nThe first 2 worlds too me 6 hours the first time and 2 hours the second time to complete. The game now has a third world too that I still haven't checked out.\nIt also has Sandbox where you can build your own bridges and share them on Steam workshop. It is still a bit buggy but hey, sandbox didn't exist a week ago so in 2 months I bet we will have a billion community created bridges in a very good sandbox mode!\nYou can also automatically share your bridge wins and fails over Twitter which is pretty cool too!\n\nIf you're interested, watch me get irritated:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IERFtJYwD0","June 30, 2015","true","16.3"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

Or getting two cars from A to B. Towards each other. Or jumping cars across a river and just hoping the bridge doesn't fall down.  I went in not expecting much and got a lot of entertainment out of Poly Bridge. :D\n\nYou get a wide assortment of building materials to use and it's really up to you how you make them achieve the goal set for any given level.  Your only limitation is your imagination... and your budget... and whatever material caps may be in place to keep things interesting.\n\nThe look of this game is really sharp and cartoony and the music is wonderful.  The way the game seamlessly transitions from build to action mode it worth mentioning it looks super good.\n\nDon't let the tutorial fool you the later levels will have you rack your brain trying to win.

It's one of the few genres that allows me to be creative, giving the freedom to eschew the more obvious solution and allowing my mind to come up with something truly innovative. Polybridge, from the developers at Dry Cactus, takes a lighthearted approach to a sometimes sterile genre, tasking the player with building crossings for a variety of different vehicles from a limited selection of construction tools.\n\nThe game kicks off with a handy tutorial, detailing the various building parts, from standard wood beams and iron girders, to the more exotic suspension cables and hydraulic pistons. Each mission has its own budget and set of tools that you must use so, while there is a degree of freedom to be had, you won't be building that multistory crossing with hydraulic lifts over a ten foot gap!\n\nInitially, you'll be tasked with building  crossings for mopeds and family cars - simple stuff, like transporting vehicles from point "A" to point "B". From there on, things become a little trickier. You'll need to account for the weight of multiple vehicles at the same time, meaning you better have enough support beams in place to take the extra load - lest your bridge flop into the ocean like a soggy pancake. Ingeniously, Dry Cactus has included coloured indicators to show which parts of your bridge are most stressed by the load, making it easier to go back to the drawing board for a quick redesign.\n\nLevels play out a bit like a puzzle, and it's up to you as Chief Engineer to decide which structure suits the level best. The game may gently prod you in its own direction, but you are free to go off on your own. For example, some levels may require you to build bridges that will allow boats to pass through - naturally your mind will instantly go to the hydraulic pistons, and while they offer a functional solution, you can just as easily bypass them by building a bridge that is a little higher up than the boats below.  This wonderful sense of freedom is Polybridge's best asset, and I suspect the developer's know this.\n\nAlso included in the game is a robust set of tools for controlling every aspect of your own levels and, better yet, you can share them with the community, so you are unlikely to run out of challenges any time soon.\n\nAlthough the few crashes and glitches I encountered during my time with game did dampen the fun a little, especially when I was working on a new design, they weren't enough to deter me. Thanks to its cute polygonal scenery, sedate music and open gameplay Polybridge is sure to build a bridge to your heart.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPreviewed using a promotional copy supplied by developer.

This is not true.\nIt is far more of a puzzle game them I originally thought.\nThe budget and the material restriction are what make it a puzzel game, not a creative game. If they made a mode/switch where you could turn that off it would be far omre of an enjoyable game for me.\n\nSome levels are very difficult (atleast I found some to be) and will take you a while to figure out (especially with the previously mentioned restrictions). It can get super frustatring at times.\n\n\nI do recommend it, but I wouldnt get it quite yet, becuase this game it definitely not without its bugs and issues. The bugs usually have a work around, but most of the time they are quite frustrating to fix. For example, the "failed level" pop-up sometimes gets frozen in place, and you need to leave the level to make it go away, thus losing everything you built.\n\nThe $13 mark would be the price you pay for a completly finished game of this sort, so its a bit high.\n\nAs for the sand box mode, its incredibly buggy and difficult to use, although its a great concept.

The simple graphics make for a deceptively simple game. However, the in-game physics are challenging and sophisticated enough to provide many hours of entertainment as you make your way through the world, building bridges (and the occasional jump). The only down-side to PB right now is the limited number of levels, but for a new game, it's got enough to keep you playing while waiting for the next update (coming soon).","July 21, 2015","true","785.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You get to build bridges and you can be as wacky as you'd like with construction methods (budget pending) or you can master the art of proper angles and materials for the least expensive and most structurally sound bridge ever.\n\nThe best part is testing the bridge and watching the little scooter, cars, or monster trucks attempting to cross your creations. The animations are awesome and its really fun to see how ridiculous a structure you can make and still successfully get the vehicles across. The best is when you get them across and the bridge collapses as they go! One time bridge use only! :D\n\nThere are a ton of levels and the music in this game is phenomenal. I really enjoy how calm and relaxing this game is to play, yet still requires focus and thought when choosing the materials to build your bridges. Definitely a great game to show to friends. Everyone I've showed always wants to try and make a crazier bridge than the ones I make, and the build in gif-maker means you can quickly share with the world how much of a failure you are at building bridges, or how ridiculously unsafe a bridge can be, and still manage to get people across it.\n\nIt's definitely a fun game to play, and the "play at your pace" style of the game makes it wonderfully accessible for anyone to play, even if you only have 10 minutes to play at a time. It's also great to relax and just play for an hour taking your time and enjoying the music.

I like physic games especially bridge ones as I can sit and work out designs that are effective and smart, you shouldn't find this sort of game frustrating take joy out of making something through trial and error till it works and sit back and enjoy your creation.\n\nAt it's current prices its worth it as the devs have thought about how this game should be played not just how it should work, I can only recommend you buy it as it is one of the best bridge physic games I've come across, plus you get some nice relaxing soundtracks which is a total plus!

It allows you to build crazy non-standard bridges that sometimes make no sense, but work for the task required. Poly bridge doesn't get boring like other bridge building games and keeps me interested. I have only gotten to the Arctic area so far so I can't comment on the rest of the game, but so far every level has been unique and interesting. It is early access but it seems finished and development could stop right now and I would still be happy.\n\nGo buy this game if you like building bridges or just want to have some unrestricted designing fun.","January 2","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I think that saves would feel much more reliable if the window didn't just disappear after saving; it should show the file you just saved. Also, saves would be much more useful if there could be a small picture of the bridge associated with each save file.\n\nAlso, I've encountered an issue where the save file loads the pistons contracting even though I saved them as expanding.

(Notice I said Most. I'll get to that later.)\n- The soundtrack is relaxing, and this is one of the few games I would buy a soundtrack for (Also will mention this later)\n- Customer Suport is extremely good.\n\nCons:\n- Like I mentioned previously, most of the levels offer room for Creativity. Unfortunately, there are a handful of levels that ristrict so many of the peices that there's only a few ways to complete the level. These are by far the worst part of the game.\n\n\nThe game itself, despite the small quantity of poor levels, is extremely fun to play. I'd spent over 10 hours playing the game when my save got deleted, but I enjoy the game enough to replay throught the game again.\n\nWhen I recently started playing the game again, I had some technical issues that were causing my music to create constant popping noises. Long story short, I couldn't fix the audio due to unrelated issues with my PC, and ultimately couldn't play the game with music. When the creator saw my forums post, one of them added me (Christian_Akacro), and gave me a free copy of the sound track to use while playing the game.\n\nLooking through the forums a bit, the creator seem to be extremely active, and seems to respond to any and all messages he can. I really appreciate the effort that's been but into the game and the community, especially considering that it was independantly created.\n\nTo sum up everything, the game is extremely well polished, and is pretty much exactly what the trailers make it look like.\n\n9/10, worth playing through","June 4","true","14.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not that the engineering behind bridge construction is boring of course.\n\nThis particular topic does in fact offer a fascinating history into the 'evolution' and adaptations of bridge-building design; the most famous of which was that of the Tacoma Bridge which the science and engineering communities took a great deal of information from.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mclp9QmCGs","July 21, 2015","true","4.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

But once when you try it you might get positive vibes.\n\nOn sight very simple but yet original and fun sandbox game with very solid mechanics where your mind comes on first place with creativity and sneaky fixing of constructions just to be enough to get success. Make possible for multiple vehicles to cross canyons, water, ships or even balloons from point A to point B with less budget and items as further as you go.\n\nYou will most of the time be limited with budget as its mentioned along with extra items as metal, hydraulics or cables which will cost more then regular road or wood. There are currently 3 different worlds containing 12 levels each where challenges will become harder and they will require more creativity since you will encounter multiple ships or even vehicles which will depend one on another to make both reach their goal point.\n\nVery well planned and created interface with quick remove/add ability will alleviate rage caused by fixing one weak point while you make couple more during progress.\n\nYou can always go through test phase where you can speedup or extremely slow down real time event over your bridge and spot weak points caused by vehicle weight highlighted from green, yellow to red colour until bridge doesnt collapse on those places. Physics are solid comparing to mayority of similiar games and it’s not random so once when you do it, you know what you need to fix, atleast in theory.\n\nOnly imagination and well, budget is limit of your creation, from most simple to most complex solutions so everyone have their own way of making ride possible. Art style along with very relaxing and cool music will keep you relaxed and addicted to game despite rage and not being able to make your perfect planned bridge so overall game is fairly balanced in all aspects.\n\nOh yes, did I mentioned that you can save and share your replays as GIF’s ?\n\nPRO's\n+ ART Style\n+ Gameplay\n+ Physics\n+ Replays\n+ Level Creator\n\nCON's\n- Minor issues with GIF replays","August 17, 2015","true","4.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

While 'Poly Bridge'  lacks nothing in the graphic department, it quickly fails as a physics based bridge game. While most bridge building games use sound engineering principles as their guiding light, and increase the dificulty by setting budgets and locations of increasing dificulty, all the while leaving the possiblity of building a bridge that is both atractive and functional, Poly Bridge instead eshews this antiquated idea, and choses rather to give the user virtually impossible  obsticles to overcome, while saddling them with rediculous materials restrictions (an entirely wooden bridge, which must be piston lifted to allow a large ship through?) artificially limited materials budgets (you are allowed 4 road bed pieces in this map, while the shortest distance between the shores is 5 lengths, Don't wory, you'll find a way!) and downright agrivating scenareos. (build a wooden drawbridge across this gap. There is only one anchor point on the terrain in this map!)\nThe result is not bridges built on sound engineering principles, but rather deranged constructions, fabri-cobbled peicemeal from the ruins of society, designed to hurl vehicles across chasms, to barely survive the transit. While this sort of gameplay seems not out of place in Gary's Mod, or perhaps Lemings, it seems entirely out of place in the pastoral and placid setting of this gorgeous bridge game. This is the QWOP of bridge building games, Or perhaps the Flappy Bird of bridge building games. where your every instict tells you that it should be simple and fun, but the game has been deviously designed to be virtually impossible and unpleasent. Instead of a bridge building game, it is a carefully designed sanity eliminator.\n","April 2","false","6.3"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","8","17","0","0"

The lack of intuitive controls on things like hydraulics, coupled with the lack of readily-available tutorials in-game makes the process more akin to russian routlette than engineering design.  There are few methods for testing beyond relatively uninformed design followed by scores of collapsing structures, avoidable crashes, and the odd inexplicable disaster.  I get that the developers want to add new features, but every significant re-design appears to bring new challenges for little more than the sake of bringing them.  I would recommend you wait until they figure out what they are trying to accomplish.","March 31","false","10.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I first saw Draegast's playthrough and was like: "This game is really cool!" And so I bought it when I got home from vacation. I liked the music in the game, it has a very laid-back tone to it. But honestly, some of the later bridges you have to build are nuts, including a SPLIT BRIDGE, where you have two levels and you have do get one from the bottom to the top and vice versa. The thing I was most excited about was the sandbox mode, but that completely dashed my hopes about this game. It is buggy as ever and my creations would be settled to dust when the editor glitched. I can't even save the darn thing when it does, causing me to immediately start over. I would recommend you get this game if you're a father that's an engineer and wants to spend time with your children on this game. And yes, that may sound silly, but try it. But if you're not a father that's an engineer, You probably shouldn't buy this game unless you like raging at a steel arch bridge completely flopping over.

I'm not really sure why but Poly Bridge is one of the best ones I've played. It has all the simplicity of the genre but adds some really challenging aspects to the gameplay to make each bridge unique. This helps the game feel less linear than other bridge builders out there.\n\nFor more of my thoughts on this game and to see how it plays check out my first look video:\n\nPoly Bridge: First Look and Gameplay","September 2, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would recommend this to anyone who likes a daily dose of rage and FUN!!! I can see myself spending many more hours playing this game. I think this is the best bridge building simulator on the market, it has sandbox (which I don't know of any that do) and tons of levels and i think the workshop is GREAT! I cannot wait to see how good this game will be after it is out of early access!
