I'm not joking. You just choose up to 6 cards and stay one or two minutes looking at the animations as they play out. You don't get to choose who attacks who, or what heals what.

To add to this, the developers attempted to ban any and all reviews that referenced this event as it happened along with screenshot evidence that confirmed it. Censorship by abuse of the ban system. When the steam mods unflagged the screens it left them with the only route of attacking the users, which they did, in my case, calling me a "Hatred liar", see exhibit B:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/qlIAdwM\n\nThis sums up the case against the developer. Now on to the game.\n\nA game that pretends to be something it isn't...\nThe game masquerades as a skill based game but in reality has a massive set of pay to win mechanics laced into the underbelly (see ruby upgrades for cards), the game plays itself automatically with players setting up their choices before the game begins out of their pool of cards, they pick six, and then launch into battle. Now for the single player campaign, this isn't QUITE so bad, as it basically plays out as a glorified puzzle game, you figure out which set of cards gets you through each fight, and then move onto the next one. So that part works out alright, but in the PVP pool, you basically have to guess based on psychic prediction or...\n\n... and here's the punchline...\n... you spend money on buying in the most powerful cards (invariably 4 and 5 stars) which means paying out for diamonds. And then upgrade them using rubies (which will cost you more money). In short, unless you've a significant sum of money, you'll not get into the upper levels of the ladder of this game, you might finish the perfunctory campaign (which hasn't been finished off), but as for PvP, your success is strictly defined by either wasting a LOT of time grinding or pumping in vast sums of real, actual money and converting it into funny currency.\n\nAll into a game which plays itself.\n\nVerdict : Avoid, avoid like the plague, run fast, run far. And keep running until you find a real, actual game, and avoid this sorry, money grabbing excuse of a "Game" at all costs.\n\nAnd now an important note from the Tiger\nEDIT : Since people can't be bothered to read the thread - Personal attacks will be met with an immediate deletion of the offending comment and a "block all communication", which will prevent you from further comment on this review. If the nature of the comment is severe enough, it will be forwarded to the Steam Mod team for review. Stick to the topic, people love to throw mud and all but really, you're not going to win here.

Plain and simple.\n\nFor starters if you really want to play this game, get the mobile version. It's a lot easier to play\n\nI have no problem making in app purchases here and there. Maybe $20 or even $50 on games I like. In most games spending money doesn't give you any real advantage it just lets you progress faster. Epic Cards Battle is not one of those games. Finshing every level of the campaign on all three difficulty levels will require at least a $20 purchase. If you want to win in PVP you will need to spend a lot of money.\n\nWhen I say a lot of money I feel like I need to stress the "a lot" part more. The players at the top of the leaderboards all have win percentages over %85. Many of them win over %90 of the time. These players have invested thousands of dollars into this game. As a free player, or a pay player without the deep pockets, you can expect a win percentage around %50.\n\nIn order to compete in the ladders/tournaments you will need the best cards right? First you must pay your way to VIP level 6 in the game. That's gonna set you back about $250. Then you can buy the best cards in the game. The ones that the devs say you can beat with any card but you really can't. The Epic cards if you will. (They are seriously called that in the game.)\n\nOne Epic card will run you $100. Then you have to upgrade it level 50. That's gonna be an additional $500 to purchase the rubies you will need for that. Now of course you will need all of the Epic Cards wont you? Lets just say for fun there are 25. That comes to just shy of $15,000 for the cards and the rubies. Still want to play?\n\nFree players can expect the grind of a lifetime just to aquire the games lower tier cards. Free players will never be able to get an Epic Card. Never.

They offer daily quests that require people to buy Diamonds, their in game currency in order to complete and some of these require the purchase of $200 in order to fulfill the requirement. On top of that, in game gold is very limited. You have a fixed amount of energy to spend on quests and PvP matches unless you buy more or level up. On top of that, packs you buy with Diamonds can also guarantee the highest tier cards in the game. Far too many TCG games are doing this and this needs to stop. If they truly wanted to do away with P2W, they should adopt the system that is used by physical TCG card games.","July 15, 2015","false","4.4"," 55 of 61 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","55","61","2","4"

First of all, this is not a game where you can influence gameplay itself by doing actions - you simply watch cards fight eachother on their own. And no, its not funny at all. Actually, you have to do a lot of math before fighting, because you can see enemy cards and prepare your own deck. And you will be forced to do it for every battle. You have to consider enemy armor and attack types to pick proper cards of vice versa types. Also you have to look into enemy skills to choose a good counter skills - if they heal, you pick a healling-punisher etc.\n\nI admit, it was unique and fresh for a first hour, but then i realised that i simply do not have any good cards to continue game and the only way to get more is to either grind a lot or buy boosters for real cash. The problem is - its very random and you wount get top cards unless you pay hundreds of hundreds dollars. But, even if i will ignore grind/p2w there is another problem - the game gets repetitive fast. You win battles in a seconds, while barely understanding what happened, and tutorial covers only a half of the process.\n\nThere is no real point for all those nice grapchics and animations when the 100% job is done before fights - when you do the math. There is no real story or sufficient explanation of ingame factions. How do you like this one: 'This is a fifth ingame faction, the newest one'... So much info, dont you think? I dont think so! And developers said that this game is out for nearly three years already. Really? In a three years they havent created a good tutorial, a good starting experience for newbies or, atleast, a good UI. There is no even a normal 'Go to main menu' button (or 'mute' for annoying music)! No events for PC version upon release - really bad attitude for CCG. Well, they, apparently, did one event for writing a review... So here it is. But i wount get back into that game again.\n\nI even have thinked about getting my cash back for this game, since i havent yet played full 2 hours, but hey... This is a free to play title xD Atleast so-called 'free to play'. Anyway, this game itself has nothing so special. We already seen all those card rules and creature skills in other 100500 games. We also seen lots of 'naked' girls around and shiny knights on horses. This is BOORING. I want NEW races, new creatures, new planets, not the skeletons, elfs and humans AGAIN, not the common fireballs and lightings... Where is creative minds, where is imagination? Nah, lets just make another clone and call it 'not pay2win, believe us'.\n\nBy the way, got banned by developers for posting negative feedback and pointing things i dont like.

I get it if you have a reasonable opportunity to get gem to get 5 stars card every day or so, but you literally have to log in at least 50 days in a row in order to be given a chance to draw one diamond card. It even forces you to buy battle speed up with in-game currency. What is up with that? To make thing even worst, they limit your play time by a stamina system where you have to wait hours for it to refill. You can spend a lot of real money to replenish it. Stay clear from this game. There is no pro in even playing this since there are seriously no strategy involved at all when the cards battle themselves.\n\nEdit: I got immediately ban from the discussion for making a comment about pay to win in this game. Good job developer. Good job at making an awful game on steam and ban people for voicing their opinions.\n\nFinal Edit (since I can't state my opinion in the forum anymore):\n\nSo far I have seen how toxic the developer of this game is toward the Steam Community. The developers are literally banning people from the forums for stating facts about the game and deleting posts that they do not want to hear about how bad their game is on Steam. They advertised in the game that they want people to review their game for free gems. Obviously, the only ones who going to get the free gems are the one who sides with the developer (positive ratings).\n\nWhat I do not understand is why can this game developer cannot learn from their mistakes. There are so many better strategy based games than this specific game (like Brave Frontier, Soccer Spirits, Hearthstone, EarthCore, Yugioh Duel Generation, and etc). The reasons why the other card/strategy based game is much better than this toxic game is that they give players a chance daily, or weekly, of a high tier card/players (most of them at at least once per week). They also don't limit you to make battle by pure chances (auto battle). As you see, I played many TCG and strategy games from both the Android and the iOs apps store, so I know how what the different between a good game and a bad game.\n\nI also read some of the positive reviewers of the game, in hoping that it might change my opinions of this game. It did not. Rather than making the game feels positive, it feels like some of the positive reviewers tried to justified their ingame spendings. Most of the positive reviews also seem super bias, as if they were trying to get some type of reward *wink* *wink*.\n\nThe last thing that bug me a lot was that it feels as if the developers cares only about fame (anyone seen that Steam Broadcasts post? like seriously) and money (do not be fooled, the only way to the top is by spending money and thats it). The developer does not want to admit it since they want more money, but this is a pay to win game.\n\nAs a final comment, if you think all free to play games should be given a chance, then you are wrong. This one does not deserve a chance with such a toxic developer that does not listen to the people in the community, but rather they like to listen to the sound of money.","July 10, 2015","false","0.4"," 42 of 46 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","42","46","0","0"

Next-Generation Revolutionary cards battle game in 3D with hundreds of stunning battle visual effects. Experience real-time match making and battle with players around the world." -game description\n\nThis game is talking to itself seriously. It is not a hardcore strategy game where every move counts. It doesn't even compare to Hearthstone, MTG or any card battle games. This game is a BRAINLESS simulation card game where RnG and money plays more than you do. The ONLY strategy here is your 6-card pick before you start the battle. The game will simulate the battle for you while you watch it play. RnG will decide whether you win or lose. Your money gives you rarer and stronger cards enhancing your win rate over other players. It is an easy to understand game that doesn't have a complex battle system (it's boring..). The only selling point of the game is the graphics/art.\n\nIf you want to play an overdramatic rock-paper-scissors, then try this game.","July 11, 2015","false","1.4"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","29","35","2","0"

Each card in the deck that you build has its own statistics and unique abilities that come into play during your turn. The only problem is that once you pick your deck and choose to go against an opponent you can't do anything other than sit back and watch as the game plays itself. The outcome of the match is entirely in the hands of the AI that chooses which card on the opposite side is going to get hit with your attack or is going to be affected by your creature's ability. Basically you're at the mercy of rng and more often than not you end up losing the match due to AI's poor decisions. It's especially apparent later on in the game where every turn matters and you have to pray for the computer to choose to attack the right enemy this time around so you can break out from the endless cycle of hitting the rematch button.\n\nOnce the novelty of the game wears off and frustration sets in you'll start noticing all the flaws this game has and stop having fun.\n\nI got to the 8th chapter of the campaign before I decided I finally had enough with AI's mistakes.

Pure Pay2win. Im just playing it for the animu art but even the art is pretty so-so. Has quite a few engrish words and errors in translation.\n\nThe game also plays itself. It's the same card battle mechanic as Rage of Bahamut where you pick cards from your deck and they do all the battling for themselves. The only strategic tactic that goes into this is picking the right cards. Once that's done the numbers and lights flash based on some hidden formula in the code and the battle is over. The beginning tutorial is bascially selecting the same card and pressing the begin button to win.\n\nIn all honesty if it had been any more complicated I probably would have just given up on it immediately. Everything else is far too bad with this game to keep me around if that had been the case.

The game itself gives players little control once a match has begun, and though there is some strategy involved in selecting the cards to be used in any given battle, it really comes down to finding the best unit for any given situation due to the cyclical damage type versus armor type mechanic. There's also a leveling mechanic, but it doesn't kick in until level 10, and without good cards, which are difficult to acquire enough experience points to get to level 10 on in-game gold alone, pressuring players to spend with microtransactions.\n\nEdit (07/13/2015): Although the developer is running a promotion where they have pledged to give in-game premium currency for reviews, and a larger amount of premium currency for a informative (which they've based on word count, rather than reading the actual review), it's been more than 48 hour since I've contacted them as directed by their in-game announcement, and I've yet to receive the premium currency. Let's just say, this whole thing is a mess, and there are better things you could play than this. Take, for example, Card Hunter, which is also a CCG, and is also free to play, and isn't pay to win.\n\nEdit (07/21/2015): It's been more than a week since I originally contacted them and they responded requesting clarification, followed by my own response, and I've yet to receive the promised in-game premium currency. Not only that, but the announcement promising in-game premium currency in exchange for reviews has been removed.

There are so many in game rewards, if you do all you can daily.

You can take as long as you like to prepare a deck. Right now because of my weak cards I spend 25 minutes studying the campaign (AI) opponent's cards(6) and 10 minutes finding the right cards in my own deck for the right attack and defence. My satisfaction comes from completeing the battle victoriously against a hand that has twice my CAP (measures strength).

Without going into too much detail, each card can be one of three types; Creature, Spell or Triggered. Your creatures battle your opponent's creatures directly, and also serve as your life-blood - ie. you win by eliminating all your oponents creature cards. Spell cards provide a wide variety of effects such as buffs, debuffs or direct damage-dealing, while Triggered cards are similar in effect to spell cards, but will only activate under specific circumstances. The actual battles themselves are completely non-interactive, but don't be fooled; in campaign mode at least, selecting the right cards for each challenge increasingly involves strategy and careful forethought - something which caught me by surprise having played a few CCGs on mobile which are largely devoid of any real gameplay.\n\nDuring the 18.5 hours total I've spent playing this game at the time of writing this review, I've completely ignored the cash-shop and PvP elements, instead focusing on campaign mode, daily rewards, and shop items that can be bought with in-game earnings. This is honestly enough. All up, there's probably a good 10-15 solid hours worth of gameplay to be had from campaign mode before you'll hit a difficulty wall, and will have a hard time progressing further without a more fleshed out collection. From there, you'll find yourself logging in for short sessions, mostly to recieve daily rewards, doing a spot of enchanting/combining, and playing maybe a round or two here and there; things I've still found to be satisfying in their own way.\n\nFor the type of game this is, I've found the quality of art on the cards to be a little diasppointing - not bad, but not that great either. Even the 4-5 star cash-shop cards are largely so-so (devs, if you are reading this, commission high-caliber fantasy/ecchi artists to do art on the cards you're expecting people to pay for - they'll sell a lot better).\n\nHaving said that though, I'd definitely recommend campaign mode to any strategy/card/table-top game fans. I can't speak for the competitive side of it, but there is a lot of fun to be had from the free elements alone.\n\n-------------------\n\nUPDATE: Turns out the number of daily rewards is finite. Now that I've claimed them all, it doesn't really feel like there's anything worth logging in for without paying money - which given the quality vs price-point of the paid content, I'm just not enticed to do. Bit of a disappointing end, but I'd still recommend the game.","January 21","true","22.1"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","52","11","21","4","3"

This is where Epic Cards Battle stumbles and face plants itself into the ground. Someone would have to spend months trying to acquire the cards that another person can get for dropping a couple hundred bucks. This creates a huge play-to-win situation. And while I agree that rare cards shouldn’t be “easy” to obtain, it shouldn’t cost $69 for 1 card.\n\nBottom line, if you’re someone who’s loaded with cash, go buy a rare collection of Magic cards or something, because spending money on this game only encourages this type of BS from game developers.\n\nIf you’re poor like me, go spend your money on food or rent, because you don't want to be burdened with the fact that you paid $250 on f-ing virtual cards.","July 11, 2015","false","1.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Needs a lot of window refinement, multitasking while in queu etc, all of which indicate lack of programming skill.  Though could easily be fixed by hiring a decent coder.\n\nProblem the second.\nThe payment mechanic is very poorly implemented, they don't use reward systems often, and they do so poorly, almost to the point where the 'reward' system punishes the player.  A big game design no no.  Example: when you start, the game notified you if you purchase the game premium currency the first purchase is doubled.  This is problematic not only for the developer but the player, as it makes people less likely to do any payment option but a bigger one, for those with thin wallets, an all or nothing approach.  Lastly, the majority of people playing this game are usually not those that are the 9-5 job sort, so they are less likely to want to put in 5 dollars because that means they miss out on the double pay of a greater amount forever after.\n\nLastly, there is a consequence if you purchase a game currency without the bonus, it reduces the bonus of any future attempts by half without notifying you.\n\nAlso the developing team seems a bit small, as per the development quality, and it's been months since an update.\n\nPros.\nCartoon Boobies.","May 3","false","149.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

You can even challenge players in foreign and become the top card player. Join guilds too to increase fame.\n\n>>Positive<<\nGreat Visuals done by the Artists and Mind to establish idea in order to make better cards. Guilds to help other players in working out cards with each other. Can buy with Game Money, cards and get ensured to get 1 card FREE after each 7 gap.\n\n>>Negativity<<\nWhere should I start? This Game doesnt allow you to select which card of yours hits which. Plus, like how your mobile games would be, You pay real money through Credit or SMS to get Blue Diamonds. The Credit also is like seperated in Coins, Red Gems and Blue Diamonds. And the costs arent like small, they are quite high to get Diamonds.\n\n>>Improvement<<\nThe Time Gap could be kept the same but, The player should get the chance to choose which cards should kill, creating a stratergy. The Diamond should be removed. Its a trouble to collect them and a lot of people wont buy. Guilds should now allow trading system. Trading between guild members of cards or Coins.

Normally would not leave a review as in my eye this game is neither good or bad enough to merit one. Honestly the game is a hair further in the bad category so that is why it does not have my recommendation. In the vein of being helpful here is a quick pro/con as I have seen in the game.\n\nCons:\n1) The free packs and random cards are not that good. The packs you purchase with in game gold rarely give you anything good. Mostly get a lot of 1-2 star cards. The packs which claim to give better drops cost a special currency which is really hard to come by in game, but can be bought via cold hard cash.\n2) Mission rewards seem a bit lackluster. To get the better rewards for missions you mainly need a specialized set up requiring certain cards. To get the cards you need to do missions... which require a specilaized set up. Depending on rng you can find yourself in an unfun situation of just grinding away. Also, red gems are hard to come by and you need a goodly amount of them to level cards to make them better.\n3) Limits on how much you can play and ineffecient energy system. Everytime you complete a mission or do something it drains your energy. You get a certain amount of energy a day, and it can be replenished by leveling up. The starting missions cost very little energy to complete, and you level up quickly. The issue is that you hit the cap of your energy and you never receive a lot of energy you get by leveling. EDIT: It appears the energy replenishes faster than I first assumed. This alleviates most of the issue. I understand it prevents people from exploiting things, but if you bing out and play it can prevent you from doing thing you want to.\n4) Basic features are purchaseable via in game gold. Things like being able to view your match after you finish and speeding up the matches are purchaseable.\n5) The farming feature to go back and reap rewards from earlier levels is not really worth it. You only get 20 or so gold and expend a significant chunk of energy. No way to get red gems other than completing quests.\n6) Hints are really not that useful if you do not have the cards. In the 3-4 cases I have used all I got was 6 sets which all included the same 2-3 cards in different orderings. Also, doing what the hint suggests does not always give you victory, there is still a fair amount of rng at play.\n\nPros:\n1) Game plays itself. Been playing this on one computer while playing skyrim on another. Gives me something to do during loading screens.\n2) Card art and music is nice.\n3) Solid rock/paper/scissors mechanics.\n4) Good solid time waster to play while your doing other things\n\nThe game has a good base. And my complaints can be solved if the developers do the following things:\n1) First time through the campaign missions costs no energy.\n2) Implementation of an energy bank. Something that your spare energy that you get by leveling up goes to so it is not wasted.\n3) Better drops in the non-gem packs. At least always give us a 3 star. Have the 1 or 5 random card have much higher odds of giving you but no guaranteed 3 star. While the booster pack randomness stays the same but guarantees you a 3 star.\n4) Easier way to get red and blue gems. More repeatable missions to gain them that do not drain your energy so much. Perhaps a mission that when you play it gives you energy. That way you are always able to play if you want.\n\nI hope my feed back helps.","July 10, 2015","false","56.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I had never played any game with a similar battle system - I don't know if there are -  and I find it great.\nThere are lots of cards, awesome combinations to be made and strategy to acquire.\n\nCons:\nPay to win, like most mobile games. There is no denying it. You can still play and have fun without paying, but you cannot be competitive.\n\nSo, I would recommend checking this game out if you're interested in its battle system and maybe giving it a few hours, but not really more, unless you love it.\n\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play","May 21","true","0.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Miantra/recommended/381560/","Miantra","Pyrithe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Miantra/","248 products in account","After being lured in by the letters TCG, I enjoyed it for a while, but there are too many glaring faults with it that I feel the game is too far beyond being fixable.\n\nFirst, I'll talk about the TCG part of what is wrong with this game.  For those who do not know, TCG stands for Trading Card Game.  The cards are untradable and the game part is pick and pray.  There is no true strategy in the game, it's mostly choose six cards and hope for the best.  The campaign feels more like a puzzle game, trying to figure out the best way to win, then 2 more objectives where you have to win under certain conditions, most of them being "shoot yourself in the foot" types like "This monster powers up when damaged, use 3 weak AoE characters to power him up, then survive for 40 seconds before you win."  Sounds easy, right?  But you have NO control in these battles, which is another issue.  If you could control your own team, you could hold back and then once 40 seconds was up, unleash all hell.  But as I said before, it's Pick and Pray.  You choose your team, then you watch as they fail monstrously.  In a normal match of trying to win, this sort of works... sort of... but in trying to devise a team build which can do some monumental task against all odds, you need some VERY specific cards.  So most of the objectives are undoable until you get 1-3 of these very specific cards to do it with.\n\nThe next issue I want to cover in depth is this pick and pray gameplay.  In the campaign, you can see your opponents deck and pick a team accordingly, but multiplayer you don't have such a luxury.  You have to design your team and then hope your opponent doesn't have some deck breaking card.  For example, you go with a team who focuses on magic damage, but then your opponent has cards that disable and/or destroy spell cards.  GG, you lose and not only do you see that instantly, but you have to watch and wait as you are crushed inevitably.  Any TCG I've played, there is a small amount of luck to it, but usually you can come up with more than one combination of cards or tactics, so even if your ace in the hole is destroyed, you can usually have some back up plan.  No such luck with this one, it's all or nothing because 2 strategies with 3 cards each just weakens your "deck" that much more instead of adding to it's diversity.  The real "strategy" of this game isn't trying to figure out a good tactic, it's how do you defeat said tactic.  Or just spend money to get 5 star cards which are usually pretty powerful.\n\nSpeaking of power, there is also a card "levelling" system, but for the cost of the levels and the bonuses they get, it seems pretty pointless unless you actually go from level 1 to level 50.  In most cases, a stat only goes up one point or so, which is a pretty small drop in the ocean.  In the long run, it's actually rather pointless as I saw no discernable difference in my battles with the few cards I upgraded.  The only point an upgrade had a statistical advantage was in a battle where I needed one card to tank an enemy with Threat targeting, so I gave one level to the tank card so it was one point stronger than the other.  That was the ONLY advantage I saw with levelling in the 20 hours I've played.\n\nNow that my little rant about the problems with the game are out, I will share what I did enjoy from the game.  Mostly the fact that every card had a purpose.  Unlike most of the major TCG's who just make "filler" cards such as Uraby from Yugioh, every card in this game had some use to it and could be properly implemented into a deck.  And there are some good combinations and strategies you can go with, but the gameplay itself is so limiting that it makes them all pretty pointless.\n\nI feel this game COULD be good if a few features were implemented, changed, or removed, such as Trading, more player control over battles (like after the CD completes, then you choose when to trigger the card), actual decks where you draw and play cards from (or a hand where you can hold 6 other cards, then withdraw a triggerable card and summon a new card which then has to charge it's CD as the "cost"), either better card levelling bonuses or scrap the levelling system completely (perhaps just do a branching skill tree for some cards, some that boost a stat or add an alternative ability at the cost of some strength?), making ALL RARITY CARDS available to players and find some other cash shop bonuses that would be worth going for, like new avatar images, or reskinned cards with a different Limited Edition image.  If people enjoy the game enough, they'll willingly spend money on trivial stuff like that.  Many games already do this, Loadout, Awesomenauts, Dream of Mirror Online, etc.\n\nAlso, couldn't hurt to add some bonus to the levels that makes it feel like you are accomplishing something with every level, add stats in for the player themselves that could affect things such as getting magnified bonuses (and penalties) for putting points into a faction loyalty for those who like a specific faction, or a luck stat that increases your rewards from farming, etc.  Then reskill books as a cash shop item, plus it would make the XP gains from VIP more worth spending money for.\n\nI also won't get into too much detail about the drama I saw with the dev in the forums, but your attitude also needs a change.  You need to be the professional, even if others aren't.  I appreciated the fact that you palled around and were there to help many players with their problems, but you gotta change your attitude about accepting criticism.  Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's just straight up hurtful, but you gotta understand that some people out there will hate on your game.  Just accept it, either change what they attacked you for or stick to your guns, but don't single out or attack specific people for a bad review or comment, that will only lose you support, not gain it.\n\nIn the end, I want to see this game succeed, so I won't really abandon it.  If the devs truly want to improve the game, then I hope they will bounce around a few ideas with the community and see what sticks.  Some of mine might be good, or they might be bad, I know a lot of them are undoable due to hardware limitations of phones and such, but the game as it stands right now is far from being something PC users would expect to enjoy.  Perhaps instead of trying to do just a cross platform phone game, you might even just focus on a new, standalone, virtual TCG project that has everything and specifically cater it to the PC market.","July 12, 2015","false","22.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I have only spent 10 bucks in the game to get the intial bonus. I have had a 60-70% win ratio in the ladders and currently holding one of the top ten spots. And no my deck doesnt contain epics nor legendary cards (which after 30d of logins you get 2 of legendary cards). My deck in fact is a mix between 1-3 star cards all of which i obtained the free play way.  The game matches you based on your deck CAP most of the time there are some overmatches but not all are imposible to defeat, yes i have defeated an EPIC card before at lvl 20. And my decks cards are not above lvl 6. This game is not about playing your cards its about strategy all cards of strategic advantages and cons including what they target your job is to prepare you decks before hand or in pro mode select up to 2 cards at a time and if you know your cards you can build to advantage of your oponent. Also same faction cards give bonuses to one another this game is about learning from first hand experience and many of the players help one another.","August 9, 2015","true","63.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

But this game has a lotta problems.\n\nHere goes my "Formal review":\n\nPros:\n-Interesting card art and asthetic. (Note I really didn't care for the boobs. There are other games that do them better.)\n-Interesting deck making and theory crafting.\n-Fairly compelling single player compaign.\n-Tutorial and basic description for each of the mechanics\n- Fairly simple UI\n\nCons:\n-A pay-to-win model that is unlike most CCGs.\n-A giant grindwall.\n-No proper matchmaking for PvP.\n-Very lobsided balancing of PvP.\n-Highest number of dicerolling and RNG I've ever seen from a card game.\n-The horrible chat and guild system.\n-To progress your profile, a huge grindwall or a real cash payment has to climbed.\n\nI love card games. This is an okay CCG with some interesting mechanics but has some very big issues. The first one is the very lobsided card balance in PvP. The star system is basically rarity in games like Hearthstone and Shadow Era. The issue at had is to get the star tier cards is either to pay with real life money or grind away for about a few days for a CHANCE at the highest rarity card. I understand that a free-to-play needs to earn money, but this promotes pay to win in every situations.\n\nAlso another thing is the enhancing system which allows low rarity cards to be effective against higher rarity cards. However, it causes a very bad PvP matchmaking as people with level 1 cards are going against people with level  50 cards. And unlike other games like Hearthstone they actually track the wins/loss ratio. So now the people that pay to get into a situation were the only even fight is against the people that also dumped money on a really hidden game like this. This game is promising with a few changes in balancing, matchmaking, and mechanics.\n\nBut in the end its a autoplay CCG with like barely any strategy involved. Its not that good but it isn't that bad. Play at your own risk of calling ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, getting angry at peopleplaying level 50 4 star cards, and a really bad currency system.\n\nIts ok, it not the best, but its alright.","September 7, 2015","true","28.2"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","0"

I'll take the hate.\n\nDespite the bad reviews concerning this game and the Pay To Win aspect of it, It's a very good game, it's barely a game though.. You see, (you might've read about this from other reviews) there aren't any actual GAMEPLAY mechanics. You pick your cards and let the game play itself for you. Which i can totally understand getting upset about. there is no AI either, each card has their own snippet of "AI" that form the illusion you're playing against someone intelligent. It's designed to make the smartest and most logical choices and i just absolutely love how you can just sit there waiting for the outcome as you're chatting with a friend not having to stress about your next move.\n\nWhat is it that makes the game appealing though? Well for me it's how addicting the game is, i just can't stop playing it, constantly unlocking new cards keeps me going and motivated to continue.\nAnd where the skill truly shows is at the part where you choose your pack of cards to fight your enemies with before the battle. Now that.. Needs both skill and knowledge, since the game gets more and more challenging as you level up.\n\nI also understand people getting upset about the fact that the game really is P2W, if you want to be successful playing online that is... But, it's a Free To Play game with a HUGE campaign scenario.. You don't need Pay to Win for that.\nThe game is also very good at teaching you the basics of the game, even though there aren't any actual gameplay mechanics, the game itself is pretty hard and time consuming to learn.\n\nThe UI also looks pretty cheap which is sort of understandable since this game was a mobile port if i'm correct.\nThere are also quite a lot of spelling mistakes, which really isn't unforgivable in my books.\n\nIt's about time we talk about the accusations concerning the stolen artwork... It would indeed appear so that the developers did steal some of the content from games such as Dynasty Warriors.. Now i may be wrong, maybe they got their permission to use those pictures but i doubt it.\n\nNow you may ask, who do i recommend this game to? My honest and sincere answer would be "For rich folks" or "For Those Of You Who have money instead of skill" Or for those of you who do not value skill as much.\n\nI'm actually one of those people, i enjoy jumping into a game, allowing me to purchase all the good sh*t right from the start.. Allowing me to take a pass from the frustration of slowly becoming better after thousands of matches.\n\nFeel free to start arguments with me about this just remember that i'm not trying to force this game onto anyone, these are just my personal opinions.\n\nI rate : 6.00/10.00","August 5, 2015","true","84.3"," 33 of 72 people (46%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","46","33","72","9","0"

Here shall be the following reasons as to why I like it and why I don't.\n\nFirst off,the game practically plays itself,when it comes to card games I prefer playing something that you can actually control,I tend to just be sitting here drinking my tea the entire time playing this game. So it is quite boring in that aspect.\n\nSecond,it has good artwork,you got you anime characters,etc,myself for sure certainly don't care for the boobs that are on the cards,I just really love card games,that will actually let you play it.\n\nThird,diamonds cost a ton of money,then on the otherside to get all the good monsters you need a ton of diamonds,which results in spending ton of money of course,my one star bear can only do so much,sadly it's also my best card at. lol\n\nFourth,this could be seen as a good or a bad depending how you look at it,they pay you  gems for 100+ word reviews. Personally I would have still wrote a decent review either way around it. I try to always remain truthful and a few diamonds of in game currency doesn't,or will never make me be a one sided review as I personally believe that the gamers deserve to know the truth about a game and of your actual experince on it. Though it could be worse,they could been offering actual steam wallet money.\n\nFifth, You only start the game off with one card which I found weird,cause when I hear "Starter Deck" I expect to get more than just one card in an entire box lmfao so that part was just weird for me cause for a card game I always expect to get a full deck of cards,\n\nSixth,the campaign is okay,there isn't exactly any story to it though it feels like and honestly there is seriously no replay value in it.\n\nMr.Number Seven,The multiplayer is okay,though it still feels like you're playing against an AI,it's still just as boring,but a lil bit more exciting I guess you could say,I guess it just depends who you are, So the game is okay to play in your spare time if you're bored enough with nothing better to play.\n\nSo this is the end of my review,would I recommend this game to a friend? Probably not,though i'll play it ever now and then,but it surely isn't anything i'd spend money on. So would I recommend you to play this game?\n\nDo you like card games? You do? Okay then. Do you like card games that play themselves? No? Well I guess I wouldn't. lol\n\nThough in all seriousness it's your choice if you really wanna try it out,but I have to give this game a thumbs down either way round it. It's just not really worth much and isn't as fun as I really wanted the game to be.\n\nSo in overall I'd give this game a 2/10.\n\n","July 12, 2015","false","9.0"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR AN ACTIVE CARD GAME, THIS IS NOT THE GAME FOR YOU.\n\nECB is a passive card game where you construct a field and, based on the traits of the cards you use, automatically fight other decks.\n\nThere is an obvious PayToWin path, but seeing past negative reviews, most issues coming from here stem from players not seeing other option or have been changed for the better, which is good in my book.\n\nFrom what I've experienced so far, there is definitely a grind to get a free experience from this game. And that's perfectly acceptable compared to other free online TCG/CCG games where there is an equivalent grind. And ECB compensates heavily for that early on with a very extensive campain mode that treats it as a somewhat strategic puzzler.","October 6, 2015","true","48.9"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

The battles are automated so you simply build the best deck you can and let it do the work for you. This is great for someone like me, who is usually multitasking.

I play about 10 regularly right now, some of which are in my library here at Steam.  I enjoy CCG's because of the strategies and thought that is required to be put into them. It's fun to create decks and try them out either in PVE or PVP.  I enjoy making the decisions in battle, determing where to focus my attack, how to defend, what type of utility to employ, etc.\n\nTHIS game...is not like that at all. There are ZERO...and I mean that literally...ZERO decisions that the player has to make in a fight. The computer does everything for you.\n\nWhat you do is merely collect cards, add select them to go into battle each round, and let things fall as they may. It's the same sort of cheesy game found in mobile markets.  If you've played some of those games...you've played THIS one. They all operate on the same premise: select cards to be used before a battle...then watch the ai take over the entire match.\n\nThere's nothing to this game, at all.\n\nI suppose it could be used as an elementary stepping stone to an actual strategy CCG, but then, why? Almost all strategy CCG's have tutorials or ways to introduce new players into the game.\n\nIt claims to be "next generation" yet it's anything but. Next generation is what Hex, Infinity Wars, Spellweaver, etc. are doing. Hell, even Hearthstone has more strategy and decision making than this.\n\nI spend a lot of money on CCG's. I enjoy collecting cards and opening packs...but not just for the sake of collecting and opening...but for the opportunity to be creative with a deck and it's possible strategies.  And that just doesn't exist here.\n\nIt's a good thing that this is a free game, it would have been refunded.  I can't imagine spending money on packs just to let the ai do all the work for the player...but I acknowledge that some players just don't want to think about strategy and just want to let the ai do all the work for them (or have a system in which strategy is not allowed, like this game).\n\nIf you are a fan of TCG's and CCG's because you enjoy creating decks and/or the thrill of making decisions during a match, this game is NOT for you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gatesda/recommended/381560/","gatesda","gatesda","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gatesda/","623 products in account","===Disclaimer===\n\nThere's a promotion going on that offers rewards for Steam reviews (good or bad).  I’m not bothering to take them up on it, though, since I’m more interested in puzzling through the campaign than acquiring powerful cards.  Too much power would make the puzzling too easy.\n\n\n===Short Version===\n\nDon't expect a normal TCG.  All the strategy is frontloaded into deckbuilding, so instead of a frontline commander making small tactical decisions, you’re the general planning the battle on a map in his tent.\n\nThe single-player campaign is a puzzle-TCG hybrid, since you see the enemy's deck in advance and build one to counter it.  Each card has its own deterministic targeting strategy, so if you think it through you can choose how BOTH sides will attack.\n\nThe big issue is complexity.  MtG creatures have three stats that consistently matter (Power, Toughness, and mana cost).  ECB units have seven, so there's a lot to track when running battles in your head.  Overall I prefer traditional TCGs, but it's an interesting, if brain-tiring, twist on the genre.\n\n\n===Long Version===\n\nOther autoplay TCGs I've seen typically fit the "brainless card games" mold the description mentioned, with insufficient differentiation between cards, random attacking, and little strategy beyond optimizing DPS.  Here most of the abilities and attack patterns are influenced by the makeup of the other team, so the precise cards matter.\n\nAs an example, the Dryad is a fast unit that slows down units it hits, but it slows them by even more if they have low base speed.  The Ice Elemental is a weak, slow unit that slows down units that attack it.  Because the Dryad's attack pattern is to maximize its ability, you can divert it to the Ice Elemental by having the rest of your team be too fast to qualify for the stronger version of its ability.  On the flip side, if you're using the Dryad to slow down troublesome cards, make sure it will actually hit what you want it to.\n\nRaw stats still matter, but the type bonuses and penalties mean a card in the proper matchup can hit just as hard as one with twice the base attack.  The situational nature of many of the abilities also keeps more cards relevant.  Try to throw a "one size fits all" deck at everything and expect some inapplicable abilities and ineffective targeting.\n\nAs a game designer, I would have cut the attack/defense types and either defense or HP.  We don't need five stats to determine effective damage; one stat from the attacker and one from the defender is enough.  It cuts some nuance, but the interesting bits can be shifted into card abilities.","July 12, 2015","true","3.0"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","4","16","0","0"

Most Americans are lazy, don't read and want things to be easy.  At first I was losing because I was just spamming random cards with the most stars. After losing a PVP match to someone who used all 1 star cards, I knew there had to be some strategy invovled. Which there is, actually TONS of strategy but a decent amount of reading invovled since there are so many options to counter other players cards.\n\nIt's really not pay to win if you know what you are doing. Like I said, you have to read the cards to see what they counter. I learned enhancing Ice Elementals to level 30 is amazing in PVP. Which is a 1 star card but owns and can control an entire game.\n\nThe game has been around since 2013, so other players have a card advantage and obviously have been getting the day 30 card rewards, which are 4 star cards. If you keep playing you will eventually get free cards that are really good. Just don't expect to be pro in 2 hours like most of these reviews.\n\nThe playerbase averages at about 350ish playing at all times. So you will always have someone to fight in PVP. READ your opponents cards to see why they are chosing them. This game is NOT just about hit points and health points. The daily mission rewards are good, the packs for free currency helps build your collection and login rewards are good.\n\nTips:\n-Buy the 998 coin packs first. (about 5 or 6)\n-Then start to buy the 2498 coin packs.\n-Enhance Ice Elementals to level 30.\n-READ the cards and do the tutorial because there are A LOT of rules in this game.","July 12, 2015","true","82.7"," 4 of 17 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","4","17","0","0"

K.\n\nTL:DR -> This is an enjoyable "free time" game on your phone or PC when you have little time between things you should actually be doing. It's not amazing or even super great. It's barely good, but you could do a LOT worse on a phone. But hey, you could also do a lot BETTER on PC.\n\nLONGER->\nFanservice cards? Yep\nAutomated battles? Uh huh.\nThe best strategy TCG you've played? Hell no.\nIs this a great TCG to take up your main time? Nope.\n\nBUT, this has been a pretty neat distraction so far, and has actually made me think about what I'm going to do in the PvE matches. Other card games I've played on my phone (which is where I started playing this game) are basically "USE MY BEST CARDS LEL" and see what happens. During the campaign in this game, I actually thought my way through fights by picking appropriate cards while keeping in mind the armor types, attack types, cooldowns, card abililties, and cards that would help each other. There's also a timer for each match because you can actually pick cards that put things into a permanent stand still.\n\nEXAMPLE SITUATIONS:\n\nOne on one card fight? Use that card that has bonus dmg when there's only one enemy left.\n\nDuplicate enemies? Use the cards that have AOE attacks when there's duplicates.\n\nCards seem really strong against your puny collection? Try using cards that keep adding to the enemy's cooldown so you can attack 2-3 times before they can.\n\n\nAgain, is this a fantastic strategy game? Gods no. But I'm enjoying myself. Nothing asked me to pay money (yet at level 9) and there's actually a decent amount of battle preparation. I played some PvE while boiling noodles.\n\nOther stuff:\n\nThe music tracks are hilariously short, which is understandable because the matches are supposed to be. If you draw out a fight, you might hear 2-3 different tracks. Also the sound quality is meh.\n\nThe port to PC isn't anything gorgeous but honestly I've seen way worse. It's completely playable but isn't made with the PC in mind, which should be expected.\n\nThere's spelling errors and grammar mistakes everywhere. Which is hilarious.

Also I can't say that the game is a clone HS or Magic, or smth like that, it has its own stylictic, atmospheric etc. Anyway, broz, this thing is not for everyone like all things in the world.\nP.S.: Free to play is never free.

Other than that, it's actually pretty fun. While I can completely agree with the fact that you CAN beat this game just by randomly picking cards, there is plenty of strategy in the game if you actually give it a chance. While some cards attack randomly, most have some method by which they choose the card to attack/heal, which you can use to your advantage.\n\nI do find it shady that they are basically bribing people to give this game a good review, but since the only reward you get for doing it is in this game, wouldn't you have to actually enjoy the game to take the bribe?\n\nIn short: Is this the best card game ever? No way! Is it the worst card game ever? No way! It's got great graphics and music and average gameplay. I wish there was a way I could write this without recommending or not recommending this game, but I'll recomend it, since I'm having fun playing it and it's free(mium).\n\nPS: I'm not taking the bribe, they said the review had to be under 100 words and there is no way I would do that.","July 11, 2015","true","2.0"," 3 of 21 people (14%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","14","3","21","2","0"

While you play you earn gold that you can use to buy more cards which will allow you to build a better deck.  There is a card rarity system in place and the higher rarity cards are strictly better, but you may find lower rarity cards that can counter the higher rarity cards so that you can win anyways with a budget deck.  There are lots of neat daily events you can complete to earn extra gold, and there is a single player campaign that will allow you to earn extra cards, gold, and rubies(used to "level" your cards).  You can also use the campaign to get some experience before launching into online pvp battles!\n\nAll in all, it seems to be a good game so far, it has some interesting mechanics and all of the cards have unique abilities that greatly influence how a battle will play out.  I recommend!","July 11, 2015","true","34.2"," 2 of 20 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","2","20","0","0"

You can enhance cards, level your character, etc.\n\n* Superior strategy and planning - Each campaign level requires you to analyze the enemy's deck, sort through your own, and then cross your fingers that the monsters, abilities, and supporting spells you've chosen are a working strategy against your opponent.\n\n* Quality over quantity - Each match is fairly fast-paced and the number of cards used per battle is 6 [unless I'm mistaken]\n* The individual card's abilties are ridiculously unique, and each card in your deck is useful for a different situation\nbased on its specific capabilities and stats.\n\n* Unique and quality artwork - None of the artwork or UI is reused or stolen from other games. The style is particularly detailed and gorgeous in my opinion. It's a great moderation between some of the other examples that are too cartoonish or hardcore. There is great variety, and another aspect of note is that portraits of women characters are anatomically correct. Fan servicing is tastefully so, and it's realistic anatomically correct and variable.\n\n* Fast load, solid UI, stable framerate, no noteable bugs, stable build.\n\n--- Overall I think it's a great side-game that's fun to play for decent periods of time. It's a solid competitor against the alternatives, and I highly recommend at least trying it.

All of us have probably played a TCG game on our phones and realised ho addicting it can be. I personaly love these kinds of games because i can just ply it in the background while doing other things (watching videos, working on something, playing other games) It's a good way to just pass those few minutes of boredom. Many people here complain about the pay to win etc, etc. I persoanly don't see the problem with it being P2W. It's notl iek it's ment to be competitive and you need the 5 star cards to survive. In my first 2 hours of playing i got x3   4 star cards and they looked very awesome. Which brings me to the seacond thing i like about this game: The art. For a mobile TCG, this has quite nice art. The anime style drawings are HQ and make it enjoyable to look at the cards.\nAnyways, if you've played mobile TCG games and know that all of them are P2W, you should not have any problems with this game.

It`s all tactic what combo you use with your deck.\nProbably all people who voted this down havn't read anything of this commend but simply disliked cause they think its pay2win and everyone has to hate this game not thinking about value of the review.\n\nTo be fair i came into this game thinking about "Hey! Many say its pay2win, me want to play some pay2win games without paying to say : "I won without money" ".\n\nBut is this game realy Pay2win?\nNO it isn't,,  It is like most games: Pay 2 get stuff way earlier\n\nYou can only buy 5star cards with diamonds you can buy with realmoney, thats true\nBUT: There is daily attendance events with diamonds, daily quests that can give you diamonds aswell as 3-5 star cards and some more ways to get them aswell... this might take a while but thats what a tcg is about... its farming for best cards.\nAlso: You can fuse 4 star cards to 5 star cards for free\n\nso: due to so many rewards and free diamonds i can honestly say  it's NOT pay2win, This Game is as much pay2win as Hearthstone... which isn't.\n\nIs it a good game?  YES it kinda is...\nAlthough it isn't a tcg most people think of when they think about TCG's... its roundbased and you just set your combo out and hope that the combo is successfull..\nIt reminds of old Pen n paper games aswell as turnbased browsergames like World of Dungeons.\nIt is imense fun if you give it a try and get into it.\n\nThe Singleplyer campaign is challenging aswell in many parts and you do have to think twice what combo you want to engage.\n\nLike many Cellphone ports this game has a actioncap after which you either have to wait (which i do, hey you can play some other games in the meantime.. simply play this during your daily league of legends loadingscreens and you will be perfectly fine) or pay money to get new points. Friends and guildmembers can give you points aswell.\nIn the early hours of the game you will NEVER run out of points due to 100 points each level up, this might be not the fact in later games.\nAnyone who played asian mmos knows that limited playing is a thing in most free2play pc games aswell. (Chinese/European Dragon Nest servers for example)\n\nThis game looks realy fun and i will invest some time into this, hopefully without spending money only to mash people who payed money. Also the Cards look realy awesome, the animation is top notch.\n\nBtw: 5 star Cards aren't even the best ones ;) 3-4 stars can have the exact same values.\n\nList of Free2play rewards:\nDaily Attendance with cards, money, rubies (for upgrade), diamonds\nEvery 20 hours a free cardpick at the boostershop\nSpecial events from time to time\nFree Campaigngoods\nSome campaign parts are daily grindable again: you can grind diamonds there: up to 10 each day\n(~1 pack a week/1viprank a week/month depending on rank)\n\nPlay:\nYou choose from your cards up to 6 and put them into your field, those cards should work together at best so one for example shredds armor while the other one does extra dmg when armor is down. Then i wait and see how the cards work together. Hopefully you win the match with your combo.\n\nThere are 3 types of cards:\nCharacters, Spells and traplike cards.\nThe characters determine how much hp you have once all your characters are dead you loose the match.\nEverycard as an actiontime of x secounds (cooldown) after which the Card will activate. While Spells and Characters attack directly after the cd is 0, the traplike cards activate only after cd is 0 AND a condition, for example a meleetype unit attacks, is given.\nUse a good combo out of all 3 and you will be successfull.\n\n\nWanna try? 81cd   code to get bonus stuff at beginning, 1 diamondcard and 1k gold","July 11, 2015","true","18.3"," 3 of 31 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","3","31","0","0"

It's easy to figure thing's out and if your not able to figure something out then you can just ask gobal chat for some help and they will kindly help you with some thing. You can easly buy card pack's by farming the gold for them and it should not take too long that i think but again i enjoy farming for stuff so it does not bug me at all but then again some other people don't care for it but there is pvp or pve where you just do mission to move through the main map.

First of all, the game looks nice and clean, the animations are top notch and the character design is generally stunning, I usually spend  a lot of time just staring to each card, zooming in and out, they are so detailed! Now, if one were just to skim through the tutorial and skip click every battle, he would not pay attention to the beautiful and  amazing strategy aspect of the game. It truly feels different from any other TCG I’ve played before, you actually have to sit down for hours and really think a strategy for your team, after all they’ll move according to their nature once in the game. Should you counter your opponent with cheap strategies, send him an entire team of spooky, or just laming it out with CD increasing cards, it’s all up to you!

They don't care if it's good or bad, just so long as you're honest.\n\nThat being said, I love this game.  It's not Pay2Win and it's really really fun.  The turorials are pretty good.  They teach you all you need to know.  The campaign is fun, informative, challenging, and rewarding.  You get tons of gold, cards, diamons, and rubies to expand your collection.  Everything can be bought through grinding, and even those who pay money don't have an advantage over people that spend zero money.\n\nThe matchmaking system is fair, balanced, and fun.  You can get into quick matches, pro matches, and ladder matches - all of which have gold bets to win from.  Quick matches are where you pick your deck and get matched with someone of similar skill.  Pro matches are somewhat of a 'draft' system where you pick two cards, two more, and two more, while the enemy does the same.\n\nThe actual gameplay is weird for americans, or so I assume ( I am american).  You just pick your cards, and enter the battle.  After that the game just plays itself.  At first you might think, "Well how is that fun?" but trust me it is and there's a lot of strategy involved.\n\nOverall this game is fun, challenging, and rewarding.  You should check it out.

Just like about every other card game out there, even mighty Hearthstone.\n\nOne thing that is vastly different about this game, is that you don't actually play the cards in the match. The strategic focus instead is being familair with your cards and selecting the best ones for the task, then the game simulates the results. The cards deal in ranges - such as dealing 100 to 200 damage, so there is some random number generation aspects, that when combined with weaknesses and skills can actually create a pretty diverse approach.\n\nMatchmaking is some of the best. When I started playing Hearthstone, I could find myself getting stomped on in PVP play by someone who had rare cards that were only available in their Solo Adventure expansions. A brutal learning experience. Here, I have no card presently better than 3 stars (it goes up to 5 stars I believe), and in over 25 pvp matches, I've only faced two people who even fielded a 4 star card, and I won 1 and lost 1. That to me is pretty fair for matchmaking.\n\nIt also gets props for being pretty intense, as like old school Magic the Gathering, you can actually have matches that wager cards used.\n\nPros:\n- Solid campaign play compared to a lot of the other card games, with three different difficulty levels for the missions and those missions collected in different chapters (at least three chapters, as that's how far I'm at this point)\n- In game public, guild, or campaign chat\n- Nice artwork\n- Good matchmaking\n- Pro format is interesting with two cards at a time selection between seeing what your opponent has, adds more strategy as you adjust.\n\nCons:\n- User Interface is a little odd at times in trying to figure out where you're at.\n- Somethings are well explained while others aren't,  such as evolving cards\n- If you have a run of bad luck, you can see your energy depleted, which apparently ends your ability to play, which is dissappointing. I've not run out of energy during a play session, but I've come close after getting used to the pro matches.\n","July 10, 2015","true","135.0"," 6 of 49 people (12%) found this review helpful","12","6","49","0","0"

This game is pretty damn fun, and I don't quite understand the hate for it.\nFirst off, the card art is beautiful. The details are amazing, and there are a wide range of cards to work up to (On level 3-1 and still getting 1 star cards, I think that's a good thing when itcomes to the amount of cards).\nAlso, Ilike the fact that everything is automated. It brings new strategy into the game. Rather than just playing the cards like traditional card games you gotta stop and think, like, will this actually win me the bettl?All of that while paying attention to the weaknesses and just all of the information that goes along with one card.\nYes, there are microtransactions. But anyone calling it Pay2Win is stupid, you can get any card, you just gotta work for it, which I personally like (Notice how most negative reviews only played .1 hours ;) )\nThe campaign is very enjoyable. It gets difficult, but it makes you think constantly of new strategies to win. With each mission or level having three difficulty objectives, that give different rewards and get harder as you go through (Also contains hints to help give you an idea of cards to use, which refresh each day).\nOverall, I find this game very enjoyable, also considering that it literally cam out yesterday and hasn't had any updates or improvements added.\n8/10, I see this game going places","July 10, 2015","true","5.8"," 4 of 46 people (9%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","9","4","46","0","0"

It really was surprising to see a different approach to the card genre. It really shows that this is played in short bursts.\nThe game itslef is decided on the Drafting phase, instead of in game\n\n(This is a new game coming to PC so there are quite a few that needs to be changed)\nNeeds improvement on:\nDev needs to update to make it per "Steam" account and not 1 email per device.(This will not be done quickly BUT IT NEEDS TO BE DONE for its success on Steam)\n\nI already informed him\her in the forums but I was informed it was to prevent easy referral points. I would really like to point out that computers can be used by different persons and they would need a different Steam account to play the game anyway.

Each card is drawn with amazing detail and I haven't even seen all of them. The gameplay is deceivingly deep, the mechanics with attack types and defense types are extremely interesting, the cooldown based system of units, spells and trigger cards are brilliant game design. The campaign, although lacking in story is full of innovative missions, with three levels of difficulty for each with better rewards the higher you climb. The grind for cards is almost non-existant thanks to the gold, ruby and diamond system. If you need a certain card rarity, no problem, just take out your wallet.\n\nIf you are playing other card games, you are missing out on Epic Cards Battle(TCG).","July 10, 2015","true","8.2"," 4 of 58 people (7%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","7","4","58","2","0"

This game encourages you to think and strategise based on your opponent cards. It removed the randomness factor that is prevalent in most other TCGs. Personally I have spent real cash on the game but not exactly emptied my fortune on it, its just my way to show support to the developer for a game well made.  No game comes free, in the past, I have spent even more to collect MTG physical cards.\n\nDownload it and give it a try, if you don't like it, then simply walk away. No harm done.

A deck of three or four stars can be beaten by one stars when four stars are supposed to be more powerful. This is because there is not much difference in the attack power or hp as rarity goes up. This defeats the purpose of trying to get rarer cards.

There are also mechanics that make you think tactically in devising a good deck of cards. I do admit that the campaign is fun and somewhat addictive after you have gotten used to how the game works also. Epic Cards Battle also has a very informative introduction, if you're able to absorb written information like a big, dry sponge. Additionally, for any information you might have skipped over, you can easily refer back to any of it, and more, via the in-game library. But that's where the good points end.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice is the anime-esque artwork showing off huge breasts like they're zoo attractions. It may bug you. The next thing you'll notice is this is not a TCG. There is no trading involved whatsoever. CG. But you carry on anyway, because it's fun after the first five minutes.\nEventually, if you follow the single player campaign, you'll come across some missions you, as a free player at least, will struggle greatly in as in order to 3-star the mission, you require either rare cards leveled to ridiculous amounts or those you can pay for. While you can use the in-game coins you get (somewhat easily) to buy new packs of cards, those randomised packs will give you so many of the same more common cards that you probably will never see one that made the menial process worth it.\n\nOnce you've had enough of that you can play against players in a system that has no visible matchmaking rules in place. You'll find yourself going against players who have some of the best cards in the game. Not only that but while you may have struggled to find that one great card you can get from the free packs, these players will have two or three of them, plus other more elusive ones. It is true that you can upgrade your cards by enhancing or via evolution which is necessary to combat these pay-to-win players but it's still a lengthy process that rapidly transfers to a grind.\n\nAs for recommending this game, I still do. It's worth five minutes here and there by having on your phone for while you're out and about, but that's about as far as it goes. Sooner or later, you'll arrive at a strut where you have no coins, unable to get more, and you don't have the right cards. You queue to play against players and find you can't win because they have the best cards money can buy.\n\nThis is a game that uses RNG like no other and a P2W system like no other. It's okay for a free game, but that's it. You're better off with Magic. This game should definitely give you more of a reward for logging in daily. I would rather listen to my girlfriend moan than play this for long amounts of time.","October 3, 2015","true","53.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Besides, the language being applied in this game is often rather stupid.","December 15, 2015","false","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I disliked the idea at first aswell, however after about 30 min I started to think differently and wanted to know more about this game and gave it a fair chanse.\n\nIts about selecting six cards that will fight for you, so all the strategy thinking goes into before the battle! To create a good combo of cards that will lead to victory! And it is alot of fun once you get to know the game more! :)\n\nI recommend it! But if you are gonna give the game a shot, play for atleast an hour so you get the feel for it unlike alot of people that just started the game and gave it a bad review :(","January 15","true","146.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
