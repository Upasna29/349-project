"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shatterwaltz/recommended/214560/","Shatterwaltz","Ibitsu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shatterwaltz/","257 products in account","Title: This confused me for a while. I interpreted it in a manner similar to "George of the Jungle", and spent a good space of time believing that the protagonist was named Mark. Somewhere, deep in my heart, I still believe his name is Mark. As such, I will be referring to the protagonist as Mark for the duration of this review, and afterwards as well.\n\nGraphics: It's like playing a cartoon which is kind of cool. I watched Samurai Jack one time, and he was pretty neat. I like to consider Mark as like his cousin on his mother's husband's side or something. The graphics contain many cool features such as ninjas, lights, and enemies. Some people consider the characters to be two-dimensional, but I think that they're just drawn that way so we shouldn't make fun of them. Everything is nice and fluid, it's like the characters are made of water or maybe filled with *blood.\n\nSound: The characters have voices and they use them to say things like"HURGH" or "BLARGLREGARGLEBLARGH" when you stab them\n\nGameplay: Gameplay is very stealth-centric, meaning it may be difficult to notice at first. Once you manage to spot it, however, you'll be hooked. And so will the guards.\nThere are lots of great ways to sneak around, like kill the guards, or hide from the guards, or scare the guards so much that they shoot their friends and kill them for you #Teamwork2014 #JustGuardThings #Livin'It\nYou get gadgets and they're useful\nYou can think in this game, and I've grown to appreciate how thinking stops time so you can decide where you want to throw things like darts and smoke bombs.\nI find it very distracting how much the game is based on distraction and getting guards to squander their attention on arbitrary things in the environment like the noise mine you threw behind them.\n\nStory: Mark bears the mark of the ninja, which gives him extra abilities. One of those abilities is the ability to take Revengeance upon the bad guys by killing them and stuff. Another ability is to go insane and kill your friends, which would be sad, but I guess they'd stop being your friends when they saw you trying to kill them so then you wouldn't be killing your friends it would just be a mob of angry dead not-friend ninjas which is entirely morally justifiable by comparison.\n\nTitle: 1\nSounds: a lot\nGraphics: Probably more than ten, I wasn't really counting when I played it so I dont know the exact number of graphical assets involved\nStory: 2 if you have the DLC thing, 3 if you count the two different endings based on your final choice.\n---------------------------\nTotal: pretty good game, almost bought again but realized that would be pointless\n\n\n\n\n*This has, in multiple instances of gameplay, been confirmed true.","January 29, 2014","true","9.4"," 180 of 194 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","180","194","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TIZexion/recommended/214560/","TIZexion","[T.I.] Zexion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TIZexion/","159 products in account","Mark of the Ninja is an aesthetically pleasing, 2-D, stealth-based, side-scrolling platformer...a.k.a. a masterpiece. For those of you who want a brief overview without looking at it in the steam store, think of it as combining the best qualities of Thief, Dishonored, and Assassin's Creed and giving it all to you in a different, albeit wonderful, 2-D perspective.\n\nTo give you a sense of the story itself, you play as a ninja (no way, right?) who accepts the "First Mark," a tattoo which imbues mystical powers to the one who accepts it upon their body. While this seems like a fantastic benefit, accepting the mark means sacrificing yourself in the future because the ink is said to drive people to insanity (e.g., hallucinations). Your purpose-without spoilers-is to avenge your clan that was recently attacked by an evil arms corporation by utilizing your newly-acquired powers. As the story progresses, you receive more marks, more abilities, and more means to uncover the irreconcilable truth about your role, your clan itself, and those of power who essentially mean to save and/or destroy it.\n\nNow if this hasn't already got you hooked or clicking off of my review to go buy it, then please allow me to further elaborate the feel of the gameplay. Mark of the Ninja does not care precisely how you play the game...to a certain extent. Yes, the stealth aspect is a given. This is not simply because this is the major theme/tag for the game itself (who knew?), but also because while you can dish out hits, you can't take many more hits than other enemies in the game. This is exceedingly true if you try to go in "weapons blazing" (expect to be punished and killed relentlessly if you do this). Despite this sometimes perceived "limitation" by some players, there are multiple routes and means of accomplishing each level through various stealth-based tactics. You can choose to be cruel, fast, and terrorizing, or merciful, meticulous, and tactful--or even a mix of these depending on the situation/your mood at any given moment! That's one of the most glorious aspects of the game: Freedom of choice to accomplish objectives. Combine this with the gorgeous settings for each level, and the 2-D game does not feel at all linear or dimensionally flat.\n\nFinally, there are a couple of minor details I'd like to state that may or may not apply to other players (skip this if you like):\n1) I admit that I played this game on steam with an Xbox 360 controller and not with the keyboard and mouse. I recommend doing so for the sake of the ease of controls. However, you may have your own preferences and be able to get used to keyboard/mouse controls faster in comparison to me.\n2) At some points my computer lagged terribly due to how many various processes were going on in the game with the visual effects (e.g., when there was a raging sandstorm in one level). The creators even comment upon this minor flaw if you turn on the in-game commentary within the game itself (which I also recommend because it reveals some really awesome facets of the making of the game!).\n3) Mark of the Ninja is a highly addictive game with major replay value. It took me 14 hours to complete it the first time through, and I intend on replaying it once again on new game+ mode in the future.\n\nHopefully, all of the aforementioned reasons will sway you to spend some money in steam to purchase a game that has certainly left its "mark" on me. Please don't think me insane for adamantly urging you to acquire this game instead of letting it sneak past some gamers unnoticed. I recommend picking it up immediately, but if you want to wait until it goes on sale in the steam store that's fine too. I doubt it will let you down regardless :)\n\nIn short, Mark of the Ninja gets a well-deserved 10/10 (ninja) stars in my book, and I'd like to thank Klei Entertainment for allowing me to play through this utterly amazing story.","November 2, 2014","true","13.9"," 126 of 131 people (96%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","96","126","131","5","4"

Lots of fun and great value for money.\n\nOne of those games that caught me by suprise and opened my eyes to the world of 2D stealth games, Mark of the Ninja is a fairly simple idea. You are a 'ninja' that is granted special powers and a terrible curse, and you must fulfill your deadly mission. How?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/csabber3/recommended/214560/","csabber3","Green Lantern","http://steamcommunity.com/id/csabber3/","174 products in account","Before the chit-chat, let me say something upfront: Mark of the Ninja is an exceptional stealth-action game, that will change your way of thinking about Indie titles if you had ambiguous feelings before. It isn't simply a great game, but also has character, story, depth and uniqueness.\n\nOur hero is an unnamed ninja of the Hisomu clan. Just after getting tattooed with an ink from a special flower that will make him have extraordinary power his clan is attacked by soldiers and his mentor is taken hostage. After freeing him, the journey begins. Yes, it's revenge time. It's not the most well cooked stories out there and the ending lacks a real punch, but from an indie title of this kind it's very ambitious. After sending our hero on his mission it is explained to him that the ink under his skin not only will make him stronger but after some time it'll drive him mad. Before that could happen he sworn to commit suicide. But, the mission first.\n\nAs we progress through the levels our hero will learn (we unlock) new abilities that help us deal with enemy soldiers. With the increasing number of light sources, lasers, detectors and enemies the game gets more and more challenging, but never too difficult to frustrate the player. With common sense and orientation you can always find the right path to clear the room or pass by the enemies undetected.\n\nAnd exactly this is the biggest fun source of the game. There isn't a definite way to finish a level or even to solve a room. You have a wast array of items you can choose from and you can use any environmental object to be successful. You rarely HAVE to kill a guard to reach the next room, there's always a second option.\n\nThe game tracks your progress all the time. Finishing a level without being detected or doing all the side tasks in a level will earn you more points to spend on special abilities and more effective distraction/attack items.\n\nWhen you feel the game is beginning to get somewhat repetitive it always throws you something new to play with, to make the fun lasting. You can even change your outfit after some time. And this isn't a pointless dress change you see in many games. With the new suit you get new abilities, but you're reduced with other ones. It is really awesomely balanced, where everybody can find the clothes that fit the player's style.\n\nWith exceptional game design comes exceptional art design. The game isn't the most beautiful you've ever seen nor packs the most polygons, but it's art and it's unique. On the audio side the lighting strikes and dog sniffles are great. The OST consists of well composed pieces that support the ninja-feel and stealth nature of the game.\n\nAfter finishing the game you can start again on New Game + mode which is essentially a hard mode and it's really challenging where your viewing angles are reduced and the enemies are more aware.\n\nMark of the Ninja executes and delivers on every part you can imagine. It's a definitive standard for indie titles. If you like stealth games, play it. If you like 2D action games, play it. If you like platformers, play it. If you want to have fun, definitely play this piece! And, well...ninjas and stuff.\n\nRating: 89/100; Replay Value: 4/5; To Beat: 10-11 hours.","October 6, 2013","true","10.8"," 108 of 123 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","108","123","0","0"

It is very easy to digest and has an alluring simplicity to it; but at the same time it boasts exciting gameplay and a very refined atmosphere.  Elements of 2D platforming, stealth, and action combine to create a distinguished and enjoyable identity for the game. If you generally appreciate this style of game, then you should consider checking out Mark of the Ninja.\n\nThe core gameplay is relatively simple and easy to dive right into.  The controls are mostly comfortable and intuitive, and the design style allows each person to tailor their play to their preferences.  Each mission allows for a little improvisation at times, as there are often different routes you can take to reach your goals. And as you unlock new items and abilities, you can experiment with new approaches to keep the game fresh.\n\nThere isn't much per way of the story, but there is enough information offered to give you a basic purpose to your actions. But even though the story elements are minimal, the game has an outstanding atmosphere.  The art style is very pleasing, especially the hand-painted backdrops. And the lighting effects are exquisite, particularly due to the importance of staying in the shadows. Add in the fitting weather effects and the soundscape and you are left with a truly pleasurable and captivating atmosphere.\n\nMark of the Ninja also was designed to be challenging without being overly difficult. I personally felt that it was perfectly balanced to not be too easy and not be too hard, dwelling within that perfect “Goldilocks-zone” that allows the game to appeal to a vast majority of gamers. And since most people won’t be able to just breeze right through it unchallenged, it can take over a dozen hours to complete— even though it isn’t necessarily a long game. On top of that, there is also a NewGame+ mode to add some replay value for those who would be interested.\n\nIn summary, I posit that grabbing Mark of the Ninja is an easy choice for any true fan of the genre. And due to the high quality of the game design, I also would suggest that more casual fans of the genre give it some strong consideration as well.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","April 23","true","30.0"," 78 of 83 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","78","83","0","7"

In addition, all items have upgrades, for example smoke bomb blocks laser path and vision, but the upgraded one chokes and stuns enemies unlucky enough to be caught inside the cloud.\nIf you're into more offensive gameplay, you can use darts that will incite terror in your poor victim, who will see enemies in every corner, very likely killing his guard-mates. Or you can use flesh-devouring bugs to make a body disappear or kill someone in a noisy fashion *yikes*, or a spike trap... Besides the straight "kill the poor sod who's targeted" effect offensive weapons are very likely will plant fear in other enemies who see their friends perish, so these simple tools actually have much more strategic usage as it would seem.\nOr who need tools? You're a ninja! You can get upgrades that improves your hand-to-hand skills by giving takedown abilities, various ways to catch your enemies off-guard by attacking from above, below, or behind close doors, or you can learn how to float a while after a jump!\nThe best thing in all of these upgrades that there is no skill tree, no various classes - you unlock whatever you want if you have enough points for them. Said points can be acquired by completing levels with 1-2-3 medals - this require you to get enough points for the three tiers.\nAnd now after mentioning points, back to the gameplay. Getting points is actually really easy, and easy to count on. You can get points for killing an enemy, hiding the body, distracting them in various ways, passing them unnoticed, panicking them, etc, etc. The game is made in a way that it can be completed in a non-lethal fashion (though as story requires you to kill the target, he and his guard in chief are killed in both gameplay styles) and you can still easily get enough point on a level to get all 2 medals.\nThe game plays wonderfully. Movement is responsive and easy to get used to, the game features a focus mode that's not breaking the game's immersion while let you aim carefully with your tools / re-think your strategy. All the weapons are very easy to use, their indicators are clear, while the whole system absolutely lacks the feel of spoonfeeding. Basically the game features a system that makes really easy to use your gadgets but doesn't really limits you how and when to use them - for good or bad, depending on your choices and the ability of aim that pesky smoke bomb :)\nI wanted to point out another feature in the game: New Game Plus. You can keep everything you have from the first gameplay, and the game reasonably makes the game more difficult. Guns will kill in one shot, enemies' cone of sight will be invisible, there won't be visual feedback about how far some noises can be heard, and you too will get a cone of sigh: anything above, below or behind you will be heavily blurred. I was tremendously happy to see such change in the game, because the game's difficulty scales not by the number of the enemies, but making the game technically harder, requiring more attention (Which shouldn't be hard after completing it beforehand)\nThe game's visual presentation can be seen as plain at a first glance because of the lot of dark areas, but it's really accurate and original. Various styled levels are presented across the game, from the modern city with it's stark edges, catacombs with darkness and decayed, uneven surfaces to the ruins of an old city where most things just want to fall apart, resulting in various traps unique to that few level.   Between the levels the cutscenes use cartoon-like style, which really fits the overall design, and it's really well done - features tell-tale facial expressions while masking parts of the story. Obviously, there's a lot of work in writing the game's story and make the story, design, style, gameplay elements to fit together.\nAnd as a last thing, still part of the graphical feats I'd like to mention one of the game's cutscene (no spoilers) I've found uploaded here: and the game's final level as both are gems of the art-like presentation in games - I'm sure I'll remember the closing level of the game in decades, it was so strong and influential, uncovering some things from the story while letting others in darkness. Feel free to look it up, but I won't link it here, being an obvious spoiler.\nAt the end, if I'd need to rephrase all these things in a sentence of two, it would be pretty hard, as there's so much great things to say about the game, while I haven't found any negatives. The game perfectly mixes the elements of platformer and stealth games supported by a great variety of tools and moves to enhance the gameplay, while staying similarly outstanding level design, storytelling and art style. Huge bonus point for alternate non-lethal ways, and letting the player experience and discover parts of the levels and the story, the forced focus from cutscenes could have destroy the player's pace, and spoil the feeling of true discovery or enlightenment.\nOne of the best and most rewarding games I've been playing - I honestly recommend it to anyone who likes platform based and stealth(y) games.","October 25, 2015","true","42.4"," 87 of 96 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","87","96","5","0"

Of course you are because it is obvious that stealth is awesome.\n\nThis game is a 2D side-scroller with amazing stealth mechanics in which you play as a ninja who disposes his adversaries as stealthily as possible. Real men and women know that you try NOT to  fight anyone unless you can dispose of them before they see you in stealth games, and that you must continue to start over and over and over and over again so that you can get the best possible stealth scores in a level. We are the true ninja perfectionists and we shall get amazing stealth scores! That is a great aspect of this game too because it has a good amount of checkpoints that will allow you to restart close by and redo the area in either a different way, or just try to do it more stealthily than you were able to do it the last time.\n\nIt really is an innovative and flawlessly made stealth game. Done in the cartoon graphic style it just makes you feel awesome playing it. Especially when you are able to clear out a room and hide every body of the silly guards that you justdisposed of and hid down a grate, or inside a trash can!\n\nThe story is typical ninja on a mission to wrong some right fare. The voice acting and atmosphere are top notch. Sound quality is excellent and the music fits the game perfectly.\n\nThis game is frequently on sale, or in bundles, so if you see it anywhere you would be a foool not to buy it. I pity the fool who doesn't play this epic stealth Indie. 9.5/10\n\nOf course as always, we must mention that the game has Trading Cards. Set is 9 and you get 5 drops. :)\n\nEDIT For Additional Special Edition DLC: I loved this game so much that when I noticed it had a DLC I purchased it immediately. Any reason to play this game again. Currently in the midst of playing with the additional content and the first thing you will notice is that there are several spots that you can activate in which it will give you a pop up to read about the development of the game and the design decisions that were made. These grant additional achievements and give you a nice background on the game. Don't worry, the game pauses while you read these developer commentary pages. If this is your first time through it warns you that there may be potential spoilers, so you may want to disable them for your first run.\n\nI have yet to play the new Dosan who looks to have the ability to do new non-lethal takedowns and carry more items. New level is part of this as well.  I will update this once I do. :)\n\nThe booby trap enemy items are a cool new feature that allows even more stealth trickanery, which is one of the things I love in stealth games. The ability to try new ways of going through levels and score more points.","February 18, 2014","true","19.6"," 78 of 87 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","78","87","0","9"

See Conclusion\nNOTE:I'm reposting some of my old reviews because I adopted an easier to read format (and because for some reason I can't edit my old reviews)\n\nINTRODUCTION:Mark of the Ninja was released in mid 2012 originally for the Xbox Live Arcade and eventually released on Steam. It is a 2D side scrolling Stealth game which delivers gameplay which heavily emphasizes stealth combat (either Lethal or Non-Lethal). It has then received several critical acclaim from both players and critics alike.\n\nThe player takes on the role of "The Marked One", an unnamed Ninja from the Hisomu Clan during the modern (relatively futuristic) world. After a massive attack by a heavily armed and technologically superior mercenary group on your home Dojo, the Marked One awakens to find himself tagged by mysterious tattoos which grant him unrivaled skills and ability. Use this new found powers to drive away the invaders and uncover their plans.\n\nPROS:+ Excellent art style with high resolution art works (essential for a 2D game)\n+ Fluid and very responsive character animation\n+ Excellent Stealth mechanic that places some Triple A titles to shame\n+ Quality sound design (which is very important in a stealth game)\n+ Good character progression that accomodate different playstyles\n+ Fun (and fair) puzzle mechanics\n+ Very responsive controls specially with controllers but...(See CON #1)\n+ High replay value\n+ Relatively large levels with hidden collectibles but most importantly...(see below)\n+ Mission objectives can be approached and completed in multiple ways\n\nCONS:- Keyboard controls are a bit complex and and may need getting used to\n- Some puzzles are repetitive and frustrating\n- Black and White ending (NO SPOILERS): - This game suffers from the Mass Effect 3 Syndrome where the player chooses between ending A or ending B regardless of how you played thus leading to...(See below)\n- Not much incentive to go with the Non-Lethal path (which, to be honest, is a lot more challanging and fun)\n- No non-lethal option for Bosses\n\nCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME. Mark of the Ninja delivers one of the best Stealth experiences since Thief: The Dark Project. The fluid Animation, sound quality and excellent art work gives life to the world.\n\nIt's well worth its full price with its high re-playability and beautifully crafted level designs. It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for long time Stealth players and casual players alike.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/214560/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Mark of the Ninja is a side-scrolling stealth game, developed by Klei Entertainment. It was initially released on Xbox 360 in September 2012, before being released on Steam in September 2013. You play as a nameless ninja in current times.\n\nMark of the Ninja places a high emphasis on stealth. You are able to see how much noise your character makes by moving, or carrying out a certain action by a circular area showing so. Noise can be used against you, or to your advantage, such as creating a distraction to enemies to allow you to pass by. The game does have a combat system, but it is on the basic side. The combat is essentially a small QTE, requiring you to press the button shown on screen in order to carry out a clean kill of the enemy. You are able to use the environment against your foes too, such as cutting a chandelier to fall onto your enemies head, turning on electric wires to shock them, and many more creative ways to cull the bad guys.\n\nThroughout the story mode, you are able to unlock extra mechanics to use, such as sliding kicks, hanging attacks or new tools to use out in the field like smoke bombs. You can upgrade these at any of the upgrade points in the game, using the talent points you have earned.\n\nVisually, Mark of the Ninja ticks all the boxes too. Even though it is only 2D, you can see how much care and attention has gone into making this game look as good as it has. The backdrops in which you are in are gorgeous, plenty of awesome looking characters and bad guys too. Every single bit of animation looks spot on too. All of the characters move so fluidly it is almost perfection. The narrator and all other voice acting are done to an extremely high standard as well.\n\nThis game is by no means easy. You will at times find yourself almost rage quitting at how difficult certain stages are. Some points almost feel impossible until everything just clicks into place. That is what I loved the most about this game. Whilst there is an element of luck involved in a lot of situations, the main points always come from how skilfully your carry out kills, and distractions. If you practice enough, you will eventually heighten your reflexes and senses to allow you to progress.  Upon completing the game, you will unlock the New Game+ mode, which is seriously one of the hardest gaming experiences you will have. Enemies become more intelligent, they will kill you in a single hit, your line of sight is limited to which ever direction you are facing and you no longer have the radius area around you to show how much noise you are making. If you want a challenge, this game mode is certainly going to be for you.\n\nThe single player story mode took me just over 18 hours to complete. This is spread out across 13 levels. Each level has three different challenges/optional objectives for you to complete such as finishing the level in a certain amount of time, finding some special loot or even something as simple as killing a certain about of enemies. This all adds to the replay ability of the levels and gives you something different to strive for.  Even though I have only just started the New Game Plus mode, I can see it taking almost double the amount of time to complete due to how high the difficulty ramps up, whether it is something I see through to the end is another thing though.\n\nMark of the Ninja is a technically sound game as of now. I was able to play in high resolutions with all of the settings turned up. The game needs to be played with a controller though. I tried with keyboard and it just isn’t as reflex friendly compared to a joy stick sadly. Whilst there isn’t any so called multiplayer aspect to the game, you can always take part in the leader boards for each level, which is a nice little touch.\n\nTo sum up, Mark of the Ninja is a seriously must play game. In my opinion it is one of the saving graces of the Stealth genre’s recent surge in popularity. It does everything right, and you will struggle to find another stealth game that is as polished and fun to play as Mark of the Ninja.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chlorique/recommended/214560/","chlorique","Chlorique Queas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chlorique/","696 products in account","Game Info  Name: Mark of The Ninja\nDeveloper: Klei Entertainment\nGenre: Stealth, Lite-Puzzle\nPersonal Thoughts: Not a bad game, the story is a bit rough but when it all comes down together well enough in the finale.\n\nWhat is Mark of The Ninja? Mark of the Ninja is a stealth ninja action game from the developers Klei Entertainment which are famed for their work on games such as Shank, Shank 2, the survival game Don't Starve and lastly the incredibly fun new game Stealth Inc. Like many other of Klei's game the gameplay mechanic is incredible and true to life ninja story in which you are not a badass in a fight but instead requiring stealth to actually take them head on and has elements of puzzle in it although it is a bit light on that front.\n\n\nGraphics\nBeautiful stuff, although unlike shank it's not handrawn due to the limitation of budget and time. The game sprite for guards, Ninja and background is beautiful to look at especially the background I suppose since the game primarily plays in black and white you won't notice all other sprites a lot.\n\nSound\nThe game has a dynamic tempo system where the action on-screen dictates what sort of music and sound you get. For most part the ambient music blends in well that you can hardly hear it most of the time. But when the action gets tough upbeat tempo accompanies you.\n\nGameplay\nThe Ninja, a tool of assassination. An agent of Destruction. A shadow that briefly appears before dissapearing, leaving death and chaos in its wake.\n\nAs a master of sneaking the ninja makes no sound as they move quietly through the level, hunting down their prey but even a master is not capable of hiding their sound completely which is clearly indicate by a circle. Hell everything that make sound in this game has a circle to let you know their radius.\n\nGame has you traversing multiple level each with their own objective and while you can easily dispatch everyone to make the game easier and get more point that way it is far more challenging to just sneak past the guards and avoid them. IF you do want to kill them there are a lot of skills that you can purchase using points earned from completing levels and objectives that will make the job of killing guard even easier. Of course stealth people are not left out either, they have lots of tools at their disposal.\n\nEverything in this game depends on line of sight and sound, guards can't see you in the shadow but can spot you a mile away in the lights and everything produce sound as I said earlier which is indicated by a circle. So far the whole system works very well, most of the time I got caught because I was too busy trying to quickly run through the level. Essentially nothing in this game is truly unfair or hard. There are also enviromental objects that you can use to hide behind, get shot and detected with and to destroy like in most typical stealth game.\n\nThat is until you play the New Game + Mode which severely handicaps you to the level of a normal human being and the game now being several times as hard. It's a 1 hko in that mode.\n\nConclusion\nLike most of Klei's game MotN plays very well with little bugs and glitches and has an incredibly strong gameplay elements to back it up. Sure the story drags on a bit and the levels are easy if you take the path of killing everyone but that is an option I usually prefer. Overall great game, no bugs and glitches so far and great gameplay elements makes this a plus.\n\nDLC\nThe special edition adds a whole new side story mission, new items, 2 new achievement and for the best part: developer commentary. These appear as balloons throughout the game that shows insight to the developers though on the game.\n\nScoring Methology [Courtesy of Meat King]:\n-	S-Rank: excellent\n-	A-Rank: very good\n-	B-Rank: solid\n-	C-Rank: satisfactory\n-	D-Rank: inferior\n\nVerdict: A+ Rank\n\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

The controls are very simple and work perfectly, you'll instantly be able to get into the game and the challenge comes from thinking about how you're going to get past, or kill, the enemies without being detected (as you'd expect from a stealth game). With loads of different techniques you can use, lots of upgrades and the addition of game changing level mechanics, the gameplay always stays fresh, interesting and fun. The storyline is pretty good, it could be predictable to the more experienced gamer but I won't say why in case it gives it away. Art direction is great, it looks sleek, aesthetically pleasing and unique but also aids the gameplay by giving clear indications of line of sights and range of hearing integrated realistically into the setting. Another thing to note is that upgrades are purcahsed with seals, you get seals from completing optional objectives, hidden challenges and as colletibles, which rewards you for your skill and exploration.","December 20, 2013","true","8.9"," 43 of 48 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","43","48","0","3"

Without a doubt, it's the best stealth game I've ever played. Also, you've got many different tools at your disposal, as well as many different abilities, so there are many different ways to beat the levels and a lot of replay value. I've beaten the game both by killing absolutely everybody in increasingly wicked ways and by slipping by unnoticed without harming anybody (except the few Bosses you are required to kill story-wise).\n\nThe animation is very fluid and beautiful. The ninja is graceful like a cat. Dispatching the enemies isn't just fun, but also looks really cool.\n\nThe voice-acting is well-done too. Ora in particular has a really nice voice.\n\nPretty much the only thing I didn't like is the story. It's not bad or anything, but it's the usual story of revenge and betrayal and honor we have all seen a million times before. I'm sure the endings were supposed to be powerful, but I just found them annoying.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/214560/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Mark of the Ninja is a 2D side scrolling stealth title developed by Klie Entertainment as a Microsoft exclusive for PC and the Xbox 360. You take on the role of an unnamed ninja who has awoken with strange markings all over his body in the midst of an attack on his base by a group of armed soldiers. The tattoos give the ninja supernatural powers that can be used to your advantage throughout the campaign, as you attempt to take revenge on the soldiers that harmed your fellow ninjas. Mark of the Ninja is a 100% pure stealth game that boasts a unique art style and some clever level design that makes it one of the most impressive stealth based releases in recent memory.As mentioned before, don’t expect Mark of the Ninja to allow you to defend yourself if you fail at sneaking past soldiers, as this game has a solid focus on stealth. It does give you the option to fight back against your enemies if you are caught, however nine times out of ten you will most likely come out the loser.Moving around the environments was great fun. While a 2D side scroller at its core, Mark of the Ninja allows backtracking and climbing of the environments’ walls which gives a lot of freedom in deciding how you could make your way past enemies. It was extremely satisfying when I eventually pulled off the perfect getaway, and the frequent checkpoints that occurred prevented me from being frustrated. I wish I could say the same about the controls however. On a few occasions they’re a little awkward, especially on PC in situations when the game requires you to click a button and swipe the mouse at the same time to perform an action.Mark of the Ninja goes for the classic Cartoon Network approach in its appearance. The brightly coloured sprites with dark lines around their main features reminded me of shows I watched when I was a child like Samurai Jack and other similar cartoons. It’s all very well animated too, the cut scenes in-between levels are particularly well done and full of character.The ninja you play as doesn’t speak, but the rest of the characters do. The dialogue is your typical ninja affair, with the words “power” and “consequences” being used like they’re going out of style, but it’s solid and when combined with the art design you really start to care about the other characters in the game. The ambient noises that you hear throughout the game are really well thought out as well.The further you are away from an enemy the more muffled their voice is, and the change in your footsteps depending on what location you’re in has a great emphasis on it, which keeps you guessing if you’re taking the best stealth approach or if there’s a quieter way around. Mark of the Ninja is a refreshing approach to the stealth genre, which has seen its fair share of mediocre hybrids of stealth and action over the years.it’s an extremely enjoyable experience that warrants a second play through in order to discover all the possibilities.","December 24, 2014","true","49.9"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","26","29","0","0"

Mark of the Ninja does it perfectly in the genre full of action-stealth games. Firstly, the story in the game is presented with average focus. Still, story about traditions, rituals of ninja clans and treasons all that integrate into a main plot and finish nicely.\nHowever, the gameplay is the "King". Stealth is the main element here, and considering the 2D view from the side, its very convenient to inspect every enemy, object around you or just plan your moves. Before starting a level the game lets to choose from many ninja playstyles - "paths", which allows to use the huge variety of ninja gadgets like traps or various distractions. Another interesting detail is that stealth kills require not only a press of the button, but also additional swipe of the analog stick at the same time. Actually sometimes its a problem, as this element at times fails to work and guards around spot you. Also, every stealth kill, hidden body and succesful distraction gives points and combined with nicely designed challenge rooms, creative secondary objectives add so much fun and challenge to this game.\nThe atmosphere and graphics are dark, as you can expect from stealth game featuring ninjas. Animations of ninja movements are very smooth with nice looking stealth kills. What I really liked is that kills are showed in slow motion, and always looks entertaining.\nSound, music is extraordinary and blends into the game very well. Voice acting is like from a good AAA game.\nAs of length, it takes more than 10 hours to beat and there are a new game plus, additional dlc level.\nOnly bigger problem is that the game freezes often, at least on my new video card.\n\nOverall, Mark of the Ninja will suprise anyone with smart level design and plenty of ways to complete levels. It's an essential game even if you hate stealth or 2D games. And, seriously "Klei", where is the sequel???\n\n9.5/10","September 25, 2015","true","36.4"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","25","29","2","0"

For its very characteristic, blending with stealth gameplay and a metroidvania style, Mark of the Ninja imprints the stock character quintessentially on the history of video games.\n\nI was attracted by the game’s art style at first glance. Dignified atmosphere rendered with dark-toned colors. The brief brushwork of the protagonist’s design is just irresistible. When it comes to action, the depth of background is gorgeous thanks to the multi-layers well-crafted by the talented artists. Appropriate blur effect not only adds artistry but also improves tactics.\n\nIn the name of a dedicated assassin, the scoring system rewards player after successfully performed a silent kill, tossing bodies inside carts or even getting passed through by the guards undetected. Completing secondary objectives of each level matters equivalently. Resulting in getting “honor” to redeem new ninja tools and moves, which could significantly widen your options dealing with the puzzle.\n\nPersonally, I think the game set a benchmark of side-scrolling stealth game.\n\nI played the game using a keyboard+mouse, but the control sucks when sneaking around in a hidden-place, sometimes it just doesn't work. Since it’s a console ported game, a controller is highly recommended for the original experience of gameplay.","January 10, 2015","true","48.0"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","21","24","0","3"

When first hearing about Mark of the Ninja and looking at it , I was reminded of some old school ninja games.The game plays like a 2d platforming assissination/stealh game with puzzle naturally thrown  in.You play the role of a ninja who is tasked with taking care of some major tasks the head of your clan chose. The game touts native controllers and mouse & keyboard controls and strangely enough, the game play wonderfully on both styles.No button lag at all,you can even play using both if you want.\n\nThe game can be anywhere from 10hrs + long depending on if you seek to engage every enemy, and look for each item.\n\n-------Gameplay-------\n\n[---]Combat in this game is very fluid and responsive.You have a choice of going stealth,offense, or both.Going the stealth route you can sneak through vents,crawl walls/ceilings,grapple across trees,poles,freak out guards,distract enemies,and other struckers or use helpful items. The offensive route  you get to assassin people in various ways.There are many kill animations ,which change depend on your killing options you picked.Weapon wise you use a katana for killing and some traps but thats all.This does not make the game limited in any way and actually makes the game more entertaining.\n\n-------Mobs & Mechanics-------\n\n[---]Mobs for the most part can find you via hearing or sight (sorta like Metal Gear Solid). So you need to watch how you approach an area.There are items through the maps that allows you to do things like: hit a gong to draw attenton,destroy lights to get more cover,using items to aide you,etc.The assissination takes place when you are withing range to be able to initiate the animation. This animation is presented in a "quick time" style so if you mess up you will not get a silent kill which the death cries could alert nearby hostiles.\n\n[---]There are no boss fights, but there are some mini boss type targets you have to deal with or avoid.The mobs themselves vary in behavior and ways you need to take  them down.\n\n-------Skills-------\n\n[---]Skills are pretty straight forward in the game.Many designed for hand to hand combat to take down enemies or stun them so you can finish them off.Others are for doing platforming maneuvers like dangling down from a gabble location. In order to unlock these skills and itms you have to earn it. This is done by playing the game, stuff like silent killing,no killing,hiding bodies,etc.Just generally playing the game will determine how many points you earn for spending on skills/items.\n\n-------Visual-------\n\n[---]Graphically this game is fantanstic.The background,forgrounds,levels,effects,etc all ar esplendily done and do not destract you while playing at all. There are some areas you might just want to stop moving and take a moment to look.Truely a visual love fest that might remind some people of great looking tv animated cartoons like Avatar. Thumbs up to Klei with deciding on this visual style for Mark of the Ninja,it works for the games style.\n\n------My final thoughts-------\n\nThe game is great,don't let the fact its an action/puzzle game fool you it is a gem that you will love to replay.Completionists out there will love it and those looking for enjoy a assassination game might find their bloodlusts quinched with this. Playing this game its sure makes being a ninja tops.\n\nGet the game, on sale,full price,in a bundle,w/e get the game its worth playing and the puzzle are not brain busters so you should be fine if puzzles are not really your thing. I spent 17 hours playing it trying to do parts with 100% accuracy and it never got dull.","August 3, 2014","true","21.7"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","24","30","0","0"

How enemies react to disturbances in the environment is a sample of how the AI is solid. There are some puzzles and challenges that help maintain a satisfactory pace from beginning to end, without boring the player. The art work is another highlight as well as animations and sounds, the game is perfect in creating an atmosphere for the player to feel immersed.\n\nThe plot follows the technical aspects, is solid and well-written, there are twists and an ending that can make you think and reflect on the events throughout the game.\n\nPlaying with the DLC, there are comments from the devs and it was a nice and unusual experience, you learn about how the game was built and you can feel the amount of work and dedication that it takes to make a good title like this get to us.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/recommended/214560/","drmircow","Dr. Mircow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/","677 products in account","Mark Of The Ninja is, without any doubt, a solid candidate for the best stealth game in recent years which rivals classics such as Thief 2: The Metal Age and Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, considering that it is essentially a 2D side-scroller.\n\nWhile the story and soundtrack are interesting enough to notice them, the gameplay is where it steals your attention due to its execution being so meticulous and flawless. From the typical stealthy backstabs to avoiding loud noise near guards, it has everything a stealth fanatic would imagine in a wet dream and more. The stealth mechanics are simply fluent and responsive, making them user-friendly. While not all are available from the start, which is somewhat understandable, more can be unlocked based on the player's performance. The various in-game puzzles are also well implemented even if they are generally very easy to figure out.\n\nSurprisingly, the trial-and-error approach here is not as blunt as in other stealth games thanks to the indicator mechanic which shows the player any interactive hotspots within range and the exact throwing distance. This is a helpful mechanic which does not take away from suspense nor ease the difficulty. In fact, it makes the game more accessible while still being challenging. The player can now take their time, plan their moves and then execute them the way they want without the fear of messing up and being immediately punished. There are plenty of opportunities where death can be easily avoided even after a miscalculated move. If this helpful mechanic is not your cup of tea, then there is a Plus Mode which can be unlocked once the main story is completed which removes these indicators, thus ultimately increasing the difficulty drastically for stealth elitists.\n\nWhile not all portions of the map are required to be explored to advance to the next stage, it is satisfying to acknowledge that there are different routes which the player can take which can also lead to potential hidden items through hidden paths. Want to infiltrate the building from the rooftop? Go ahead. Want to crawl through the sewers instead? Go ahead. However, while the game does offer route options, as a whole, it is more or less linear in the sense that these different routes are not always in the same area or, in some occasions, not available at all. There will be moments where a particular underground corridor is the only way to get across to the other side of the map.\n\nThe art direction in the style of Samurai Jack and Xiolin Showdown is fantastic and blends perfectly for a side-scrolling game. The backgrounds are captivating and set the atmosphere fittingly. The lighting effects are also used appropriately and are in fact part of the gameplay mechanic, so it is wise to take down all the lights down a corridor or hide yourself from lightning from the stormy weather in the latter levels.\n\nMark Of The Ninja is one of those games which does what it was designed for so well that its near-perfection is its downfall, weirdly enough. The game is so satisfying and engrossing that by the time you finish it, you want more; a lot more! Also, while the ending has a psychological twist to it and the special cutscene leading up to it is amazing, the overall story does lack depth for someone expecting a deeper story. This is something which keeps the game away from being perfect all-around. Nonetheless, the narrative is solid but nothing special.\n\nConclusively, it is challenging to call Mark Of The Ninja the best stealth game ever created (yet) since it is not perfect as a whole game, but as a stealth game in terms of gameplay it definitely rivals the best classic stealth games out there.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/60Frames/recommended/214560/","60Frames","Fabi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/60Frames/","240 products in account",""Mark of the Ninja surprises with its tremendously good gameplay, but lacks of story and character depth and leaves you behind with unanswered questions."\n\nTL;DR:  Story sucks, but it's totally worth it.\n\n\nNote: This review is only about the main game. I did not play any DLC thus far.\n\nGraphic 9/10 Absolutely beautiful. Though it is personal preference if you like the comicbook style Mark of Ninja comes along, you can't deny that it looks stunning. Animations are fluent, and killing scenes are well put together. It fits the theme and I really love that art style. Only thing I didn't like is the fact that you don't get any options at all to change anything. Only resolutions and some small little things. But  therefore it should run on any pc.\n\nSound 7/10 Overall it gets its job done. Chases are covered by tempting music and there's no point where it gets annoying. Some tracks are really awesome. Could have been a little more music after all, but it was okay. Have to admit here that I'm not a big fan of eastern music. Voice-acting was suitable, but there isn't that much talking anyways.\n\nStory: 4/10 You see, where the dog is buried. It absolutely has no story. And what is presented to you is a pure shame. There is so much potential but none of it was used. Instead you get this forced filler, which doesn't explain anything. You get no backstory of your character or any protagonist / antagonist. And on top of it all: The ending. Very poor. I call it "Mass Effect 3 Syndrome". In the end it doesn't matter which ending you choose since it only changes one cutscene. Lots of potential wasted here. The game could have gotten even better if it had a well told story. Or at least any story that isn't cliché-filled.\n\nGameplay: 10/10 Do you like stealth games? Do you like challenging games? Then here you have it. MOT has it all. As a true fan of stealthing games I now have found my new favourite one. It's even better than Dishonored. You have so many options to go through one stage. May it be thorugh the shafts or through underground tunnels. The choice is yours. You get a few options to get pass enemies by blinding them, killing them with little insects (yup. You heard it right.) and so on. And it is so much fun! I always reloaded after I screwed up to get the perfect way through the level. Even if that took me half an hour for just one stage. I couldn't resist. And you won't either. I don't want to spoil too much of how you get through the levels or what you can do, since that's part of the fun to figure it all out yourself.\n\nDifficulty: 7/10 It wasn't that hard, but it was challenging. Especially those small riddles you get, where you're teleported in another room and figure out which lever is the right one and how you freaking get there in the first place. Lots of fun there. Featuring New Game Plus you have the option to play through it once more if you felt it was too easy. I myself was pleased and sometimes I even raged. Gonna be honest here: I skipped one riddle since it frustrated me so much that I was too dumb to find the solution. Good luck for you! ;)\n\n\nNotable: - I haven't come along one single bug.\n- Lack of options\n- Runs smoothly\n- I completed it in roughly 8 hours which is quite okay for such games. If the story would have been better I'd crave for more, but since it has none it would have gotten repetetive quite fast, so 8 hours is a good deal.\n- You'll get it on Sale for 3 bucks.\n- It has New Game Plus, which is even harder since it takes away your advantages of your hud that shows you how much noise you're doing.\n\nConclusion: Buy it if you love stealth games. If you're looking more for a story-based game you'll be quite disappointed.\n\nThanks for reading, if there are any questions leave a comment below.","June 21, 2015","true","8.0"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","13","17","2","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xelios/recommended/214560/","xelios","Xelios","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xelios/","4978 products in account","Mark of the Ninja is a 2d, sidescrolling stealth platformer. The emphasis here is on stealth, and the devs nailed it. The game is mission-based and you're given three special objectives to complete, three story scrolls to find and three score goals to reach for each mission. You'll earn an honor point for fulfilling each one, which you can use between missions to unlock powers, special attacks, tools and traps. You also earn costumes throughout the game which confer various bonuses depending on which you're wearing.\n\nScore is earned by completing missions with no kills, remaining undetected, distracting guards, triggering no alarms, kills (stealth and creative kills earn more points), hiding bodies etc. The game doesn't punish you for not going the stealth route, and the highest score goals can be achieved either way, but the stealth mechanics are so well-designed it's easily the most fun way to play.\n\nThe mix of 2d environments and the ability to cling to any wall, grapple from surface to surface and crawl through air vents makes getting around quick, and puts an end to the usual complaints of crouching and a plodding pace in games where stealth is implemented. The generous checkpoints also make reloading a thing of the past.\n\nOne example of a great unlockable attack is the ability to lower yourself from a platform in wait, then pull a passing enemy up and hang him from a noose, terrifying any guard who sees the corpse. Terrified guards will begin friendly fire or even run off ledges, falling to their deaths. An example of tool utility is the ability to throw darts to break lights, which distracts guards and allows you to sneak by undetected.\n\nMark of the Ninja becomes progressively more difficult with laser security, collapsing platforms, hounds, increased enemy density and detection radius working their way into the game, and there's an even more difficult NG+ waiting at the end. There is a puzzle room on most levels containing a scroll, and most of them are quite challenging and fun to solve.\n\nNative 360 pad support, achievements, beautiful graphics and perfectly executed platforming and stealth.

The game generally allows for a number of ways to tackle each situation - slipping by completely un-noticed or taking everyone out – building in some replayability to the title as well. Graphics are polished, (K&M) controls are intuitive and slick, and the game’s frequent checkpoint system ensures frustration is kept to a minimum. The game is not without its flaws however – perhaps an inherent flaw with a 2D Platformer is that some levels can tend to get a tad repetitive, and you will occasionally come across the odd trap or room which can be frustratingly impassable.\n\nThat said, ‘Mark of the Ninja’ is a fun, tip-toeing, blade-slashing, somersaulting side-scroller which ultimately succeeds in making the player feel like a real Ninja (powerful, yet vulnerable at the same time), has good replayability and pays homage to the great stealth titles of the past. On sale (at $2.99), the overall package is a steal and Recommended! - Rated (8/10)\n\n\nWant More Recommendations?\nMake sure to click the 'Follow' button on our Curator Page (Link Attached) to get the latest reviews updated directly onto your Activity Feed.

The unnamed ninja protagonist, resting after receiving an extensive irezumi tattoo, is awakened by a female ninja named Ora. Gathering his equipment, the protagonist is able to defeat the attackers and rescue his sensei, Azai, as well as several other members of the clan. Azai tells him about the power of his tattoo and the legend surrounding it, explaining that the ink comes from a special desert flower and grants greatly sharpened senses and reflexes when absorbed slowly into the body, but will ultimately cause one so tattooed with it to descend into madness. To receive the Mark, a ninja swears to kill himself once the madness takes hold. And after that you set on your tale to kill Colonel Karajan and save the clan from his army.\n#thankswikipedia\n\n\nThis game is amazing. It has tons of replay value. Like collecting the scrolls, artifacts, and other stuff. You can get the seals that challenge you to do thing likes stealth terrorize a guard by killing his friend with a spike mine, terrorize a guard to kill his own friends, remain un-detected until a certain area.\n\nThe art style is orginal and good looking. Un-like Shank and Shank 2, this game has you playing more quiet and sneaky approach to your enemies. Using your darts to take out the lights and distract the guards, getting behind and killing them in a swift move. Or just going to no-kills and killing no one.\n\nFor most things, there are different ways to do it. Like getting into a fortress, heavily protected by guards. You can go through the frount door, by the roof, underground, and other ways,\n\nIt's a hard game to beat, but when you do beat it, you un-lock a new game plus. Where the game get's harder. You can not see behind you if you just stay in one angle, you cant see what noise some things make, enemies can kill you in one hit, and  the enemies are more aware.\n\nWhat I rate this game is.....\n9.5/10\nDo yourself a favor and pick this game up! It's wonderful and amazing and a master peice! I hope you think that too.\n\n*Gaben voice* Thanks! And have fun!","November 25, 2013","true","32.1"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wizcreations/recommended/214560/","wizcreations","wizcreations","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wizcreations/","74 products in account","I can't really think of anything this game does wrong.  Mark of the Ninja is a very enjoyable stealth platformer that incorporates pretty much everything I'd want from a stealth game.  Levels are varied enough that you don't feel like you're doing the same thing over and over, and, unlike many other games in this genre, this game doesn't force you to progress through each level at an unbearably slow pace as you wait for the exact moment to move forward.\n\nYou can "see" where enemies are both by sight and sound (their footsteps appear if they're walking).  Various actions will cause loud sounds and nearby enemies will react.  You can run so that your footsteps draw attention, or you can throw daggers at lights, walls, bells, gongs, and even enemies in order to draw attention.  Sounds are indicated by a blue circle that shows how far the sound travels. (Sound circles go away in New Game Plus if you want the extra challenge.)\n\nLevels reward you for achieving perfect stealth kills or for not killing anyone at all.  You need to be careful if going for no kills, though, because if an enemy accidentally walks into a trap and dies, you get credit for the kill, even if you did nothing to attract the enemy to that location.  Each level also has artifacts to discover that boost your score and scrolls that both boost your score and further elaborate the story.\n\nI particularly enjoyed the challenge levels, though I admit they do have a bit more trial and error than I would like to see.  Some of the later levels also require speed and precision in movements, which I find difficult to perform with mouse and keyboard.\n\n\nThe special edition includes Dosan's Tale, a fun and challenging level that occurs chronologically prior to the events of the game and explains a bit more about the tattoo ink.  The special edition also includes developer commentary spread throughout the game which can be turned off if you don't care to see it.","January 27","true","9.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

What the game might be lacking in story, it compensates in splendid stealthy gameplay mechanics, distinctive artstyle, well-designed levels and the smoothness of controls. The keyboard and mouse controls work perfectly fluid and responsive, which allows you to execute silent takedowns with surgical precision. Thanks to the "New Game Plus" mode, unlocked upon finishing the game on standard difficulty, you get a chance to really test your martial skills in a new level of challenge. Getting achievements and getting scores as high as possible is very satisfying and ensures nice replay value. If you're looking for a quality 2D platformer or just are fond of ninjas and a stealthy approach - get this game without hesitation. 9.5/10","August 4, 2014","true","27.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

That's a bold statement... especially since there have been many stealth games to release from then until now. It's also the most historically correct and accurate to life Ninja game that you will ever play.\n\nI'm quite astonished and amazed at the depth and atmosphere this game has even though it's a 2D game and it's attention to detail is on point. Everything is purposeful and that's important in this day of gaming. There is only one thing I would nitpick about when discussing this game, and that would be that I wish the controls would be just a little bit tighter. I'm running the game at 60fps but there is a tiny bit of delay in the controls -Don't let anyone tell you it's not there, they're lying. This response is very noticable after playing Super Meat Boy, Rayman Legends, or other games. It's not a huge deal but it is indeed, slightly noticable.\n\nSurprisingly, even though the levels are 2-Dimensional, they have so many ways you can approach them, they are legnthy and will make you feel like you're in a living comic book. I don't think this is the kind of game that would be fun to watch someone play as much as it is to actually experience. I'd like to compare this game to something like a 2D child of Hitman and Splinter Cell but with Ninja to give you an idea of how the aesthetics works  but that's not the point, the point is that there is an unprecedented amoint of freedom here to tackle your goals throughout.  This isn't something typically seen in 2D platformers.\n\nYou are given a wide arrange of abilities and tools to use at your disposal. These include wall climbing, ceiling dangling, smoke bombs, darts, ect. Even though this is a 2D game, there are object in the foreground and the background to hide in or behind of. So I guess this game can be technically considered 2.25-Dimensional if we wanted to be specific. The game is littered with clever puzzles which will test your ability as a ninja. You will be working with, avoiding, and manipulating lazers, security doors, and other various electronic devices to accomplish each puzzle.\n\nPros  Best stealth game in years\nEngaging level design\nSmart and fun puzzles\nDifferent an interesting art design\nTrue to the Ninja lifestyle\nFull controller support\nCons  Lame soundtrack\nSub-par voice acting\nSlower control response than other similar 2D games\nFinal Thoughts:\nThe story isn't spectacular but the cut-scenes do make you feel as if you're watching Samirai Jack and it is interesting enough, the gameplay outshines the story 150% but the story isn't bad, that's a compliment to the gameplay of Mark Of The Ninja. You get ranked on how you go about each mission, if you kill or show mercy, treasures you nay find, environmental danage and more. You can cut out lights to make things easier for yourself but can you conceal yourself without using darkness? You can kill everyone in the game but can you go through without killing anyone? Test yourself within the 2D that is this game. If you love the true art of the Ninja and not the video game-ized art of the Ninja, then why not buy the only game ever to honor and recognize just that? Finally someone got it right!\n\nRating (8.7 out of 10)\n\nThis review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.","February 26","true","2.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","4"

You play as an unnamed Ninja (called "Ninja" by the developers in the commentary - I always thought it would be cool if his name was Mark) who take on a type of magic tattoo (the "mark") that gives you powers beyond even normal ninjas. The story starts off fairly straightforward (soldiers invade, ninjas strike back) but takes a few interesting turns as it goes on.\n\nYou jump, slide, sneak, grapple-hook and crawl through vents to traverse the levels, and have to deal with a couple of different types of enemies as you do so. You can either play it non-lethal and avoid them (and get bonuses and achievements for doing so) or you can kill them in beautifully animated brutal killing moves. Ninja doesn't stand up to enemies in direct combat, so your best bet is sneaking up and stabbing them, and then hiding their body, or using it as a lure for other enemies (or using it as a grisly trophy hanging from streetlamps, terrorizing other guards).\n\nTo help you with this you have a lot of different tools - your trusty katana is your main tool, but you also have extra things, everything from smoke bombs, distracting light flare and a cardboard box á la MGS, to small spike traps, terror darts and ravenous insects.\n\nThe music is understated and atmospheric, but reacts to what is happening as you play, more intense for escapes/gunfights/action scenes, more tense for sneaking around, and so on. There's a particularly beautiful song for the last level.\n\nThere's plenty of extra stuff to find, do, and collect during each levels, including "challenge rooms" and haiku scrolls. You also get points for doing different things (sneaking by undetected, distracting foes, killing with special moves, etc) and at the end of the level it all adds up, and it gives you a score, and "honor" that you can use to unlock more things. There's a leaderboard as well, if you want to compare yourself with your friends.\n\nAll in all, it's a fantastic game. The Special Edition is well worth it, you get a substantial new level, a new "Path" (basically different loadout with unique features) and some new tools. I 100%'d this game, something I almost never do anymore, but for this game, I enjoyed every second of it.","February 13, 2014","true","33.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

Absolutely shockingly beautiful! I hate watching cutscenes and skip them mostly, but Mark of The Ninja is so different, I watched them all! They are funny, character animations and so good and cool! I love it!\nUsually indie games f*ck up story right? Yeah Mark of the Ninja nailed storyline! It's SO good! You have a huge twist in the end that makes you think about everything you've done until then and it made me sit in my chair for 10 minutes strait looking at my damn screen thinking which ending I should pick (there are 2 endings...). It's quite mindblowing I must say, last time I felt like that was with Bioshock Infinite (Infinite mindblew me a bit more though :P).\nGameplay is also stellar, the map layout/design is incredible, you can take so many routes to reach your objective, there are so many different paths! It's incredible how they pulled this off! The controls are also amazingly fluid and responsive, unlike most stealth games, a sight for sore eyes! The game is also pure stealth-like, and by this I mean you can finish the game without killing anyone (except "boss" targets, and even some you can choose not to kill, rather steal their info or something like that, really genius!).\nThe game also has a bit of an RPG like system, where you get scored based on your level performance (don't worry it's much better done than Hitman: Absolution!), you also have some collectibles to find and objectives during the mission (like destroy 20 light in this mission or get to the end of the level without getting detected), very well thought and Future Soldier-like with I really loved in Future Soldier! It adds replayability! Anyways, with all those collectibles, scores, challenges completed you will be awarded a certain number of points (up to 9) where you can spend on new kill moves, tricks, hiding techniques, new equipment to use, like distraction flares, mines, etc. It's well thought and it encourages various styles of gameplay (between a murderous SOB to a sneaky pacifist, everything works!)\nVoice acting is also pretty good and you care about the characters, they have a personality and makes you get really into this ninja clan your character belongs to and what's happening and figure it all out.\nI though I covered pretty much everythign, the amazing skill point system, the amazing story, the amazing art style, the amazing character development, the amazing sound quality, the amazing and varied gameplay, the amazing and fluid controls! I think that the only think left to say is that there is a New Game +! To add even more replayablity! New Game + isn't shallow like in most games, hell no! Here it's fully implemented, your  FOV is much lower (if you want to see if there a guard or something behind you you really need to turn back, if you want to see if there's someone below you, you need to look down, etc. This makes it a lot harder, besides the fact that in NG+ you die in one shot! so run like hell if you get spotted!\n\nIt's right now 14,99€ it's totally worth it at that full price, at any discount it's a steal! Like I said I was going to score a game if it was an amazing-truly-exceptional exception and Mark of the Ninja is EXACTLY THAT:\n\n10/10! :D Get it now! It truly deserves the Metacritic score it got: 91 for an indie game? Wow It's the same as Fallout 3, more than any CoD game, more than The Witcher 2! It's not as good as Fallout 3 xD but it's really one of the games of the year and like I said one of the best games of all time. This IS true stealth! and like Destructoid said: "Let it stand as the benchmark by which all stealth games are now measured."\nOr like GameInformer: "Tense, strategic, and hard to put down, Mark of the Ninja is one of the welcome surprises of the year."\n\nAgain! 10/10 on my list! I love it!","October 13, 2013","true","13.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The game is broken down into sets of little puzzles, often involving you to kill/sneak by guards in order to open up access to the next area.  The environments are varied from a sewer level to a mansion, to a castle etc.\n\nAt the end of each level your total score is tallied and you get a certain amount of upgrade points which can be spent on perks, or new ways to solve puzzles.  The game has a huge amount of freedom on how any one play through can go and be solved.\n\nThe art style is unique and reminds me of samurai jack, while the animation is very fluid.  The environment is drawn in such a way that you can almost always tell what you can and what you can't interact with.\n\nOverall the game is extremely enjoyable.

You play as an unnamed Ninja (called "Ninja" by the developers in the commentary - I always thought it would be cool if his name was Mark) who take on a type of magic tattoo (the "mark") that gives you powers beyond even normal ninjas. The story starts off fairly straightforward (soldiers invade, ninjas strike back) but takes a few interesting turns as it goes on.\n\nYou jump, slide, sneak, grapple-hook and crawl through vents to traverse the levels, and have to deal with a couple of different types of enemies as you do so. You can either play it non-lethal and avoid them (and get bonuses and achievements for doing so) or you can kill them in beautifully animated brutal killing moves. Ninja doesn't stand up to enemies in direct combat, so your best bet is sneaking up and stabbing them, and then hiding their body, or using it as a lure for other enemies (or using it as a grisly trophy hanging from streetlamps, terrorizing other guards).\n\nTo help you with this you have a lot of different tools - your trusty katana is your main tool, but you also have extra things, everything from smoke bombs, distracting light flare and a cardboard box á la MGS, to small spike traps, terror darts and ravenous insects.\n\nThe music is understated and atmospheric, but reacts to what is happening as you play, more intense for escapes/gunfights/action scenes, more tense for sneaking around, and so on. There's a particularly beautiful song for the last level.\n\nThere's plenty of extra stuff to find, do, and collect during each levels, including "challenge rooms" and haiku scrolls. You also get points for doing different things (sneaking by undetected, distracting foes, killing with special moves, etc) and at the end of the level it all adds up, and it gives you a score, and "honor" that you can use to unlock more things. There's a leaderboard as well, if you want to compare yourself with your friends.\n\nAll in all, it's a fantastic game. The Special Edition is well worth it, you get a substantial new level, a new "Path" (basically different loadout with unique features) and some new tools. I 100%'d this game, something I almost never do anymore, but for this game, I enjoyed every second of it.","February 13, 2014","true","33.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

It is a great stealth game: it uses the stealth mechanism in a decidely puzzle-like manner, but allows vast freedom for problem-solving in any number of novel ways. It is also about as informative as it gets regarding game development: all throughout the game there are info tidbits that can be viewed that tell backstory of the production aspects of elements the player is currently involved with at that point.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/214560/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Ninja's do leave a mark it seems. Well, at least the ones we've seen in Klei Entertainment's side-scrolling stealth flavored platformer, Mark of the Ninja, in which players assume the role of a silent Ninja assassin, ya know, not the evil kind, but the kind that's on a meaningful crusade. Anyway, the game was initially released through Xbox Live Arcade back in September 2012, with a PC version following about a month later.\n\nDon’t expect Mark of the Ninja to allow you to defend yourself if you fail at sneaking past soldiers, as this game has a solid focus on stealth. It does give you the option to fight back against your enemies if you are caught, however nine times out of ten you will most likely come out the loser. I did find it rather odd however that your character, the ninja, would use his sword to kill his enemies when undetected but would start using his arms and legs when faced with up to three gun wielding baddies at a time. It’s obviously a game design choice to cut down on action and punish you for failing, but I still found it distracting.\n\nThe premise is actually quite riveting story and it keeps you going. Sure it's a classic ninja tale, but who would say 'no' to a cool ninja tale? The storytelling is done by offering well-animated 2D cut-scenes between levels. The artists and animators who brought these cinematics (and the 2D character models) to life did an excellent job. The in-game dialogue is brief and to the point. Your clan has been crippled and your Master was captured, so you have to head out and rescue him. That's about it. Of course, things get a bit more exciting later on, but suffice it to say, Mark of the Ninja has a surprisingly satisfying plot structure for a platform game.\n\nMoving around the game's environments is great fun. While a 2D side scroller at its core, Mark of the Ninja allows backtracking and climbing of the environments’ walls which gives a lot of freedom in deciding how you could make your way past enemies. It was extremely satisfying when I eventually pulled off the perfect getaway, and the frequent checkpoints that occurred prevented me from being frustrated.  The gameplay flows really well and can leave you feeling rather accomplished. Killing a room full of guards and hiding their bodies in the sewers in which you attacked them from, and then seeing their buddies walk in and look confused was a highlight for me.\n\nThe game awards points to the player depending on how well each level is played. Extra points are awarded if you locate certain artifacts that are scattered throughout each area. The points you receive can be utilized for upgrading the ninja's skills. Upgrades include unlocking various additional abilities such as new execution moves or other moves such as stronger punches, kicks etc.\n\nThe ninja you play as doesn’t speak, but the rest of the characters do. The dialogue is your typical ninja affair, with the words “power” and “consequences” being used like they’re going out of style, but it’s solid and when combined with the art design you really start to care about the other characters in the game. The ambient noises that you hear throughout the game are really well thought out as well. The further you are away from an enemy the more muffled their voice is, and the change in your footsteps depending on what location you’re in has a great emphasis on it, which keeps you guessing if you’re taking the best stealth approach or if there’s a quieter way around.\n\nOverall, you might say this is one of the most enjoyable platformers I've played in recent times. Mark of the Ninja is a really nice surprise and definitely one of the best indie games I've ever played. There's not much I can criticize about it, other than the fact that it leaves no options for those who wish to resort to pure action during challenges. But if you're a ninja, what would you do? Jump into the fray, guns blazing? No that's not the ninja way.\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","April 25, 2015","true","44.3"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","15","25","0","0"

It has it's twists and turns as you'd expect from any story, and is enjoyable to follow.\nI found the artstyle tastefull. You can probably see if you like it or not by looking at the pictures in the store page.\n\nThe mechanics of the game itself is where the real fun comes out in my opinion.\nThere are several ways to complete a map, be that as an oblivious-to-pain-sword-swinging-maniac, sneaky stealth kills or even non-lethal takedowns.\nThe maps could have been a bit more "explorable", but that's just the sandbox enthusiast in me grasping for straws, trying to squeeze the most out of every corner of the map.\nThe puzzles are on the easy side of the scale, but then again, they are not the main focus of the game and are mostly used as a gateway to "secret" areas or point-loot.\n\nThe controls as snappy and feel nice.\nThere were occasions where I grapple-hooked the wrong ledge, but that is down to my own incompetence rather than the games controls.\nOn my "non-lethal" playthrough certain areas felt a bit too unforgiving, but I guess that is a part of the "non-lethal" challenge. You are an elite ninja killer after all.\n\nUpon completion of the game I wanted more, and that says something since the game actually is decently long.\n\nIf you are still reading this I will not keep you any longer.\nThe bottom line is:\nThis game is great. I had a great experience playing it, and I would warmly recommend it to anyone interested in 2D platformers with stealth elements - even though there are not many games in that genere.\n\nIf you were on the fence about this one I hope this review helped you decide :)","July 1, 2014","true","41.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Coincidentally they also share the trait of each being one of my favorite genres: Deadlight is set in a zombie post-apocalypse and Mark of the Ninja is a stealth sneaking game.\n\nMark of the Ninja is a better game all around. Controls feel smooth, responsive. None of the puzzles really gave me a hard time but that was true for Deadlight as well.\n\nSpeaking of stealth games: major plus points for the Metal Gear Solid reference and the Thief video game franchise references.\n\nOn the other hand, major minus points for the middle-school English caliber "haikus". Extra minus points for being *BAD* middle-school English caliber haikus. English teachers continue to tell people that all a haiku consists of is to fit three lines together in a 5-7-5 syllabic structure, nothing more. This leads to that stupid "refrigerator" nonsense. Most people don't even know what a real haiku is but I'm not here to educate you about it in a review for a videogame. What's worse is that the writers for this game couldn't even do a bad job correctly. They couldn't even write three lines that fit into the 5-7-5, they instead wrote one 17 syllable line and cut it up into three separate lines of 5-7-5 to make it fit. They did a crappy job making crap. That's an achievement.\n\nAnyhoo, on to stuff you probably care about:\n\nThe gameplay mechanics were excellent, especially in New Game + mode. The restricted vision really made the game feel more "organic" somehow. On the other hand, if you are like me and made sure to get 100% on regular mode before moving on, you'll have unlocked all the upgrades for yourself by the time you reach the New Game + mode and it takes most of the added difficulty away again.\n\nThe art style reminds me of that cartoon, Samurai Jack. It's a good thing, really.","August 28, 2015","true","22.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

In other games, you get a knife and some guns. If you're the type of person who likes to kill with the knife (or melee), just to show dominance of your victim, then Mark of the Ninja is for you. 'Cos you got to get ALL of your kills that way.\n\nIf they see you and start shooting at you, you're in trouble. Ninja don't wear body armour. Your weapon is your stealth and speed; they need to be dead before they know you're there.\n\nFortunately there's heaps of ways to kill those unlucky sods: grab 'em from below, hang 'em up from above, pull 'em into a doorway and watch the blood come out, or sneak up behind and do the classic backstab. Just don't get caught in the light, or make too much sound, or you're busted.\n\nBack in the C64/Spectrum days, there was a ninja platformer called Saboteur. Infiltrate the base, get the disk, plant the bomb, and escape in a helicopter. Mark of the Ninja is sorta like that, but more awesome.

I found out half way through the game, terrorizing guards is the best because you can make them kill other guards for you if they get in the way and such.\n\nVery nice characters: A lot of the characters I liked actually, Each one that I met had a different kind of vibe and I loved each one, mainly Dosan and Ora though, Dosan is more of the subtle kind who does things more stealthy than anyone, and Ora is basically your partner in crime, although funny thing is that neither of them do much in the game itself.\n\nFocus: Focus is when you hold down CTRL with a item, it freezes the whole game and lets you pick your options, you can throw darts to break items or grappel onto something with your hookshot, or even give you some time to plan ahead of what the enemies will do, it can be a very useful tool.\n\nTeleportation: At one point you get the final mark for the Ninja and he can teleport a certain distance, it costs a distraction item, but why bother when I can just teleport away from them?\n\nCONS:\n\nStupid ending(spoiler): Spoiler alert, you know the drill, put a metal pot on your head and smack it with a spoon till you can't see or hear correctly, ok, now then, this ending to the story is just awful, it's either you kill you're best friend who's helped you from the beginning who MAY OR MAY NOT be a illussion from the Tattoo and have your Sensei kill you for the sake of the 'clan', or kill your Sensei and save yourself and then it ends.  What, that's it? No actual ending to what happened to the clan or my guy?\n\nGet caught half the time from BS: While I was playing I threw a dart over to break a light, a guard walked over, I was behind him as he was walking over, I got right up to him, he TURNED AROUND, and then looked up, which made me get caught.  You can get caught in some really bulls%$t ways sometimes, and it can get VERY annoying when it keeps happening, trust me you're going to be mashing that Retry Checkpoint button as much as possible.\n\n"No killing anyone" my a$$: Funny, these guys say in the commentary nodes that this game is not about killing, yet, the only way to get past some guards is to kill them, what? That makes no sense, you specifically say you aren't suppose to kill anyone yet that's sometimes the only way to get past certain guards or areas.\n\nStupid idea for some seals: Anyone else noticed this? Like I said, they don't WANT you to kill anyone, yet they make seals, SPECIFICALLY for killing people in a certain area or something, that makes no god damn sense, you make a game for NOT killing anyone, then turn around and make seals which require you to kill someone, that is just weird.\n\nTerrible costumes: If you get a certain ammount of seals for a costume it unlocks it automatically, problems is EVERY SINGLE ONE SUCKS, theres a pure stealth one that gives you 2 distraction items but you don't get a sword, what? I can't knock out the enemies with my hands? Is that too complicated for the Ninja? Then there is one where you get a distraction and tool to kill or distract as well as gain health from stealth killing someone, but you can't use focus to stop time and observe your surroundings.\n\nDosan character: If you do Dosan's special level HE is the ONLY ONE, out of the WHOLE CLAN, who actually knocks out guards and doesn't kill them, why only have one character do this at all? Why not have other characters do it? This is a stealth game where the company SAYS it's not about killing, then does the total opposite.\n\nWhy pick other characters/costumes?: Why the heII should I pick other costumes or characters when I can just pick the default guys without any penalties to using them, WHY THE F%$K ARE THE OTHER COSTUMES EVEN THERE?!?! They all suck and have really annoying penalties that pretty much kill off most of the stealth in it, Dosan is the only one I actually used most of the time, the problem is I can't slow down time with focus because "The game doesn't want you to with him" and it's EXTREMELY IMPORTANT in some areas too.  So they make a game about being really stealthy, then give you a sword to kill people with, then make stupid costumes or use other characters which can HAVE STEALTH PROPERTIES, but totally downgrade them with other abilities like no focus or something, which can be your downfall later on in certain areas, how the f%$k does that work?\n\nWHAT I THINK:\n\nI think the developers of this game took something great but didn't actually put enough effort into some areas, they did in a lot of places, like having lightning show your position or having really planned out levels, but when it came down to the actual stealth of the game I feel they kind of flopped on that part, anyway, i'm going to give it a 7/10, it's fun as f%$k don't get me wrong, but there is so much wrong with the game that I can't really appreciate when you call it a stealth game where you aren't supposed to kill anyone, just seems kind of wrong.","August 28, 2014","true","22.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

With a lack of challenging stealth games in the last couple of years, Mark of the Ninja is a complete breath of fresh air for the genre.\nAlmost a decade after Thief - Deadly Shadows and the last extraordinary game in the Splinter Cell franchise - Chaos Theory - Mark of the Ninja appears as an extremely good stealth-only game.\nYes, it is a 2d-Sidescroller, yes it is more or less an indie-title, but nevertheless, it is one of the best stealth-games ever made.\nthe level design is superb, perfectly tuned to give you a challenge that can only be bested via stealth. there is no running and gunning, especially the last levels are plain unbeatable if you're up to open combat. the game forces you to rely on different stealth techniques, different, well balanced gadgets and to use the surroundings to your benefit.\n\nEvery level has a unique set of traps, enemies and mechanisms. it is absolutely possible to ghost most of the levels, although there are certain parts where combat is neccessary. the character has a good chunk of abilitys and items, that give the player the opportunity to beat levels and dispose of guards in various ways. especially the takedowns are perfectly executed, with lots of different possibilitys, depending on your position and the position of your enemy.\nthe style and artwork of the game are great. this is much like a virtual comic, with stunning lighting and an intense atmosphere. the story is well written. the plot is nothing we haven't seen before, but it is interesting and well done.\n\nthere is absolutely nothing bad i can say about this game. it deserves a top 3 spot in my 10 best stealth games of all time. everyone who loves challenging stealth-games will love Mark of the Ninja. This game has a metascore of 91 and is in a range with games like Chaos Theory, Half Live 2 and Portal. So what the hell are you waiting for?

Despite the fact of being a 2D side scrolling experience, the game really entitles you to go-about a mission however you want. The stealth mechanics are truly phenominal, comparing to games today. The assassination or execution of a security guard can really be used in many ways, including: terrorizing other guards, distractions, clearing a path or even just adding to your body count in the nearest vent. The game is also not very simple, so do find yourself continuously repeating a task for the highest points, as it will produce extreme satisfaction.

Here's some points I'd like to touch on, generally pros with any associated cons.\n\n1. Multiple playstyles - for me, I enjoy playing the ghost; no kills, no detection, no nonsense. That's an option I played through the first handful of levels before I began experimenting with the other playstyles available. Each outfit you unlock has different perks and pitfalls, and my favorite (before the endgame outfit) became the terrifying Oni outfit + playstyle. It's definitely not supposed to be funny, but man I got some good laughs watching guards react to their dead allies... Now, the only downfall here for me is that stealth / ghost is much tougher than in most games I'm acquainted with... without the DLC. This is both a pro and a con. There's only one DLC item for this game, and it came out some time post release to add new content. It doesn't quite fit its price tag for me, yet; this upsets me slightly because I would love to try out those new stealth manuevers, but don't yet have the opportunity.\n\n2. Beautiful graphics - ain't really got a summary nor story for this. The backgrounds are wonderfully detailed and the level design uses darkness and absence of darkness for most elements. I did have to turn the gamma WAY up past the beginning setting, though it was unclear whether that's actually the recommended setting or whether they just want you to be like "Ooh, there's a ninja appearing in the darkness while I adjust my gamma." Cool effect anyway. The game would have just been way too dark for me to see anything below... 55 or 60, somewhere in that range.\n\n3. New Game Plus - okay, I'll be honest, I have no earthly idea whether or not I'll get around to playing this, but any game that includes it gets bonus points in my book. You mean to tell me I get an excuse for going through the story again? Which brings me to the next one...\n\n4. The story. It's pretty... cliché, I'll be honest. I knew where it was turning well before it got there. That being said, I guess it's a guilty pleasure, because I still enjoyed it thoroughly. There's scrolls hidden throughout the game to add backstory in the form of haikus - I haven't unlocked most of them as of yet. Not really a plus or a minus for me, since the gameplay is so fantastic and fluid.\n\nI played through most of the game with a controller, before I got sick of the fact that my Right Trigger didn't function 90% of the time. That's not an important key for how I played, it's sprinting. It definitely feels a lot more fluid on a controller than on a keyboard, in my opinion.\n\nNow, overall, I got ~12 hours of awesome playtime, and will likely get more. Does this fit a $15 pricetag? For me, yes, because the quality of the product is stellar and I doubt I'll find a game topping this in the stealth field any time soon.","April 10, 2014","true","15.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

As sure as the Sun rises in the East, the smell of profits ensured that a few Ninja movies soon became a plethora and eventually a torrent. Everything martial arts related became popular. Movies by Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steven Seagal and the legendary Chuck Norris inundated the public. Sure, some of them were not bad, but just as a cow produces milk, it also produces manure. Lots of it.\n\nFortunately for fans, the passage of time hasn't blunted the enthusiasm of Van Damme and Seagal who are still prolific today, producing straight-to-DVD movies with the regularity and consistency of a dyspeptic sybarite with irritable bowel syndrome. As for Seagal[lebeauleblog.com], he is now better known for spending more time at the buffet table than at the training dojo, preparing for his next blockbuster by subsisting on a stringent diet of Buffalo Wings. It is rumoured on the IMDB website that Seagal turned down a part in The Expendables 3 because he wanted to star alongside Harrison Ford in the new Star Wars film as Jabba the Hutt's son.\n\nFor anyone who doesn't know, The Expendables is the prestigious action movie franchise where famous action movie stars compete to see who can be more incomprehensible. So far, Slyvester Stallone and Jason Statham are tied for the top spot. In early editions of the DVD (since recalled), a production error dubbed over the actors with these guys and nobody noticed the difference.\n\nAnyway, history buffs might be interested to know that not only is Ninjutsu a venerable art with a long and proud history in Japan, it was practised as far away as the Caribbean, brought there by Ninja-Pirates migrating across the Pacific Ocean. Joining a Ninja clan is simplicity in itself as traditional Ninja membership policies are extremely non-discriminatory as seen in the remarkable documentary Beverly Hills Ninja. In fact, being human is not even a necessary pre-requisite for being a Ninja. Robots, mutants, pet turtles and cheerleaders are all eligible.\n\nAs the epitome of martial arts, anyone would think that becoming a Ninja would take strict discipline and many years of intense training, but nothing is further from the truth. Simply yelling "Ninja Power Now!" while gesticulating idiotically in the manner of an epileptic mime is all it takes.\n\nIn Mark of the Ninja, the developers Klei draws on the vast legacy of Ninja mythology to deliver an intriguing 2-D stealth platformer that does justice to the Ninja genre. Your job is to guide Mark, a slightly fruity human Luddite Ninja, on his epic quest to defeat the bad guys by destroying all their lamps. The darkness will create serious Workplace Health and Safety issues and cause severe embarrassment at the next WHS inspection. That'll teach em.\n\nLevels are well designed usually with multiple paths to objectives. Just like in Deus Ex: Human Revolution covert and overt playstyles are supported. The stealth action is incredibly well integrated into the gameplay, with the option for non-lethal pacifist vegans to ghost through every level without killing a single thing. It's even possible to hide in a box Metal Gear style. Sadly, the time-honoured stealth tactic of putting a lampshade on your head and pretending to be a lamp isn't implemented.\n\nWith an engaging narrative, responsive controls and a beautiful art style that is uniquely Klei, this is the best and only stealth platformer I've ever played.","September 4, 2015","true","34.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Levels have multiple pathways and depending on what equipment you take in you can change up the style on each play-through.\n\nI personally love the art design and you get a feel for your character even though he has zero dialogue. The music and sound effects are excellent.\n\nSearching for a negative, the only ones I can think of is the game is fairly easy if you are used to this genre and have skillZ. This also makes the game fairly short if you intend to only play through once and aren't achievement/objective hunting. You will not be able to unlock all the "wonderful toys", gadgets, etc. on one play through.\n\nI highly recommend this game if you like stealth, Ninjas and have OCD on getting the perfect kill every time you will love this game.","November 20, 2015","true","16.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Shame you can't tone it down a little more.\nAnimation is smooth and elegant, as they should be, especially if it's a sneaky ninya game.\nThe way they've implemented how you can "see" sound, so to speak and the field of view of your enemies is a new and pretty awesome add to a stealth game.\nThe way light is shown, and the fact there's a difference between being spotted and detected make for some incredible stealth kills.\nA majority of the puzzles are riveting, and sometimes even confusing. Which is exactly what a puzzle should be like. In my opinion.\nThe equipment you can get and buy depending on how well you did in the previous levels are absoloutely superb, especially the box. A different combination of different distraction items, attack items and even your costumes, can make for a gripping and almost irresistible new gameplay every time, creating one of the greatest replay values I've ever seen in any storyline-orientated game. Even then, each costume alone creates a whole new gameplay, sneaky sneaky, terrory-makingy thing, super damage man ninja, and quite a few more. AND EVEN THEN you can decide to try and play the opposite game-style that that costume is trying to help you/make you play (that was clear).\nThe story is also really confusing yet also mesmerising, as there are many different signs, implying many different things. Unfortunately this doesn't mean you can have multiple story lines depending on how you play the game, or different endings, but it does make you think. Which is awesomeballs.\nThe art on the main menu is absoloutely delightful.\n\nNegatives.\n(I had to spend quite a long time trying to think of these)\nFirst of all, the Mark of Serenity. Absoloutely ruins the game. You can use it in pretty much any puzzle, ruining that. Ruins all the running around and wall-climbing etc that makes the game so fun, and last, but not least, and probably not even last, ruins pretty much the entire game (If you use it, of course).\nI found the first play through a tad bit easy, though it did get harder nearer to the end, as it should. However, I would have liked to have seen a bit of a difficulty choice. I am aware of the New Game + at the end, though I would have preferred to see something similar at least, in the main menu.\nNITPICKINNNNNNNNNNNNG D=\nThe main menu could also have a "Load Game", "New Game" type thing going on, but it doesn't. So yeah.\n\nThis is not so much as a negative but more of a "What would make the game better" type thing.\nCan't think of much so here's one, and I think they would probably do this anyway but. Maybe add more costumes? More equipment and maybe a side story, similar to what they had to "Dosan's Story". Maybe have Azai's story or something like that. Maybe a whole new story line for Dosan, I dunno. It has great replay value nonetheless.\n\nAll round, this game is an absoloute blast, definitely worth the £11, and alot of the negatives are nit picks and the Mark of Serenity is something you could easily not have by just having another costume, since it's the only positive on the Final Mark costume. I say costume alot, I should stop.\n\nAll in all, I would without a doubt, highly recommend this game to absoloutely anyone who enjoys stealth games.

With an arsenal of fancy moves, gadgets, and murder methods, this is 2D stealth at its finest and stands as one of my favourite sneak-em-ups, 2D or not. Extremely polished and well put together, it looks and controls great, and it's just so much fun to creep around and terrorize your enemies, with stealth that's similarly satisfying as the Arkham games. You're powerful and lethal in the shadows but vulnerable when seen, and as the game progresses you'll have to come up with fancier and fancier tactics to overcome the escalating security and new varieties of enemy immune to this thing or that. Succeed and you feel like the ultimate badass, fail and you're a fumbling idiot.  It's all wrapped up in an excellently presented package with an enjoyable, if simple story to work through.\n\nIt's a little on the easy side, but there is a new game+ mode in which all gunshots are fatal and your vision is more limited, etc. Definitely more challenging, but still beatable. There is a quicksave option that doesn't penalize you for using it, which can suck the difficulty out of things a little if you're prone to save-scumming.  Because things can go so very wrong so very quickly, it's a welcome addition but it does make things a little less tense.","September 18, 2015","true","24.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

People claim to be "ninjas" after watching a dozen or so episodes of the wrong cartoon, after they buy an unsharpened aluminum samurai sword at a flea market, or just whenever they're trying to impress people anonymously.\nSo when I point out that I write this review "from the standpoint of a ninja," I'm aware of how half-witted and watered down the term is. But a ninja is nothing if not determined to overcome tough odds, so here goes; time to ♥♥♥♥ up this rope.\n\nMark of the Ninja is possibly the best ninja-themed stealth game I've ever played, and I've played nearly all of them.\nThe first major note to its credit is, Mark of the Ninja favors gameplay over realism or historical accuracy. The player can always tell how visible they are based on the tone of the character's graphic. Enemies can see things which are in the light and can't see things which are in the dark. Walking footsteps are silent, and running footsteps make noise in an area around the character; the distance they can be heard from is indicated with a graphic on screen.\nOpen combat is virtually nonexistant and, most importantly, avoidable. The code of the Hisomu family demands that their sword be used only on an unaware enemy, and as such every patrol of guards can be outwitted and avoided or eliminated by surprise one at a time. And that's how and why the game *really* starts to shine; Mark of the Ninja is, at heart, a puzzle game (as most of my favorite stealth games are), inherently one where there are multiple solutions to most of the puzzles.\nAs such, it's not an exaggeration to say that it lives or dies based on the level design. The levels are linear, with distinct starting and ending points and few branching paths, but each section can be approached from numerous directions. The addition of hidden areas and collectable scrolls I could take or leave, but being able to unlock new equipment and "Paths" (suits of armor granting special powers) means that the already variable gameplay sprawls out even a little more.\nSo it's linear, yes, but with a huge amount of room for creative puzzle solving for players who have good awareness. Nervous guards can be tricked into shooting their team or tripping and falling off ledges. Killing a sentry or sniper and leaving his body somewhere others will discover it can lure them away from your objective. Often times, clever use of cover can remove the need to confront or eliminate guards entirely.\n\nIn summary, from the standpoint of someone 20-ish years deep in what's left of the real ninja tradition, Mark of the Ninja is a spectacular ninja-themed game because it rewards awareness and patience, promotes creative and variable problem solving, and most importantly always puts the important task at hand (in this case gameplay) first in terms of priority. Anything missing by way of historical accuracy is made up for on all points with the spirit, method, and feel of what the way of the ninja is *really* about.","December 14, 2015","true","15.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

As sure as the Sun rises in the East, the smell of profits ensured that a few Ninja movies soon became a plethora and eventually a torrent. Everything martial arts related became popular. Movies by Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steven Seagal and the legendary Chuck Norris inundated the public. Sure, some of them were not bad, but just as a cow produces milk, it also produces manure. Lots of it.\n\nFortunately for fans, the passage of time hasn't blunted the enthusiasm of Van Damme and Seagal who are still prolific today, producing straight-to-DVD movies with the regularity and consistency of a dyspeptic sybarite with irritable bowel syndrome. As for Seagal[lebeauleblog.com], he is now better known for spending more time at the buffet table than at the training dojo, preparing for his next blockbuster by subsisting on a stringent diet of Buffalo Wings. It is rumoured on the IMDB website that Seagal turned down a part in The Expendables 3 because he wanted to star alongside Harrison Ford in the new Star Wars film as Jabba the Hutt's son.\n\nFor anyone who doesn't know, The Expendables is the prestigious action movie franchise where famous action movie stars compete to see who can be more incomprehensible. So far, Slyvester Stallone and Jason Statham are tied for the top spot. In early editions of the DVD (since recalled), a production error dubbed over the actors with these guys and nobody noticed the difference.\n\nAnyway, history buffs might be interested to know that not only is Ninjutsu a venerable art with a long and proud history in Japan, it was practised as far away as the Caribbean, brought there by Ninja-Pirates migrating across the Pacific Ocean. Joining a Ninja clan is simplicity in itself as traditional Ninja membership policies are extremely non-discriminatory as seen in the remarkable documentary Beverly Hills Ninja. In fact, being human is not even a necessary pre-requisite for being a Ninja. Robots, mutants, pet turtles and cheerleaders are all eligible.\n\nAs the epitome of martial arts, anyone would think that becoming a Ninja would take strict discipline and many years of intense training, but nothing is further from the truth. Simply yelling "Ninja Power Now!" while gesticulating idiotically in the manner of an epileptic mime is all it takes.\n\nIn Mark of the Ninja, the developers Klei draws on the vast legacy of Ninja mythology to deliver an intriguing 2-D stealth platformer that does justice to the Ninja genre. Your job is to guide Mark, a slightly fruity human Luddite Ninja, on his epic quest to defeat the bad guys by destroying all their lamps. The darkness will create serious Workplace Health and Safety issues and cause severe embarrassment at the next WHS inspection. That'll teach em.\n\nLevels are well designed usually with multiple paths to objectives. Just like in Deus Ex: Human Revolution covert and overt playstyles are supported. The stealth action is incredibly well integrated into the gameplay, with the option for non-lethal pacifist vegans to ghost through every level without killing a single thing. It's even possible to hide in a box Metal Gear style. Sadly, the time-honoured stealth tactic of putting a lampshade on your head and pretending to be a lamp isn't implemented.\n\nWith an engaging narrative, responsive controls and a beautiful art style that is uniquely Klei, this is the best and only stealth platformer I've ever played.","September 4, 2015","true","34.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

People claim to be "ninjas" after watching a dozen or so episodes of the wrong cartoon, after they buy an unsharpened aluminum samurai sword at a flea market, or just whenever they're trying to impress people anonymously.\nSo when I point out that I write this review "from the standpoint of a ninja," I'm aware of how half-witted and watered down the term is. But a ninja is nothing if not determined to overcome tough odds, so here goes; time to ♥♥♥♥ up this rope.\n\nMark of the Ninja is possibly the best ninja-themed stealth game I've ever played, and I've played nearly all of them.\nThe first major note to its credit is, Mark of the Ninja favors gameplay over realism or historical accuracy. The player can always tell how visible they are based on the tone of the character's graphic. Enemies can see things which are in the light and can't see things which are in the dark. Walking footsteps are silent, and running footsteps make noise in an area around the character; the distance they can be heard from is indicated with a graphic on screen.\nOpen combat is virtually nonexistant and, most importantly, avoidable. The code of the Hisomu family demands that their sword be used only on an unaware enemy, and as such every patrol of guards can be outwitted and avoided or eliminated by surprise one at a time. And that's how and why the game *really* starts to shine; Mark of the Ninja is, at heart, a puzzle game (as most of my favorite stealth games are), inherently one where there are multiple solutions to most of the puzzles.\nAs such, it's not an exaggeration to say that it lives or dies based on the level design. The levels are linear, with distinct starting and ending points and few branching paths, but each section can be approached from numerous directions. The addition of hidden areas and collectable scrolls I could take or leave, but being able to unlock new equipment and "Paths" (suits of armor granting special powers) means that the already variable gameplay sprawls out even a little more.\nSo it's linear, yes, but with a huge amount of room for creative puzzle solving for players who have good awareness. Nervous guards can be tricked into shooting their team or tripping and falling off ledges. Killing a sentry or sniper and leaving his body somewhere others will discover it can lure them away from your objective. Often times, clever use of cover can remove the need to confront or eliminate guards entirely.\n\nIn summary, from the standpoint of someone 20-ish years deep in what's left of the real ninja tradition, Mark of the Ninja is a spectacular ninja-themed game because it rewards awareness and patience, promotes creative and variable problem solving, and most importantly always puts the important task at hand (in this case gameplay) first in terms of priority. Anything missing by way of historical accuracy is made up for on all points with the spirit, method, and feel of what the way of the ninja is *really* about.","December 14, 2015","true","15.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It is a 2D game, utilizing Klei's signature art style to tell a surprisingly good story with solid voice acting.  Thankfully it isn't punishingly difficult like Klei's previous Shank games.\n\nGameplay manages a perfect balance between a fast and fluid action game, and a slow and methodical stealth game.  It's fast enough to please action game lovers, but still offers satisfying stealth mechanics.  You utilize shadows and vents to make your way through levels, with access to a variety of ninja equipment to help you distract and kill enemies.  Klei came up with a very nice vision system, where you can only clearly see what your character can see, with the rest of the screen intelligently blurred out so you not only have to think about your position in relation to lights, but also how well you can see.  Loud enough sounds such as footsteps are visible on the screen thanks to your ninja training.  The game also offers a focus mode which pauses time to allow you to aim and multi-target equipment.  The controls are intuitive and very responsive, at least when using a gamepad.  I have not tested the game with kb/m.\n\nAs you progress you can unlock new ninja styles, abilities and killing moves to help you progress through the levels more easily.  Ninja styles have their own strengths and weaknesses and can alter what equipment you are allowed to carry.  I found myself using the standard style for the most part, but it's nice to have options.\n\nThe Special Edition DLC includes a new level, a distraction item, and a thrown weapon, as well as a new non-lethal ninja style for those who don't like to kill enemies in stealth games.  All of this equipment can be utilized in the main campaign once the DLC level is completed and does make the game a bit easier since the new items allow you to do some previously impossible actions.  The DLC also adds commentary nodes scattered throughout the game which you can read.  They are unobtrusive for the most part though there are a couple that pop up automatically.  Overall it's a worthwhile DLC but doesn't contain a whole lot of content.\n\nMark of the Ninja is possibly the best stealth game I have ever played and one of very few games I can find nothing negative to say about.

You stay under enemy's feet, you climb on the shadow, you walk behind enemies, you hide behind vases/doors. Fighting enemies head on is not recommended and normally would result in lower overall scores after a level ends. To achieve that, you're given various tools like Caltrops or skills like Mark of Serenity or you can even use environmental hazards like spike traps to kill enemies indirectly. Granted, you need some plans ahead to do that, but it's fun when you can pull the strings. There's another option.... to stay quiet and move stealthily, or run like no tomorrow to the checkpoints/objectives ignoring everything. Your call, as the game allows multiple approaches to finish the game.\n\nGame mechanic has some RPG style where you're given talent points and you can assign it to skills (new stealth kill style) and  items (upgrade armor) to be unlocked. This offers some flexibility to suit your playing style.\n\nGraphic is very good and polished. A bit gore here and there but all cartoon-ish so it's ok. The levels are drawn well and the characters do animations when dying (not disappear into thin air), running or terrorized. The game even uses lightning system to calculate detection for AIs. While the AIs are still predictable, it's a good mechanic already. Overall, the game maintains dark appearance throughout and it's suitable with the stealth theme of the game.\n\nAs for the sound, it's a quiet game. Only when you alert the guard and trigger the alarm will  the game suddenly play real upbeat sound. Most of the times you'll only hear your footsteps or ambient background sound. The last level music is good, though - and it seems like they put more effort into making it as written in the documentary (DLC).\n\nStory is just classic, not a big invention since sliced bread but the plot is well written. You're a ninja, you're sent on a missions and gotten a tattooed seal that helps but has major drawback on your mind and so on but it keeps me interested in the game - can't tell no spoiler. Most of the times it's told to players via cinematics in-between a level with voice acting included (which is a job well-done as the artists know how to portray the chars they play).\n\nFor replayability it lies on New Game Plus+ mode, where enemies basically will one hit KO you and the AI's hearing and eyesight capabilities won't be displayed in screen like in normal mode. In normal mode you're still given a radar in-level for AI's hearing and eyesight capabilities.\n\nOverall difficulty it's sustainable, not too hard not too easy - there are checkpoints in each level so you won't get frustrated. Well, except New Game Plus as it thinks you've beaten the game at least once and have knowledge already.\n\nFor playing this game I recommend you to use controller. So far, I find no problem playing with either dinput or xinput based controller. I've tested with Rumblepad 2 and xinput mode F310.\n\nOverall, this is a very polished game saves for occasional glitches as reported here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/214560/discussions/0/541906348038543161/\n\nWell worth it and recommended.","July 17, 2015","true","28.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's obvious from the very beginning of the game that the creators put a lot of thought into how the game's mechanics work, and it shows that the developers really care about the game.\n\nThis is not your average stealth game. Everything about it has been tweaked to perfection, and it shows. One thing I really like about this game is the optional commentary, which adds a lot by showing you how the game was created. Of course you can turn the commentary off in the options menu, but I've left it on for my first playthrough and I'm really enjoying it so far.\n\nThe music in Mark of the Ninja is very well done, and really contributes to the overall atmosphere of the game. When you're just sneaking around, it's a soothing zen-like experience, but when you're detected by an enemy, it switches to a pulse-pounding combat theme that gets me on edge every time.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are extremely well done. As you progress through the story, you pick up new tools and skills along the way, which adds new depth to the strategy of the game. For example, in the second level you pick up noisemakers which can be thrown to distract a guard, allowing you to sneak up on him for a kill. There are hidden levels, too, that present an entirely new challenge by making you seriously think out your actions before doing anything, as one false step can spell your doom. Fortunately, you're not limited to just a few lives, so if you die a few times it's not going to matter that much.\n\nI'm playing this game with an XBox controller, and I suggest you do the same if you want the best experience. I tried the keyboard/mouse controls for a few minutes, and there's just too much going on so it's really hard to keep track of which key does what, especially when you need precision. And there are a lot of times in this game where you'll need to be very precise. I'm only a few levels into it so far, but I've already encounted quite a few areas where I had to throw a dart to take out a light, then run like hell to hide before the guards noticed, and things like that just don't work as well on a keyboard/mouse control scheme.\n\nFor players who care more about the story than the gameplay, Mark of the Ninja won't disappoint you either. The writing is top-notch, and I really enjoy the fact that there are hidden scrolls that give background information to supplement what the NPCs tell you. The cutscenes are beautifully animated in a cartoonish, almost anime-like style that really fits the game perfectly.\n\nIf you want a hack-n-slash ninja game, I suggest you look elsewhere. But if you want a true stealth game that will really make you plan out your actions as you jump from one hiding spot to the next, you should be playing Mark of the Ninja right now. I can't remember the last time I had this much fun in a stealth game.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you enjoy my reviews, why not follow my curation page?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/214560/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nMark of the Ninja was an enjoyable quick stealth game that does a good job combining stealth, 2D puzzle, action, and combat. The story is quick to play though; you probably will spend a few hours depending on how good you are at staying on target. I tend to collect things so it took me longer than usual but that was okay, because my second time through I was able to wrap up my achievements with relative ease.\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: Just a fair warning, I might be giving a few details away from the game, it’s short so you probably don’t want to look at the hidden text (put your mouse over it to see). Possibly a spoiler  You are an unnamed ninja who is identified for the tattoos that he wears. These tattoos give him unique and fierce powers, unfortunately as you progress, the poison from these tattoos starts to drive you mad and you no longer can tell the difference between friend and foe.\n\nGame Play:  As you play the game, you get tokens that unlock more abilities and weapons. Without unlocking you get about 4 different ninja abilities, and 5 or 6 different ninja tools. These are enough to solve the puzzles, but for more enjoyment I recommend unlocking the abilities and upgrading your favorite ninja weapons and tools.\nAdditionally you unlock different costumes that grant you different abilities, however, I found myself sticking to the original balanced outfit.\nAs I briefly stated, this game is a stealth action puzzle 2D combat game. I didn’t know all those terms could be put together but there you have it. I absolutely loved the game play. The story might have been short but I got a good amount of pleasure out of the game experience, and recommend it to anyone who is a fellow Ninja/Shinobi fan.\n\nAchievements: Something that should be said about the achievements right away, is that to get a complete 100% on the game, you are required to purchase the DLC for the final eight achievements. I haven’t purchased this DLC at this time (02/28/14) but I look forward to maybe seeing a sale on the dlc and I would gladly purchase and try it out.\nRegarding the regular achievements, they are fun, enjoyable and mostly straightforward to get. I didn’t look up any guides for the achievements, most of them required either: A) Completing challenges in the game. B) Getting a high enough Score. C) Collecting scrolls inside the game. Once you collected everything the level turned Yellow as a sign of “100%”\n\nPrice: Mark of the Ninja is $14.99, plus $4.99 for the DLC. (Get the Special Edition for $17.99) I put in 22 hours into the game. That was two play through and that was about it. I didn’t get very much time out of this game before I had everything and was looking for the next game to play, however I would recommend adding this game to your wish list and waiting for a steam sale. Generally indie games go on sale, so this is probably your best bet.\n\nConclusion: I loved the game, I loved the story, I loved the controls, I love Shinobi/Ninja, I hated the price and that I need to get DLC to get 100% on the game. You do the math, this game was mostly good with a few disappointments, but on a whole; a pretty great game.\n\n\n---------------Update after purchasing the DLC and playing---------------\nWhat you get with the DLC: One new skin that gives you a different set of abilities (and also its own unique challenges [no time stop when you use items] ), two different ninja tools, several easy achievements, and an extra level.\nI’m really glad I got the DLC on sale because you can get a whole game for $4.99. Additionally I had finished the level and gotten all the new achievements in less than a couple hours. I was disappointed for the high price on the DLC and the little amount of extra play time I put into the game.\nI still love the game, but the DLC is definitely a pass, unless you can get the full game or get the DLC on sale.","February 28, 2014","true","23.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The storyline isn't amazing , but that doesn't really matter here. The gameplay is great and you are in complete control of your environment. You can of course rush through a level, alerting everyone , but the beauty of this game is in surveying the surroundings and using the tools at your disposal to achieve perfection in every level.\n\nThe upgrades arrive at a good pace and there is a variety of different tools and outfits you can use to play in a number of different ways. Sound plays a major part in the game, something that many stealth games seem to leave out. There are other collectibles you can find to extend the gameplay even further and a new game plus to increase the challenge again. The campaign itself is remarkably long for a game I considered a small arcade title.\n\nIf you are a fan of stealth gameplay and if you especially miss games like Tenchu , then you have to pick this game up.

Whether you choose the Path of Silence, Path of Nightmares or any of the other half a dozen Paths available, you will enjoy the way each path's strengths change the experience of the gameplay and provide for replay value to this gem of a game.\n\nAnd then there is the story of a Ninja Champion, chosen to take on the Mark to save his clan, at the risk of losing his sanity, life and honor.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/frazr_lzer/recommended/214560/","frazr_lzer","viad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/frazr_lzer/","164 products in account","Mark of the Ninja is a 2d stealth platformer that applies the stealth genre in unique ways and encourages a wide variety of approaches to tackle a problem. Being a game about ninja, the visual design employs some Japanese style in the levels. There are also other styles depending on the current level, ranging from a modern city, a castle, and the Middle East. This game uses a hand drawn and animated style for objects and people, which look nice visually and stand out from each other. The game's background graphics have intricate designs and distinct silhouettes. Most of the game is shown in a black silhouettes with some highlights. This is both an artistic and a gameplay choice, since lit areas will show the full color of things on screen, while in darkness black silhouettes are shown. The animated cutscenes help drive the story and stay consistent with the style of the game. The cutscene animation quality is great, as if it were an actual show, and has its unique Japanese inspired style like the game's graphics. Overall, the art style leans towards a great animated style with some Japanese influences along with a few other distinct designs.\nThe music in this game is both a mix of traditional Japanese and contemporary styles. There aren't that many tracks to this game, but the music tends to change dynamically based on actions in the game. There are a few special songs that play at certain parts of the game to heighten a certain mood. Still, the music sounds great here and helps drive the game's style along.\n\nThe story of Mark of the Ninja features an unnamed ninja under the control of Azai, his master, on a mission to assassinate the owner of a company called Hessian. Along the way the player meets up with Ora, a female ninja who guides the player along in the game and Dosan, an artist who gives the playable unnamed ninja special tattoos. These tattoos grant special powers to the bearer, but cause them delve into madness if they have the mark for too long.\nThere is obviously more to the plot without spoiling it, but the story for Mark of the Ninja is thought out well and has excellent twists and turns throughout the whole game. The animated cutscenes occur mainly between levels and help drive the story, along with special levels designed to advance the story further. The strong story will keep players on the game, along with its excellent gameplay.\n\nThis game takes the stealth genre and applies it to a 2d platformer with wildy amazing results. For starters, the player needs to take advantage of line of sight, lighting, and sound to slip by undetected. These three things each have their own visual cues, ranging from blurring, silhouettes, and circles to represent sound that others can hear. The player can kill enemies, but it usually has to be done using stealth. Going at an enemy head on where they can see you is a surefire way to get killed. Along the way, the player can use special tools or moves to help kill or sneak by enemies, and can be upgraded or unlocked with special tokens earned from playing the game. Enemies can be distracted, take notice of you, and can even be terrified. Knowing the best course of action when the enemy behavior changes is vital. Sometimes, a puzzle needs to be solved to advance, which is based on some special mechanics seen throughout the levels. The game does open up a wide amount of options to get through an area with complex tools to accomplish the task. Solving a puzzle or navigating a room of enemies successfully feels rewarding, and it's not just the assassination animations looking cool too. Taking the stealth genre and putting it in a 2d game is well done here, as you do have many options and tools to use for a very engaging experience.\n\nMark of the Ninja nails its 2d stealth platforming down, and it also has an animated visual style and a well written story. You will definitely enjoy all three of these parts of the game for the high quality demonstrated in this game as a whole.","August 8, 2014","true","10.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Some of the levels are great, I especially like the later ones.\n\nIts fun, and very easy to get into. There are a few moments which will make you think, but overall this should be approacable by anyone familiar to gaming.\n\nThe game is not too short, and doesn't run on. Decent length, I got 93% of the achievements, and completeled the game fully short of new game plus.\n\nThe controls were smooth, took little-to-no getting use to.  Very little bugs, although the occasional checkpoint bug which sticks you in a loop due to some strange (failing stipulation) for instance: get a checkpoint  1 sec before someone spots you, and when they do mission failure. (don't have time to escape, have to restart level) But that was really no biggie.\n\n\nThe Modern Ninja setting was cool, but I would like to see some Espionage, spy, military, CIA stype stuff in a game kinda like this. Maybe with slightly better graphics (just slightly), or better effects.\n\nIf this game is ever on sale, there really isn't a reason you shouldn't try it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kibernetik/recommended/214560/","kibernetik","Eddard Stark","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kibernetik/","542 products in account","This has got to be the best stealth game I have ever played in my life, and is one of the best games I've played this year. A ridiculously well-done masterpiece, from start to finish. The stealth mechanics are amazing as this is the only game where sound, visibility and movement indicators are so well done. You always know if you will be spotted or not. Also, Mark of the Ninja has great variety, as you can complete each mission how you want it. Want to become a merciless killing machine, with upgraded armor and health regeneration? You got it! Want to become the living shadow, making almost no noise at all and flying through obstacles undetected? Check! Want to strike endless fear to your enemies, hanging both dead and alive while slaughtering terrorized foes like pigs? How about a no-killing policy, where you don't even have a sword? Check, check, check! A dozen of absolutely different gadgets also add to variety and make every playthrough unique. If you want, you can carefully lay down mines on the path and lure enemies with firecrackers, killing the guards remotely, or you can throw a hallucination dart and make the foes shoot each other down. Hell, you can even take a plain old cardboard box, hide inside it and just wait for the kill!\nNot only the playstyles and gadgets, but also the levels themselves add to the variety. If you see a heavily guarded corridor, you can always rush underground, trying to avoid various traps, but without the necessity of dealing with the guards, Or you can rush through the door, throw a smokebomb and massacre everyone. Of course, you might just climb on the roof, go through the ventilation chamber and lure off the enemies and murder them one by one. Or, you could just.... well, you get the idea. Each level can be beaten in so many ways it can be hard to count.\nSurprisingly, there's also a lot of diferent enemies. From your average short-sighted guard, who easily panicks to cybernetic assassins who detect your presence from afar to snipers who take you down in one shot. There's numerous types of guards, each of them must be dealt in a different way. The enemies also look really great, and so we come in to our second part of the game...\n...the graphics. They are amazing. The levels look gorgeous in such a way, and as I mentioned, various stealth-related indicators look and fit here really well. Areas that you have no vision off have this black and white mist. Sound indicators have different shapes, sizes and colors depending on the strenght of the sound. Thus, you will always differ a footstep from a gong going off.\nSpeaking of which, the sound in this game is great. It fits the atmosphere really well and the swish, swoosh of a stealth kill feels ever so satisfying. The music is great as well, it differs in both the tone and intensity if you are slowly climbing the walls or running away after you've been spotted.\nThe controls are one of the best in a 2D sidescroller as they can get. The character will almost always do exactly what you want to, whether this could be hanging off a ledge without jumping off or doing a tricky jump off a cliff in order to land right behind a guard.  This makes even the hardest challenges force you to keep going or try a different aproach without any rage, as any deaths are because of your poor judgement and not bad controls.\nThe challenges are incredible. Most puzzles in MotN will normally be solved in under a minute, but if that sounds too easy to you, and it should, there's always a sacred gong in every level. It offer a really hard challenge, based on the thematic of the level, forcing the most out of your problem solving, finger dexterity or ninja skill usage. The challenges are hard, and most of them will require more than five minutes each, but they are never unfair or unsolvable.\nThere's so much I haven't talked about, like the great storyline, Mark Powers and many more things, but I think every single one of you should see for yourselves.\nKlei Entertainment did a really good job.\nRecomended to buy.","September 26, 2013","true","13.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Nothing like it, not even like Tenshu but contains about the same exvitement as if you were playing either one.  I really enjoyed the level of stealthiness put together with a series of puzzle solving.  It really puts you in the driver seat of being a ninja that carries the mark.  Having the decision of killing your victims and stashing them for extra points is quite on hte cool side.

Mark of the ninja offers just that, a game that could be finished in many different ways, you can terrorize your enemies and let them shoot each other, you can   brutally murder all guards on the level, you might want a bit of challenge and try pacifist run. Mark of the Ninja offers all this and more. It is a game with simple controls, simple mechanics and yet I finished it least 3 times.\nThe story follows the silent protagonist which has a tattoo's that gives him supernatural abilities such as teleportation, freezing time seeing through walls etc. As lore explains such power comes with great responsibility, the ninja must to end his life after the mission because he might become mentally unstable due ink that is used for tatoo's. It's tradition that comes back from ancestors. At the begining of the game you are awaken by fellow ninja Ora which guides you through first level. Apparantly your home is being attacked by some soldiers for unknown reasons. Once you finish the level your real mission begins: find who attacked your home and dispose of him.\nGame features 12 levels unique levels, fun gameplay, replay value and good story.

Plenty of levels to experience, plenty of tricks and weapons you can use to complete objectives. Whether its taking down targets silently without killing them or going on a massive murder-spree, the game supports it. (To a point). Add on multiple ways to approach a problem and this game just rocks. The story is a bit weird and that ending even more so. While you can burn through the main campaign in around 10 hours, you should also consider trying to get all the achievements and optional objectives, as they really flesh out the entire experience. I'm not one to say that often either so, something to keep in mind.\n\nFor a 2D game, it has a surprising amount of PC settings that  you wouldn't normally expect. You can check them all out here: http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/File:Mark_of_the_Ninja_video_settings.png. The DLC comes with a new level, more items and new playstyles for non-lethal takedowns in the original game. Definitely worth picking it up and/or the Special Edition of Mark of the Ninja.\n\nThis is quite the engaging experience and makes Mark of the Ninja one of my favorite stealth games.

It's clearly taken cues from the stealth games that came before it, and applied what it learned to make a highly enjoyable game that avoids a lot of the frustrations that can, and have, plagued the genre.\n\nYou play as an unnamed ninja who possesses mysterious tattoos that give him superhuman abilities. Abilities that come in handy when your ninja clan is slaughtered and you start out on a quest for revenge. It's a cliche setup, and for the most part the game seems to be OK with that, focusing more on making you feel like a ninja than telling you a deep story. Midway through however, the game's priorities seem to shift and it suddenly wants to be thoughtful and engaging, but without the character and story development needed for something like that. It's just there with little substance and unlikely to leave the impact that it seems to want to by the end.\n\nBut that's OK, because it makes up for that shortcoming with excellent design, responsive controls, and a huge amount of player freedom. Each level is scored, has collectables, secret rooms, and level specific challenges. All of which lead to character upgrades and alternate costumes that set up a sort of risk/reward type of strategy as you decide which bonuses are worth which penalties.\n\nCombine that with the variety of ways any given situation can be approached (levels are large, layered, and full of toys to play with), and you have a game that rewards experimentation and exploration, and doesn't punish you for playing the way you want to. Most of time. Unfortunately, as the game progresses toward the end, it begins to push the player into a specific play style, and then outright forces another, eliminating the freedom of play that it carries through most of the game. The story may be the worst part of the game, but this shortcoming is the most disappointing.\n\nStill, the game is highly enjoyable. Your character responds quickly to your commands and features such as the need to press the jump or run key to descend from a ledge (keeping you from accidentally falling into enemy sight lines) limits frustration. 95% of the time, if you're caught, it's your fault, which is how it should be.\n\nMark of the Ninja is definitely a blast to play. It's smooth, stylistic, and challenging without being unfair. It's few faults don't keep it from being an overall highly enjoyable experience.","December 9, 2013","true","13.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is pretty much the closest thing I have got to achieving this goal. The best bit about this game is it really makes you feel like a ninja, without the  use of fancy 3D, realistic graphics. Whether you want to be the stealthy, sneak-by everything ninja or the katana wielding meat grinder, this game will make you feel very Ninja-like. The stealth mechanics are some of the best I've ever seen, better than that in some 3d games, with great AI, multiple routes and the fact every move, every noise you make could be your downfall.\n\nThis is only complimented by the art style, which is nothing short of beautiful. Factors like noise, enemy awareness and enemy vision are all clearly displayed in a neat way that doesn't detract from the art style at all. The Animations and cutscenes are excellent and while the story isn't brilliant, the gameplay more than makes up for it.\n\nSo, if you are a fan of the stealth genre, do yourself a favour and buy this game, otherwise you are truly missing out on one of the best stealth games of this generation. 10/10","January 9, 2014","true","11.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In my exploration of such games, I have yet to come across one that accomplishes this is such a simple, yet successful manner as Mark of the Ninja.  Using an easy to understand system of darkness, distractions, and assassination, the surface level of it's gameplay does not have anything to make it stand out.  Rather than attempt to accomplish too much though, Mark of the Ninja demonstrates a seamless mastery of it's stealth system, and allows the player to approach it from many varying methods of completion.  While level objectives are static, the addition of varying skills, items, and costumes allow the player to adopt unique strategies to complete these in a variety of ways–whether that be through slaying guards, utilizing terror, or sneaking your way through every room.  Unfortunately the story falls short of the expectation set up by the rest of the game, but is engaging enough to push the game in the intended direction and motivate the player to complete missions.  Overall, Mark of the Ninja offers a fantastic change of pace that I would recommend to anyone remotely interested, and sets itself up as a benchmark for what  stealth games should strive to be.","January 25, 2014","true","12.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In fact, while many of these games remind you of Mario or Contra, games in which you were actively engaged in combat, Mark of The Ninja puts a lot of emphasis on stealth instead. Attacking your foes up front is instant death. Your best bet is to lay traps or to approach from the shadow which is your best friend in this game. There are a handful of levels and the further you get the more patience is required from your side: each move how you take down your enemies should be planned carefully.\n\nI liked the learning curve in Mark of The Ninja.

Initially, I didn't want to buy it since I'm not really one for side-scrolling platformers.  But, during the Steam Winter Sale, I caught it at $10.48 and bought it.  I'm very pleased.  Why am I so happy with it?  Because the side-scrolling platforming is not all that obtrusive and the big driver in the game is stealth.  As an added bonus, much of it (though not all) can be played without killing people.  And, since it took me a total of 59 hours to finish the base game and get all the Achievements (42 hours to finish the first run through, plus another 17 hours to finish it in New Game Plus mode), the money I spent was well worth it.  With the amount of gameplay you get out of the game, it's worth it even at the current list price of $14.99.\n\nI do have some minor issues with the game.  Most irritating is that the DLC's Achievements are lumped in with the base game's even if you don't own the DLC.  So, even though I  don't yet have the DLC, and have completed 100% of the base game's Achievements, Steam only shows a completion rate of 79%.  The most serious issue is with the mechanism used for you to return to the levels you've completed.  I (and many others) initially couldn't seem to return to my last level.  It turns out that the obvious scrolling to what you think are the levels only takes you to what are actually *areas*.  The specific levels are represented by the drawings of buildings at the top of those area screens.  So, you scroll to the area and then click on the building (or level) you want.\n\nAs for quibbles, there are several places where the game saves a waypoint (or even finishes a level) without warning and, possibly, right as you do something you really didn't want to do.  So, you can't go back and fix it without replaying the whole level.  There are also a couple of places where you re-spawn to a place in the midst of some bad guys.  Those are a bit difficult to escape.  And, finally, there are some places you go through where you can't backtrack.  That's a bit irritating if you've forgotten something and realize you can't get it unless you replay the whole level.\n\nStill, I'm very pleased with "Mark of the Ninja," consider it an excellent game, and recommend it even at it's list price.","January 27, 2015","true","62.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It offers all of the stealthy exploration and interaction of the Batman Arkham series without the cruft.  The game is mission-based, but each mission allows backtracking and can be replayed later to find missing items, try out different tactics or aim for a higher score.  You can even take advantage of restarting from mid-mission checkpoints when failing to pull off whatever you intended.  Upgrades can be earned, but are not required.  While I tended to focus on takedowns and smoke bombs, there's plenty of room to experiment.

It's clearly taken cues from the stealth games that came before it, and applied what it learned to make a highly enjoyable game that avoids a lot of the frustrations that can, and have, plagued the genre.\n\nYou play as an unnamed ninja who possesses mysterious tattoos that give him superhuman abilities. Abilities that come in handy when your ninja clan is slaughtered and you start out on a quest for revenge. It's a cliche setup, and for the most part the game seems to be OK with that, focusing more on making you feel like a ninja than telling you a deep story. Midway through however, the game's priorities seem to shift and it suddenly wants to be thoughtful and engaging, but without the character and story development needed for something like that. It's just there with little substance and unlikely to leave the impact that it seems to want to by the end.\n\nBut that's OK, because it makes up for that shortcoming with excellent design, responsive controls, and a huge amount of player freedom. Each level is scored, has collectables, secret rooms, and level specific challenges. All of which lead to character upgrades and alternate costumes that set up a sort of risk/reward type of strategy as you decide which bonuses are worth which penalties.\n\nCombine that with the variety of ways any given situation can be approached (levels are large, layered, and full of toys to play with), and you have a game that rewards experimentation and exploration, and doesn't punish you for playing the way you want to. Most of time. Unfortunately, as the game progresses toward the end, it begins to push the player into a specific play style, and then outright forces another, eliminating the freedom of play that it carries through most of the game. The story may be the worst part of the game, but this shortcoming is the most disappointing.\n\nStill, the game is highly enjoyable. Your character responds quickly to your commands and features such as the need to press the jump or run key to descend from a ledge (keeping you from accidentally falling into enemy sight lines) limits frustration. 95% of the time, if you're caught, it's your fault, which is how it should be.\n\nMark of the Ninja is definitely a blast to play. It's smooth, stylistic, and challenging without being unfair. It's few faults don't keep it from being an overall highly enjoyable experience.","December 9, 2013","true","13.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is pretty much the closest thing I have got to achieving this goal. The best bit about this game is it really makes you feel like a ninja, without the  use of fancy 3D, realistic graphics. Whether you want to be the stealthy, sneak-by everything ninja or the katana wielding meat grinder, this game will make you feel very Ninja-like. The stealth mechanics are some of the best I've ever seen, better than that in some 3d games, with great AI, multiple routes and the fact every move, every noise you make could be your downfall.\n\nThis is only complimented by the art style, which is nothing short of beautiful. Factors like noise, enemy awareness and enemy vision are all clearly displayed in a neat way that doesn't detract from the art style at all. The Animations and cutscenes are excellent and while the story isn't brilliant, the gameplay more than makes up for it.\n\nSo, if you are a fan of the stealth genre, do yourself a favour and buy this game, otherwise you are truly missing out on one of the best stealth games of this generation. 10/10","January 9, 2014","true","11.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In my exploration of such games, I have yet to come across one that accomplishes this is such a simple, yet successful manner as Mark of the Ninja.  Using an easy to understand system of darkness, distractions, and assassination, the surface level of it's gameplay does not have anything to make it stand out.  Rather than attempt to accomplish too much though, Mark of the Ninja demonstrates a seamless mastery of it's stealth system, and allows the player to approach it from many varying methods of completion.  While level objectives are static, the addition of varying skills, items, and costumes allow the player to adopt unique strategies to complete these in a variety of ways–whether that be through slaying guards, utilizing terror, or sneaking your way through every room.  Unfortunately the story falls short of the expectation set up by the rest of the game, but is engaging enough to push the game in the intended direction and motivate the player to complete missions.  Overall, Mark of the Ninja offers a fantastic change of pace that I would recommend to anyone remotely interested, and sets itself up as a benchmark for what  stealth games should strive to be.","January 25, 2014","true","12.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While it may not have the most original story, it is your standard western ninja-flick, the beautiful animation makes the cutscenes stunning and engaging, and the talented voice actors make it even better. The gameplay itself is quite unique, because in most stealth games it is always a gamble about how far the guards can see or hear, or how far the grenade you've thrown will go etc. However, in Mark of the Ninja, it tells you all of these things that you need to know, making most, if not all, deaths simply user error, and not bad game design making it unfair.\n\nIn the game you can choose your playstyle: sneaky sneaky, or kill people- and non leathal take-downs with the special dlc- and the game gives you upgrade paths for all of those playstyles. However, I feel that the game is a bit indecisive about the upgrades and playstyles, because while you get loads of points for completing a mission without killing people or being spotted, most of the upgrades are for the violent path, with far less benifitting a stealth approach. Personally,\nI prefer the violent path, purely because of the great takedown animations.\n\nThe presentaion and artstyle of this game is amazing. It really adds to the atmosphere, and the fact that it is all hand drawn makes it even better to look at. When it comes to Klei's games (the company that made Mark of the Ninja) they have a really unique and eye-catching art style to all of their games, whilest all of it is unique, it still has that similar, colourful theme.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game to anyone who even has a passing interest in the stealth genre, and for stealth verterans looking for a challenge in the New Game Plus mode. It is also a good entry level stealth game, catering well for beginners and people who have only just discovered the genre.\n\nPros\n\nExcellent gameplay\nOriginal art style\nGood for beginners and veterans\nCons\n\nUnoriginal story\nSome bugs and glitches\nScore\n\n8.5/10\n","July 7, 2015","true","8.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Don't fret, as each stage can be replayed upon completion. There's also a New Game+ mode for those who crave an even greater challenge.\n\nThere are a few nitpicks. First, the game sometime doesn't recognize (i.e. award points for) hidden bodies, or certain other tasks. The handy-dandy 'restart from checkpoint' option nearly always solved this for me. Still, I thought it wise to give you all a head's up. Second, and I blame Steam/Steam Cloud for this, I -- and many others if you check Google -- lost my save at one point, completely negating approximately six hours of playtime. Mark of the Ninja is so good, I didn't really have an issue replaying it, but -- again -- it's worth mentioning.\n\nPerhaps due to the need to replay a significant portion of the  game, I do wish it was a level or two shorter.

While it may not have the most original story, it is your standard western ninja-flick, the beautiful animation makes the cutscenes stunning and engaging, and the talented voice actors make it even better. The gameplay itself is quite unique, because in most stealth games it is always a gamble about how far the guards can see or hear, or how far the grenade you've thrown will go etc. However, in Mark of the Ninja, it tells you all of these things that you need to know, making most, if not all, deaths simply user error, and not bad game design making it unfair.\n\nIn the game you can choose your playstyle: sneaky sneaky, or kill people- and non leathal take-downs with the special dlc- and the game gives you upgrade paths for all of those playstyles. However, I feel that the game is a bit indecisive about the upgrades and playstyles, because while you get loads of points for completing a mission without killing people or being spotted, most of the upgrades are for the violent path, with far less benifitting a stealth approach. Personally,\nI prefer the violent path, purely because of the great takedown animations.\n\nThe presentaion and artstyle of this game is amazing. It really adds to the atmosphere, and the fact that it is all hand drawn makes it even better to look at. When it comes to Klei's games (the company that made Mark of the Ninja) they have a really unique and eye-catching art style to all of their games, whilest all of it is unique, it still has that similar, colourful theme.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game to anyone who even has a passing interest in the stealth genre, and for stealth verterans looking for a challenge in the New Game Plus mode. It is also a good entry level stealth game, catering well for beginners and people who have only just discovered the genre.\n\nPros\n\nExcellent gameplay\nOriginal art style\nGood for beginners and veterans\nCons\n\nUnoriginal story\nSome bugs and glitches\nScore\n\n8.5/10\n","July 7, 2015","true","8.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Having tried to clear levels in several of those different ways during my playthrough - from only distracting guards (without killing anyone) to only getting rid of those in my way to making sure every single last one was dead before moving on - I can conclude that all of those options felt viable, challenging and satisfactory (once completed) in their own way. You're also rewarded as a player for pretty much anything positive you do (killing an opponent, staying undetected while an opponent passes by, successfully distracting an opponent, etc.), so no complaints there.\n\nFurthermore, the game does a good job of throwing in new types of enemies or other obstacles (e.g. poison gas, explosives) whenever you think you've seen it all, and although the story for the most part is not overly impressive the ending made me appreciate it a whole lot more (dw, won't spoil anything).\n\nAs a final sidenote, I should note that I found messing with guards and leaving them in a state of terror (usually happens when they see another guard step into a trap and die in front of their eyes) absolutely hilarious, 10/10 would do again.","January 4","true","12.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It met my expectations.\n\nPositive:\n+ Best in genre of 2D stealth games\n+ Great graphics\n+ Great mechanics with different ways of killing your opponents\n+ Different builds you can use (it's possible to beat any map with an build, whatever suits your style)\n+ Strategy involved in using objects and builds to kill you opponents\n+ Replayability with the scoring of each "chapter"\n\nCons:\n- The story starts off slow\n- Have to finish the game to appreciate the story\n\nReason for 10/10:\nLack of an immersive story\n\n9/10\n\nRecommended to anyone who just wants to have fun. It's been awhile since a game was just fun to me. Most are actually fun but usually have sort of grind mechanic which can reduce how much I enjoy the game. This game keeps me entertained and wanting more. Easy recommendation.","December 30, 2015","true","15.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

On level 2, when your wife tasks you with taking out the recycling, the game takes a dark turn as you, the player, discovers on the door of your 4 bedroom suburban home the dreaded mark of the ninja. Ancient Japanese folklore states that those who once lived a dark path cannot escape their judgement among the gods, and it is the task of the order of the ninja to mark such people and bring them to justice. In levels 3-10 you proceed to dodge the ninja's attempts on your life such as while waiting in line at the grocery or having to outrun the ninja while you're getting your license renewed at the department of motor vehicles while still having to perform up-to-par as a driver to the ministry's expectations. Narratively, the game is very interesting, as the player discovers more about their dark past and wrestles with mature themes such as forgiveness and regret.\n\nWhile the mark of the ninja is very dangerous to get in real life, don't be afraid to get the mark of the ninja on steam, you'll be safe from the ninja on steam.","July 6, 2013","true","11.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

There are many cool ways to kill, and many different tools in your arsenal. All aspects of the stealth aspect are done right, from light, to sight, to sound. There are a few minor problems. I would do the same part over numerous times and do the exact same thing and I would get caught sometimes and not others. There is sometimes a flaw in the lack of consistency. The levels all seem very similar as the terrain is black and there isn't much of a different to to notice. The length is not bad for being a lower costing price. It is nice how there are multiple ways to go and get to a part. This also backfires however, when you are supposed to find things scattered about the level to complete challenges it is usually all but impossible with how many different ways there are to go which can make the levels confusing. Since you stealth kill people very often, it gets boring to see the same 3 animations for 7 hours. Theres really only way to kill people and it leaves very littile in improvisation. Most of the abilities are locked through the entire game which makes sense. I think it is meant to be so you replay but that is a cheap way of doing it as I would like to see what my guy can do through the game. You also get very little honor to unlock new things and many of the abilities are simple upgrades on equipment and usually uninspired. The controls sometimes screw up. Certain times I would want to jump down and it would make me go into a vent instead. Other times I want to jump off a ledge and it would make me stick to it and just transfer to the underside. Other times I would be right behind someone to stealth kill them and I would press the button and it would just hit them for no reason. All-in-all this game deserved the good reviews that it got and  itusually does stealth right. Once again a lesson for all those ♥♥♥♥ indie developers that keep putting out 1990's pixelated japense rpgs or other crappy aracade side-scrolling shooters. You can make an inspired and original game. No need for more games that look like ♥♥♥♥ and are the same as every other one out there. 8.5/10","December 16, 2012","true","20.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

First off, its art style reminds me of cartoon TV shows I used to enjoy watching through my childhood years, like Avatar and many Cartoon Network-based shows, so that's a big plus for me. Then the gameplay - the controls are very responsive, its mechanics aren't hard to get a hold of, every level feels like a bit of something new and there's mostly always several options to deal with any problem that the player has to face so the game never gets boring. Manipulating, terrorizing and executing enemies is pretty satisyfing, and many different execution moves and several animations for each make sure that killing people doesn't become a tedious chore. Checkpoints aren't scarce and shops are always accessible in case the player wants to switch loadouts mid-mission. Exploration feels rewarding thanks to the side-objectives that every mission has and as well as the goodies that can be found at distant parts of any level, like challenge rooms. The soundwork is freakin' A, especially the soundtrack which is remarkable and very memorable. Finally, the game has a nice ammount of achievements and their cool names and fantastic icons make it particularly pleasing whenever one of them gets unlocked and pops up on the player's screen during the play.\n\nI'm aiming to touch up on this text once I get the Special Edition DLC but I hope that even at its current state it's quite evident from my review that this game is a fantastic title and very much worth the buy.","September 7, 2014","true","22.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Being able to climb everywhere and how you can specifically kill guards in a variety of ways makes going through the game never makes it dull, really, terrorizing guards is the funnest thing you can do.\n\nThe vast amounts how you can approach a situation, depending on youre items, really feels good. The games doesnt penealize you for not killing people like most stealth games would.\n\nI can say my only complaint is the game (on normal at least) is a bit too forgiving on you getting caught.

The games doesnt penealize you for not killing people like most stealth games would.\n\nI can say my only complaint is the game (on normal at least) is a bit too forgiving on you getting caught. The 8 second cooldown just feels like nothing, espcially when you can go right back to a guard that JUST saw you, then again getting caught does reduce your score greatly.\n\n","February 13, 2015","true","8.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","1"

First off, its art style reminds me of cartoon TV shows I used to enjoy watching through my childhood years, like Avatar and many Cartoon Network-based shows, so that's a big plus for me. Then the gameplay - the controls are very responsive, its mechanics aren't hard to get a hold of, every level feels like a bit of something new and there's mostly always several options to deal with any problem that the player has to face so the game never gets boring. Manipulating, terrorizing and executing enemies is pretty satisyfing, and many different execution moves and several animations for each make sure that killing people doesn't become a tedious chore. Checkpoints aren't scarce and shops are always accessible in case the player wants to switch loadouts mid-mission. Exploration feels rewarding thanks to the side-objectives that every mission has and as well as the goodies that can be found at distant parts of any level, like challenge rooms. The soundwork is freakin' A, especially the soundtrack which is remarkable and very memorable. Finally, the game has a nice ammount of achievements and their cool names and fantastic icons make it particularly pleasing whenever one of them gets unlocked and pops up on the player's screen during the play.\n\nI'm aiming to touch up on this text once I get the Special Edition DLC but I hope that even at its current state it's quite evident from my review that this game is a fantastic title and very much worth the buy.","September 7, 2014","true","22.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It stars a Ninja imbued with enchanted tattoos that give him special powers but also curse him with increasing madness, whose goal is to complete a mission of assassination and then take his own life before he loses the last remnants of his sanity.\n\nThe graphics and music are all appropriately ninja-themed which really helps to draw you into the overall atmosphere of the game. Most characters are fairly well animated for 2d and I was impressed by the level of effort put into the cinematics between levels (they had kind of a Samurai Jack vibe). The game also features helpful sound cues for when enemies are moving around in other rooms and for when you have been seen.\n\nSince this is intended as a stealth game, gameplay consists of you finding your way through each level while avoiding detection and removing any obstacles, human or otherwise. Many of the areas had multiple routes that sometimes took me in completely different directions which I thought was a nice touch and added to overall replay-ability. Of course, it wouldn’t be a ninja game if you didn’t also have an array of ninja tools to deal with pesky enemies and inconvenient light sources. Besides your darts, you also have methods of distraction and extermination, and can customize your loadout at various points denoted by a hanging flag in each level. You will only have a few abilities at the start of the game, but you can unlock more by completing bonus challenges, finding secrets, and completing objectives.\n\nThe only gripe I have with Mark of the Ninja is that the controls can be a little quirky at times especially when moving between horizontal and vertical planes with contextual button commands. This wasn’t really a big deal but it did take me until near the end of the game before I finally got used to it. The game is also a bit short, but considering how cheap it is that’s not really a problem.\n\nSo, if you’re in the mood for a stealth-action ninja-themed game, try picking this one up. You might end up just as pleasantly surprised as I was!","November 12, 2015","true","8.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Mark of the Ninja is a great platformer and an even better stealth game! Mark of the Ninja has you playing a ninja warrior who has been given special powers by his clan, in order to avenge them, these powers however are slowly driving him mad. The game itself is done in a pretty unique art style for a stealth platformer, and its an art style I have found myself enjoying as I play.\n\nMechanically you are able to spring and grapple through the levels trying to remain out of sight of enemys. You can chose to try to complete the level without killing for a large bonus at the end, or you can massacre your way through the level building as many points as you can.  There are collectibles hidden levels as well, such as hidden challenge rooms, artifacts, and other secondary objectives you can collect to learn more of the lore.\n\nThe character is equipped with a variety of gear including a sword for executions and assassinations, firecrackers for distractions, throwing darts for distractions and interacting with items from a distance, and a few other items you will get throughout the game. This leaves the options open to play how you want, kill no one, kill a lot, or just stealth through like a ghost. The one takeaway from this is to NOT go in guns blazing, even when you do fight, keep it like a ninja.\n\n\nOverall I would recommend Mark of the Ninja to fans of stealth games and paltformers, you have definitely got yourself a good game here!","November 15, 2015","true","3.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Spoilers, obviously.\n\nWhen I started playing this game, my approach was to "ghost" through the levels. "Ghosting" refers to passing through the level undetected without harming anyone, as though you were never there to begin with. I reasoned that, because my character was at risk of going mad, this path of restraint would be a logical choice for them.\n\nThen I got to a point where it was quite clear I would be unable to progress without one of two things happening: killing a guard, or being detected. Maybe once I beat the game and had more tools available I could come back and ghost the level, but with my current inventory it wasn't happening. So I killed them. I reasoned that, because killing undetected was worth far more points than not killing after being detected, this is how I was intended to play the game.\n\nSo I killed only when necessary to avoid detection. Then I killed when doing otherwise would have been inconvenient. Then I killed when I felt like it. Eventually, and before I knew it, I was backtracking across the map to hunt down a single enemy that had escaped my wrath.\n\nKilling was no longer part of the game. Killing WAS the game. Each kill was an exercise in self-expression and creativity. Whatever the risk was for impending madness, I didn't care. I was having way too much fun.\n\nThen I reached the end of the game, and it was pointed out to me that I had indeed gone mad, that I was hallucinating, and that it was my duty to end my life. Now, whatever amount of killing I may have done, after terrorizing a enemy to shoot another enemy with their assault rifle, it seemed MORE likely that they had at least HELD an assault rifle than that I was merely imagining them doing so. Hallucinations don't inflict real bullet wounds on other hallucinations. What's more, whatever my disposition might have been, these people had still killed a friend of mine, and they had been trying to kill me.\n\nSo I said, screw that. At the very least, you buggers will die first.\n\nAnd then the credits rolled, and the epilogue was revealed.\n\nThey were right. I HAD become a monster. And now I had unleashed myself on the world. I was unseeable, I was untouchable, and I was unstoppable. I was a terror, I had been given the chance to end my life, and I didn't. And now there was no stopping me.\n\nThat this was so perfectly conveyed through my gameplay experience is a greater compliment to the developers than any words can describe.","January 31, 2015","true","19.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Mark of the Ninja is one of the best games to come out in 2012. As a stealth game it's really well done, the idea that you're a ninja and not a samurai is a brilliant emphasis on the play style this game presents. As a Ninja your mission is to avenge your clan and take out the bad guys. Pretty simple in the story department. Gameplay is 2D and all the information you need to know is there, how much sound you make is given off by rings broadcasted from the last position you made noise, if enemies are with the radius of these rings then they'll investigate. The greatest thing is enemies suffer from fear, as you do horrible things to the unlucky schmucks they'll start panicking and this can go either way as they shoot their buddies or hit you in the process. Combat is pretty non-existent in this game. You can stun enemies, but you'll most likely be out-numbered and killed in that pursuit. Instead your attacks come in the form of gadgets, like traps. As long as an enemy cannot see you, you can kill in up-close stealth take-down form! The last point I want to make is masks. Masks alter the game in subtle ways that change how you approach sandboxes for example there is a mask that lets you take more Offensive gadgets or there is a mask that makes your enemies panic if they see corpses of their buddies anywhere (not just hanging from lamp-posts). The masks are all unlockable and this ties in with the game's replayability. The game is already highly replayable but the masks add different flavours of fun, and that's something the game is, amazing fun!","July 18, 2013","true","18.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KliPeH/recommended/214560/","KliPeH","KliPeH","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KliPeH/","115 products in account","TL;DR - Mark of the Ninja provides good 6-7 hours of gameplay for the average player. If you don't totally suck and you don't score-attack, you're in for a few hours of stealth-action platforming and a fairly good storyline. If you're not into score-attacking and perfecting the game, or if you don't like stealth-focused games AT ALL, you might want to either wait for a sale or give it up completely; being careless and going for the extreme offensive won't get you very far in the game, and a good score unlocks quite a lot of stuff you can use to your advantage. I'm bad at stealth-based games, and I still had great fun with it. Awesome experience, will probably replay it sometime in the future.\n\nVisuals: 7/10 MotN's graphics are very cartoony, and very similar to those which Klei showed us in its Shank games. While I'm not a huge fan of cartoon-ish graphics in video games, I do like the way information is conveyed through graphical cues and not in a form of text as it would in most other games.\nFor example, being a stealth-based game, Mark of the Ninja lets you know when you can't be seen/detected by draining the color from your character when he's in the darkness and outlining him in white, as opposed to showing the true color while standing in front of/under a source of light. Another example is being able to see the sound-waves coming from their source in a form of ripples, and seeing them in advance when aiming your equipment and tools (which allows for better stealth action and setting traps unheard and undisturbed).\n\nControls and UI: 8/10 Mark of the Ninja has fully rebindable keys and fully functioning menus in general. Controlling the equipment-selection menu with the mouse was a bit weird, but other than that it's alright.\nWASD and Space (jump) to move, Left-click to attack and perform executions, Right-click to use the grappling-hook, E to interact with objects and Left-ctrl to stop time and use equipment.\nThe UI consists of the score-bar and the stealth-meter on the top left corner, and your equipment selection on the bottom left corner. Great controls, decent UI, nothing too intrusive or bad about any of these. No complaints here.\n\nMusic and SFX: 7/10 Both the voice acting and the music in the cut-scenes are good, but I didn't notice the music much when I actually played. Sound-effects are great, and the game handles sound-cues in a very interesting manner. I elaborated a bit about that in the Visuals section and I have nothing to add. No complaints here either.\n\nMechanics: 9/10 While there's no randomness involved in the levels and exploration is somewhat limited, they all provide at least two different ways to beat them. You gain more points by avoiding guards or killing them without being spotted, rather than going on a rampage and fighting them without any attempts to conceal yourself. This style-point system makes MotN especially fun for score-attackers and people who like to beat levels with the best score possible.\nIf you get close enough to your enemy without being noticed, you have an option to execute them - a QTE followed by an animation and the instant death of that foe. If you fail the QTE you will gain less points, and any nearby enemies will be alerted. You can unlock executions from the provided execution-tree to kill guards with less effort and in more convenient ways. In order to unlock them, and also new equipment, seal-points are required. You get these by completing side-missions (which are optional) and finding scrolls that are hidden in each level. Your score is calculated by the following factors: scrolls found and collected, side-missions done, and stars for your overall score. Gain overall-score by killing or disabling guards, by collecting artifacts (hidden as well) and by finding scrolls (1,000 points for each).\n\nReplayability: 7/10 You can unlock new characters by completing side-missions and beating the game itself to then go back and play with said characters on previous levels (if you had a hard time perfecting them with the default one). The score and style-point based system, combined with the different characters and the many ways to complete levels, encouraged me to play through them more than once and try to beat them in the best way possible.\nIn general, you probably won't go through the whole story AGAIN, unless you want to try the New Game+ mode, but you MIGHT want to replay a level a few times just to get the maximum amount of points out of it and find all the scrolls/artifacts it provides. If you're not a score-attacker but you do love the stealth aspect of the game, you'll probably buy MotN for the sole purpose of completing the story, effectively dropping the replayability-value to 2 or 3 out of 10.\nIn my case, I did try to find EVERYTHING and perfect ALL the levels, so I put nearly 27 hours into it. Other than that, I was basically done with it after 9. It's up to you to decide whether the money is worth it or not.\n\nEDIT - 24/11/2014   Updated the review to match my review-template - added Visuals, Controls and UI, Music and SFX, Mechanics, and Replayability. Before the update, all the review contained were parts of the Mechanics and the Replayability sections, and the TL;DR bit. I decided to organize it, add what was missing, and match it to the review template that I will be using for future reviews on my profile.\nEDIT - 07/01/2015   Moved the TL;DR bit to the top - I realize some people don't feel like reading the whole review and just want to read my conclusion about the game right away. Reading the TL;DR first will probably help understand my point faster.\nWording.","August 23, 2014","true","32.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Spoilers, obviously.\n\nWhen I started playing this game, my approach was to "ghost" through the levels. "Ghosting" refers to passing through the level undetected without harming anyone, as though you were never there to begin with. I reasoned that, because my character was at risk of going mad, this path of restraint would be a logical choice for them.\n\nThen I got to a point where it was quite clear I would be unable to progress without one of two things happening: killing a guard, or being detected. Maybe once I beat the game and had more tools available I could come back and ghost the level, but with my current inventory it wasn't happening. So I killed them. I reasoned that, because killing undetected was worth far more points than not killing after being detected, this is how I was intended to play the game.\n\nSo I killed only when necessary to avoid detection. Then I killed when doing otherwise would have been inconvenient. Then I killed when I felt like it. Eventually, and before I knew it, I was backtracking across the map to hunt down a single enemy that had escaped my wrath.\n\nKilling was no longer part of the game. Killing WAS the game. Each kill was an exercise in self-expression and creativity. Whatever the risk was for impending madness, I didn't care. I was having way too much fun.\n\nThen I reached the end of the game, and it was pointed out to me that I had indeed gone mad, that I was hallucinating, and that it was my duty to end my life. Now, whatever amount of killing I may have done, after terrorizing a enemy to shoot another enemy with their assault rifle, it seemed MORE likely that they had at least HELD an assault rifle than that I was merely imagining them doing so. Hallucinations don't inflict real bullet wounds on other hallucinations. What's more, whatever my disposition might have been, these people had still killed a friend of mine, and they had been trying to kill me.\n\nSo I said, screw that. At the very least, you buggers will die first.\n\nAnd then the credits rolled, and the epilogue was revealed.\n\nThey were right. I HAD become a monster. And now I had unleashed myself on the world. I was unseeable, I was untouchable, and I was unstoppable. I was a terror, I had been given the chance to end my life, and I didn't. And now there was no stopping me.\n\nThat this was so perfectly conveyed through my gameplay experience is a greater compliment to the developers than any words can describe.","January 31, 2015","true","19.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

More if you play the DLC mission and New Game Plus.\nRating: 9/10\nReview:\n\nA really nice, 2D side-scroller stealth game, focused on being a Ninja and completing objectives like infiltrating a facility or taking down a target, and so on.\n\nPeople say the storyline is short, but I don't think it is. Atleast, it isn't short if you don't rush through the game, and you explore the areas carefully and play slowly. Good amount of hours of playtime. (about 9 hours, if you don't count the DLC mission and New Game Plus)\n\nThe gameplay is just great. Stealth is very well done and you can be creative, as you can develop your own playstyle.\nYou can sneak through everything, avoiding getting detected by anybody at the same time. Or you can sneak up on every enemy and kill them, while not getting discovered. Or you can use FEAR against your enemies, depriving them from noticing you properly, and making them hurt their own allies too. You can probably mix this all up if you like, it's all your choice.\n\nThe graphics are cool too, as it has a lot of effects for a 2D game.\n\nOverral, I highly reccommend this game to anybody out there that likes stealth games, no matter if you prefer it to be 3D games.

Great visual arts and excellent gameplay mechanics which is really easy to master thanks to the fluid controls. With no sweat you will be able to pull of really cool ninja moves and plan out coordinated strategies to take out enemies without breaking stealth. At the beginning you are fairly weak, but you will eventually get upgrades which will make you an unseen killing machine. There are many different ways to play, and before each mission you can choose your ninja path which gives completely unique abilities depending on your preferred game style. The story is also surprisingly good, and you get cool cutscenes after each mission. You will also have to solve a fair share of puzzles and a lot of these are well integrated into the level design.\n\nHowever I do wish the theme was centered more around Japan. Having the story centered around the Meiji Restoration would be the perfect setting for this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/diefahda/recommended/214560/","diefahda","Zamug","http://steamcommunity.com/id/diefahda/","180 products in account","Phantastic platform/puzzle/stealth game. There are different solutions to each problem (undetected killing, diversions, open fight, evading, instill fear, ...), and the maps are more or less open, there are different ways to reach your waypoints. This variety makes the game quite interesting. Together with upgradeable items, learnable skills, achievements, leaderboards etc I think this game is very replayable. I've had 15 hours of great fun on my first playthrough.\n\nI hope there will be a sequel some day, and my only points of critique are that despite the different tactics the background story feels a little repetitive (find object X, kill person Y), and the (great) visual style feels a little monotonous after many hours of playing (too dark & gloomy). But those things didn't spoil the fun at all for me. Oh, and maybe the non-stealth fights could be a little more complex, but that's not the focus of the game.\n\nCons:\n\nOn Linux the fullscreen mode is broken for me on dual head setups. The game takes over both screens, making it impossible to use the secondary monitor for anything. Alt-Tab to get out of the game is not possible from the game, but you can open the steam overlay to make it possible.","December 2, 2014","true","71.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This also is the basis of the game, no skilled point and click, instead it is a great example of a game that requires patience to execute the enemies of your clan.  You will find yourself stealthing through sewers, across city tops, and worming your way through vents as you evade the eyes and ears of your enemies and bring silent death upon them.  There are special puzzel levels hidden about but the difficulty was slightly wanting I found.\n\nThe story is that of a chosen ninja, one who bears the marks that only his clan knows of, hence the title of the game.  The marks will imbue you with power beyond any mortal, but there is a price to pay.  The legend tells of those that undergo the ink will do the will of the clan and then must turn their sword upon themselves or else bring ruin on their clan.  This story element really comes to fruition at the very end and was wonderfully put forward by the creators.

Everything about this game screams terrific design. It captures the spirit of true ninjutsu: complete nothingness and silence, alongside the occasional assassination. The path you take as a ninja is completely up to you, ranging from a murderous nightmare towards every guard to an undetectable ghost. The game is more than happy to give you various options in approaching every situation. I was also pleased by how varied the levels are; one time you will be infiltrating a fortress, the next time you'll be escaping poison-filled catacombs, and another time you will be setting a building on fire. I also found the game to be quite challenging and as of writing this review have yet to earn all the achievements...and complete a harder New Game+.\nThe art direction is fantastic, harkening me back to the style of Batman: The Animated Series, Star Wars: Clone Wars, and Samurai Jack. Plus, the visual cues regarding sound and light is nothing short of genius.\nThe story is surprisingly intriguing and the end led to much reflection of my playthrough as a ninja. The characters are good with well-executed voice-acting. Overall, very well-written.\nWith all this being said, this is a ninja game.

As far as 2-D stealth platformer games go, Mark of the Ninja is definitely the king. The player must use a veriety of tools along with the environment to either kill the gaurds, or sneak past them. The player is heavily rewarded with staying out of combat, and remaining undetected which proposes a unique challange to each player. The points the player receive will also help them upgrade their arsonal and allow them to complete each level more easily; which is good, because as the game progresses the levels become increasingly difficult.

You're a ninja who must accomplish different tasks that require you to be stealthy and deadly.  You're given ninja tools and weapons to accomplish your given tasks with scenarios that allow for a range of different kills or kill styles with a range of bonus points for either.\n\nThe gameplay is smooth and your ninja is easy to control whether you're using the keyboard/mouse or a gamepad (360 controller).  The game puts a nice twist on the 'stealth' genre of games by including more than a "stay out of the lights" playing mentality you usually find.  Of course you have to stay out of the lights but the game makes you think without getting overly complex in movement controls or in problem solving.  I became quite comfortable with movement and action controls rather quickly.\n\nEach level has a number of challenges that contribute to your ranking at the end of that level (IE: hitting all the gongs will get you a bonus).  This allows you to farm for achievements within the game level as well as the Steam achievements for the game itself.\n\nIf you're into 'stealth' style games, this one's a 'must have'.  If you haven't tried 'stealth' style games, this is a nice place to start. Buy it on sale.","July 22, 2013","true","9.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game perfectly pitches character progression and challenge, marrying atmosphere and threat with power-fantasy.\n\nIt's in actuality a puzzle game; if you are detected and discovered, the punishment is rarely less than swift death and a fast reload. Perhaps punishment is the wrong word, as the game never penalises you for failing to outwit one of it's systems, but challenges you to do so with all the timing, strategy and grace of a true ninja. This approach to stealth is something many other titles avoid, especially AAA games with long loading times, which give players to option of fighting their way out of their mistakes.

Overlooked this game for a while but really glad I picked it up. The game has a decent sized campaign with lots of challenges in every level. I found there was a lot of ways to approach every situation, either with lethal or non lethal takedowns, entry points or use of gadgets. Really felt like a true badass ninja in this game. You have the ability to terrorize your enemies and sink back into the shadows, causing them to panic and attack other guards, it's pretty great. I felt like Batman. Like I said very nicely stylized, which I expected from a Klei game. Nice art direction and animations all around, and cool tradition ninja themes mixed with more high-tech stuff. Still think I'm going to play this more to complete more challenges and play with different loadouts and ninja suits.

It's a 2D platforming stealth game, but the controlls are tight, and it's very rewarding. It's a lot of fun dispatching the enemies in fun and unique ways and each level provides different paths you can take through it. It's a pretty good length for the price, about 10 hours on a single playthrough, and the different item/upgrade system lets you play each level how you prefer.

This game perfectly pitches character progression and challenge, marrying atmosphere and threat with power-fantasy.\n\nIt's in actuality a puzzle game; if you are detected and discovered, the punishment is rarely less than swift death and a fast reload. Perhaps punishment is the wrong word, as the game never penalises you for failing to outwit one of it's systems, but challenges you to do so with all the timing, strategy and grace of a true ninja. This approach to stealth is something many other titles avoid, especially AAA games with long loading times, which give players to option of fighting their way out of their mistakes. While this may avoid frustrating players with constant failure, 'Mark of the Ninja' proves that less is more when it comes to the mastery of stealth.","November 29, 2014","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game also rewards you for either killing everyone or not killing anyone, since you get a bonus for not killing anyone.

You're a ninja who must accomplish different tasks that require you to be stealthy and deadly.  You're given ninja tools and weapons to accomplish your given tasks with scenarios that allow for a range of different kills or kill styles with a range of bonus points for either.\n\nThe gameplay is smooth and your ninja is easy to control whether you're using the keyboard/mouse or a gamepad (360 controller).  The game puts a nice twist on the 'stealth' genre of games by including more than a "stay out of the lights" playing mentality you usually find.  Of course you have to stay out of the lights but the game makes you think without getting overly complex in movement controls or in problem solving.  I became quite comfortable with movement and action controls rather quickly.\n\nEach level has a number of challenges that contribute to your ranking at the end of that level (IE: hitting all the gongs will get you a bonus).  This allows you to farm for achievements within the game level as well as the Steam achievements for the game itself.\n\nIf you're into 'stealth' style games, this one's a 'must have'.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GerDeathstar/recommended/214560/","GerDeathstar","Deathstar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GerDeathstar/","407 products in account","Your Ninja-clan is under threat by a mysterious mercenary-group and you are chosen to protect it. For that, you are given the Mark of the Ninja, a set of rad tattoos which increase your abilities tenfold at the cost of your mind. Over time, the Mark drives the bearer insane and he must kill himself.\nThe way towards your inevitable fate is to be littered with corpses, though, as you seek to find out what the attack was all about. Mark of the Ninja is a 2D sidescrolling game in which, generally spoken, your goal is to get from the left end to the right end of each level. This is, of course, not all, as various bonus-objectives and collectibles are scattered throughout each mission. Unlike pretenders like (modern) Splinter Cell or even Thief, MotN definitely focuses on stealth above all. Enemies have guns, you have an array of ninjaesque weapons like a sword, kunai (throwing daggers) and a grappling hook. These put you at a disadvantage when going up against the mercenaries directly, so you should stick to the shadows at all times. Making use of the environment to either kill or avoid enemies is what makes up the largest portion of this game. Deciding which route to take, how to take care of them one by one without being spotted etc.. You can use ventilation-shafts and high-up ledges to help you get around. While taking care not to be SEEN, being HEARD is also a threat. Sprinting will give you away to those close by, as will using your grappling hook. The game offers very clear indications, showing you whether or not you can be seen and how far the sound you make will travel, which you can use to your advantage to lure people around as you please.\nCollecting XP from your kills and secrets will allow you to level up your abilities between levels, as well as give you more different kill-moves.\nWhile it is possible to play this game with a keyboard only, using a controller of your choice (preferrably an XBox one for USB) will make the game a lot more fluent and easier to control. Be warned: There are some quick-time-events involved.\nMark of the Ninja has some very pretty 2D graphics which feel absolutely in place for a game like this. It makes for an easy to pick up distraction when you just cannot find the time to play something "large". I picked this up during the last sale, but even on full price, it is not very expensive.\nHave a controller handy?

There are different solutions to each problem (undetected killing, diversions, open fight, evading, instill fear, ...), and the maps are more or less open, there are different ways to reach your waypoints. This variety makes the game quite interesting. Together with upgradeable items, learnable skills, achievements, leaderboards etc I think this game is very replayable. I've had 15 hours of great fun on my first playthrough.\n\nI hope there will be a sequel some day, and my only points of critique are that despite the different tactics the background story feels a little repetitive (find object X, kill person Y), and the (great) visual style feels a little monotonous after many hours of playing (too dark & gloomy). But those things didn't spoil the fun at all for me. Oh, and maybe the non-stealth fights could be a little more complex, but that's not the focus of the game.\n\nCons:\n\nOn Linux the fullscreen mode is broken for me on dual head setups. The game takes over both screens, making it impossible to use the secondary monitor for anything. Alt-Tab to get out of the game is not possible from the game, but you can open the steam overlay to make it possible.","December 2, 2014","true","71.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even tho' it does takes less than 10 hours to complete normal gameplay the achievements and different gamestyles offers some very entertainment hours to play. One minus would be lack of degrees of difficulties because after finishing the game once you get to play "New game plus+" -mode which doesn't really offer that much more challenge than normal gameplay. Also DLC didn't really bring anything awesome and interesting. (excluding one new mission which was pretty fun to play). I might not recommend buying DLC for this game (although it's only 5€) but buying the basic game won't most likely let you down.

The level design really compliments this multi-pronged, open approach with many ways to get from A to B and back again.\n\nI found the game difficulty and pacing to be good and the simple puzzles were welcome. The dedicated puzzle trials/rooms were nice for an extra challenge. The length of the game was decent too, and I didn't collect/complete everything so that would have lengthened it a little more.\n\nI had a blast playing this, especially with the lack of real stealth games out there these days.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RaefGall/recommended/214560/","RaefGall","RaefGall","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RaefGall/","298 products in account","I recently reviewed this game for my game review blog, Five Penny Review. If you enjoy this review, please visit my page:\nhttp://fivepennyreview.blogspot.com/2013/08/mark-of-ninja.html\n\nWhat sets this game apart?\nWhile I have certainly played first-person shooter games that had some reliance on stealth, I have never played many games that would be considered a part of the stealth genre.  The idea of a stealth game designed as a 2D platformer intrigued me, so I tried Mark of the Ninja during the Steam sale and was not disappointed.  While many stealth games seem to devolve into combat at some point, it is fully optional in Mark of the Ninja, and its system is highly tuned to allow you to emphasize stealth and movement.  If you are the type that prefers killing everything in sight, you can still functionally play the game as long as you do so carefully.  The art style is creative and complements the story well, and the cut scenes are generally well composed.\n\nWhat is the difficulty factor?\nWhile this game does a good job of pausing to offer instruction when new mechanics are introduced, the controls for the PC version are not discussed and can be a bit challenging as a result.  Once you experiment enough to figure out how everything works, the mouse control actually makes your movement and aim very natural.  Mark of the Ninja is a fairly difficult game as you progress, largely because of how unforgiving it can be.  It does not take much to kill you if you get caught, and if the alarm sounds it causes a huge loss of points that make it difficult to complete all of the tasks for the level.  With that said, the game is also as hard as you make it, as maximizing your points, completing side missions, and collecting all of the hidden scrolls are all completely optional.  When you do complete the game, the New Game + mode offers an entirely new level of difficulty, even less forgiving and relying much more on your ability to be aware of your surroundings and react quickly.\n\nDoes it use media effectively?\nThe art style utilized by the game is strange, but highly effective.  The game uses smooth cartoonish animation that complements both the style and story, especially considering the story elements involving scrolls and tattoos and the connections in the art style.  The voice acting and music are good enough, but nothing spectacular, especially with the often mediocre dialogue.  The place where this game really shines, however, is in the mechanical visuals and subtle sounds.  The game represents sounds with a ripple effect, revealing when enemies make noise near you and letting you know how far the sounds you make reach, and shows the visual range of enemies with a simple cone before them.  The use of subtle sounds such as footsteps, light switches, doors, and vents play an equally important role, especially in the New Game + mode where the sound ripples no longer appear.\n\nBest moment in the game?\nWhile the cut scenes have their good moments, the gameplay is really where this game shines.  As you unlock new styles, there are some really neat effects in the gameplay, and for me the most interesting is the Path of Nightmares.  In this mode, it becomes easier to trigger the “terrorized” condition in enemies, resulting in the enemies randomly shooting at any little noise, or running and screaming.  This adds another element to the game, as you discover creative ways to terrify the enemies.\n\nWho needs to play this game?\nMark of the Ninja can be played in a variety of ways and can appeal to a variety of different players.  Players who enjoy stealth games like the Tenchu series will likely enjoy it.  Players who enjoy classic platformers will get a lot of enjoyment out of the puzzle-platforming sections, especially the catacombs.  The New Game + mode is extremely challenging, while playing the standard game without going for a high score can be fun to just play around.  It is available on Xbox Live and Steam.","November 28, 2013","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abbe/recommended/214560/","abbe","Abbe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abbe/","806 products in account","Disclaimer: Might be a bit weird, it's late and I have no clue if what I write makes sense. :)\n\nMark of the Ninja is a game you should buy.\nIf you like sneaky games this is definitely for you. It’s one of the best ninja-sneaky-backstab games I have ever played and the sheer intelligence and commitment of the devteam to create a great experience for the player is admirable.\n\nIt took me maybe 14-17 hours for my first playthrough (guessing), and the rest of the time (of a total 26,6h) to play the new DLC level, playing it through again in NG+ and collecting all achievements.\n\nIn short it’s a platform sneak game, you play as a ninja with various skills, keeping to the shadows and trying to advance by backstabbing or avoiding the enemies. You are not the strongest fighter and while you can fight one-on-one, you won’t survive multiple alert enemies, so you take it slow and plan your way forward.\n\nHowever, if things go south you can always flee, or just reload, often you have a checkpoint just outside the area that you tried to clear, so you can be back where you was in a matter of seconds. The game load saves instantly, I have reloaded some checkpoints probably 10-15 times over and over just because I haven’t gotten the right outcome.\n\nSo, the game is great, the areas present different challenges with both puzzles and enemy encounters, forcing you to become a better ninja.\n\nGameplay and design is top-notch, they have put a lot of time in everything from how you make sound to how the enemies walk, act and react. You see enemy sightcones, if they have nightvision, what status they are in and when you run what soundwaves that you make, giving you optimal information to how to approach any situation.\n\nThrough a time-stop mode you can queue up several actions that will be performed by the ninja. So while you are jumping off from a light you can stop time and throw two darts and a poisonbomb and then grapple away to a treebranch.\n\nYou have optional suits to change up your gameplay, I enjoyed almost all of these in my NG+ playthrough, some giving you hilarious combos and chain effects that makes you squeal happily in your seat.\n\nNG+ makes the game harder by removing most of the help that you get as a player, after having played the normal mode and learning these things by heart, it’s very thrilling to not see what’s behind your character. Having to guesstimate how close you can run up to an enemy before he notice your footsteps, or how close you can get to the dog without it picking up your trail. Going by enemy design to judge if they have night-vision and if they are looking in your direction. I enjoyed NG+ maybe even more than normal mode, but the normal mode was excellent practice for it, if I hadn’t played the game in normal mode first, I probably wouldn’t have liked NG+.\n\n\nSo, bad stuff, honestly it’s not that much. Controls can act up a bit, they can be kind of finicky where you need to look to get the correct action. When it’s a tight space and you slide down just behind an enemy you miss some actions that would seem natural to do.\nSome checkpoints in the later levels are horrendous, especially in the last level where you can spawn inside a house where there is a very dangerous enemy patrolling, whom you don’t want to get seen by. Some areas are very large, making a small mistake cost you a lot of work. But most of the time it just work and feels natural.\nI’ve probably become annoyed by more things but honestly they are a speck of dust on a gem.\n\n\nGraphics pretty much look like a very, very pretty flashgame, same with the cinematics. Don’t look down on this, it looks awesome and the ninja animations are awesome. A lot of work have gone into the style to make surfaces and the areas both pretty and functional.\n\nMusic is mostly ambient, works well but nothing you will write love poems about.\n\nTechnically it worked fine, I played with a Xbox 360 controller and had no crashes or anything mess my game up.\n\nHope you buy it and enjoy it as much as I did! :D","August 19, 2013","true","26.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With a gameplay style that rewards tactical precision while still keeping a brisk pace, the game manages to work your brain and reflexes in a way that feels exciting and familiar as a player.\nThe story is clichéd but sincere, the levels are more videogame than reality, and sometimes you'll encounter a loophole or exploit to take away your immersion in favor of ratcheting up your score, but you'll enjoy every minute of it.  Every challenge is met with enjoyment.  No part of the game ever feels like it drags or has that "boring act" structure.\nThe gameplay is finely tuned, with inspiration from every major stealth title out there put to good use.

The aspect I praise the most for this game is the ending. Never have I experienced a ride like this; it was unexpected but quite fulfilling. My only complaint is if you play the special edition. I feel that the written commentary detracts from the experience because you're forced to stop and read what the director had to say if you're interested. It seems like a cumbersome addition as this game has a very nice flow to it, and the commentary essentially obstructs the experience.

The cartoon style immediately put me off; how can you have a serious stealth game when it looks like a childrens program? But after the first bloody kill I was won over. The cartoon style works, it may not be your favorite but you'll soon get over it with gameplay as engaging as this is, however you want to play the game you will find it rewarding. Whether you wish to leap over heads not hurting a fly or wish to leave a trail of death and destruction in you're wake the game gives you points which in turn can be used to unlock various things; either equipment or abilities. That is another aspect of the game I love, the upgrades, while none of them completely change your character you can use various combinations to result in a very different playing experience.

The art is beautiful and the animations are slick. There is a range of environments, each with stunning vibrant parallax scrolling backgrounds offsetting the generally monochrome foreground.\n\nYou start out with a relatively simple set of moves, introducing you to how stealth works in the game; Enemies have vision cones, moving quickly makes sound which draws enemies, you can hide behind environmental objects like vases and dumpsters, slipping through vents and setting up ambushes.\n\nThe game slowly increases your equipment and move set (all of which can be customised) as you play. Each level has challenges for you to attempt, each of which unlocks a token you can spend on upgrading your gear. Complete enough of certain challenge types will unlock new costumes which include a gear restriction or boon. For example, completing 3 'Terror' challenges unlocks a gear set that makes you run without making any noise, but you lose your sword, forcing you to a fast and non-lethal playstyle.\n\nThe story is relatively simplistic, but presented in short stylized cutscenes that work well. The story has a twist with a choice at the end, but it is nothing earth-shattering and not really the focus of the experience. The joy here is in the gameplay, the smooth controls (even if playing with a keyboard and mouse) and the art.\n\nAfter completion you unlock a new game plus mode, which increases the number of guards and increases the difficulty.","February 12, 2013","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are numerous ways to approach any given situation: use darts to create distractions that help you navigate your way undetected past guards, lure enemies into traps you set, dangle above them and string them up Batman-style, hide in a vent below and pull them under or let them pass...whether you choose to go full stealth and avoid everyone or to murder all the bad guys on screen, the game rewards you, which is refreshing given that most stealth games penalize you for taking the latter route despite how much fun it is. Your enemy's field of vision is represented as a Metal Gear Solid-style cone and the audible noises you make as expanding & contracting circles - this results in the near-complete absence of a HUD, which further immerses you in the game's superb Sumi-E art design as the difficulty rises on a steady incline, never failing to challenge you in new and creative ways. Mark Of The Ninja stylishly takes its place among the best of its kind and deserves every bit of the acclaim it's garnered.","August 26, 2013","true","9.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Naturally, the best solution to a problem usually involves removing that problem but you are rewarded for ghosting through and leaving everyone alive and unaware you were ever there.  The rewards come in the form of even more ways to murder people though, so that's... conflicted I guess.\n\nThis dualistic nature also extends into the visuals which favor about as bright and expressive a style as one could really have in a game about sticking to the darkness.  This pays off with really satisfying expressions on your victims during kills for the more sadistic among you but it will definitely bother those who want their grindhouse ninja-ing to be taken as seriously as the central storyline suggests.\n\nOh, and if you hate halfway sitting games, you WILL be murdered toot sweet if you decide to just charge in and attack head on.

End of explanation.\n\nOf course, that isn't helpful at all for a review, so let me start over. In Mark of the Ninja (MotN) you play the role of a ninja that just received a tattoo (hence, the Mark of the Ninja) and wake up to hearing the ninja complex you live in under attack. I won't go any further on the story since I do think it would ruin everything for everyone.\n\nThe biggest truth to be said about this game is that it is a stealth-approach game. Before it, you can argue that the stealth genre was lacking some sort of depth. You can also argue that Metal Gear games want you to use stealth, but in no way does Snake compete with the protagonist of MotN.\n\nAs a ninja, you get your standard ninja stereotypes. If you're sneaky, you are lethal and kill anything that isn't a rock in one precise assassination strike. Resorting to fighting out in the open = you died, because if you've seen Indiana Jones you know that gun beats any weapon skill as long as there is any range between two persons, and that's when there's only one gunman. Throwing knives are infinite, but cheap as they are they can't kill people: only force them to go look for the wise guy that thought of jabbing them with glorified sharper sticks.\n\nSo, naturally, you need some ninja gear that actually does stuff. Well, say no more. Spike traps that make witnesses of their workings lose their mind over how gory they can get? Check. Smoke bombs to create visibility problems and let you move with no fear? Check. Beetles to eat your enemies and leave no evidence...? Wow, I wouldn't want to be the one handling that particular jar. Bottom line is that there are plenty of tools for your ninja. But also bottom line, fine print, is that you are restricted severely as to how many of said devices you can carry, and even of the types of devices you can carry.\n\nBecause you see, being a ninja is cool and all, but you can be a specialist in the world of the ninjas too. Unlock different suits and get something improved, at the cost of gimping something else. For some people it may be that they want to guarantee not to screw up an assassination, or that their bare fists actually hurt people, or that they want to be able to teleport around because you know that's going to save your life for sure. It all boils down to how you play the game that will have you choose which outfit is the best fit for you.\n\nI've been saying good things about the game. Are there any bad things about the game? Yes.\n\nThe story feels short. A good player on his first run might unlock just about everything at the first opportunity provided. Other than the imposed limitations of the system and how creative you are, some sections are not exactly very interesting or are unjustifiably difficult for almost no reason. The "hard mode" is basically the exact same game, except you die with a single hit (as you should, you wannabe ninja,) and you lose your fourth wall of indicators (sounds happening and visual fields) of the environment, which you also shouldn't be playing with them on unless you're learning how far each goes.\n\nAnd there. That's it. That's the review of the game. Now let me review something else.\n\nMotN came out for the XBox Live first. I said, "I don't judge a game by where it was born, I judge for how good it is". And indeed the game was fine. Until I realized that I was in the top scoring lead (think I was even 3rd on a level once, in a time that already had a large playerbase that could potentially blot such a result away), and that even if I was the third ranked on a level there was always someone with "plausibly higher" scores than me... and then the hackers showed up. Imagine the Mario Bros game, and that there was a set maximum ever theoretical value of score that you could legally attain. Then imagine people with scores over 100 times higher. My single motivation of getting the highest score I could manage went out the window, pure and simple, because these scores were never removed. Never mind banning the leaderboards to known hackers, the blasphemy simply stayed there to haunt me. This says much to me about the developper, Klei Entertainment, who apparently doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥.\n\nAnd speaking of Klei Entertainment, I bought the game as soon as it came out for Steam because I knew this was guaranteed to be a good stealth game: the premise was good, the few videos showcasing a little of the game looked great and even the screenshots made me think everything was perfect. With the disappointment of the above came the sin that Klei made. Not only did they decide to screw price conversion overseas (since Klei is american AND greedy, and the dollar is worth significantly less than other currencies,) but then they added the DLC of the "special edition".\n\nWhat's on the DLC? A new suit that favours a different niche of gameplay (but is still essentially the same gameplay) and a new long-ish level that you HAVE to play with that suit because of limitations. You may be thinking: "No, the dlc also includes something else". True: the DLC included a developpers' commentary strewn across all the levels. Imagine how disappointing it was to see that it was walls of text, not voiced, that could have even been shipped with the base game. Do you consider it to be worth the price of a third of the base game? I sure don't. It also ticked me off that for someone like me, who bought the game full price overseas, to have to pay the price of the DLC when everyone else that decided to get the game AFTER the DLC came out would be saving a fifth of that value. You may think: "That's not a very high price, a whole 1 (insert currency)". Why should I pay more for being one of the original players? Couldn't THEY cut that whole 1 (insert currency) from the price instead? They also justified that developing the DLC cost money... and so they wasted resources there instead of making a new game? Brilliant logic; with me being shunned out of the game with the hacked leaderboards and little other incentive to play, it was certainly I that wanted more content for a game I no longer played. For the record, I got the DLC on a major discount so I could witness for myself how little it added, and so that one of the few games I had 100% achievements wouldn't be broken forever. Because yes: EVERYONE loves dlc-specific-non-optional-breaking-of-hundred-per-cents achievements.\n\nAlso to keep in mind is how flawed one particular part of the game is. If I unlocked everything, WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ SHOULD I HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE UPGRADES MENU EVERYTIME I "WANT" TO SET UP WHAT GEAR I'M WEARING FOR A MISSION? This includes those moments where, in the middle of a stage, you can (or are basically forced to) change your setup. Such ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, many confirmations, much anger, wow. Time that I could be actually spending playing the game, let me remind you. Klei Entertainment could have fixed this really early on; it's still in-game, AFAIK.\n\nShould you buy MotN? Yes, definitely: especially if you want to experience a true geniously good stealth game; I have no idea how everyone failed to make a stealth game this good before MotN. Make sure you get the special edition, however, since you don't want to pay more because you didn't get it before. And even then, wait for a discount so if you get disappointed you'll say "oh well, at least I didn't pay that full, overseas-inflated price". But me personally? I'll forever be keeping an eye out for Klei Entertainment and their greedy antics; their image, to me, is now worse than ♥♥♥♥.","June 19, 2014","true","38.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I enjoyed it a lot.\n\nI especially liked how clear the stealth elements were.  You always know exactly how much noise you'll make and who will hear it, and you also always have a strong idea of how well and where the enemy can see.  Good times.\n\nThe stages are long, however, and if you intend to kill all the dudes/do all the things expect to take about 30-50 minutes per level.  I had difficulty playing more than one stage at a time and I very often got kind of bored about halfway into a stage.  As fun as the game is, it gets very monotonous: there really isn't a whole lot of variety going on here.\n\nThe music and sounds are pretty solid but the voice acting is lacking (much like it was in Shank, whatcha gon' do).  The story, while basic, is good and I liked it.\n\nThere's an upgrade system but there might as well not be for how much it comes into play.  You'll grab the super useful things, like the ability to kill dudes from behind doors or in cover, almost right away and then just not really want anything else.  Nothing is bad, necessarily, but a lot of the abilities just aren't really useful.  Additionally, by completing x number of different objective types (terror, stealth, kill things and maybe a few others) you unlock different suits.  The different suits change the basic gameplay somewhat, such as allowing you to carry two attack items instead of an attack and distraction item.  The different skillsets are neat but I never really found myself wanting to use anything aside from the basic set because it's so balanced.\n\nThe first playthrough isn't so difficult but when you do make mistakes you usually won't have to repeat large chunks of the stage.\n\nI got about 8-10 hours of play out of this, which was about double the time I spent on Shank, so that's good.  Additionally I wasn't so big on gathering all the hidden stuff or acing all of the stages, and I also didn't do NG+, so there's a lot of potential for this game to eat up a lot of time (assuming that's what you're into).\n\nOverall I considered this a very positive and enlightening experience.  If nothing else, it had me thinking about platformers and general stealth elements differently than I had in the past, and that's great (from a design perspective, at least).  It's a good game and it should definitely be in your library.","July 11, 2014","true","14.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's up to you to track down the people responcible for the attack and annihilate them like a good ninja would. But along the way you uncover something that puts your loyalty to your Master at risk. What is it? Play it and find out.\nI love this game, it's one of the best stealth games I've ever played. Even though it's not an immersive first-person game, it really makes you feel like a real ninja. With how you barely make any sound when you sneak around, using the shadows to your advantage, and of course the grusome executions of enemies.\nOne cool thing about the game is, like Dishonored, you can actually go through most levels without killing anyone. And while some may think, "Where's the fun in that?" You can actually get a bonus at the end of each level for not killing anyone, or being seen by anyone, plus going that route make the game more suspenseful and challenging.\nThere are also some amazing weapons you aquire throughout the game. Like the "Fear Darts," which make enemies see there's fellow gunmen as horrifying hillucinations and shoot at them. Or, my favorite, the "Carnivorous Beetles" which can devour an enemy alive, bone and all.\nAlong with the weapons, you can unlock different costumes, which each have different advantages and disadvantages. My favorite of them is definitely the "Nightmare" costume, which will instantly terrify enemies if they see someone you killed, or if they see you.\nThe only thing I really have to complain about is that on some computers the game will run great, but right when you decide to quit the game, it will freeze your computer and you'll have to restart it. It's really annoying, but doesn't really affect the overall gameplay in any way.\nI really can't reccomend this game enough, even with the annoying occasional crashing at the end it's still great. If you love games like Dishonored and Assassin's Creed you'll definately love this game.","February 20, 2014","true","23.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Those who are fans of classic side scroll games should get this one as it makes for a good break from all the usual mechanics of the platform.\n\nThe shadowy business you get into in this games is presented quite well. The art style was the first thing that got me hooked - this game is the bloodier, darker, more violent cousin of Samurai Jack. Set in a modern day metropolis, the environment makes for a good contrast to the ancient arts of the ninja. The ancient ways will be challenged by all modern means - guns, spotlights, motion sensors, and laser triggered security.\n\nThe shadowy arts never felt any simpler with the smoothness of controls - there is little room for the awkward movements and bad camera angles in this 2D platformer. Slipping in and out of the shadows is one click away! This, I think, is another good score for the game as it leaves only your good timing and judgement to deal with a present challenge.\n\nLevels have varied goals to meet - the game can't be done perfectly by just staying hidden in the shadows forever. There are instances where your blade will get stained. (In some occasions, the goals aren't even related to being a ninja but it's all fun and challenging all the same.)\n\nAs you progress into the game, your are introduced to its very own customization system. Clearing goals allow you to buy additional stealth kills and improved ninja styles and tools.\n\nThe story - which I haven't finished, actually, isn't really that unique. Revenge and self-preservation is its very core to say the least, cloaked in shadow and with a very sharp sword.\n\nFor those who are fans of side-scrolling and stealth, this one should definitely not be missed.\n\n","January 12, 2014","true","28.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Mark of the Ninja is a terrific stealth game in which only your creativity and some slightly rough game mechanics are the limits. You take on the role as a ninja of the Hisomu clan nad set out on a mission to avenge your fallen comrades after a raid on your clan's home.\nThe game offers a rich amount of tools that you can use as you progress through the various missions. Your items include a sword, darts, a grappling hook, various items used for distraction and some used for trap kills.\nYou can choose to kill every enemy alive or go unseen through the whole game but no matter what your moral choices are, you'll hopefully find yourself striving towards some very addictive additional goals during the playthrough.\n\nOf course, the game isn't perfect and that should be noted. I never enjoyed the art style a lot. That is because it felt rather American, while the game revolves around japanese characters. Some of the mechanics are slightly buggy and that can be bothersome until you find your way around it. The last enemies in the game just feel rather cheap and overpowered. One annoyance is that there are some achievements that you can only unlock if you have the DLC, which feels like a cheap way to make users purchase it just to beat the game 100%.","March 4, 2014","true","24.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Little did I know that I would have eventually put in nearly 30 hours of quality gaming into this artistic masterpiece.\n\nRight off the bat I could tell how polished and clean the graphics were. What really made the game sing were the simple lighting effects and the amazing depth of field they added. Depth of field in a 2D game! Who would've thought. Basically, whatever isn't in your character's line of sight is blurry. Simple yet added a nice touch to the game. The running, killing, climbing, etc animations were all fluid and sexy. Nice simple cinematics added to the feel of the game.\n\nSo it looks great, and sounds just as good. I love the ambiance in the game. The drums are my favorite, really sets the pace of the game. Audio is nice and smooth, nothing sounded off while playing.\n\nThe gameplay itself was something unexpected. It started off simple, and got more complex as it continued. I had no problems finishing the levels while either killing everyone or not killing anyone. Most levels had several paths and ways to handle every situation. Even more so, with the array of tools you're provided to handle missions. I honestly never came to a part of the game that frustrated me, or made me want to rage quit. With each obstacle presented, I had fun figuring out the best way to handle each situation.\n\nMark of the Ninja is going on my top list of favorite games.

There is no actual combat, meaning if the player is spotted then you have to run, hide and accept the penalty to your final score.\nI like the concept of sticking to the shadows and utilizing the environment to move from point to point to avoid being seen, the player can climb to higher areas, hide in vents, duck behind cover or create a distraction to keep out of the sightlines of the patrolling guards. What I dislike about MotN is how the kills are managed, utilizing one of my greatest gaming pet-peeves, quick-time events. When you approach an enemy and click on them to begin your attack, the game will give you a split-second warning to slide your mouse either to the left or the right, a successful attempt will give you a silent assassination while failure to complete the event will end up making a lot of noise and attracting nearby guards.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wirdjos5/recommended/214560/","wirdjos5","Wirdjos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wirdjos5/","89 products in account","Mark of the Ninja is a ninja simulator, plain and simple. Stealth is as much a part of it as action is, and the strongest point of the game is the way it plays with the balance between the two in order to represent a variety of different ninja tropes. The stealth works so well due to how explicit the game is. The effects of light and sound are clearly marked, leaving no guess to the consequences of your actions. This allows for complex strategies without the sudden surprise of a detection. The game's finer points are explained by a companion, Orai. This keeps tutorials and backstory in the game's context while allowing the protagonist to remain silently stoic, both avoiding an assigned protagonist personality and playing towards another ninja trope. The game's weakest areas seem to be those that weren't developed simultaneously; the cartoony art style, the same one used in the studio's previous game, doesn't quite jive with Mark of the Ninja's more serious tone and the PC control scheme leaves something to be desired. Several actions are tied to single keys based on exacting and constantly changing contexts. Despite clearly marking the outcome, this makes complicated maneuvers almost impossible to execute swiftly. As far as the DLC, the only strong point of it seems to be the commentary. It does add a new ninja path and two new weapons which do add a new set of options and restrictions, but that doesn't totally change the game. Which begs the question of whether commentary is worth the extra expense.","July 6, 2015","true","24.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The guard AI is smart, the art direction is neat, but there's something that feels weird about accidentally jumping on top of a building and realizing that I've hit an invisible wall in a 2D game. It's not that the game is bad or that the design should be limitless, Mark of the Ninja just feels like an experience handcrafted to make me feel like a cool guy who kills a bunch of people.\n\nMetal Gear Solid 2, on the other hand, is a game that only becomes expressive after you've decided to die a bunch of times. It's linear, but the tools Kojima gives you are entirely built for survival on harder difficulties.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is that while Mark of the Ninja is a great game, it seems to miss out on the part of stealth games where you get killed a lot and are able to feel more powerful as you explore your options.

You are in control of a nameless ninja protagonist that undertakes various missions, and to that end, you have an array of tools and techniques at your disposal for hiding from, distracting, and even stealth killing the various enemies you will run into along the way. While it is technically possible to engage in direct combat, it is basically never a good idea to do so, as your character severely lacks in raw durability.\n\nBecause of this, Mark of the Ninja is more of a puzzle-based platformer than a combat-based one. Many areas require some thinking and planning in order to get yourself safely through, particularly if you aim for the bonus challenges and achievements that the game is full of. Thankfully, the game provides you with many audio and visual indicators of enemy behavior, such as their sight/hearing radius, keeping the frustration aspect of the game pleasantly minimal and letting you focus your attention on the particular details of whatever area you're in.\n\nThe one main criticism I would make about Mark of the Ninja is the repetitive nature of it. While the game definitely makes efforts to keep things fresh and provide you with new challenges, you will probably find that a handful of core tools and techniques can be repeatedly used for most purposes. This isn't helped by the presentation aspects of the game; while the artstyle and music are very appropriately done, their sparse nature makes it difficult to feel like you're really experiencing new environments, and the story, while not terrible, isn't really worth remembering or mentioning.\n\nStill, for all that, Mark of the Ninja definitely provides solid hours of engaging puzzles (if that's your thing), and if you find you want more of the gameplay, the bonus content and the DLC (which I haven't looked at) is probably worth a look.","June 21, 2014","true","13.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Mark of the Ninja is a terrific stealth game in which only your creativity and some slightly rough game mechanics are the limits. You take on the role as a ninja of the Hisomu clan nad set out on a mission to avenge your fallen comrades after a raid on your clan's home.\nThe game offers a rich amount of tools that you can use as you progress through the various missions. Your items include a sword, darts, a grappling hook, various items used for distraction and some used for trap kills.\nYou can choose to kill every enemy alive or go unseen through the whole game but no matter what your moral choices are, you'll hopefully find yourself striving towards some very addictive additional goals during the playthrough.\n\nOf course, the game isn't perfect and that should be noted. I never enjoyed the art style a lot. That is because it felt rather American, while the game revolves around japanese characters. Some of the mechanics are slightly buggy and that can be bothersome until you find your way around it. The last enemies in the game just feel rather cheap and overpowered. One annoyance is that there are some achievements that you can only unlock if you have the DLC, which feels like a cheap way to make users purchase it just to beat the game 100%.","March 4, 2014","true","24.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Those who are fans of classic side scroll games should get this one as it makes for a good break from all the usual mechanics of the platform.\n\nThe shadowy business you get into in this games is presented quite well. The art style was the first thing that got me hooked - this game is the bloodier, darker, more violent cousin of Samurai Jack. Set in a modern day metropolis, the environment makes for a good contrast to the ancient arts of the ninja. The ancient ways will be challenged by all modern means - guns, spotlights, motion sensors, and laser triggered security.\n\nThe shadowy arts never felt any simpler with the smoothness of controls - there is little room for the awkward movements and bad camera angles in this 2D platformer. Slipping in and out of the shadows is one click away! This, I think, is another good score for the game as it leaves only your good timing and judgement to deal with a present challenge.\n\nLevels have varied goals to meet - the game can't be done perfectly by just staying hidden in the shadows forever. There are instances where your blade will get stained. (In some occasions, the goals aren't even related to being a ninja but it's all fun and challenging all the same.)\n\nAs you progress into the game, your are introduced to its very own customization system. Clearing goals allow you to buy additional stealth kills and improved ninja styles and tools.\n\nThe story - which I haven't finished, actually, isn't really that unique. Revenge and self-preservation is its very core to say the least, cloaked in shadow and with a very sharp sword.\n\nFor those who are fans of side-scrolling and stealth, this one should definitely not be missed.\n\n","January 12, 2014","true","28.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Controls are ideal, levels are designed to give you multiple options for objective completion. There are usually alternate paths to avoid or take out guards in different ways, for example. The scoring/leaderboard system encourages you to replay levels and beat your record. If you're good at the game and know what to expect in a level, you can really fly through - but each level can also take quite a long time, especially if you're looking for the secrets (and want to unlock all the goodies - different stealth moves and weapons!).\n\nI think player progression is key in making a great game - ask yourself if you become a better player as you progress through the game. If not, then it's mostly just a time sink. If yes, then the rewards are much greater! In Mark of the Ninja, the answer is a resounding yes, a testament to how polished and well-designed the game is.","August 21, 2013","true","19.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The art is beautiful and the animations are slick. There is a range of environments, each with stunning vibrant parallax scrolling backgrounds offsetting the generally monochrome foreground.\n\nYou start out with a relatively simple set of moves, introducing you to how stealth works in the game; Enemies have vision cones, moving quickly makes sound which draws enemies, you can hide behind environmental objects like vases and dumpsters, slipping through vents and setting up ambushes.\n\nThe game slowly increases your equipment and move set (all of which can be customised) as you play. Each level has challenges for you to attempt, each of which unlocks a token you can spend on upgrading your gear. Complete enough of certain challenge types will unlock new costumes which include a gear restriction or boon. For example, completing 3 'Terror' challenges unlocks a gear set that makes you run without making any noise, but you lose your sword, forcing you to a fast and non-lethal playstyle.\n\nThe story is relatively simplistic, but presented in short stylized cutscenes that work well. The story has a twist with a choice at the end, but it is nothing earth-shattering and not really the focus of the experience. The joy here is in the gameplay, the smooth controls (even if playing with a keyboard and mouse) and the art.\n\nAfter completion you unlock a new game plus mode, which increases the number of guards and increases the difficulty.","February 12, 2013","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

All throughout my playtime I can honestly say I felt like a ninja.  Everything is smooth and simple, and tons of fun.  Downsides are amount of game-time and replay value.  While there is a New Game+ mode that offers a bit more challenge, it's still the same missions that you've already played through, so there isn't much that will surprise you your second time around.  It's an awesome game that, in my opinion, definitely needs a sequel.  And the sequel needs a level creator and Steam Workshop!  Gameplay is incredible and smooth, but the amount of gameplay truly available is certainly a downfall.  Definitely still a recommended playthrough.","January 9, 2014","true","19.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Overlooked this game for a while but really glad I picked it up. The game has a decent sized campaign with lots of challenges in every level. I found there was a lot of ways to approach every situation, either with lethal or non lethal takedowns, entry points or use of gadgets. Really felt like a true badass ninja in this game. You have the ability to terrorize your enemies and sink back into the shadows, causing them to panic and attack other guards, it's pretty great. I felt like Batman. Like I said very nicely stylized, which I expected from a Klei game. Nice art direction and animations all around, and cool tradition ninja themes mixed with more high-tech stuff.

Little did I know that I would have eventually put in nearly 30 hours of quality gaming into this artistic masterpiece.\n\nRight off the bat I could tell how polished and clean the graphics were. What really made the game sing were the simple lighting effects and the amazing depth of field they added. Depth of field in a 2D game! Who would've thought. Basically, whatever isn't in your character's line of sight is blurry. Simple yet added a nice touch to the game. The running, killing, climbing, etc animations were all fluid and sexy. Nice simple cinematics added to the feel of the game.\n\nSo it looks great, and sounds just as good. I love the ambiance in the game. The drums are my favorite, really sets the pace of the game. Audio is nice and smooth, nothing sounded off while playing.\n\nThe gameplay itself was something unexpected. It started off simple, and got more complex as it continued. I had no problems finishing the levels while either killing everyone or not killing anyone. Most levels had several paths and ways to handle every situation. Even more so, with the array of tools you're provided to handle missions. I honestly never came to a part of the game that frustrated me, or made me want to rage quit. With each obstacle presented, I had fun figuring out the best way to handle each situation.\n\nMark of the Ninja is going on my top list of favorite games. It's well worth the $15 asking price, regardless of any kind of steam sale. Crossing my fingers for a sequel.","March 17, 2014","true","27.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is no actual combat, meaning if the player is spotted then you have to run, hide and accept the penalty to your final score.\nI like the concept of sticking to the shadows and utilizing the environment to move from point to point to avoid being seen, the player can climb to higher areas, hide in vents, duck behind cover or create a distraction to keep out of the sightlines of the patrolling guards. What I dislike about MotN is how the kills are managed, utilizing one of my greatest gaming pet-peeves, quick-time events. When you approach an enemy and click on them to begin your attack, the game will give you a split-second warning to slide your mouse either to the left or the right, a successful attempt will give you a silent assassination while failure to complete the event will end up making a lot of noise and attracting nearby guards. (This is especially bad if you're like me and you can never immediately figure out left from right on the spot.

The levels are really challenging and provide repetitive fun if you want to find all the collectibles and alter your gameplay - either kill and terrorize every guard in your way or be like a shadow and avoid the guards completely. For each mission you pick a costume (if you unlock them), which grants specific bonuses to each style you fight want to try out. If the screenshots and videos got your attention, don't hesitate about Mark of the Ninja, it's even better when you try it! 9/10","September 21, 2013","true","16.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not only does it do that, it does so masterfully, with strong attention to all of the things that can make or break a stealth game.\nThe art deco inspired aesthetics fit the japanese and urban settings surprisingly well, characters animate great and special attention is given to each locale in order to accommodate the stealth based nature of the game. A very important aspect of any stealth game is the sound design, this one nails it, it has a somber, unobtrusive score and slick audio cues for situations when a silent pursuit is close to turn into an unwanted confrontation. The mechanics and items are varied and tend to bolster the options available for handling situations. You'll rarely, if ever, get bored of what's being offered.\nUmmm...

It is overall very well made:  comic book-esque animation beautifully done including animated cut scenes; voice acting is very quality; controls with a Playstation (and I assume Xbox) are very good and fit perfectly with the gameplay, which also very excellent and fun (I have not tried playing with a keyboard and/or mouse).

If this seems frightening or overbearing, feel free to ignore this review, and refer to the average 3-line steam review of your choice. But if you do, you're pretty much a troglodyte.\n\nMark of the Ninja is a 2d stealth game by Klei, the same guys who made Shank and Shank 2. The same buttery fluid animations and art direction are present in Mark of the Ninja. Quite frankly, the game looks amazing in motion. Once you get the hang of the controls and the environments, you put whatever the current-gen protagonists of Assassin's Creed are called to shame. That's inadequate, you make the free-running elements in AC look like a geriatric with a crutches by comparison.\n\nThe story, so far (I've yet to beat it), is rather straight-forward stuff. You've gotten inked by your clan's tattooist Dosan, with ink which heightens your senses and gives you a convenient array of abilities that are mainstays in video games. But the downside is that the ink burns you out, and will ultimately drive you mad. So you've taken this Mark, in order to undertake a mission to safeguard your clan's existence.\nAnd once you've completed your task, you're going to kill yourself.\n\nBefore that though, truckloads upon truckloads of henchmen are going to get theirs.\nAlternatively, they will not even know you were there.\n\nKlei made the Shank games. Shank games are 80-ish action homages as sidescrolling beat-em-up. MotN is the AC/Batman/Splinter Cell/Tenchu/Sneak-em-up treatment of a sidescroller. You have essentially complete freedom in how you choose to undertake your missions. And by how, I mean the level of lethality and bloodshed that will befall those who made the poor career choices that culminated in ending up on the wrong side of your blade. Or those ninja traps you will unlock or buy eventually. Or, you will just quietly slip by them. Hiding in doorways, behind potted plants, crawling past them on the ceiling, grappling from lamp-post to lamp-post above their heads, sneaking in the vents below or above them. The sneaking is really good. Like REALLY good, REALLY good.\n\nYour equipment at first consists of firecrackers for distraction, a sword for stealth killing (kills are executed like a QTE, but not nearly as annoying. You press a direction and X to cut someone up), and that's all you got at first.\nLater on you get a grappling hook, spike traps which work like land mines, smoke bombs and more fun stuff to play around with.\n\nThere are challenge rooms you might encounter (they look like gongs), which mix up the regular levels by being more of platforming challenges/puzzles. They use the normal game elements to complete, which manages to both freshen up how you think about the environments and traps/hazards in the game, as well as giving you a fresh lease on how to approach situations in subsequent levels.\n\nI know a lot of game reviews fall prey to the pitfalls of hyperbole and similes, and I've already planted my foot firmly in that territory. And I kinda detest that. But honestly, it's impossible to do it when talking about MotN.\n\nHell, it's just straight-up amazing.\n\nThe stealth&stalk bits are great. The array of gadgets are groovy, as is the techniques you unlock with honor points as you complete levels. Some of them are different types of stealth kills, while another lessen the sound you make while sprinting, or allow you to string up dead guard from lamp posts in order to frighten other guards senseless. You can actually terrify guards to the point of them losing it completely, where they just start shooting wildly at everything they see or imagine they see. The only downside so far, is that sometimes it's a bit wonky whether you get the bonus for hiding bodies or not, and you might have to drop them a couple of times before it registers. Or possibly that's just left in there as a reference to Metal Gear Solid games. I'm not putting it past these devs, this is obviously a labour of love.\n\nThis is definitely a high-score type of operation, and I'm gonna come back to these levels.\nYou're scored on stealth kills.\nYou're scored on sneaking past guards closely while remaining undetected, and on distracting them.\nYou're scored on equipment kills, on terrifying guards (and the possible resulting friendly fire), and hiding bodies.\n\nIn each level, you can find 3 scrolls which tell the story of your clan and how it came to be, and what led up to you taking on the Mark in the first place. These also give you a point of honor each, which is used to purchase upgrades inbetween missions or at banner stops within levels.\n\nThere are also 3 seals per level. Seals are the same thing as optional objectives or challenges.\nThese seals fall into Path of Hunter, Combat, Nightmares or Shadow.\n(Names subject to making-up by me, just now, seeing as it's late and I can't be arsed to start the game to be correct.)\nCompleting enough of these nets you new outfits with special pros and cons. For instance, the sneaky suit silences the sound of running feet, and allows you to carry 2 distraction items in your loadout. But the tradeoff is your sword.\n\nFor anyone who enjoys 2d games with tight controls, this is a must.\nFor anyone who enjoys cartoon violence, this is a must.\nIf you've ever played a game that had a great single-player campaign, but was hamstrung by a forced multiplayer that was just put in there in order to sell the game to people who think singleplayer games are a waste of time, you need to get this in order to support the practice of making "great games that don't need no multiplayer".\nFor anyone who played and enjoyed any of the stealth elements in any of the recent Arkham games, this is a must.\nFor anyone who has ever daydreamed of being a ninja, this is a must.\n\n\n...I just want slap a "MUST BUY" sticker on this.\nThe rest of all the games I bought this holiday sale and have yet to play might turn out to be complete ♥♥♥♥, but Mark of the Ninja more than makes up for that possibility.","December 26, 2014","true","17.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are numerous ways to approach any given situation: use darts to create distractions that help you navigate your way undetected past guards, lure enemies into traps you set, dangle above them and string them up Batman-style, hide in a vent below and pull them under or let them pass...whether you choose to go full stealth and avoid everyone or to murder all the bad guys on screen, the game rewards you, which is refreshing given that most stealth games penalize you for taking the latter route despite how much fun it is. Your enemy's field of vision is represented as a Metal Gear Solid-style cone and the audible noises you make as expanding & contracting circles - this results in the near-complete absence of a HUD, which further immerses you in the game's superb Sumi-E art design as the difficulty rises on a steady incline, never failing to challenge you in new and creative ways. Mark Of The Ninja stylishly takes its place among the best of its kind and deserves every bit of the acclaim it's garnered.","August 26, 2013","true","9.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Nevertheless, I usually have a lot of fun with the games. Mark of the Ninja is one of the most fun stealth games that I've played in a long time, as well as being one of the most immersive. The reason why is because of the stage design. Stages are absolute monsters that sometimes feel like a Super Metroid level than anything else. This game has a lot of exploration capabilities as well as plenty of non-linear apporaches you can take to meet objectives. There's even plenty of items to suit your playstyle. Do you wanna have fun scaring the pants off of enemies? String up bodies on grapple points. Are you a fan of the "out of sight, out of mind" mentality of guard AI? There's a suit that allows you to have full motion silence with the tradeoff of not being able to bring a sword with you. I'm more of a fan of going undetected and (preferably) not killing anyone, as I feel that stays truest to the stealth genre as a whole. However, if combat becomes a necessity, you could always hack your way out of a scenario.\n\nWhile I hardly did any fighting myself, the enemies seem to have pretty good AI whenever they've caught a glance at you, often backing up for reinforcements then pushing hard. There's also enough enemy variety to keep things interesting, but most of the time the thing that makes the game interesting are the stages themselves. Usually I get a bit annoyed whenever a game doesn't have any boss fights, but I wasn't that annoyed with it in this game, as an actual boss would've felt counter-intuitive to the design of the game. As far as the challenge of this game, I could see this being pretty easy for the stealth savant, but for the average person, I think the difficulty is just about right, if a bit too easy at the beginning. I think that the game could've done with a few less checkpoints per area so that you really have to slow down and not make things a trial and error fest, but I could also see the reasoning for the checkpoints. Checkpoints can screw you over at times, although this only happened to me once (a checkpoint put me in front of an enemy, ruining my chances for a no detect for that level), so be sure to take it easy for a couple of seconds once you see the checkpoint symbol.\n\nApart from that, there really isn't too much more to talk about. It's a stealth game with a ton of great design sensibilities, it allows you to take things however you want to, and it's overall just a really fun game that's definitely worth your time. 10/10.\n\nStory: Everything up to the ending: pretty not bad, but not anything terribly memorable. The ending: should not be as good as it was. No seriously, dat ending. Actually, in retrospect, one of the main purposes of the plot up until the ending seems to be setting seeds for the final areas. As for the characters, they're kind of prototypical Japanese ninja movie characters, but oh well. Dat ending. 8/10.\n\nGraphics: I don't need to tell you that this game is absolutely phenomenal looking. You've got eyes. As for the technical aspects, the game fullscreened to my native resolution of 1080p without any hassle. Also, if you do happen to skip cutscenes, you may find that areas lag for a bit but then sort themselves out afterward. It's only a minor annoyance, since once you get past those spots, the game runs at a perfect 60FPS. 5/5.\n\nSound: The soundtrack is pretty dang good, and once again, the ending is the thing that really takes the cake. Most of it is pretty ambient stuff, but it does a very good job at setting the mood. Fortunately, there weren't any sound glitches I experienced. As for the voice acting, it works fine. It's good enough. No award winning material, but hey, we can't expect that from everything. Disappointingly, it doesn't seem like the Special Edition comes with the soundtrack, but oh well; that's what Youtube is for. 5/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 10/8/5/5; cumulative score of 9.3/10. I noticed that this review ended up being a lot shorter than a lot of my others. Honestly, I think that's because I don't really have anything else to say other than, "It's good. You should go get it."","August 8, 2014","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Best game in this class in my mind. I have played many stealth games, and this is my favorite.

The controls are good in either case. You feel powerful and in control over your character; it is in fact one of the stregths of the game.\n\nOne of the many great things about this game is that you have many options on completing the levels, especially as you unlock new equipment and "character" (sort of).

Animations are smooth, non-redundant and tastefully exaggerated.\n\nControls are incredibly compact, which will certainly help you stay in function in every single move. This is absolutely important in an action-stealth game.\n\nGameplay in Mark of the Ninja is highly innovative, and also very brutal. You as a ninja are given a wide variety of equipment, tools and courses of actions to proceed and complete your missions. However, make one wrong move, and you may consider yourself finished, as you are a Ninja, not a Rambo. The shadow is your friend, not the fists.\n\nOverall, Mark of the Ninja is an absolute gem of the 2D side-scroller and stealth genre. If you are a big fan of either of those, or both, then this game is definitely a must-have.\n\n","December 4, 2013","true","17.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Easy to learn, hard to master. Good replayability: has nice achievements, challenges for each level ("seals") and exploration for hidden stuff. If you're good at it, you'll be able to get upgrades faster. Upgrades are not like "in your way", but they are still very useful: new ways to kill, to move, to trick people.\n\nClassic stelath with light exposure and sound as your main foes. A great number of ways to handle just about anything with either lethal takedowns (in many ways!), clever distraction (like scaring the s**t out of people), or just avoidance ("don't mind me, just passin' through"). All spiced up with cartooney yet serious art style (Klei is good at it!) and good audio (music and SFX).\n\nChallenging if you want it to be: in New Game+ (unlocked after normal playthrough) things are pushed a bit towards realism: you can't see behind yourself, you can't visibly determine sound's detection range. Nothing forces you to try it though, there's not much to miss without it.\n\nNot without its drawbacks: since it's stealth, it's often dark in there. And some really crucial elements are sometimes difficult to detect. And controls are clunky when it comes to precision moves (even "focus" doesn't help much with that). When it doesn't though, they are great: responsive and mostly express your intentions fast.","September 26, 2014","true","44.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Best game in this class in my mind. I have played many stealth games, and this is my favorite. Well, thief is up there too, but that is a different kind of game of course, not being a platformer.\n\nThe game runs better with a controller, but I have also tried with mouse and keyboard and there were no real problems. The controls are good in either case. You feel powerful and in control over your character; it is in fact one of the stregths of the game.\n\nOne of the many great things about this game is that you have many options on completing the levels, especially as you unlock new equipment and "character" (sort of).

The gameplay mechanics are original and intuitive.  The story seemed bland and unoriginal at first but I was pleasantly surprised at how it turned around near the middle and evolved into a moral dilemma for which either side could be argued.\n\nThe game is a good length too; I was able to beat the main story in about 9 hours.  There's a great amount of replayability thanks to each level's goals, the extra unlockables, and the more difficult story mode replay which is unlocked after beating the main story.

To the game's credit the story is more complex than it makes out to be, which leaves the player thinking about their decisions by end of the game. The music does a great job at giving the sense of tension in stealth games.\n\nThe gameplay is trully where this game shines. As a ninja you have a vast amount of gadgets available to deal with gaurds such as spike traps, bug swarm, smoke bomb etc. The levels are quite large, generally offering more than one route to reach an objective. Frontal assaults are inefficient at taking out gaurds as it takes alot of hits to knock them down for kill, whille you can die in a few shots. Unlike other stealth games, you can easily see whether your out of site due the the character model changing from coloured (visible) to black (invisible),which means that deaths are hardly the game's fault but rather the player's. There are also alot of places to hide in including rooms, garbage bins and ventilation shafts. The open ended levels and the variety of gadgets allow the player to play their own way (you can even win some levels without killing anyone if your good).\n\nMark of the Ninja is an excellent game for players who love stealth games with some platforming involved.","November 15, 2014","true","21.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Spoilers, obviously.\n\nWhen I started playing this game, my approach was to "ghost" through the levels. "Ghosting" refers to passing through the level undetected without harming anyone, as though you were never there to begin with. I reasoned that, because my character was at risk of going mad, this path of restraint would be a logical choice for them.\n\nThen I got to a point where it was quite clear I would be unable to progress without one of two things happening: killing a guard, or being detected. Maybe once I beat the game and had more tools available I could come back and ghost the level, but with my current inventory it wasn't happening. So I killed them. I reasoned that, because killing undetected was worth far more points than not killing after being detected, this is how I was intended to play the game.\n\nSo I killed only when necessary to avoid detection. Then I killed when doing otherwise would have been inconvenient. Then I killed when I felt like it. Eventually, and before I knew it, I was backtracking across the map to hunt down a single enemy that had escaped my wrath.\n\nKilling was no longer part of the game. Killing WAS the game. Each kill was an exercise in self-expression and creativity. Whatever the risk was for impending madness, I didn't care. I was having way too much fun.\n\nThen I reached the end of the game, and it was pointed out to me that I had indeed gone mad, that I was hallucinating, and that it was my duty to end my life. Now, whatever amount of killing I may have done, after terrorizing a enemy to shoot another enemy with their assault rifle, it seemed MORE likely that they had at least HELD an assault rifle than that I was merely imagining them doing so. Hallucinations don't inflict real bullet wounds on other hallucinations. What's more, whatever my disposition might have been, these people had still killed a friend of mine, and they had been trying to kill me.\n\nSo I said, screw that. At the very least, you buggers will die first.\n\nAnd then the credits rolled, and the epilogue was revealed.\n\nThey were right. I HAD become a monster. And now I had unleashed myself on the world. I was unseeable, I was untouchable, and I was unstoppable. I was a terror, I had been given the chance to end my life, and I didn't. And now there was no stopping me.\n\nThat this was so perfectly conveyed through my gameplay experience is a greater compliment to the developers than any words can describe.","January 31, 2015","true","19.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It spoke a lot and I am reviewing it after playing it for quite a while. Nowadays, Platformers are the most approachable genres for developers, the way I see it and it is hard to tell which is more innovative and it is harder for the developers to innovate because there are so many ideas out there already. Mark of the ninja broke that boundary and provided us with a simple concept and great writing. The story was engaging to say the least and I cant imagine someone nowadays missing out on it. Get it and you will have a great time.","February 18, 2015","true","25.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DejaBleu/recommended/214560/","DejaBleu","Wonderful Ruby Fruit Jungle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DejaBleu/","339 products in account","Easily one of the best Stealth games out there. Mark of the Ninja is one of the best games to come out in 2012. As a stealth game it's really well done, the idea that you're a ninja and not a samurai is a brilliant emphasis on the play style this game presents. As a Ninja your mission is to avenge your clan and take out the bad guys. Pretty simple in the story department. Gameplay is 2D and all the information you need to know is there, how much sound you make is given off by rings broadcasted from the last position you made noise, if enemies are with the radius of these rings then they'll investigate. The greatest thing is enemies suffer from fear, as you do horrible things to the unlucky schmucks they'll start panicking and this can go either way as they shoot their buddies or hit you in the process. Combat is pretty non-existent in this game. You can stun enemies, but you'll most likely be out-numbered and killed in that pursuit. Instead your attacks come in the form of gadgets, like traps. As long as an enemy cannot see you, you can kill in up-close stealth take-down form! The last point I want to make is masks. Masks alter the game in subtle ways that change how you approach sandboxes for example there is a mask that lets you take more Offensive gadgets or there is a mask that makes your enemies panic if they see corpses of their buddies anywhere (not just hanging from lamp-posts). The masks are all unlockable and this ties in with the game's replayability. The game is already highly replayable but the masks add different flavours of fun, and that's something the game is, amazing fun!","July 18, 2013","true","18.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Either stealth or bloodbath/terror.\nTerrorizing  guards is one of the most intresting elements in this game. Sometimes its enough killing one guard, and hang the body in the ceeling. Making several other guards go nuts and start fire wild in random directions. Also killing other guards.\nThe DLC is an intresting twist that also unlocks some more equipment for the main stoy. Its not that expensive and also get my thumb up. I recommend that if you have managed to clear the 5 first levels, buy the DLC for some more equipment. Some of it is quite helpful at that stage.","January 6, 2015","true","27.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wormerine/recommended/214560/","Wormerine","Wormerine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wormerine/","269 products in account",""The best stealth game ever made?"\n\nNot sure about that. I would still give this title to Thief 2. That said, Klei seems to have a talent of creating brilliant games no matter what genre they reach for and MoN is no different.\n\nGreat artstyle mixing western-style animation and Japanese themes. This 2d stealth game allowing for variety of approaches. You want to sneak? You can. You want to murder everyone in the room? You can. You want to murder one guard and hung him high to terrify other guards, who the fall to their deaths, or shoot other guards. You can.\nWhile levels aren't complex as in earlier mentioned original Thief games or Hitman: Blood Money, they are designed well enough to allow for different paths and encourage exploration. Add to that really solid game mechanics which allow you to make your own path if you feel like it, by distracting enemies or taking out guards in ways not specifficaly designed by creators.\n\nThe UI makes sure that whatever you do you know hom much noise you make and who and how can hear you.  Thanks to this you always know how much noise you make and can plan your moves accordingly.\n\nAnything bad? The writing could be better. While the story is pretty solid and the little "Haiku scrolls" you find in every level are brilliant, I am not a big fan of the dialogue in the game. It is just too dry and character-less.\n\nStill, a must buy for anyone even remotely interested in stealth games.","October 23, 2014","true","13.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
