Master using the machines and the money available will INCREASE a lot, helping you out on the economy side of the game. There is a nice bunch of tools and machines - from chainsaws to harvesters, cranes, trucks or tractors - at your disposal, you tend to orders and try to max your skills within different areas of the gameplay.\n\nThe world where you play cicles day and night, which end to be two total different styles of play in my opinion. Concerning the graphic design of the game, I found the HUD very easy to understand and use.

I particularly like to try mastering the machines as soon as possible because it will help a lot on winning more revenue from all actions. The main purpose will be to expand your company, and to do so you will need to sell a lot of woosd logs and other related products.\n\nForestry 17 is a great title, aware of any other forestry simulator out there.

But in all fairness, I've played this game a short bit and it was at least "OK". It ain't exactly epic and there are things I would add to it, but I did find it entertaining so far and intend to go back and play it some more. Considering Steam's new refund policy, if you think you might like it, it might be worth a try because you can always get your money back. A lot depends on what you think you expect the game to be... It's pretty basic and uncomplicated. At least I haven't found any glaring bugs or anything like that yet.\n\nI'd describe the game as a basic simulation in which you start off with a horse (with single log trailer) and a chainsaw. It seems like you can pretty much fall any tree in sight of the town you start in, saw it into 4 sections, then haul each section (one-by-one) back to the lumber mill for money. There's a light RPG element as you gain experience/level for selling logs, for which you get a point to allocate toward a skill (higher selling prices for logs, cheaper equipment prices, etc.).\n\nI've only gotten so far in the game as of this review, but after level 3, you can buy a garage (which opens up the ability to buy tractors and other logging equipment... Couldn't afford them yet myself). A level 6 you can buy an office to accept contracts and so on. In higher levels, it appears (I haven't got that far yet) that you can hire employees, possibly buy the lumber mill, make stuff to sell there, etc.\n\nAnyway, I think this game may suit some, but not others. For me, I give it a tentative thumbs up, subject to change. I know buying again from this company is scary, I almost didn't do it either. But so far, even though there's things I think they could/should add, I do like it better than anything else I've bought from them. And I haven't seen much about the game itself except people angry at the company for past burns (rightfully so). So, I thought I'd try to post something informative to help those on the fence. Good luck with your choice.","March 27","true","5.8"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","10","22","2","0"

They could cut down the vehicle's price a bit would help tho. But this games more vehicles, but other than that and very minor bugs the word itself is pretty realistic.","May 28","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was a good click-then-achievement type game, especially where people are interested in linear goals and clear-cut objectives. I liked the wavy grass! The physics could be quite entertaining in the game. I count this as a pro because it provided some comic relief. Who knows where the tree's going next?!?! NO ONE!\n\nCons: The lighting at night was pitch black, which most games there's SOME lighting so you can make sure you're not walking into walls and stuff...I'd recommend a bit more ambient lighting. The controls could use a little work. My poor horse got stuck going in circles a lot. :( Poor horsie. I think if the vehicles didn't get stuck in a perpetual circle motion occassionally the controls would be just fine.","June 2","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
