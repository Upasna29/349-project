I miss a lot of small indie games because i play everything streaming and don't want to have to mess around manually installing stuff from itch.io on all my devices. I really hope more indie developers put their jam games on Steam, because there is some great stuff out there. Like this one. It's a graphic adventure game with a handful of straightforward puzzles, a somewhat silly storyline, cool art and some fun dialog. Definitely worth giving a quick playthrough, especially for the low, low price of nothing.","October 17, 2015","true","0.8"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","0"

In fact the game itself functions as an interactive critique that shows you what the devs themselves had to say on the matter and ends up being an interesting piece of social commentary on the issues plaguing the gaming scene. The fact that so does it in a funny, light-hearted way makes it even better imho.\n\nThe game is free and I recommend you to try it and see if it clicks with you: perhaps it'll make you laugh, or think, or both but I find it hard to be left unfazed by it. And if you've enjoyed what the devs did you can buy the day-one useless DLC (another critique by itself) as a way to support them for what they did while supporting the business practices that the game criticizes...isn't it nice?","October 13, 2015","true","0.6"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

The music is pretty good as well, and overall I would recommend The Secret of Tremendous Corporation to anyone who is a fan of free point and click adventure games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/recommended/380140/","JacquesLeSauve","JacquesLeSauve","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/","591 products in account","I think it's important to set your expectations to an appropriate level before going into some things. Knowing that a game has spent years in development with hundreds of man hours and (insert applicable currency and exaggerated value here) pumped into it, it's pretty fair to expect great things. Going into a game that was made by a couple of guys over 48 hours as a project for a game jam and is then offered for free... you probably know you won't need to be calling in sick to take the day off work to play it.\n\nThe Secret of Tremendous Corporation is a short point and click game about the game industry, a satire of sorts about both the creators and players. A new intern starts his first day at a large, successful game developer that has become so powerful that they've muscled all other developers, big and small, out of the business and are now literally the only game in town. But you don't make it to the top without making a few enemies, and a rebel group of indie devs have kidnapped their workforce to learn their secret and end their reign. This is where you come in, to snoop around the offices and see if you can find answers, and maybe even end their tyranny once and for all.\n\nThere's two main factors to this title really, one is as an actual game and how it plays, and the other is as a social commentery on the industry. As a game it's pretty decent without being staggering - the artwork has its own unique vibe that brings a certain charm with it, and the handful of puzzles aren't too bad, if not a tad trying at times given how directionless they can be. But as a commentery? Mmmhhhnnnggg... it's maybe not quite as on the mark? It feels like it perhaps makes too many jabs but with too few real points actually being made about their target. Or maybe that is sort of the point? I dunno, unless I misinterpreted the message, I get the sense that the moral of the story and its hyperbole is it's silly to get really worked up over stupid, small stuff and we should all stop for a minute and try to take stock, that a more reasonable sense of proportion and balanced perspective would serve us better. But maybe that's just me reading too much into it what feel like rather broad, and maybe even somewhat conflicting statements both against and in favour of certain issues.\n\nBut, even though I didnt buy it, I do really like the game's DLC. It's literally just a cra*ppy little hat. Not a fancy one with special powers or incredible animations or bonus XP or the like, just... a hat... the kind you wear on your head. That's it. Now, I can already imagine a bunch of people will be crying fowl about this, saying what a rip-off it is to give us a whole game for free, but a single, small, useless item for several of your monies (2 euros, in my case), but for me, it's probably the most genius aspect of this whole thing. Firstly, it's arguably the most biting of points it could have made about the industry, to have this be a day-one release and charge so much for it, but I also like that it provides an avenue for people to support the developers should they choose to. Whilst technically a transaction, I think it should be viewed more as a donation... with a free hat as thanks. The choice is at least there if you want it and I wouldn't be against other indie devs having fun with stuff like this for other free titles. As long as something isn't cynical or sleazy I think gamers will generally be OK with it as an option they can freely make for themselves.\n\nSo, as I seem to say with many games like this, it's short, it's free, and even if it isn't a landmark event in gaming, it's at least not bad. If you have an hour to spare and this sounds like your kind of thing, or even if you're merely curious about it, there's no harm in giving it a shot then moving on with your life.","October 12, 2015","true","0.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","8","10","2","0"

Then again, it is nothing more than a short spoof that ridicules two sides of the same coin in the video game industry. On one side, we have the world’s only AAA game corporation that creates its titles on a literal conveyor belt. On the other side, the zealous indie game fans who believe that because an independent person made it, it must be better than anything. And we have a freshman intern as a protagonist, standing in the middle, not really knowing what the heck is even going on.\n\nThe puzzles follow the typical indie game adventure format, as in click on everything, use everything with everything, and talk with everyone all the time to find that obscure, insane clue or item you need. Still, with four locations in total, getting stuck is hardly an issue.\nSo, if you like adventure games or just want a quick parody on the gaming industry, this freebie could entertain you for a little while.","May 22","true","0.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The game goes to show how with simple strides forward in the feild of computer science we can conquer the problems of lackluster sequels and unoriginal ideas. The world depicted shows the gamers utopia where games are pumped out on a production line to keep every gamer trapped in there own escape from reality where they can live happy and not worry about the horrors that occur outside the world. Almost mockingly at the end of the game the developers taunt us with the dystopia we live in by explicitly pointing out the worlds problems such as global warming and poverty. The symbolism in the game rivals that of that in the lord of the flies by depicting the Receptionist as God. When we did not know the password for the first panel of SECRET we sought help from the all knowing receptionist. She saw our need for guidance and answered. Praise The Receptionist. Although it was not shown in the game it was heavily implied she also placed the potato in the cell.","October 18, 2015","true","0.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","8","11","4","1"

The Secret of Tremendous Corporation is one such game. Full of humour and simple yet charming graphics, you can finish the game in under one hour, yet the memory will remain with you long afterwards.\n\nDue to the simplicity of this game, it is difficult to accurately rate such details as graphics or sounds in comparison to modern trends in eye candy. Thus I will simply point out that what music there is has been well done, and the sketchy appearance has a lovely charm to it that is far more fitting than if the developer had gone all-out with cutting-edge 3D CGI.\n\nThe game itself requires some thought and creativity to complete, and while the puzzles aren't always the most logical, rookie game developer Max Burton is quick to comment when creativity is required. In fact, the entire point of the game is to help Max overcome a series of totally nonsensical events on his first day at Tremendous Corp.\n\nHonestly, this is one of those games you just have to play, and why not? It's free! Classic gamers will love this faithful addition to a once prevalent genre. Younger gamer will enjoy the pop culture references and witty dialogue. And every gamer will appreciate the way in which Tremendous Corp represents so many gaming companies these days with their goal of creating only low-quality pay-to-win content.\n\nBut why are you still reading this when you could be saving the world from yet another terrible freemium release? Go uncover the SECRET and enjoy a free game that leaves you wondering why you spend so much money on games which don't hold a candle to this one.
