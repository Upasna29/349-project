In SPACE, no less!  Then it occurred to me that unless I also incorporated words like "spoopy" and "pants" into my review, I'd get no end of thumbings-down for my lazy efforts.  So...sigh...in the interests of full disclosure and being found "helpful" and blah-blah-blah, let me describe to you my "experience" of Project Pulsation thus far.  (Well, hopefully FOREVER.)\n\nREALLY nifty opening cut-scene.  One of those classic, slow-moving tracking shots along the outside hull of a vast spaceship, a la so many quality, big-budget sci-fi movies which you've no doubt seen.  With a suitably eerie, machinery-in-deep-space style rumble to accompany said visuals.  Things then start to go a TINY bit awry once we get past the credits - I mean, how could they possibly ♥♥♥♥ up writing their OWN NAME? - and into on-screen captions such as "inside the hidden artefact, his and you have to find"...and then, BAM!  We're straight into the game (i.e. abruptly, without the above highly enigmatic statement even reaching its no doubt eye-widening conclusion).\n\nSo the first level is "Elevator", apparently.  Hmmm, that's an interesting concept for a first level.  Oh, I see...in almost total darkness, with a not-very-helpful flashlight to help us to see, we're going to travel down an elevator shaft via a mixture of moving elevators, jumps across to other elevators, and...wait for it...free-falling huge distances which don't seem to kill you (or even make the vaguest semblance of a sound) when you strike a hard surface tens of metres below.  Which one would take to mean that you are invincible for the rest of the game.  A "rest of the game" which I, regretfully, am perhaps destined to never see, mostly due to this game being AN UNFORGIVEABLE, STEAMING PILE OF ALIEN DOO-DOO.\n\nOh, speaking of which, did I mention the strange red "monsters" crawling about on the walls of the elevator shaft?  The first one seemed so preoccupied with crawling in one spot, and subsequently never getting anywhere, that he just allowed me to shoot him to death with my laser-pistol multiple times before he simply, er, disappeared (not even sure the word "dissipated" covers it) in a highly unsatisfying and decidedly un-gruesome manner.  There were many more such monsters, as I travelled further down.  They all died with a similar lack of spectacle, and no attempt, that I could see, to ever "attack" yours truly.  As for myself, well, I think I "died" when I finally took a HUMUNGOUS fall of perhaps a half-mile and maybe - just maybe, I really can't confirm - striking what may (?) have been the very bottom of the elevator shaft?!  Again, I'm not sure, it may have just been the game crashing...'cause after this highly eventful occurrence, I couldn't move, or exit to a menu screen or anything.  So I was forced to restart my whole computer, which is always a benchmark of the highest quality in a video game, I'm sure you'll agree.\n\nOh, and just in passing, did I mention that you can't remap the controls, and I saw no visible sign that any of my attempts to change the graphics quality actually made a lick of difference?  Do you need any further convincing?!  Sigh...then just waste five of your own bucks and find out for yourselves...\n\nVerdict: 0.5/10.","December 15, 2015","false","0.7"," 66 of 76 people (87%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","87","66","76","13","0"

But others will die sooner, it is almost like the laser sight is terribly inaccurate.\n\nIt seems impossible to beat the elevator level to me.  I tied and tried and it doesn't even make sense.  You just die.\n\nLet's say you put all 100 bullets into one enemy.  Go back to the main menu, start a new fresh game.  You still won't have any bullets.  They don't reset.  It's that bad.  Also, you can shoot your gun after you are dead.  And you can shoot your gun in the main menu as well.\n\nThere are no reloading animations, although there is a sound when the gun fires, it doesn't even make a click noise when you run out.  The enemy animations and models are really poor.  The graphics provided by the Unreal 4 engine look amazing with all these blindingly bright flashes of light but it doesn't help the game.\n\nAVOID.  It's not even a game.  You will regret your time spent playing.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPhZZtE_mhg","January 28","false","7.4"," 32 of 41 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","32","41","2","0"

I get it, it's a game made by one man, but instead of doing things he doesn't know jack about, maybe he should've delegate.\n\nThe sound design of this game, or the lack of it makes you feel crippled all the time and leaves you constantly questioning your hardware. Even worse — it gives you no audial feedback whatsoever. You somehow supposed to stomach the fact, that you make no sounds, apart from reloading. What is it? A feature? No one can hear your scream in space? Yeah right, lazy sound design more like it.\n\nThe level design is absolutely terrible, I had no a slightest clue which of the locations I've visited and which are new. And don't get me started on crouching in this game or UI for that matter.\n\nThis thing should be free as any proof of concept. Though I fail to grasp what concept this one was supposed to proof because it proved none I feel appropriate to mention.\n\nGranted, I played only 9 minutes, but I fail to see how it could get better from such a start. So if you like me was after something like System Shock or say Dead Effect, forget about it. This thing is more along the lines of EYE or whatever that convoluted thing was called, but worse on any level.\n\nBuy Dead Effect instead, which deserves extra attention even if it looks ugly (the main reason why I gave this one a shot).","May 21","false","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Sort of early 8-bit era kind of storytelling where you don't really understand what's going on from time to time, but as a whole it makes a mesmerising picture. The graphics are pretty cool (haven't played too many games on U4 yet, but this one looks really nice). The ambient sounds are great imo, help to build the pressure a lot. But yeah, the not so great part is that the game lacks technical polish. The main menu looks like a dev version and sometimes during the game you don't understand what's happening at all, which can add to the atmosphere a bit, seeing this is a horror game and all, but for modern games you have to have more clarity in terms of gameplay mechanics. Overall I think it's a pretty interesting game for its price, but I really hope author will address some of the technical issues it has.","December 16, 2015","true","1.0"," 8 of 47 people (17%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","17","8","47","2","0"
