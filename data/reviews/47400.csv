After watching the DEV-team videos and listening to what they were "promising" I decided to pre-order it (pre-ordered it the day before it came out).\n\nFast Forward a day and stronghold 3 was released. The features that I had purchased this game for were missing from the in-game menu and when I got out to check the store page they had removed at least half of the bullet points for what this game was promising. Fraud?\n\nThe game itself is riddled with issues; path-finding, graphical mishaps, and the beloved soldiers mixed with wall syndrome.  The skirmish is no longer a skirmish of any sort but a rather boring and pointless sandbox free-build mode where you build a glitched-out castle on one of 7 tiny maps.\n\nThe campaign itself is TERRIBLE. The cutscenes are storyboards, which they try to play off as art (something only BL2 was able to pull off without it seeming like the game was rushed and released without polish).\n\nDont buy this game. Dont buy any games from the criminals at Firefly, i wouldnt purchase this game for $0.50 and it was the last game I have or will ever pre-order. It's worth noting that after reading reviews of their newest "game" it appears that much of the same happened yet again. They simply cash in on a halfway decent game that was made 20 years ago without putting forth much effort to change or enhance anything. Terrible company, terrible games, and terrible ethics.","October 2, 2014","false","4.6"," 802 of 845 people (95%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","95","802","845","37","16"

If this were Japan, the staff of Firefly would be honor bound to commit Hari-Kari.\n\nLike so many others I have been with the Stronghold Series from the start; absolutely one of my favorites until...Stronghold 3. It was more than a slap in the face to fans of the series. It was an insult to the entire gaming community.\n\nIt was months late from its expected arrival. Each delay accompanied by an assurance they were refining the game. What they were doing was hurriedly hacking together a cheap revised version of SH2. Even though the "frankenstein" they had created still lacked life, they released it upon the world, in time for the Christmas market.\n\nThanks to trusting fans and unwary buyers the game went gold immediately. The scheme had worked perfectly. They dangled it front of us with a lot of hype [lies], made a fortune in initial sales, delivered a bonified POC, figuring to patch the monster together in the following months. And then failed to deliver on that as well.\n\nHere's an example of the refinements they were making. I call it, Mission: Impossible\nOne of the first missions is to defend the town from wolf attacks. I built 2 wooden towers with ladder access, put archers in them to intercept the wolves and reduce their numbers as they approached the town. The wolves came, climbed the ladders into the towers and killed my archers. Any playtesting at all could not miss this.\n\nIf releasing this abomination upon a trusting fan base wasn't despicable enough; consider how they treated the foreign markets. The Chinese were sold a retail copy that could not be converted to a Steam account. That meant they had no access to any patches except if a kind soul posted a cracked version somewhere. Let me say it again. They sold the Chinese unplayable versions of the game with no support. Anything for a buck.\n\nI don't care what excuse they give for their actions. They cheated me. They cheated the world. And there's been no retribution for the crime. Firefly is dead to me. I don't look at anything that has their logo on it. There's plenty of new, respectable talent and castle building games are coming on all the time.\nFirefly should stick to games about organized crime anyway. That's where their true talent lies.","May 7, 2015","false","23.3"," 655 of 685 people (96%) found this review helpful 174 people found this review funny","96","655","685","174","0"

You could not place certain (crucial) structures like steps .. which would allow you to mount archers on the walls.  Archers did not return fire as mace-men approached your walls.  It was a ridiculous and frustrating mess.  Only positive I can say is I liked some of the gritty art style.\n\nA few months later:  it seemed like the developer was as disappointed as most consumers .. there was apparently some advices saying they blamed the publisher who pushed for an early release, and that they would endeavour to give consumers the game that they deserve through patching and constant and consistent after-sale improvements.  (Apparently the game we deserve is 'poo poo' because even with them working through the list of problems, the game, although playable in some ways, was still deeply flawed.  Archers still wouldnt retaliate, still had issues placing simple things like stairs up to walls).\n\nAbout a year after launch:  I decide to give the game one last try.  (Loved earlier Stronghold titles and the concept in general).  They made some improvements to the game .. archers could fire back .. structures could be placed .. overall the game became somewhat playable .. BUT .. even after all that work they really barely achieve 'passable' .. archers may retaliate, but there's no mechanic for wall cover, and they get no elevation bonus to range or accuracy .. so basically 20 archers attacking a wall v 20 archers on a wall .. probably the attackers would win because they are clustered into one big kill-group, firing all their arrows together accurately, while the wall guys are scattered about and some would be out of range to attack... but yeah, basically the ones on the wall get no benefit).  Also you'll place units on a wall and they will become un-movable.  Just plain stuck.\n\nSo basically, despite a good legacy and concept, the game sucks.","January 26, 2015","false","74.2"," 291 of 304 people (96%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","96","291","304","12","0"

It doesn't live up to the Stronghold series. Don't even buy it on a sale even if its $7.49. Go buy a small game with 8 dollars, you can probably find something with more playability. Go ahead and buy those cheap DLCs or cosmetics you've been wanting for your other games. Go ahead... its much better to buy cosmetic DLCs or small packs then it is to buy this game.CategoryRatingGraphics8/10 The games graphics are probably the best in the Stronghold series, but there are problems stated about this belowModes2/10 The lack of modes is terrible, there is no more skirmishes, there is a great lack of siege battles (and those siege battles are pathetic). There is no built in editor either.Campaign1/10 The campaign is terrible! I haven't even got through the first mission it was SO poor!Building placement3/10 This is a true horror. They added a nice new way to rotate buildings, but the downside is, it takes longer to place buildings now! But whats worse is the spaceing! You can't place buildings closer than 6 feet now! Buildings are so spaced, but the maps (which I won't do a category on) are also terrible! You can only place buildings on 1/4 of the map, because of the elevation, and the strict limits! You have to be careful of where you place, and you can only place so few buildings because of the stupid placement system.Bugs and crashes4/10 I myself haven't saw much bugs (but I have heard of a lot) But crashes, theres a lot of that too. Not even 2 hours, and I already had a crash. The first Stronghold is more stable with crashes, even though I have Windows 8 and no compability mode on!How it runs2/10 LAG LAG LAG and low FPS. I really don't know if its my computer or the game, but it has a low FPS. Other people have stated there was lag though. But it is bad... I can run 800 people with a small castle on the map in Stronghold 2 on high graphics, here I can't run 100 people on the map with even medium graphics. Avoid.ExtraOnce, a Youtuber named DiplexHeated said,"The buildings are terrible.

Geeze, it was like... two years ago now I played (and beat) it?\n\nPersonally, I don't care about the bugs, of which there really arn't THAT many compared to earlier Stronghold titles. The game worked okay for me and I got through the campaign without any real serious issue.\n\nNo, where I got upset, where I feel the devs truly betrayed everything that Stronghold stood for, was thinking I was no longer smart enough to build my own castles. That's right, its Stronghold, a castle building sim, in which you don't build castles. On every single player map the castle is already built for you. Oh sure, you can build a wall between two incredibly obvious cliffs to seal off a supposed weak point, but I wanted to build frickin' castles. The first game let you build castles. The first game said "Here's some land. There's a quarry. Choose where to place your stockpile ANYWHERE on the map and, oh, by the way, you're getting attacked in about ten minutes." That's what made Stronghold, Stronghold for me. Sure, they still gave you some castles in Stronghold 1, but they usually destroyed them in the first assault and made you rebuild them, often having to scrap some of the infastructure so you could pull your defenses back to a more practical postion. Stronghold 2 backed off of that, but still allowed for it, and on the missions you were given a castle to start, they were often little more than a ring wall and a single scout tower just to get you through the first attack. Stronghold 3... gives you a full castle on most maps, doesn't want to let you decide where to place defenses (and fights you tooth and nail when you try), and on the rare occasion you don't start with a fully loaded bastion, the places they want you to build are painfully obvious. In short, they've made what once was a good castle building sim into a below average Midieval RTS. For shame.\n\nThrowing salt on the wound is the way they handled the story. The original Stronghold's story was pretty good, and the characters were humorous, colorful, and fun to listen to. Yah, they had dialouge in the first game. Good dialogue. In the first game you were supposed to be afraid of The Wolf. You would panic when he attacked your early castles, and the final two missions against him featured huge battles that saw nearly complete destruction of the castles involved.  Comparitively, the Wolf of Stronghold 3 is a has been that should have stayed gone. Unfortunately this reflects on the protagonist as well who, while a capable military leader in the first game, might as well be a court jester in the third. Even the last few battles, where you go up against the Wolf himself, are so toned down it might as well be a sprawling bar fight. In the end, I was actually happy the game ended the way it did, they both deserved it.\n\nTLDR: If you've never played Stronghold, get the first game. It's infinitely better than this turd, and you actually get to build castles.","February 16","false","45.5"," 209 of 224 people (93%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","93","209","224","13","3"

I have gotten hours of enjoyment out of it, but that was only because I am a die-hard stronghold fan. Anything less will find no enjoyment in this game, only the frustration of trying to get not everything, but ANYthing at all to work the way you want it to. There are only 2 solid points to this game - the graphics and the gridless building system, both of which are the best in the series as of the time of this review. The military units don't behave properly and have minimal AI on their own...there IS no AI for enemy opponents whatsoever, meaning more often than not they sit there doing ♥♥♥♥all until you go to them instead, there are massive game-breaking glitches with the physics and pathfinding, and the multiplayer servers are so god awful that they had to slap a 150 troop limit and 125 building limit (INCLUDING TOWERS AND GATEHOUSES) into the multiplayer to make it barebones functional and you can still expect massive lag left and right - not computer lag, but network lag where the whole game will slow to a crawl.\n\nWant the bonuses of a 3D stronghold game that doesn't suck and has functional multiplayer? Go get crusader 2.\n\nOtherwise just get ANY game in the series besides this one. This is the ONLY game in the entire series that I would not recommend, as it is the only one that provides more frustration than it does fun - the next worst in the series falls to Stronghold Legends, which is not nearly as bad as this and is easily playable and enjoyable.","November 22, 2014","false","21.2"," 170 of 184 people (92%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","92","170","184","10","0"

The frustration is painful and not worth it.-\n\nI have always been a Stronghold fan and wouldn't hesitate to recommend Stronghold, Stronghold 2, Stronghold Crusader or even Stronghold Legends to any of my friends. So of course I was biding my time until the game finally released and squandered $60 on it. I'd equate the anticipation level of buying it and actual gameplay akin to Duke Nukem Forever.\n\nWhile there certainly are positives: the game is gorgeous when rendered and boasts a lot of new content. The basics that make the game flow and playable are the worst in the series. As much as I would like to rant as to how Firefly could botch a release so badly after having released a prior version, Stronghold Crusader Extreme, wherein the player could field an army of up to 10,000 troops and limitless buildings, I have no idea.\n\nThe number 1 issue that ruined the game for me was the slow replenishment of the player's campfire (distributable population) mixed with the prioritzation of industry over military. For instance if an opposing army kills the workers of any industry buildings beyond your walls, or even wolves for that matter, you will not be able to build any troops until the workers are replenished in the order that they were killed. Unfortunately that is just one glitch of many that should have been cleaned up during simple game testing.\n\nWhoever was in charge of cleaning up this game ought to have used Lemon Pledge.","August 29, 2014","false","6.3"," 201 of 225 people (89%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","89","201","225","9","1"

Apparently all they learnt from it was how to make a crappier game then their previous titles.\n\nStonghold 2 is not generally considered the favourite in the series, but comparing 3 to 2... 2 wins. 3 has absolutely no redeeming gameplay features. Visually it looks better (excepting personal taste) but even the lauded features like wall destruction physics which are nice to look at in actual fact make the gameplay much worse. I have never before played a game where the walls are hands down the worst place to position your archers... They will recieve no extended range, no cover, and are more vulnurable as they will fall to their death when the enemies weakest units chips down your stone walls in seconds with their daggers. Pretty much the opposite of a castle "sim".\n\nThe ecconomic sim is also suffered. Smaller maps and bigger building footprints means you can't construct a small castle town let alone a complex one. Clunkier interface, less building options, dumber AI (how do you even achieve that?) and all around less content makes this a step backwards from the series previous installments in pretty much ever single way except graphics rendering.\n\nIf I could get my money back I would because I don't think I have ever been more disapointed in a studio... This is the game that was the straw that broke the camels back as far as my personal policy on preordering games goes.

Now I can safely say: Don't buy this hunk of junk. Instead, go watch the 'Heroes' or 'Breaking Bad' series, potentially 'The Mentalist' and 'Supernatural' along with 'The Vikings' as well. It's FAR more worth your money and time (to clarify, as they are amazing series).\n\nSadly, the Stronghold series has had a special place in my heart since day 1. I LOVED the first, the second just as much and Stronghold: Legends was one of my all time favourites for RTS (I know a lot didn't like the fantasy mix, but I enjoyed the slightly difference for once, of course the original was there should I get bored).\n\nThen they announced SH3: My life was almost complete.\n\nThey released SH3: My life WAS complete.\n\nI played SH3: My life was thrown into a well with a giant slab of steel tied around my ankles...\n\nThis game takes nothing from the previous ones that made them so good (other than the storyline, which personally was a little cheap as it's basically the same damn missions). The missions maps are horrific and restricting, the combat is god awful and nothing like the orginals when it comes to army management and the list goes on and on. I'm sure you can read other reviews and here the same story.\n\nGo look at Anno 2245, out soon and I CANNOT wait. I know it's SciFi and not medieval, but Anno 2070 was one of my favourites and I highly recommend that to any RTS fan. As for a modern 'SH3' but a good one: Sorry I don't know any at all for you.

I was looking forward to this because I am a big fan of the Stronghold franchise, and when I was led to believe that Firefly was finally going back to their roots and cutting the gimmicks, the reviews for this game begin to reel out and that was where my disappointment begun to happen. It's just so horribly put together compared to older Stronghold titles to the point where any longtime Stronghold fan would find it absolutely cringeworthy. There's also this issue where if you redirect a unit's goal location, they pause for a brief moment before continuing to the newly-directed location, no other Stronghold game does this and it's absolutely infuriating.\n\nIt's a lot better now than it was at release, though. They managed to patch up a lot of problems, but the damage has already been done. It's been said that this game's bad release is due to Firefly Studios being forced to release before it was finished by their publisher.\n\nIf you're new to the Stronghold franchise you'll probably find more enjoyment in this than I, otherwise just buy Stronghold Crusader HD on Steam, you'll get a much better experience.","November 27, 2013","false","3.0"," 80 of 103 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","80","103","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/recommended/47400/","PrivateGodfrey","Captain MooMoos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/","490 products in account","It took me a long time to finally beat this game, but I am proud to say I have done it. Stronghold 3 is an interesting addition to the series. It adds incredible depth into the story and lore of Stronghold series. If anyone has played Stronghold Kingdoms many of the ideas for how that game is played come from Stronghold 3. I personally think this game is a fun game with an incredible campaign. But in all honesty there are a lot of problems and I won't hesitate to list them all out for you.\n\nMilitary Campaign:\nStronghold 3 starts off after Stronghold 1, essentially skipping what is the terrible tales of Stronghold 2. With improved voice acting and better cinematic (realizing that using in game graphics for cinematics was an awful idea - thanks Stronghold 2) Stronghold 3 creates a story which really revives the series. Set ten years in the future you play "The Boy", the main character of the original stronghold series. In this tale enemies attack the kingdom you worked so hard to restore pushing you out of the capital. You must recuperate and slowly retake your kingdom. To do this you fight off the offspring of The Rat, The Pig, and a new foe The Jackal. Throughout the story you figure out a much greater foe exists  The Wolf and he is back for vengeance.\n\nEconomic Campaign:\nIn the economic campaign you play Lady Catherine who is trying to rebuild the country, particularly the Abbey, after the war has ended. In this you must complete tests by meeting economic growth factors. The Economic Campaign shies away from military and allows you to play a game featured on running the day to day life of a castle.\n\nThe Problems:\nWhat's wrong with this game? Well there is a lot that makes this game terrible in most people’s eyes.\n1) There are lots of bugs; in fact I had to save about twenty times per map just because I didn't want to take the chance of my units getting stuck in walls or random places. On a few maps you only get a couple units and if one of them gets stuck it can be the difference between a victory and a defeat.\n2) The units attack one unit before spreading to attack others. This means the first time your archers attack an enemy they all fire at the same enemy. The wasted attack results in a couple second delay which allows the enemy AI, who spreads their attacks, to hit all your untis. The end result is the computer has killed a bunch of your archers.\n3) There is no Skirmish mode, they took it away again!!! I don't know why they keep doing it seeing as everybody wants it, but they do.\n4) My game crashed every time I quit the game resulting in me having to sign out of Windows and sign back in. This can be very annoying and at one point caused my save to go corrupt (hence why I started saving about 20 times per match).\n5) You can only slow the game down to Normal speed, so no longer can you use the slow speed to establish yourself.\n6) The graphics are not that great, especially seeing as how this game is a more recent edition to the series.\n7) I could not play with duel monitors; every time I would try the game would lag beyond playability. Now some would say this is my computer, but seeing as I can play essentially every other game with second monitor up and watching a TV show I don't think it is my computer.\n8) There is a building capacity; this really limits how you can play in some missions.\n\nResults:\nIf you can get past all the deficits the game offers, and instead just enjoy the game for its story then it is a blast to play. I thought the campaign was amazingly well played out, and the story had me wondering constantly what was going to happen next. The dialogue before each mission was very well done, and if you already listened to the dialogue you could simply skip it. The gameplay is much better than Stronghold 2 and the units are much cleaner. The idea of auto-market functions is incredibly useful (you can make your market sell resources if you go over a certain amount). And incorporating the statues to generate honor is incredibly helpful as you don't need to waste space on banqueting goods.\n\nI recommend Stronghold 3, but only if you can get it for a good deal. Its not easy to look past all the problems with this game and still enjoy yourself, especially if you paid full price.\n\nPros:\n+Amazing story with beautiful campaign\n+Added statues to generate honor instead of having to use banqueting goods\n+Market has auto-buy/auto-sell features\n+Trees do not disappear as quickly as in Stronghold 2.\n+Added nighttime battles. In a couple levels you must defend a castle at night, which requires you to use fire to light up areas of the map in order to see approaching enemies.\n\nCons:\n-Lots of glitches, bugs, and errors.\n-Building cap\n-Poor unit AI\n-The enemy on the campaign isn't very bright and doesn't maneuver his units very often.\n-Lowest speed is normal speed\n-No skirmish mode\n-Doesn't function with dual monitors\n-THERE ARE NO BOATS, THE STEAM PICTURE DECIEVED ME!!!!!","March 2, 2014","true","17.1"," 177 of 281 people (63%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","63","177","281","9","4"

So if you want to build a castle from basic starting goods, your forced to play the even more limited campaign missions.\n\nSomewhat positive;\nStill, I play the economic missions when I'm bored of other games.\nIf you have a LOT of time and patients to figure stuff out, and don't expect much compared to the older, better stronghold games, it might be worth a try.

And SH2 also  had some nice additions in the Castle-Sim part. But this.... I can't believe they build this up on SH2.

And if you are in any way interested in gamedesign, I highly recommend buying it for 1-2 € for educational purposes. Literally everything was done wrong in this game (compared to SH1, Crusader and SH2).\nDon't judge the developers as if there were no predecessors of this game.

They took every single system (economy/walling/troop management) and flushed it down the toilet to replace it with something a mentally handycapped, blind ape coded. (Fu for using poor animals as cheap labour, btw.)\n\nDon't be mislead by my playtime. I tried to play the game for 1-2 hours at first. The rest of the time is checking after each patch. There are things you don't have to play through to judge it reasonably. There is nothing they could hide in the campaign what would save their game.","July 29, 2015","false","3.9"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","19","22","6","0"

This is unfortunately only true if you play one of the scenarios that feature already constructed fortifications. Throughout the rest of the game you will never get to build anything more than a few haphazardly placed walls and the occasional watch tower.\n\nThe problem with Stronghold 3 is it's speed. Everything moves at a dreadfully slow pace. Gathering resources and building structures seem to take forever and most of the game seems to take place without any interaction from you, simply waiting for something to happen. The extremely tiny maps doesn't help either, making every town feel cramped.\n\nYou play as a feudal lord starting every map with your, very small, castle and some starting peasants. As you build resource gathering structures or conscript soldiers those peasants get used up and to attract more you need to provide them with adequate housing, food and not as much plague as you would like to inflict upon the lazy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n\nAs your town grows you start to get involved in the more costly resources as well as the more complicated resource chains letting you equip your army better and feed your populace more sufficiently. Along the way and depending on the scenario or campaign mission you're on you might face the additional threat of invading armies or super aggressive wolves that'll kill your poor defenseless peasants and put a stop to production until you can attract some more.\n\nThe problem with economic and city-building aspects of the game is as mentioned before, the speed. Everything happens at a snail's pace. You place your initial resource gathering buildings, got get a cup of coffee, come back and place the another resource gather. You repeat this process until you get enough of an income to start placing the more advanced resource harvesters as well as building the beginnings of an army and then you go get a cup of coffee and come back when you've got enough resources to place another advanced harvester or recruit another soldier. You spend more time waiting than actually playing the game and that is a serious design flaw.\n\nI am normally all for slow paced intelligent games but this is just ridiculous and the slow speed adds nothing to the game's depth.\n\nThe military aspects of the game is predictably simple. You harvest resources to construct weapons and then use those weapons to conscript your peasants into military service as a variety of different types of soldiers. The actual combat however pretty much boils down to box selecting your army and clicking attack on the enemy army, hoping you got the right numbers and combination of troops.\n\nGraphically there is nothing wrong with the game but not much right either. It neither adds nor detracts much from the experience. The sounds are comfortably boring although the soundtrack does feature some neat flute music that fits the genre very nicely.\n\nAll in all Stronghold suffers from two serious design flaws that takes it from being a great idea to a bad game. The slow speed makes the game boring and any sense of accomplishment you get from finally getting a proper economy working is instantly removed when a new map starts and you are thrown back to square one having to rebuild. The lack of proper fortress building however is what truly kills it for me. You will never come to a point in the game where building those mighty fortifications that is the game's trademark becomes natural. It takes far too long to get there and once you do you could probably have won the map three times over.\n\nStick to the older titles in the series or looks elsewhere, this is not a game that delivers what it promised.","December 5, 2012","false","45.6"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","3"

Glad I did.  In spite of all the hate that has been heaped on this game, it has a certain appeal.  That is, if you like town/castle building, hoarding resources, ordering peasants around, and seeing your enemies crushed and driven before you; while listening to the lamentation of their women.\n\nSoundtrack is fitting for a feudal lord, but John Barley Corn tends to play a tad too often, and the lyrics remind me of brave Sir Robin.  Graphically, the landscapes are rendered like impressionistic oil paintings, which is fitting for this genre, although not for this time period.  Also, if you've got a hankering for medieval architecture, you'll be treated to variety of historically accurate building styles; a few have given me ideas for building defenses in other games like 7 Days to Die.\n\nThe one thorn in my crown over this game is multi-player because I can never connect.  However, for the sale price the single player modes are worth it, and real feudal lords didn't have an internet for their multi-player games either.  I give it two forks up!  (Note: One of the forks is somewhat bent from jamming it in my ethernet port while trying to get multi-player to work.)","June 4, 2014","true","12.2"," 85 of 144 people (59%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","59","85","144","6","0"

Stronghold holds a very special place in gaming as it holds castle building, fighting and economics in equel amounts. While the 3D graphics are nice, they ultimatly end up hindering you when placing objects. Because these objects have such big 'footprints' it means building can become a pain when everything is forced to be spaced out. Worse yet, you can't connect walls to create interesting shapes. You basically can make squares- and that's it. The economics don't seem a lot different than titles before it and the combat which you'd assume would be improved- also seems to be the same level of strategy. It's a very chill- laid back type of RTS in that sense.

That is very sad thing, because I really liked the original stronghold games. Buy either original Stronghold or Stronghold Crusader or wait and hope that the Stronghold Crusader 2 will be better.\n\nFull review:\nThe developers of Stronghold 3 said that they attempted to return back to the roots of original Stronghold games after that Stronghold 2 and Stronghold Legends had been disappointments. Personally I don't see that much resemblance between original Stronghold games and Stronghold 3. This might not have been the problem, because this series might require refreshing instead of going back to roots. Whatever the developers tried to do, the game is a failure. This result was heavily affected by the fact that the publisher pushed the game to markets before it was ready. Now the game doesn't have any game braking bugs anymore but some annoying bugs still exist and the gameplay just isn't nearly as good as it should be.\n\nI'll start with the gameplay. The gamplay is too slow. The gameplay in the actual Stronghold games has always been slower than in the Crusader versions to place more value on the economy but in this game the gameplay is just too slow. The units are too slow and also the economy is also extremely slow. Even new citizens spawn too slowly. The result of this is that the army sizes are extremely low as well as the size of the castle.\n\nNext i'll talk more specifically about the economy. The economy in this game seems to be very difficult to manage. It seems like that no matter the player does, the player is all the time on the edge of collapse of the economy even if the enemies don't attack you castle. Even worse is how popularity is calculated. Before this game the popularity was very stable once the most basic needs of the citisens were secured. In Stronghold Crusader 3 however the popularity changes all the time because\na) the economy is all the time on the edge of collapse\nb) amount of population has drastic effect on popularity\nc) Popularity is always going up or down unlike in previous game in which it was easy to have stable popularity.\n\nThe result of both economy and popularity being at the edge of collapse is that the player uses almost all the time micromanaging these things leaving no time to build the defenses or care about the army in a game in which half of the game should be doing these two things.\n\nThird main problem in this game is the castle building. The building of walls and towers was changed dramatically for this game, but unfortunately the new system is total disaster. It is difficult to use and some of the difficulty might actually be caused by bugs. In a game, where economy is requiring your constant micromanaging and enemies attack every now and then a difficult to use waal bulding system is huge problem. The new system also prevents the creation of imaginative castles. On top of this the player is unable to create moats around his castle inexcept in the scenario builder. The developers have admitted their mistake and the building of walls and towers will be reverted to how it was before for Stronghold Crusader 2.\n\nFourth main problem is the combat. The combat is very slow and units under melee attack are very unresponsive. This makes makes usage of fast troops pointless. In previous games I preferred to have mixed army (because different units had their own strenghts), but in this game only useful troops are swordmen and crossbowmen. Exception being knights that are needed to destroy siege engines.\n\nTo summarise the gameplay part: Stronghold crusader is a game combining medieval combat, castle building and economy and it fails in all these aspects.\n\nLast thing that I would like to mention are graphics. The graphics of this game are awful. Both the soldiers and buildings are are very difficult to distinguish from each other and I also dislike the chosen artistic style. If the developers of this game can't create clear and beutiful 3D objects they should revert back to 2.5D graphics that was used in original stronhold game because that game had very beautiful and clear graphics.","November 27, 2013","false","26.9"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

This is my opinion except for the part about being pure crap.","March 17, 2015","false","39.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The graphics look to be from 2005, not 2011. The music is good. The tutorial is 3 min and basically shows you nothing of any systems or menus or hotkeys/orders of the game. Funny after all their patching and complaints of terrible unhelpful and uninformative tutorial, they didn't expand on it. The combat is shotty, as you can't attack an area, just click on one guy. Sometimes you don't auto attack enemies in the area. Clicking on places to go is finnicky and doesn't work half the time. The enemies have no health bars so you can't tell how you are doing in a fight. For some reason your guys walk super slowly anywhere you order them, as apparently people didn't know about running/jogging in the medieval times. There is no seemingly obvious way to speed time or things up to not make you have to sit there forever. Multiplayer is dead. I wasn't a fan of strategy/sim games to begin with, and this didn't help in making them more interesting. Didnt' feel like waiting around for the other terrible features that the long fans of the series have mentioned previously.

The wall building tool is very difficult to work with and will force you to build some awkward looking structures out of pure despair. The campaign story is dull and uninspired. Sound and music have been blindly copied from the previous games. The new fighting by night feature adds nothing but frustration. Overall this game gives the impression that the developers were just lazy.\n\nIn short: steer clear of this game.

So I decided to install it and play since I never got to when I had the disk version as my old computer was crap and the disk went missing. Was shocked to see there was no skirmish/kingsmaker mode. Said arlight lets jump into the military campaign. Cared nothing for the story, but dear god was the unit mechanics horrible. The enemy archers had 3 times the range of my archers. Furthermore whenever I would order my archers to attack they run up into melee range and start shooting. Melee units seem to have an extremely short agro range even with agressive stance, and they are pretty slow in this game( Even some of the light infantry such as Men-At-Arms are very slow). There are quite a bit of bugs like units standing on invisible walls after the walls are destroyed. The animations are so choppy for melee units. Altought 360 building rotation was nice, the building placement (especially for castle walls, towers, and stairs) are a pain in the ♥♥♥. Castle gates don't make sense to me in this game. Sometimes they work and open for your units, other times they close on you and won't open. To make\nmatters worst, your units can get stuck on buildings or the terrain and become immobile. Formations seem to give little\nbenifit now, For example in earlier games column formation would allow your units to move faster, but now it doesn't\nseem to do anything or is so small its unnoticable. missile units have lost alot of value as you can't even target properly\nwith them without getting them into melee range.

As is, the black and white charcoal smudges feel somewhat unfinished.\n- The leaderboard for mission scores is offline with little likelihood of being restored\n- Peasants can get stuck in buildings\n- Killing pits are all but invisible, good luck deleting them if you want to put another building in your minefield.\n- The game is prone to unpredictable crashes, sometimes when you are creating a game save.\n\nAfter experiencing first hand the problems with this game I can understand why players who bought this game full price are still seething. That said, I do recommend picking this game up on sale if you've played and enjoyed Stronghold 2 or even if only to understand why the release was such a disaster.","August 20, 2014","true","12.9"," 21 of 39 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","21","39","3","0"

The story is unimanigative, and the missions are practically copied from the first Stronghold.

I bought the game after they said that the worst bugs got fixed. Yea sure..\n\n\nNegative Points\nBugs\n- Horrible, game breaking bugs (for example troops get stuck in walls or just dont walk, killed all enemy troops and I still dont win in siege mode etc).\n- Game crashs very often.\n\nAI/Troops\n- The AI is buggy and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Sometimes my troops just ignore enemy troops even if they are in attack range, sometimes my troops ignore my commands, the AI or my own troops use the farthest way to the target even if the short way is clearly in front of them, especially in siege mode the AI act foolish.\n- The controlling of troops works bad. It is difficult to select 1 unit in your army, controlling your army just dont feel good at all. Often I cant even command my troops to a point because they just stop several meters in front or after the point (pretty bad if you want to coordinate an attack).\n\nSkirmish mode\n- No skirmish mode in this Stronghold. Seriously? This alone is reason enough to not buy the game!\n\nCampaign\n- Poorly told with black/white pictures.. I lost the interest in the story very quickly.\n- I could only finished the economic campaign because game crashed frequently..\n\nGameplay\n- The castle building sucks (that's a big problem because this is a game about BUILDING CASTLES). I dont have enough space for a big, good looking and working castle. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t!\n-The game speed is so slow, it takes sooo long to get an army and a working economy because new people come very slowly and work slowly. The troops walk slowly too, everything is just slow!\n- The building limit is 125 building and 300 troops by default. You can change it when you edit the game files but you will get major lag even if your pc is good.\n- The mechanism for placing buildings is smooth and works surprisely good - but on the other hand placing a wall is pure pain.\n\nMultiplayer\n- Couldnt finish a single game because the game always crashed.\n- Different modes are avalible but I coudlnt test them.\n- MP is dead. Suprise suprise..\n\n\n\nNeutral Points\nGraphics\n- The graphics is not good and not bad. Many people say that the graphics of Stronghold 3 is too bad bad I think it is acceptable for a Stronghold game.\n\n\n\nPositive Points\nMap editor\n- Game got a level editor. I didnt work much with it but it seems ok\n\n\n\nConclusionIf you fit in one of the following groups you should NOT buy this game:\nStronghold game series fan\nFan of castle building games\nPeople who like medieval game\nStrategy games fans\nWell, all other people shouldnt buy the game too..","December 23, 2013","false","17.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I'd finish it completly.\n\nI really waited long for this game and expected a lot of it because i'd love the second part. If you dont have much time oir just dont like to read long rewies skip this because it will get longer. Well i dont know where to start with the negative points so i start with the few good points:\n\n\nThe Graphics are really really good and i do like them also the soundtracks are great but thats it!\n\nIt shocked me with alot of unrealistic facts, beeings and a so stupid programmed unit controlling, that every crusade is a torture for the player.\nFirst, there is no ballistic trajectory. Arrows, spears (yes they can be thrown in this game but almost as far as an archer can shoot next negative point) stones from catapults etc. are just flying in a straight direction to the target. Doesent matter if there is a ground wave, bigger rock or something else in their way. They flew just through it.\nNext point: There are placable traps on your walls now like a stack of logs wich incinerate themselvs and rolling in directon of your enemys. Good idea bad performence. EVERY unit wich just touching it - dies. A person who didnt played this will now think:,, bro that are burning, rolling logs of course they die!'' Thats right but the main problem here is: They die even whenn the logs stopped moving! I saw 120 units of peasents (its a fighting unit in part three) dieing because they ran into burning logs wich stopped moving in a straight line. Lemmings would be proud of em.\nNext Point: One of the main reasons i bought this game was the Sandbox mode and skirmish against KI- Players. All i got was a big NOPE! in my face. There is none. No Sandbox neither a skirmish mode! only the campaing can be played great who didnt like this? Thats really sad because the sandbox mode was one of the best things in part two and i've been really looking forward to play it in good graphics.\n\nIf i had knew all these things before, i wouldn't bought it and thats why i dont recommend it. To save all of you who thinks this game includes the best parts of Stronghold 2 trust me: It doesent!","July 13, 2014","false","0.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

Best trade ever, the game still serves as a great time waster for me.\n\nNow about Stronghold 3... Where to start. This game advertises "free build sandbox mode" which is limited to 125 buildings. What a joke! Castle building was one of my favorite things to do in Crusader. These maps in Stronghold 3 could easily fit 400+ buildings and it is so limited. My population couldn't get much higher than 120. Stronghold 3 has 4 maps to choose from in "sandbox" mode. 4. Stronghold crusader had at least, 20 balanced and unbalanced, with the option to create your own map from a blank slate. Troops constantly don't obey my clicks in Stronghold 3 and the game feels extremely rushed. The campaigns are a joke and give maybe 2 hours of gameplay.  After that you're stuck with the option of a broken multiplayer or the extremely limited "sandbox". Crusader has the Crusader trail with 50 missions or the skirmish options. Graphics have improved but gameplay has died.\n\nFor me, i'll stick with my 11 year old bad graphics but awesome gameplay Stronghold Crusader.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eagleprince/recommended/47400/","eagleprince","EaglePrince","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eagleprince/","6 products in account","I am writing this review because I think there are too much negative reviews about the game.\n\nI wouldn't say this game is bad, although in many aspects, it is not what we are used to have in other Stronghold games. It does have some bugs, and the one that is most common is troops stuck when you place a new buildings near them, and similar stuff... Still, same thing was happening in Crusader 1 and Stronghold 1 as well, with exception that in Crusader 1 this unit would disappear, or remain stuck on wall crenelation until the player does something to set him free.\n\nAlso, many complain how they cannot play with massive armies in multiplayer... Why do we need to play with so many troops? Can we play with smaller troops? We would make some smaller castles, and attack each other earlier with less troops... In the end - it is the same if me and my opponent have 50, or 500 troops. Still, I must admit that I wasn't playing it in multiplayer much, and those games I started - I did face the lag, but I cannot say I have some powerful computer, so I do assume that is the reason why I had those problems. For this reason I decided to play only multiplayer games 1v1 on smaller maps, but it doesn't have to do much with the game itself - it's because of my PC... Also, I hope that we should be able to play multiplayer games with less troops and less buildings, and still, to have the fun. :) In fact, that is another challenge! Try to make your economy efficient as much as possible with less buildings. :)\n\nThe other thing about Stronghold 3 is the fact that I was reading some reviews before buying Stronghold 3, and I knew there wouldn't be skirmish, and I knew there are still those bugs - so I got the game with low expectations. :) So, when I got the game, I was only looking at those good things of the game, and still, there are more good parts, and those bad ones.\n\nNevertheless, it is not an excuse, and I am also sad that Firefly gave up this game, and that they didn't work on it a little more to fix those few remaining bugs.\n\nI would also like to add that it is Stronghold 3 in which Firefly introduced some new interesting things such as: building walls in all possible directions, and putting any buildings wherever I want and rotate it however I want; special abilities of some troops, such as men at arms: they made spearmen more useful this way, etc... Also, I like it more how a castle looks in Stronghold 3 than how it looks in other Stronghold games - here castles are more natural, but that is only a matter of taste I guess.\n\nAmong those new stuff I do dislike how they made troops just leave the barracks - peasants do not need to walk to the barracks... This is something that could be exploited even in some campaign missions! I also dislike how they made the siege camps just like in Stronghold 2. One doesn't need to bring the engineers (and to protect them from the enemy) to construct mass of catapults in the middle of nowhere.\n\nI only want to say that besides its bad reputation Stronghold 3 is not that bad as they say - it is a good game, and we do have to admit that with this game Firefly gave us something new! I am sure that if the game wasn't published too early, they would have done it way better.\n1. there would be less things to be fixed in patches, and\n2. Stronghold fans wouldn't be so much driven away from the game after their first impressions, although it is bad that Stronghold 3 doesn't offer skirmish mode. (I guess that they had though/hoped it would be as good to us as Stronghold 1 was without skirmish mode, but in year 2011 we were expecting nothing less that a game with skirmish mode.)\n\nSadly, that bad reputation Stronghold 3 got was almost certainly the reason why they gave up Stronghold 3, and why they left some more things to be fixed... Even if they made a perfect game afterwards, little people would get it. Little people would be playing it, there wouldn't be much of those who would recommend it to someone, little people would be buying it...\n\nStill, even though I am recommending this game, my advice would be: don't get this game with high expectations, and still, you should have fun playing it. :) Also, I don't think it is worth 27,99€ - don't rush when buying it, you should be able to find a retail version for less, or you could wait from some sale at Steam, and to get it for less money.","November 19, 2014","true","39.2"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","16","30","0","5"

Reused one or two of them as well. A few times!\nThe building placement grid is gone, and the game seems even more sluggish then Stronghold 2.\n\nAs well, form what I see, there is no smooth transition for the day/night lighting they focused -so much- on. “It is a sunny day ma'lord” and with that, bam, light.\n\nI am embarrassed I just paid 50 bucks for this.","October 24, 2011","false","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Even if you are, you're going to severely disappointed. Another game that just fails to live up to its predecessors in every way. Building placement is clunky, unit pathfinding is near broken, Countless bugs litter the game and while it is playable (at least for me, some still seem to struggle) It requires a far beefier pc than should be necessary. Many features are from previous games are just downright missing, others seem half implemented.\n\nAbout the only thing the game has going for it... well it's kinda pretty, and the music isn't half-bad. But who wants to pay $30 for something that is at best an ambient screensaver? The historical sieges can be a little fun but they are the only mode really worth playing. Hate to say it but the reviews are bad for a reason. If you MUST try it make sure you pick it up heavily discounted.","January 10","false","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That could have been a tasty beverage, but someone got the bright idea to strain out all of the detailed play mechanics and structures from Stronghold 2 and throw them away. Why?!\n\nStronghold 2 was an awesome game, BECAUSE you had so many management options and detailed buildings! There were geese and eels in a pond, which was my personal favorite structure, followed closely by the royal treasury. There were lots of detailed buttons and menus when you clicked on structures…\n\nAnd while we’re on the subject, since everything in Stronghold 3 feels repurposed, what was so hard about carrying over all of the peasant dialog from the other games in the series!?! What fun is it to be lord of the castle if you can’t click on your peasants and listen to their simple babble? How are criminals supposed to steal from my granary if there ARE NO criminals!? Done away with gong pits? Madness I tell you!\n\nAll of that is gone in Stronghold 3… But at least there’s a day / night slider and some weather options in free build… Oh, and you can free rotate buildings… But the walls don’t connect to my castle anymore either… Win some, lose allot?

Comparing it to it's predecessors, Stronghold, SH 2, SH Crusader, it has a feel of being half finished in the most important areas.\n\nWalls, buildings, towers, traps, all are hard to place how you want them. The free build maps are only a small handful of pre-made areas, no custom map making. The main story continues from Stronghold 1, and it's decent enough to finish, though the ending is really dissapointing! The graphics are better, and they added a few awesome songs to the soundtrack, but they aren't enough to have you keep playing more than a few hours at most.\n\nIf you played the first games, I don't reccomend playing this one. If this is your first, give it a try and see if you like the concept of castle simulation; if you do, get the original Stronghold and SH Crusader.","August 12, 2015","false","17.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Also other units with lighter armour like spearmen swordsmen or crossbows look better.\n- There are a view completely new buildings for the stronghold like very low towers (I dont know what they are called in english) and better looking houses for the villagers.\nAlso "old" and familliar looking buildings like the cheese production and others look better now.\n- Sounds are good, there is at least one new song playing in the backgrund while playing,\nthe old talking sounds of the units when clicking on them and giving move or attack or formation command have been coppied (makes players who played SH2 feel familliar)\n- there are new fancy graphic options like depth of focus changing with the distance a building has between it and the camera and special options for light and particle effects.\n(I dont like the change of sharpness very much because i feel like not being able to see something (for example a blurry high tower with its tip close to the cam) very well. but im sure others will like it AND you can switch it off so this is a PRO.\n- The menu looks nice and is simple\n- Graphic changes can be adopted without restarting the game\n\n\nGameplay:\n\n- It is now possible to rotate buildings by rotating the mouse wheel, therefore buildings can be packed closer to each other in the castle (thats a really cool feature in my opinion and prevents the player from being ♥♥♥♥♥♥ because he wasted some space).\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n3. CONS (those are overwhelming the PROS by far in my case because i bought the game for the multiplayer experience and remembered SH2 being a good RTS game):\n\nAbout "setting up" a multiplayer game (i enclose the points in "About "setting up" a multiplayer game" in brackets because i cant rule out the possibility that the game destroying buggs described below where caused by my friend having a ping of arround 800 (please give me feedback if others are observing the same buggs)):\n\n- In the Host menue several times almost nothing happened after hitting the "go" button (even thou everyone was ready because he had clicked on the "rdy up" button an od number of times).\nJust a text at the bottom of the screen appeared saying: "game is being started..." (or simillar).\nMy friend with whome i was connected via Skype said he could see the loading screen but nobody was loading (counter stuck @ 0%).----> we couldnt start the game.\n- Also changing the position of the players on the map did not work when the maximum number of players on the map was reached. i think the developers did not include such a function in their game. (correct me if im wrong here). SH2 had this function. (it seems to me that this was just lazyness and bad work).\nIf they did not include such a function i ask here: Did the developers see the possibility of the Host wanting to change the position of players after the game is full? Did they even test the multiplayer mode?)\n- When setting up teams when trying to play for example 2 on 2, does "annoy just a little bit" :D because its just possible to count upwards and then reset the counter at 8 to 1 if you click it again.\ntherefore if you click one time to much you have to click several times to get a correct team setup, this wont be that bad if the "counter" would react fast so you could for example click 5-8 times in 2-3 seconds to correct the mistake. (in Age of Empires 2 they did solve it that way and it was okay)\nBUT: somehow hitting the "Teamcounter buttons" or the "go button" in host screen while being the host often does not have any effect at all, and you have to click again and wait 1-4 sec. until you see if the changed parameter becomes "online".\n- Also a programme running in the background while hosting changes the numbers = teams of the players which have not been clicked on, on its own if the host clicks on a players number=team to make him go one team up! (as if the host was too stupid to think on its own!)\nThis "feature" makes the host stay calm because the "mini plan" the host formulates kinda subconcious when setting up the game would sound kinda like this if you put it in language: Me and my friend(s) or other players in team A and the other players in team B. Then he goes on changing the numbers by clicking on them and if he screws up something (for example clicking one time to much which can happen with a high probability because the changes wont be accepted always or when they do with a delay :D)\nThe "AI" of the background programme ♥♥♥♥♥slapps the host in the face by changing ♥♥♥♥ on its own! and the host goes like: "what the ♥♥♥♥?!" I(!) am the HOST(!) I(!) change the NUMBERS(!)!!!\nOne could eventually try to shout the following at ones screen 3 times in a row:\nGet thee hence, evil background programme get thee hence out of the game Satan!!!".\nI can tell from experience it didnt work in my case...(that was a joke).\n- The chatt in the host menu (which is used to communicate with other players) (simillar to the buttons) often just did not show a new message i did type in and hit enter even if I waited a view seconds. The "lost" messages did appear when spamming a view more messages after the initial one.\nAs you can easily immagine i was staying cool and relaxed at this point in time because i realised that i did pay 20$ for a good load of fun buggs which wood enrich my experience greatly. (this is meant sarcastic).\n\n\nIngame experience:\n\n- Wall building partially did not work ingame for no obvious reason (probably i was too stupid to connect the gate with the wall correctly but i think that also was a bug). Also there was no invisible unit (like the assassin in SH2) standing there which couldve prevented me from building the wall. i can rule this out because i asked my friend if he had an invisible unit standing where i wanted to connect the wall to the gate i built.\n- One time my archers just did not attack enemy units which where passing by and where in range (at least it felt like they where in range; of course i did not measure the range ingame, thats the job of the developers). probably they have reduced the range of the archers dramatically but im guessing that this was a bug of the "AI".\n- It seems like you have to click on the ground to see the "building menu" which (in my opinion) is bad, i want a button (which can be configured as a hotkey) to click on to make the game show the building menu to navigate to the building i want to build. i dont want to click on the ground to summon up this menu.\n\nI repeat here: DONT BUY SH3 until they remove the worst buggs! (they probably wont remove em.)\nBetter play other games which are fun! SH3 is a waste of your money, time AND makes you go mad (especially if you "play" multiplayer)\n\nThanks for reading\n\nand @ the developers: Thank you for making this great game, removing most buggs and making my day! f*ckerz!!\nits a worthy follow-up to SHC and SH2!","October 26, 2014","false","1.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

I would barely say this glitchy, buggy, lazy and poorly optimized game is worth a purchase on sale, especially to fans of the franchise. Now I was alright with Stronghold 2. It was fun enough.

Units phasing through walls, shooting through walls, extreme lighting bugs and crashes to where I feel like a computer demon is clawing it's way out of my computer screen. The game doesn't have that "Hey I'm not the best game but I have enough charm to be fun" type of gameplay that 2 and Legends have.

This game is a step waaay back from the first two.  Although the graphics were much improved everthing else is absolutely crap.  It was full of bugs some of which killed what very little enjoyment i got from playing it.  The pathfinding script is so flawed that your army has trouble negotiating simple terrain.  The AI is a joke.  There is no co op options in the multi player set up.  The building options are clunky  and make no sence.  The maps are all small,  even the so called large ones.  This version make building any kind of keep difficult to the point of frustration because the maps are so small.  The zoom in and out optios are so limited that building become very difficult.  Firefly really shot themselves in the foot on this one.  They made promises about the game mechanics and multiplayer options and never kept them stating they never intended to include them, but the manual clearly states that those options are there.  In fact the Firefly forums for this game are all complaints.  The quit supporting this game and flat out refused to do any more work to fix the game other than making it stable, which it wasn't at release.  considering that the Stronghold series is what put these guys on the map this latest release will likely put them in the poorhouse if not out of business.  I flat out refuse to buy anymore Firefly products because of their attitude toward a broken unfinished game.","January 22, 2014","false","5.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

However, this game still feels a bit incomplete on the gameplay side and certainly feels lesser to that of Stronghold Crusader. The graphics are pretty decent, but I would have prefered more focus on gameplay. After all the patches, I'd give this more of a 60/100 as there's still more work to go. Diehard fans will still enjoy this and it's quite difficult too! Not like the strategy in the classic games with so much more luck involved in many more random events.  60/100 is a fair score that cannot increase until the content increases.  They shoulda used the same brilliant story telling method of Stronghold instead of the confusing sketch slideshows and "thrown into midst of battle" military campaign levels.

I loved stronghold 2 and the rest of the Stronghold games. But this one was bad.... The online is unplayable (if anyone even plays it) and theres no skirmish mode (You vs. AI) At ALL! I love playing vs the AI on Stronghold 2. Its pretty difficult and fun to just try to build the ultimate castle and army. But theres no mode for this. Id love if there was a custom game mode creator where you could add AIs to verse on a map of your choosing and the settings of your choosing. But there is not. Luckily I got the game on sale. So i didnt get ENTIRELY screwed over. The campaign is okay. But I know most people like to have a competitive experience wheter it be with others online or against an AI. I for one would not recommend you buy this game if you like Stronghold 2 and are thinking this is level up and an upgrade from it. Most things are exactly the same. The only difference is the graphics (which are really great actually).

The medieval charm of the original games do not shine through in this one, unfortunately.

It's just, it does not quite feels the same as the good old Stronghold 1.\n\nI can't exactly pinpoint what is wrong with this game, but it feels more dull and awkward, comparing to the older predesessor of Stonghold. It could be the awkward animations or maybe the lack of zoom or these weird green squares around all of your buildings... Or the complete lack of personality in your population, they become less of a people under your command and more of just... Units you can use as you please. Or maybe it's awkward phisics with projectiles and such. Or the lack of skirmish mode. I dunno, guys. It could be the sum of all of it together, but...\n\nI feel like it lost it's spirit since the second part of the series and it never got to be even close to what the first part felt like. And I will say once again... The game is not bad. It's just doesn't feel like that good old game that I used to spend days playing and enjoying every single moment of it.\n\nI will not make a negative review of this game, as it is not entirelly bad. It's just... Feels incomplete and more of a game than a whole living a breathing universe as the first part used to be. But I do not recommend you to buy it eighter.

The game is devoid of the charm of its predecessors and goes so far as to be a bad game. The battles are a big part of the game but, the AI is nonexistent and moving your army around is an immense struggle making the even a simple skirmish a massive pain. This could be forgiven if the economic gameplay wasn’t entirely broken, most buildings produce too slowly to keep up with a steadily growing demand, you'll find yourself with frequent food shortages despite having more than enough farms. Even the castle building, a cornerstone of the series is a glitchy and counterproductive mess.\nI strongly recommend you do not waste your time and money on this game.","April 19, 2014","false","7.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game is devoid of the charm of its predecessors and goes so far as to be a bad game. The battles are a big part of the game but, the AI is nonexistent and moving your army around is an immense struggle making the even a simple skirmish a massive pain. This could be forgiven if the economic gameplay wasn’t entirely broken, most buildings produce too slowly to keep up with a steadily growing demand, you'll find yourself with frequent food shortages despite having more than enough farms.

Then Stronghold 2 came out and for all of its ♥♥♥♥♥♥ storyline, It had a great interactive system. Following the line of games in the Stronghold line there were hits and misses aplenty but none of them were truly God Awful.\n\nUntil Now. Ladies and Gentlemen I give you, The biggest pile of crap on Steam. The Game that if anyone ever payed for, no matter how small the price, should receive a full return of their payment a written letter of apology from Gabe, and everyone at Firefly studios.\n\nYou took the orignial game and storyline and gave it a slight ENB setting change. Then you took the worst mechanics from other games, put them in, and left out all of the great mechanics. Why would you cut out the content that made the other games acceptable as continuations to the story?  So that you could fix nothing about the graphical errors or the faulty mechanics of the orignial without having to patch in new mechanics or graphics from the later installments.\n\nIf The original game had a performance level of 5. Its sequel had a level 8.0 Crusaders 1 and 2  were respectively 8.0 and 7.5 The King Arthur varient was probably a 6.5 but because of novelty became a 7.5\n\nAnd This Game is a 3. STronghold Online is a 2. Everything about this game offends. The cutscenes, the audio, the lack of detail from ANY other game. Oh you can be greeted by your peasants and see their names when you click on them? Not in this game. You can earn honor and influence to purchase estates and create traderoutes between other villages? Not in this game. You can host Balls and Feasts that are measured through the livelyhood of your village?  Well here, were back to basics with Food storages, and Weapons storages. Anything else is just fluff in the medeival era. WHo needs Jousting tourneys or Medeival torture for criminals, who needs Renn fairs to make the villages happy or Mercenary camps to implore new types of troops from across the seas in the holy land,\n\nWHO NEEDS A STRONGHOLD GAME IN 2010 WHEN WE HAVE THIS GARBAGE.\n\nSorry Firefly.

The moment i booted up, my heart sank. It is basically stronghold 2, but buggier and not having anything that even resembles any sort of skirmish. Skirmish had been the best part of all of the older strongholds, and was what i was looking forward to the most, but it is not there. It is also buggy as ♥♥♥♥, with units getting stuck in walls and archers sometimes hugging the enemy while attacking them. I would not recommend this game due to that, and i hope that Stronghold 4 fixes all of that, or else i will not get it. I cant believe that firefly would release it like this. If you want stronghold games, I would definetely go for crusader or 2. Those games were made in 2001 and 2005, and they are much more enjoyable that this.","April 17, 2014","false","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Unfortunatly it did not last long as the force I was given was very over powered.\n\nThis game is very pretty and a lot of detail was put into it. I liked how when I box selected units they would do battle cries and chants depending on the number of men I selected. It is just a shame that this game just refuses to play. I could easily have 100+ hours on this game if it would just run.\n\nIf the game was fixed I would recomend this, even if the devs expressed how they were possibly working on fixing this I would still recomend this. Sadly the devs just pushed the game out and left it to rot. This game had so much potential and hype it saddens me that this will be most likely the last traditional Stronghold game.

Clearly version 2 is the best.\nVersion 3 is by far the worst. Sloppy programming, Units stuck, Dull landscape, Impossible to get stance of soldiers to anything. Insane bias towards computer AI. Expect to have to defend impossible positions and single archers decimating your ranks from 20% greater distance than you can shoot. Expect battles in which even at puny level the amount of soldiers you get to defend or attack is half that what the computer opponent gets. Expect not to be able to rotate the battle field or unseen enemies lurking in trees and no way to kill them. Expect enemies to field entire armies in the time you barely can get 10 villagers to spawn. Sad stuff really.

This game feels rushed and unpolished, and with zero response from the dev's about updates or patches, you have to assume there will be none.\n\nSeveral missions have you forced with only a few units to face an entire army of invaders.. you might think there are several ways to win at this mission... you would be completly wrong.. you must complete the mission the EXACT way the developers planned for you to, or you will be totally decimated.. thus taking away the fun of trying your own thing.\n\nthe worst offender of this is a Castle seige mission where you are given 2 catapults, 1 ram, 15 pikemen, 20 archers, and a couple of archer sheild things... you have to breach a 2 stage wall, and the keep that are totally lined with archers, and about 50 macemen and roughly the same number of pikemen around the keep.   if you dont move your units exactly to required positions (which are totally obvious) you lose... period. (oh look a convenient hill overlooking their castle and its undefended, Wow what luck *eyeroll*)\n\nI own Stronghold, S:Crusaders, S:Gold, S:2, and now S:3  and 3 is by far... the worst of them all.  by a huge margin... i wont be buying S:4 or any other stronghold game ever again because of this.

After you finish the military and economic campaigns there are no much to do, so you will go for free build, where you will build one time and set and invasion (then you wont play it again for sure) so after that you will jump into multiplayer, you will struggle and waste time in order to start the game, and if you succeed you will lag and maybe crash, thats it the game itself has a great potential but it seems a lot of things are broken and will be hard to fix. Stronghold series is unique and I love it, but SH3 is just so buggy with missing features that were avalable in previous game (skirmish for example)... This will be thier last game for sure, untill some developers will come and make us a nice castle RTS/ Sim..","August 20, 2014","false","79.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I played the old titles and yes, they were better (those were the days, get over it), but as it is the only one available for Linux i would say: Playing Stronghold 3 is better than playing no Stronghold, because it is a great series and the worst Stronghold 3 is still better than many other games of that type.","October 25, 2014","true","13.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Here's why. User created games! That is what makes this game awesome! Individual quests that you can get off the website or a search. You will have to put the file from the internet into a specific game folder, the web will tell you how, its not hard. New goals to be reached, taking over multiple castles, and some games have a feature that allows you to send armies of choosable size to attack you, and to change other things. Some games are dumb. Some are epic. Find em, download em, and enjoy.  This game is still a worthy play. The "bugs" everyone are talking about are the semi-cheats that were removed from previous games, (like building walls and buildings on mountains and unstable ground, and layering castle walls.) The AI has always been very dumb in the stronghold series, so why complain now? Do you want these soldiers to all run their own highly organized black op mission?! Give the cold, wet, untrianed, underaged, malnourished, poorly clothed, diseased, dirty, smelly, soldiers of the dark ages a break would you!  I am bummed tha some of the buildings are gone from stronghold 2, but looking at reviews of that game, these were buildings that had niches to how they worked, and could be a pain. Like catching criminals, and gong farming. I like this game. I hope that more user games get made. After seeing all the nasty reviews there probably won't be another Stronghold.","May 6, 2015","true","444.9"," 16 of 35 people (46%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","46","16","35","5","0"

These conditions are that you are a Stronghold fan, and that you have a friend who is also a Stronghold fan who you can struggle through the missions together with.\n\nIn this way there will be dark times ahead, but also cheery times.  From the Bees dying to yelling out "NOT THE LOGS" while assaulting a castle as well as attemting to move your units which are stuck inside the environment or buildings.  However there are also moments of hilarity and joy when you finally capture that accursed castle, The Sultana I'm looking at you, or perhaps just a sense of relief that you have finally finished the mission you have been stuck on for far too long.  If I had been playing through this game alone I would have uninstalled this game during Mission 8 and never looked at sultanas the same way again, however, as I knew my friend was going through this suffering with me, we both persevered and triumphed. Always remember, however bad you are, Scarab is still worse.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you and a friend like Stronghold then I recommend both getting the game, otherwise I would probably stay away from it.","September 8, 2015","true","13.0"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","29","2","7","3","1"

Ok, the odd unit did get stuck in a wall but that never ruined the fun.\n\nI found the overall gameplay fine and had no problems with the UI or the economy or the building.  Having played all the older ones this one seems largely similar, which also includes the bad bits, and certainly does things no better.\n\nMy biggest gripe, that I have to mention, would be the lack of a skirmish mode.  This really limits the amount of time I’ve played it and for a castle building game the story line had too few opportunities to build a skirmish-mode-like castle.\n\nSo as a fan of the series, yes this incarnation was disappointing and limited, but I’d still recommend it when it appears in the sale, just to get a fix of castle building.\n","November 29, 2013","true","20.4"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","0"

Though Stronghold 2 and the first one and Crusader were much better. Stonghold 3 is not bad in it's current state. But let me list some cons...\nCons\n- You can not choose what type of stronghold you want (Castle, Stronghold or Manor Also this is historically inaccurate because Stronghold 3 takes place after 2 and 1 and after the Middle ages kings were probably living in palaces not wooden Strongholds but of course Stonghold 3 is it's own story)\n- House systen is just.... BAD\n- No more hutning system...\n- No ships\n- Not worth a high price\n\n\n\nNOW FOR THE PROS!\n- Improve Grahpics\n- Still fun\n- Many character from Stronghold 1 are back!\n- GREAT SOUNDTRACK\n- DID I SAY GREAT SOUNDTRACK???\nAnyway is this game worth it at the price? No. if it's on sale for at least 10$ or 7$ OR 5$-12$ It's worth it.

You begin with nothing but a small settlement and meaningless objectives and gradually progress across the medieval world growing in strength and defeating progressively strong foes. The story is very linear and there is no tutorial, guess work is what keeps the game a challenge to begin with.\n\nI'd really like to say it's a great game having been a fan of the series for years but I honestly wish I hadn't played it. The lack of tutorial or direction for the game frustrated me and despite the odd humorous comment by my adviser, I quickly grew bored. I can't recommend the game but if you do decide to buy it and can get your head around the unexplained and complicated economic system, you could get a good few hours of play from the game. While the previous games appealed to younger audiences, this game is simply too difficult without a tutorial for anyone too young.\n\nPros:\n•	A lighthearted take on a grisly medieval world.\n•	Amusing characters.\n•	Wide range of units and buildings.\n•	A fairly complex economic system.\nCons:\n•	A linear storyline.\n•	Lack of tutorial.\n•	No real advances since Stronghold 2.\n•	Essentially the same story as the previous 2 games.","July 14, 2014","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Or perhaps I might mention the completely dead plot throughout the millitary campaign with nothing to be said for it minus that it is voice narrated inbetween missions?\n\nRather, I think I might mention that the game itself is just filled to the brim with glitches, looking like it was rushed to meet a release date, and then abandoned before it was ever fixed. For examplle, unit pathing is AWFUL. Units will frequently get stuck on completely flat terrain, corners, slight grades such as ramps and stairs, etc. And god forbid you attempt to play online.

For now I would suggest the waites until it's like 10 15 $ something like that. If you are looking for a good castle game I would suggest something like stronghold 2 which is in my opinion by contrast very well done and has far more then this one does all around I would say: Legends isn't "bad" if your into dragons gients wharwolves that sort of thing.","September 17, 2014","false","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But by removing the skirmish mode from the other games ruined the game for me, not to mention it ruins this formerly great franchise by destroying what was great about the games in the franchise. Sadly the game has only better graphics and has worse gameplay then the previous games in the franchise. Another thing, for me anyway, the multiplayer doesn't work, period.There is now a limit to how many buildings you can have on the map at a time which kills the ablility to build the way you want.  if you want a better game in the franchise i reccomend Stronghold Legends or Stronghold 2, those are my personal favorites in the franchise so far. i would even reccomend stronghold and stronghold crusader over this, and i really didn't care for them taht much.","September 18, 2014","false","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Stronghold 2 is of my favorite games of all times. This game is terrible. It is worse than anything I have ever tried playing before. Not only are the small number of features in the game broken, but there is a reduced number of features from stronghold 2. They have done nothing to effectively fix any of the problems at all and the game looks and plays just terrible.\n\nUnits will just walk through walls, not that one should even build walls as there seems to be no advantage to even doing so. Units have been taken out of the game. Most units will just stand there and take damage unless you specifically order them to attack enemies 1v1, in which case they will still only do one or two hits of damage before resuming their meat shield mechanic. The cut scenes are drawn with what looks like crayon or a large #2 pencil by someone who might have taken art in high school.\n\nOn top of all of this rubbish they have also taken out kingmaker. Kingmaker was the mode that let one skirmish with CPU's all of which had different play styles. This was a ton of fun and pretty much all that one could do after the campagins were done. Now, if one has the nerve to trudge through hours of crap story and broken units, missions, and dialoge; one gets to sit on his/her thumbs and contemplate why the ♥♥♥♥ poor decision was made in the first place.\n\nI made the mistake of paying 60 dollars for this game. They could have simply re-released the stronghold 2 with an extra couple missions and I would have felt shorted, but content in the long run. The complete lack effort or pride in this game is enough to make one wonder why anyone would have even started on this project. I would now not only recommend not buying this game, but never buying and product that firefly ever produces.  This game is garbage.","July 22, 2014","false","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I just bought the gold version for a few bucks in a sale. I only play the campaigns, and single player, and i found it very similar to the first game. Many of the early missions were direct copies or at least the exact same feel to them, but they had some interesting twists as well. There are some new additions to the game play that were not around in the first version, and that does add some depth, and helps you grow in power and prestigue while you grow your Feudal villages.  I did not come across many bugs, and have a feeling that many issues of the early game release have been fixed. Over all i found it a fun, yet simple castle building game, that really did remind me a lot of the first Stronghold.

You begin with nothing but a small settlement and meaningless objectives and gradually progress across the medieval world growing in strength and defeating progressively strong foes. The story is very linear and there is no tutorial, guess work is what keeps the game a challenge to begin with.\n\nI'd really like to say it's a great game having been a fan of the series for years but I honestly wish I hadn't played it. The lack of tutorial or direction for the game frustrated me and despite the odd humorous comment by my adviser, I quickly grew bored. I can't recommend the game but if you do decide to buy it and can get your head around the unexplained and complicated economic system, you could get a good few hours of play from the game. While the previous games appealed to younger audiences, this game is simply too difficult without a tutorial for anyone too young.\n\nPros:\n•	A lighthearted take on a grisly medieval world.\n•	Amusing characters.\n•	Wide range of units and buildings.\n•	A fairly complex economic system.\nCons:\n•	A linear storyline.\n•	Lack of tutorial.\n•	No real advances since Stronghold 2.\n•	Essentially the same story as the previous 2 games.","July 14, 2014","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When most of your player base get that kind of enjoyment out of a game, you would think the makers would have half a brain to add it. I suppose they spent there allowance on getting used to the new 3D style RTS and  it just took too much money, I cannot say for sure but I got this on pakage sale cuz im not a sucker like a lot of the ppl who paid full price. NEVER impusle buy even if ads make a game look good; wait for proper review and THEN decide if its worth your hard earned money. If companys add all this PRE-order stuff that makes you REALLY want the added stuff then the game is probably crap or ripoff OR not done, don't fall for it guys and gals.","April 27, 2014","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The campaigns are super short and dont really let you build up your base design it and upgrade it you are very limited and its over before you can even get the really good troops. Nobody as far as i can tell plays online. Skirmish mode is similarily a disappointment there is only one mode that is a free build mode where you can actually build a civilization and design a base and get the really good troops and buildings. However the map is small and you cannot pit yourself against any ai. So im confused on what the point of it was. I would not recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a fun castle builder that they want to soak some time into. It was a massive dissappointment to me and i wish i could get my 30 dollars back.","May 6, 2014","false","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

People have posted it's not a stronghold game, it is, just not a very good one. If your a die hard stronghold fan, thank you should explore it at least.\n\nThe game felt like it wanted to be Stronghold two, where you develop your castle into more of a town, but they left out all the decorations. More so, unlike the other Stronghold's, there isn't one stage where you start from scratch and build how you want to build.\n\nDon't expect to build an epic army just to meet another epic army in the middle of the battle field and try to outwitt the AI all the while having another army building.\n\nMost of the game is simply surving.  Your always on the clock with a limited amount of days before the task is met or you made it through the attacks.\n\nWhat I didn't like was the limited amount of usage of the higher end units like swordsmen and knights, even crossbow men. Most of the game you use peasents as cannon fodder to protect your spear men. Though they added the ability for the spearmen to do a good amount of damange to soliders by throwing their spears, they are still the weak spearmen we all know.\n\nThey did add a new type of soilder, the Ranger but since you only get to use the Ranger unit twice I never got the chance to explore the unit.\n\nIf you look back to Crusaders and even stronghold legends, they have less units. No fighting monks and no mercs like the slaves that can burn down buildings or the archers on horse back. In fact there really is no use for the "well".\n\nThe sieges are way to hard. You litterly have a handful of men and not enough seige weapons. It almost feel's like a puzzle and a touch of stealth when your taking down a castle.\n\nThe one interesting aspect of the game I did like was the honor system. You buy statues and have varrious special buildings that allow you to throw a party which gives you honor which is needed to use higher end units like knights, swordsmen, macemen, but oddly enough not pikemen.\n\nFor Multiplayer this is a great effect, it makes it so you just can attack right away like in so many other RTS games. By the time you can build a half way decent army, your going to have to go against the other players castle...But oops, if your lucky enough to find someone online playing, it's buggy once you both get building.\n\nI did like the fact that taxes actually were worth rasing and mining for materials paid a lot less which made it a must to have to build your own weapons. Unlike the other strongholds you do build weapons faster.\n\nThe graphics are better, but not really haven't made leaps and bounds since the orginal. The stronghold series has never been about the graphics. I rather have had the game graphics dumb downed when the game first game out.\n\nIt's pretty safe to say Firefly is finished with this game despite the few bugs it has. The only good thing that came out of this stronghold was the honor system, which is actually bearly used.\n\nPerhaps the only saving grace for stronghold 3 will be if the makers do a crusaders verison of the game.\n\n","April 7, 2014","true","34.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can play two campaigns (or one other extra if you include blackstaff) And they both are: Military Campaign,and Economic Campaign. I was deciding to get this and i suprisingly enjoyed it. There is some improvements that can be put to this nice idea of a game and fair results. Some improvements i think about is:\n\n1. Skirmish.\nI didnt play other stronghold games,but i always like skirmish games aslong as you can fight against someone. However freebuilds enemy deployment kind of blocks that part.\n\n2. A bit of patching.\nWhile i dont see that much bugs and glitches and crashes and corruptions that other people see,i was only met with probably only one crash before and some very hailarious bugs that should actually be a feature if you want to laugh. While i know the people that made this game stopped doing something with Stronghold 3,this is only my thoughts.\nWould be nice if they could probably try fixing some corruption and crash problems and then i would say this game is good.\n\n3. Multiplayer performance fix.\nWhat i mean is that some people with toasters seem to just play this,and i dont want to have to see that im needing to be patient sometimes just so someone can stop lagging. Its just.. Madness.\n\n\nI think the features this game does provide makes me happy. The problems arent much of a disturbance and are more a bit funny or odd.

I am writing this to inform you about this half finished game. There are many elements crucial to an RTS that this game lacks. For instance, death match mode.. which is non-existent. Death match is what gives an RTS replay value and this game does not have it.. just a completely boring free mode where hardly anything happens. There arnt cut scenes in the story mode, only cheesy little picture slideshows with concept art. I find it impossible to make myself play through the boring story. The game play mechanics are very unpolishedl... the worst mechanic being the soldiers.. they move painfully slow. In addition to the poor mechanics, There are many bugs! more than normal! I also personally think there is a bit too much to mico in this game and the lack of an opponent makes this feel like an waste of time. I do think that the graphics are very well done and the character models are great. But aside for a little bit of eye candy initially, the game is mediocre at best. The game has so much potential that it does no fufill. Many people including myself find this game a a disappointment and that feel that it remains in its Beta form. The game play is so lacking. I only got it because it was $3. I would not pay any more of my hard earned money for this lacking game, just take my advice and buy a better game. Don't be tricked by the flashy trailer, the game is very dull. If you're looking for amazing RTS, get starcraft 2 or Age of Empires HD edition. If you like stronghold then buy stronghold 2. This isn't worth your money, to me it was only worth a few bucks. And if you really do want to give this game a try, wait for a sale!

When most of your player base get that kind of enjoyment out of a game, you would think the makers would have half a brain to add it. I suppose they spent there allowance on getting used to the new 3D style RTS and  it just took too much money, I cannot say for sure but I got this on pakage sale cuz im not a sucker like a lot of the ppl who paid full price. NEVER impusle buy even if ads make a game look good; wait for proper review and THEN decide if its worth your hard earned money. If companys add all this PRE-order stuff that makes you REALLY want the added stuff then the game is probably crap or ripoff OR not done, don't fall for it guys and gals.","April 27, 2014","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Dashed upon the rocks they were, throwing up at me from all angles of this delectable piece of garbage.  Ignoring the reviews from the other websites and friends that told me what a piece of trash this was, I played anyway.\n\nMy disappointment is so great that this is the only game I would remove from my steam games list if it were possible.  Flora's fruit farm was a better war game then this collection of heartbreaking ones and zero's that now take up space on my list.  A game that had such promise, and with a great community and die hard fans to back it, has dug its own grave, jumped in it and then instead of dirt, used its own fecal matter to bury itself alive.\n\nNo wonder Firefly Studios has abandoned this game, they spent a grand total of 300$ and a drunken frat party weekend putting this ♥♥♥♥ together, spew it out for 60$, which the fans bought, and then face ♥♥♥♥♥ them by the dozens.  Thank you Firefly for showing your fans how much care and effort you put into your new games.  I will be telling as many people that will listen to never buy another game from your Studio again.\n\nP.S. And no skirmish mode?  How much do you like men Firefly?

You begin with nothing but a small settlement and meaningless objectives and gradually progress across the medieval world growing in strength and defeating progressively strong foes. The story is very linear and there is no tutorial, guess work is what keeps the game a challenge to begin with.\n\nI'd really like to say it's a great game having been a fan of the series for years but I honestly wish I hadn't played it. The lack of tutorial or direction for the game frustrated me and despite the odd humorous comment by my adviser, I quickly grew bored. I can't recommend the game but if you do decide to buy it and can get your head around the unexplained and complicated economic system, you could get a good few hours of play from the game. While the previous games appealed to younger audiences, this game is simply too difficult without a tutorial for anyone too young.\n\nPros:\n•	A lighthearted take on a grisly medieval world.\n•	Amusing characters.\n•	Wide range of units and buildings.\n•	A fairly complex economic system.\nCons:\n•	A linear storyline.\n•	Lack of tutorial.\n•	No real advances since Stronghold 2.\n•	Essentially the same story as the previous 2 games.","July 14, 2014","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The very first thing to pop out as I loaded up after a 2.5 hour download, was no opening cinematic. Not a huge problem, but it really stood as odd in comparison to the older games.\n\nUpon loading up the first mission, I was surprised to see the introduction as a stylistic drawing. Yes, they drew the intro to the game. Admittedly, they did a damn fine job with the drawing but it just seems so out of place. Likewise, I couldn't even tell if they knew how the Wolf had acted in the original games when they portrayed him during this. 3 missions in, and I can still tell that the Wolf is trying to portray himself as a benevolent overlord that loves everything. Then they instantly change his attitude not 10 seconds later and take him down a murderous rampaging path. I know the guy is old, but come on.\n\nI have yet to meet any real bugs or issues, but I'm only on the 3rd mission of the main military campaign. However, the sudden "victory, let's take you to how you did!" screen was... obnoxious. At least give me 2 seconds to comprehend that something was done correctly in the mumbo-jumbo that's happening on the screen.\n\nOh yeah, the screen. Where I feel the biggest let-down has happened. Remember where your popularity would start at 70 and you would gain/loose popularity? From what i've seen, it starts at zero and that's your base unit. Fall below that and loose villagers. Go higher and nothing else happens. It will drop back down towards zero unless you do a "permanent" fix, such as increase of rations or bribery. There's no popularity lee-way as in the previous games.\n\nOn the other hand, the graphics are really nice as per usual Stronghold style. No pictures detailing your peasants, animals, or etc this time though. Just a name and semi-rare voice line used.\n\nGoing in, I expected much more from Firefly than this. It's most certainly playable, at least thus far. Confusing though, as there's no real tutorial. They just throw you right in, expecting you to know what to do. Reading the help menu in game is great and all, but there is no detailing your control scheme or other major changes from here versus previous versions.\n\n\n\nOverall, this is probably a 5/10, and that's being lenient. If you're a fan of the series, get it on sale. Don't spend much cash, or you'll just be grumpy at yourself. If you want a game that lives up to it's predecessors name, don't go here. Seriously. It's decent, but not good. Nothing short of a complete and total overhaul will make it good. What is available though, is moderately fun and interesting. Play a few missions, quit out for a few weeks, start it up and just repeat the process.","April 14, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can play two campaigns (or one other extra if you include blackstaff) And they both are: Military Campaign,and Economic Campaign. I was deciding to get this and i suprisingly enjoyed it. There is some improvements that can be put to this nice idea of a game and fair results. Some improvements i think about is:\n\n1. Skirmish.\nI didnt play other stronghold games,but i always like skirmish games aslong as you can fight against someone. However freebuilds enemy deployment kind of blocks that part.\n\n2. A bit of patching.\nWhile i dont see that much bugs and glitches and crashes and corruptions that other people see,i was only met with probably only one crash before and some very hailarious bugs that should actually be a feature if you want to laugh. While i know the people that made this game stopped doing something with Stronghold 3,this is only my thoughts.\nWould be nice if they could probably try fixing some corruption and crash problems and then i would say this game is good.\n\n3. Multiplayer performance fix.\nWhat i mean is that some people with toasters seem to just play this,and i dont want to have to see that im needing to be patient sometimes just so someone can stop lagging. Its just.. Madness.\n\n\nI think the features this game does provide makes me happy. The problems arent much of a disturbance and are more a bit funny or odd. This is only an opinion.","November 28, 2014","true","52.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a avid stronghold fan I was looking forward to it. I had expected something like stronghold two's castel system and stronghold crusaders level of combat difficulty. I got a watered down buggy unfinished product. I'm not sure if they even play tested this thing.\n\nOne simple expample of its shortcoming is the compleat removal of any type of Player VS AI deathmatch game type, so all those stratagies that ou thought you may like but didnt want to try against human opponents? yea too bad. They also cut out custom senerios as it was called in crusader or user maps as it was called in two, entierly. This used to be one of my favorit parts of these games, being able to just go at it in compleatly customaisable enviorments. Well I guess that was jsut too much for this game.\n\nSome of the smaller yet equally annoying things are the loss of the gong and rat mechanics, this is supposed to be compisated for by a large increase of the random events however I ahve no control over wether or not rats eat half my food now, instead of before where I was held somewhat accontable. Additionaly we lost the whole crime mechanic from two, so now if you ahve criminals you had best not punish them or else you will take a hit to the painfully fickel popularity meter.\n\nThey also cut out much of the difficulty I as able to beat the war and ecconomic campains without ever having to redo a level.... on the hardest difficulty. Firstly since when do we have difficultys in a Stronghold game? one of the best things was that ti forced you to put your best food forward and guided you throught the process of knowing squat about how to run a castel to being albe to take on 4 wolfs at a time (wolf the lord not the animal) secondly while I am what I would call a compitant player, I should not have been able to get through two of the three campains with no deaths on my first runthrough.\n\nOverall buggy and far to easy, 4/10.","May 26, 2014","false","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's full of bugs, and there's not even a skirmish mode. Worst of all the game was abandoned by Firefly, so there's no chance of the bug fixes, additional content and expanded modes that the game desperately need.

Nobody should be put through the nightmare of having to play this. Simply awful. Congratulations on making the most terrible game of all time, firefly. While stronghold 2 ruined the original game, it was still playable, this one is just  terrible. And 2 years after being released it's still buggy and unplayable.\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME!\nI am also going to boycott Firefly after this...thing... they do not deserve more of my money, I feel like I've been robbed and cheated by them.\n\nI paid 50 euros for this, ultimately receiving not even .50s of fun.","January 5, 2013","false","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
