You have a time limit to kill the animals in question and are deducted points if you shoot things you shouldn't.\n\nIf that's your type of game then you will like it otherwise it won't hold your attention long.","January 16, 2015","false","0.2"," 37 of 47 people (79%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","79","37","47","6","0"

I purchased the game did not expect much for 5.00 but there is no volume in the game all other files have volume, turned up volume in setting and on computer.  Tried to play game without volume and now it says I have no lives?/ ?  Do not waste your time or money.
