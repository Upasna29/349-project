With very friendly and inviting characters as well as a bright atmosphere, Mortal Kombat is sure to delight children of all ages and engage them in a very positive, educational experience. It plays like a fast-paced game of tag, with puzzles to challenge the mind, different mini games to enhance response time, and a difficulty that is very forgiving to new players. Don't let the pictures above fool you; Mortal Kombat is all about peace and non-violence.\n\nMortal Kombat follows the stories of several characters as they each compete in a fabled contest called, "Mortal Kombat." The Mortal Kombat Tournament is basically a tag & hugging contest, with the best tag players from around the world competing to be crowned the winner and earn a years supply of cupcakes and a Starbucks gift card.\n\nHowever, there is a secret bet between a group of overseers known as the "The Elder Gods," and the previous tag master, Shao Kahn. Shao Kahn wants to throw a big party with music and cake in Earth Realm, but Raiden one of the protectors of Earth Realm, doesn't want to have a party, since nobody likes Shao Kahn since he's a bully. So the Elder Gods tell Raiden that Shao Kahn can have his party unless someone from Earth Realm wins the Mortal Kombat Tournament.\n\nKnowing this Raiden begins training his pupil, a happy-go-lucky man by the name of Liu-Kang, so that he may win the contest. But he is not the only one participating. There are numerous other characters that the game follows, such Scorpion and Sub-Zero, two best friends who dress as ninjas that love hanging out and visiting each other's families. There's also Johnny Cage, a famous actor that respects women and goes out of his way to be kind and caring. Mileena, who is known for having the most beautiful smile in all the realms, and of course Goro, a jolly giant who loves to give hugs and is a very active environmentalist.\n\nTensions arise though when Raiden discovers that Shao Kahn plans to cheat his way through the tournament and make people come to his party. There's also a minor subplot about a man named Kano, who's being pursued by a lady named Sonya Blade in an effort to find him the perfect Christmas present, the ever-gentlemanly Johnny Cage assists in this, and it teaches a valuable life lesson about sharing and giving and respecting the law.\n\nAt some point you'll play as most of the characters, and you'll discover that all of them have unique methods of tagging. Each character even has special moves ironically named "Fatalities," because they're completely non-violent and send messages of peace and good sportsmanship to the players.\n\nOther than the story, there are numerous game modes, such as challenge tower, that are increasingly fun and not at all too difficult for the average player. In addition you have the fun mini-games I mentioned before; Test Your Might, Test Your Skill, Test Your Luck, each adding a little something extra to the formula.\n\nThis edition also comes with a few new characters , such as Skarlet, a girl with good intentions that has difficulty spelling words with a C in them. Rain, a funny weather man from Miami Florida, and let's not forget Freddy Krueger, who is not at all the same person from those terribly violent horror movies, but rather a kind doctor who helps people suffering from terrible injuries and is also incredibly good with children.\n\nAll in all, when it's finished, you'll feel incredibly fulfilled and your children will have learned a lot of things about themselves and about how to treat other people. Definitely recommended.","April 2, 2015","true","8.3"," 1,251 of 1,415 people (88%) found this review helpful 2,076 people found this review funny","88","251","1","076","53"

This new Mortal Kombat is great fun. The story has a good pacing and lets you play with all your favorite characters. Only downside in the Story mode is the fact that there are no Fatalities. Because of that it sometimes doesn't feel like the Mortal Kombat we all know. But I guess that can be ignored, because otherwise they weren't able to pull off the story anyway. The characters look pretty detailed, especially when damaged and the new X-Ray feature is pure eye candy.\n\nThere are plenty of characters, and a whole batch of secret characters as well. Moves are relatively easy to pull off and especially Fatalities are easily performed. Gone are the days of 10-button combos, now it's just 4 or 5. It makes the game fun, not frustrating like older MK titles. Defeating enemies and completing missions will earn you coins which can then be used to unlock outfits and things like artwork and background music. There's more than enough replay value here.\n\nAnd even though this new Mortal Kombat is already 2 years old, it still is good value for your money.\n\n[Rating: 85/100]","August 23, 2013","true","12.0"," 304 of 366 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","304","366","0","15"

A true-to-form outrageous plot set in a war between Outworld and EarthRealm, narrated through well conceived animated cut-scenes and interspersed with 1-on-1 and Tag Team battles, allow gamers to control their favorite characters as well as try some others they might not have been so inclined to. The usual suspects are all here – from Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Sonya, Johnny Cage, Liu Kang, Sektor, Raiden and Shao Khan to a host of new faces like Smoke, Noob Cybot, Rain, Quan Chi, Scarlett and Cyber Sub-Zero. In addition, a variety of Single Player Arcade-style ‘Ladder’ Tournaments, Online Modes (to include Tournament’s, ‘King of the Hill’ events), and lots of unlockable Achievements, round out a robust content-rich title.\n\nGameplay | Graphics | Sound: Gameplay is fast and savagely bloody - and PC controls are tight, responsive and well optimized for both M&K and Controller. Newcomers to the franchise (or fight games in general) will relish the fact that unlike other fighters (which can be notoriously difficult to master), ‘Mortal Kombat’ utilizes a manageable 4-5 buttons for even its more complex combos making elaborate ‘Take Downs’, ‘X-Ray Hits’, and ‘Fatalities’ executable even for non-veterans. Mastering this system however, is another challenge altogether. Another positive is that all playable characters come already un-locked, eliminating the usual grind. Graphics and Sound are great overall as well.\n\nFlaws: In considering its flaws – 1. Multiplayer Connectivity Issues, and 2. an un-even difficulty curve – the continuing issues with online connectivity are the biggest concern. Online matches are frequently laggy and result in too many dropped matches (Be warned, although your mileage may vary).\n\nOverall, ‘Mortal Kombat: The Komplete Edition’ is a fantastic modern fighting game and a worthy re-boot of the legendary Arcade brawler - with a large collection of fighters (30+) to choose from, a lengthy well-crafted campaign, satisfying fight mechanics, all the brutality we would expect from the series, and lots of SP and MP modes to keep you busy through a sustained gaming session or a shorter pick-up-n-play distraction. Highly Recommended for both Fight fans and newcomers. “Get Over Here!” - Rated (8.8/10)\n\n\nWant More Recommendations?\nMake sure to click the 'Follow' button on our Curator Page (Link Attached) to get the latest reviews updated directly onto your Activity Feed.

This is true to the Mortal Kombat brand. Everything about this game feels familiar to long time fans.\n\nGraphics: Graphics are crisp. You will be able to see all the gore and special effects in vibrant 3D rendition. However, fighting only happens on a linear plane. Each fighter has a supermove that has X-Ray animation. It is bone crunchingly satisfying. Devs weren't skimpy on blood. Each strike produces buckets of blood, oil, smoke (depending on what the fighter is made of). Special moves look good. There is a lot of color, and yet, it's not overwhelming or distracting.\n\nSounds: You will hear one liners, grunts, strikes, special move sounds, bone breaking, etc. Sounds help you to get emersed into the experience. Everything fits together well. Sounds help making every punch satisfying.\n\nGameplay: If you played Mortal Kombat before, this will feel immediately familliar. If you are new to this universe or fighting games in general, there is a nice and helpful tutorial. Story mode is great. It's like watching a cheesy movie. You may not care for the story too much because writer/s were not afraid to make bold moves in story telling. Much like The Walking Dead, main characters may be killed off unexpectedly. I would suggest to use a controller to play this game (xbox controller will make it really easy, no setup required). You can play in Steam's "Big Picture" on TV with your friends. It's just like a console. I didn't have any luck with online play. There are many extras. All the basic features of a traditional Mortal Kombat game are also here. This includes special finishing moves. They are relatively easy to master. There is a helfpul tutorial for that too.\n\nVerdict: Both long time Mortal Kombat fans as well as fighting fans should get it. It's a definitive version that will give you everything a console version could. This is a good argument for the genre in general on PC.

All the best characters return and with new looks, including the special Freddy Kreuger guest. Lot more blood, violence, gamplay, features and of course no doubt the sadistic fatalities. The game is playable on your own, also to play with others at home, and online. The online side of the game and its several options to battle people around the world is incredible but also very competitive. And since its on the (Steam) Universe its best to be played with a controller. And depending on the Pc or laptop your using to play it can cause the mechanics of the game to perform poorly, the grapics slow down the graphics which can affect the use of gameplay causing lags. Not to mention there is no real technical support for this game which it needs, which effects the online play with others. And there is no option to turn off In-Game volume chat unless by headset, also for some the game launcher won't work which makes you have to keep deleting the file every time you play, stuff like this is what hurts the great title on PC.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/237110/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Mortal Kombat has seen action on the PC before. In the heyday of the series, both Mortal Kombat II and Mortal Kombat 3 were released on the PC under Acclaim's license. Midway then published Mortal Kombat Trilogy and Mortal Kombat 4 on the PC before the fighting game scene all but dried up. It wasn't until a few years ago that the gory series returned to the platform in the form of the Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection, which brought the original arcade trilogy to the PC for the first time in almost a decade. With the reboot of the series being successful, WB Games decided that it was finally time for the series to reappear on the PC with Mortal Kombat: Komplete Edition. There are a few issues, but it's one of the best fighting games on the platform so far.\nMortal Kombat is a 2-D fighting game that only shares a few things with other 2-D fighters. There is a large roster of fighters, and each has an arsenal of special moves to mix with regular moves to create combos. That's where the similarities end, as far as the fighting mechanics are concerned. While other games like Street Fighter are content with high combo counts and the mastery of technical moves, Mortal Kombat focuses on the brutality of fighting. You can still perform combos, but the emphasis is on hitting hard while sacrificing fluidity. Punches and kicks stagger opponents and spin them while special moves offer an extra punch. It's further accentuated by the presence of blood with just about every hit, except for a few body blows. Everything from the simple jab to a full-on buzzsaw to the chest produces copious amounts of blood, and special metered attacks, like the X-ray move, add broken bones and muscle tears to the mix. All of this culminates in the series' trademark fatality moves, which include beating the opponent with his/her own limb, slicing body parts into multiple pieces, and tearing a person in half lengthwise.\nThis recent iteration, though dubbed a reboot by many, is actually more of a culmination of everything that's worked in the series thus far, and it also culls extraneous features and modes. Free-form combos have replaced the "dial-a-combo" system, so combos are no longer canned and predictable. Though there is still a stance change button, it is only for aesthetics. The weapons system, which was first introduced in Mortal Kombat 4, and the create-a-fatality system from Armageddon have been removed in favor or more traditional fatalities. The game hasn't completely gone back to the system where everyone has the same moves, but everyone still has a sweep move and an uppercut, and damage becomes visible on characters over time. The new special meter allows for some depth since players choose whether to expend it on breaking combos, powering up special moves or executing the devastating but risky X-ray techniques.\nThe fighting style is enough to differentiate the game from other 2-D fighters, and the lack of gimmicky modes brings the focus back to fighting. The back-to-basics approach eschews needless complexity in favor of straight-up brutality. Fans who have strayed from recent iterations will be enticed by the effective fighting, and those who have stuck with the series will find the streamlined approach to be refreshing.\nThere are several modes available for solo players. There are the standard ladder modes, which let you play fight after fight until you defeat Shang Tsung, Kintaro and Shao Kahn before learning of your fighter's fate. The expected difficulty levels are also present, but the ability to play in a tag-team format and solo mode makes it more enjoyable, especially if you want some co-op play.\nTutorials are available in Mortal Kombat: Komplete Edition, but they've taken a deeper turn. A basic tutorial mode teaches you the basics, some special moves, and the game's newer techniques. You also have a free form practice mode, where you can beat up on a dummy all day and see data from your moves. What proves to be more valuable, however, is the fatality training section, which teaches you how to perform everyone's fatalities and includes proper spacing to take away the guesswork about required distances.\nThe deepest mode is Story, and while it isn't the first time a fighting game has done this, it is certainly one of the better implementations. Instead of resetting the tale, the game opens with the end of the events from Mortal Kombat: Armageddon. Just about everyone is dead, with only Shao Khan and Raiden left standing. Sensing the end is near, Raiden makes a last attempt to prevent Shao Khan from taking over the entire realm. Using all of his strength, he takes his memories of every tournament and sends them back in time to himself, thus setting up the story line reset that takes on familiar scenarios with new directions.\nOne of the reasons this works so well is because Mortal Kombat was always big on telling stories. Other fighting games concentrate on the fighting experience alone, but Mortal Kombat always makes an effort to build up the lore surrounding the fight. Even though the tale takes some silly turns, it is at least believable enough to work. Like Challenges, you're forced to play as characters you may hate, but the different perspectives add some depth to the story. With the tale lasting several hours, there's plenty to do in this mode alone.\nUnfortunately, the online multiplayer isn't as strong as the rest of the game for a few reasons. For starters, the online community on the PC version is quite small. When you get an online match going, the performance fluctuates. While the game never stuttered when playing online, some controller actions didn't activate until later, so jump kicks wouldn't execute until you're about to land from your jump. The controller delay and small online community means you'll really be looking to local players for multiplayer matches.\nGraphically, Mortal Kombat: Komplete Edition is still great, especially when you consider it debuted a little over two years ago on home consoles. Built with Unreal Engine 3, the game has some great-looking fighters that animate well and come to life as the damage builds. Backgrounds tell exactly the same story and are mesmerizing in that there's so much going on when compared to other fighters.\nFrom an audio standpoint, the game is also quite good. Effects hit hard, and each hit still sounds solid — though a little wetter due to the copious amounts of blood being splattered. The music borrows liberally from past Mortal Kombat games with remakes of classic stage tunes, and the new material happily goes along in that tradition of serious orchestral stuff as opposed to the electronic techno stuff that's associated with the old movies. The voices are great and acted well in story mode and in pre-fight taunts\nEven though it is two years late to the scene, Mortal Kombat: Komplete Edition shows you can create a compelling fighting game experience without only catering to the genre's multiplayer aspects. The single-player modes alone give the game an amazing amount of things to do, and the multiplayer still remains an addicting part of the game. The solid fighting formula seems to have found some comfortable footing over the years. The online experience could be better, especially with such a small community, but the game is solid enough in other areas that it is easily one of the better fighting games for the platform and worth checking out.","July 30, 2015","true","59.7"," 90 of 106 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","90","106","6","5"

I think this is the best Mortal Kombat game to date. The only thing it lacks from the other games is the use of weapons, style changes and a few of the historic chracters (not many though!). The story mode is a good addition and the cut-scenes try to make as much sense as they can with people ripping each other apart and then walking around fine in the next scene. The Krypt will keep you collecting coins to unlock new fatalitys and costumes. The moves aren't too complex to pull off in most cases, so it is about timing. Mortal Kombat is still my second favourtie fighting game franchise after Soul Calibur.

My favourite video gaming series. I have never seen a bad Mortal Kombat game. Let's go back to Pros and Cons.\n\nPros:\n-Gameplay: The gameplay is extremely agressive. And I have never seen a bug on the gameplay.\n-Story Mode: It has a great narration. (Spoiler Alert) And the story mode is about the events of MK 1-2-3.\n-Challenge Tower: Nice mode. And nice missions. Broke my gamepad because of this. 10/10.\n-Babalities: Cute and sad.\n-Test your ???: Every Test Your mini game is amazing, my fav is obviously Test your luck.\n\nCons:\n-Fatalities: Of course every fatality isn't bad, but most of them are disappointing for me. Yes this is a reboot, but why no original, new fatalities? Like come on, Shang Tsung's fatality is the same every time. Soul Steal. His main ability is soul steal, I know but why don't you add something new to it?\n-Multiplayer: If you want to play ONLINE, DO NOT BUY IT. Lag problems. But I don't care because I don't play MK online.\n\nFinal Score: 9.2/10\n\nThis game is one of the best reboot games in the video game franchise. Let's wait for MKX.

The game's story mode, challenge tower and classic ladder mode kept me super busy. I only recently started playing online thanks to the sale. MP was super laggy for me at first, but thanks to the forums, I found a small fix (turn off AA). The fix made the MP a bit more tolerable\n\nIt's easy for someone who has never played an MK game, to pick this up and be decent at it in a short time. The combo system is not super complicated like in SF, where you have to be on point down to a millisecond in order to pull off a decent combo.\n\nThe game is in fact complete. Buy the game, and you get it in its entirety. All the characters, all the costumes. No nickel and diming with a ridiculous amount of DLC.\n\nI have heard a lot of users having issues with crashes and other technical issues. But I have had none. 0 crashes in all my hours of playtime, and no FPS drops.

Challenging yet very satisfying when pulling off combos and fatalities. Lots of content including full story mode, tag team, arcade ladder, test your luck, challenge tower and vs mode on a single machine - allowing up to four players (two vs two tag team) so a great game to play with friends. Appears compatible with almost every controller, whilst also remaining playable using keyboard.\n\nI haven't had a very good experience online, connections are poor (possibly due to players being in different regions) and few players online . Private matches may fare better as I know the player will be in the same region but I've yet to try this.\n\nExtremely good value for money (31 kharacters, komplete with DLC). I've already invested hours into this game and thats just to learn basic BnBs for a few kharacters lole. Highly recommend for PC gamers wising to enter into the fighting game genre.\n\nMore people should play this game!! Trust me, if you stick with it (It will be difficult if this your first fighting game; which was the case for me) You'll love it.

This new Mortal Kombat game enjoyed being one of those games that only got ported to PC years after its release. The advantage we'd relate to the passing of time would be a decent number of people willing to play the game. It has an assumption of having either a growing or just a steady community. Also, PC gamers are well aware of how low the chances are for a fighting game's release these days. And of course late release would make us believe the game is a decent, well-optimised port without any major glitches, issues.\n\nSo, before continuing reading my review I would like to say it straightforward: multiplayer with this game is just awful. I have been unable to find a host or host a game ever since I purchased it. In fact, a friend on Steam asked me to play together so that he could unlock a missing achievement. Neither hosting nor joining worked. I am amazed how bad a multiplayer code a game can have today!\n\nPutting the horrendous multiplayer experience aside this game is very good! Although its story mode offers a store-telling which tries to tell you this is a sequel to previous Mortal Kombat games it is, essentially, a remake. Gameplay is similar to that of Street Fighter 4: no real 3D just 3D graphics. The game looks good, plays smoothly and offers a long single player experience.\n\nSimilarly to Street Fighter 4 the new MK offers ultra moves. Basically, a meter gets charged along the way and once it is fully charged we can unleash an X-ray move. This consists of a series of attacks and if the enemy is successfully hit each time the amount of damage they receive is just tremendous. As the game is very gory the X-ray utilises a lot of close-up shots focusing on the internal organs and bone structure of the enemy: we can see how these are crushed during the move.\n\nThe game's PC version (Komplete Edition) comes with some extra characters (such as Freddy from the Nightmare of the Elm Street horror franchise) that were only available via various DLCs on console. This is nice but expected 2 years after the console release date. The game has many unlockables, achievements and a Challenge Tower to further look for challenges in case you want to thrive.\n\nOverall, this is  a good game and recommended but in case there are friends who only want to purchase it so that they can play with one another do bear in mind you'Ll have a tough time with multiplayer.","June 14, 2014","true","155.6"," 46 of 55 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","46","55","0","1"

The story has fully revisited the first three games in the Mortal Kombat series. A huge amount of characters is re-introduced with new visuals, best seen in the many cutscenes. Yet the gameplay remains 2D sidescrolling battles, the way it is played best. Lots of fighting modes, challenges, unlockables ... this all can be found in the game. Challenge tower is included too, of course. Difficulty is stiil high when even on the lowest settings the enemies, especially Shao Kahn, will kick your ♥♥♥ if you suck at the game. Or if you own an XBox360 controller (like me) because precision button mashing is a must and analog sticks are almost useless. The fighting is fun, the story is cool and the online multiplayer is, well, empty. Yes, this is a understandable flaw, so be sure to have friends who either have this game or come over to play.

If the last MK you played was MK4, then MK9 is like it would be MK5. And it's lot better even that MK2 when it was released in 1993.\n\nThe only one bad thing about this game is the online gameplay. It needs an extremely good connection which can not be shared while you're on kombat. So, if you have a girlfriend who likes to watch youtube videos, ask her gently that she CAN'T use Internet while you are fighting.

Finally we have a Mortal Kombat game with a very well done story mode complete with talented voice actors and exciting cinematics.  I felt invested in the characters as they protected Earthrealm from the Outworld invaders and even learned a bit about their backstories that I hadn't previously known.  Instead of the classic "choose a character and win to see their ending" mode that most of the Mortal Kombat series has been, in MK9 you play through the story taking control of each character as they make an impact on it.\n\nThe fighting itself is extraordinarily smooth and, in my opinion, tied with Injustice: Gods Among Us for best fighting game experience.  Combos are easy to learn, special abilities are simple and intuitive, and fatalities, as they always have been, are absolutely glorious.\n\nIf you're a fan of the fighting genre, this game is a 10/10, no question whatsoever.","April 12, 2015","true","24.9"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","0"

After the forgettable Mortal Kombat VS DC Universe, MK is back in a huge way with tons of gore, over-the-top characters and combo-heavy the famous series is known for.\n\nStory: The story mode of the game is pretty well-done and in-depth. The tale follows the events of Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, where everyone has been killed off except for Raiden and the Outworld emperor, the mighty Shao Kahn. As Raiden is about to be "finished" by Shao Kahn, he uses his amulet to telepathically contact his past self with the message "He must win". So now it is up to the past Raiden to figure out who it is that must win and forever defeat the vicious emperor. From that point onwards, you get to play as most of the characters with the player using a different character in each chapter. The story is surprisingly good and is one of the best examples of how fighting games can do more than just add versus modes to a game and sets a benchmark for storytelling in such competitive games.\n\nGraphics: The graphics hold up well for a game released in 2011. On the highest graphics settings, Mortal Kombat looks stunning on PC with the characters and environments popping out of the environment with vivid colours and exquisite detail. Whether it be Sub Zero's ice moves or Liu Kang's fire moves, the game looks crisp and is bursting with personality.\n\nSound: Each punch, kick and bone-crunching move is captured extremely well in MK. In particular, the new X-Ray moves have a satisfying "oomph" to them and you truly get goosebumps when you hear thess moves being executed for the first time. Also, each character is voiced with a lot of charm and the announcer of the game gets you pretty hyped up, with his deep and menacing voice. The sound design is spot-on and is among one of the best in fighting games.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay in Mortal Kombat has been completely revamped in comparison to previous MK games. The combat is alot more free-flowing this time round, making it much easier to pull off multi-hit combos and super moves. It is fast, stylish and alot of fun. NetherRealm has to be given credit for how much they have improved the gameplay in this installment of MK, for it to be fun even for non-hardcore fans of MK such as myself.\n\nIn summary, Mortal Kombat is a fine example of what people should expect in modern fighting games: a solid cinematic story mode, heaps of content, online play and frenetic, fun, easy-to-learn gameplay. It redefines the fighting game genre and sets a benchmark for all other fighting games that come after it, in particular, the upcoming Street Fighter V.\n\nI'd give the game a 9/10.","February 14","true","28.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","10","11","2","0"

There was 0 patches since release.\nAnimations and controls feels clunky. Combat system is prety bad, there is no depth to it at all.

You can do 40% dmage combos too easily, that endles jugling looks way too stupid. Also most of the combos are safe, so you can just dial it in and enjoy free chip damage.\nBecause everything in this game dose chip damage and you get meeter while hiting your oponent when he is blocking, you are forced to play agresively all the time.\nIf you are close to death and your opponent has more or less than half HP comeback is imposible. You can forget about your own gameplay style in this game.\nThis is only good to play with people who are not that much in to gaming while a emtying create of beer.\nI have a feeling that they tried to cover bad gameplay with boobs, stripers, gore (characters look like zombies after few punches) and some badass looking characters and stages.","November 26, 2013","false","127.0"," 100 of 178 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","100","178","0","3"

Along with the usual ladder theres also a pretty solid story which personaly ive never experienced in a beat em up before. Another part to the game is the challenge tower which tasks you to complete certain challenges such as beat a fighter with no arms,fight upside down or many others. There is a krypt which contains many collectables, these can be aquired through coins which are rewarded by carrying out fights, challenges etc etc. Its a tough game, and one I just couldnt get the hang of using my xbox controller until I switched to keyboard. This made the game alot more enjoyable and also alot easiar to carry out special moves.

O que me deixou triste com o MK9 da Steam foi os imensos bugs que ele trouxe não só os que já tinham na versão pra console quanto mais bugs que se formaram nessa versão pra PC. o Online é altamente lagado para algumas pessoas, problemas de slow motion, queda de conexão com o jogo em alguns momentos.. Enfim, tudo isso pode ser resolvido com atualizações futuras que eu espero que aconteça. Fora isso, é simplesmente um dos melhores jogos de luta já feitos (Vale lembrar que esses bugs não são para todos os usuários. Eu já consegui jogar perfeitamente online com várias pessoas, só com algumas que acontece todos esses problemas chatinhos.)

So why do I love MK you ask? Let me answer..\n\nFirst It has a cool story. You are not a fighter that show up just to fight on streets or sth (Did you see what I did there? :) ). MK Universe has background and all of the fighters has some motives to be in this scenario. Also this one has a story mode to show you what the story is. And not like third person kind of style as in old games. Story is that good, you can watch it as a movie or something from Youtube. So you fighting actually make sense. Also story mode is a good way to know your way around all characters.\n\nSecond this game has lot of side activities if you finished the game and don't like playing online. There are some mini games, challange tower with lots of activities and also there is a krypt that you have to earn kombat points to collect stuff like character pics, concept arts, alternate fatalities and costumes (I don't think they are useful in this version because they were all open from begining). So after you finish story mode, you still have lots to collect and while you are doing it, you won't get bored.\n\nLast but not least, game is really easy to adapt (but hard to master I think) so any newcomer can learn the basics easily. There are wide options as difficulties, you can start from beginner all the way to nightmare. Game also has really nice tutorials and stuff, so it could be a good way to get in the fighting games. Graphics and gameplay are also a plus. Even with the worst graphics you can see the beauty in it.\n\nIn conclusion, if you haven't played MK yet, this one is a perfect way to start (cause it is a kinda reboot). If you are a longtime fan, I know you already got it. It is great to be able play a MK game on PC (They didn't release the last few games on PC). So have fun as you have it.","February 26, 2015","true","25.6"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Lag is extremely bad!\n-The training mode is lackluster and offers only the bare minimum\n-Very few players can be found only who play this game because of the terrible online issues that this game has\n-For you achievement hunters out there... this game has some terrible online achievements that are damn near impossible...\n\nOverall, if you have a friend who is willing to play with you and you can play with one another then I would suggest picking this game up for under $5.  I personally would not have paid more than $10 for this game because of the extremely poor online experience.  The lag is anywhere from a quarter of a second delay to a full second of delay.  Dropping games is a huge issue and is damn near impossible to avoid.  Nether Realms has since stopped supporting this game and has abandoned all works on this one as the new one will be coming out with MKX so don't bother buying this if it is more than $10.\n\nAnd no, I would not buy this game for more than $5 for just the story and challenge towers, but then again, I under estimated how troublesome online play was.","June 30, 2014","true","216.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I honestly recomand this game on console because it will be easier to play. Especially in 2-4 players mode. On keyboard and on single player, is easy to learn the buttons and combos, but when you try to play with a friend on the same keyboard, it's a nightmare! The second player must learn from different buttons and sometimes, players's fingers can tangle between them. It's like playing Twister, and I know it from my experience. I can't even imagine the 4 players mode. Other than that it's a great game. Graphics are really good, the combos, all characters have unique abillities, and oh my God...Fatalities!! Bloody hell, not even The Walking Dead can have so much blood in a game. Great and challanging bosses like: Shang Tsung, Goro, Quan Chi and that bad mofo, Shao Khan! X-Rays are stunning! NetherRealm Studios did a fantastic job! That's how you reboot a franchise without ignoring the last games. I think it's really worth it to purchase this game because all characters (DLCs included, of course, except for Kratos) and skins. Even after you finish the game, you can do a lot. Unlocking bonuses like concept arts, skins and fatalaties by exploring the Krypt, Challange Towers, Test your Luck/Might/Sight/Strike etc. The only, personal, problem that I have with the game's design it's that the female fighters shows too much skin. I know it shows that they have great bodies and all, but let's be real, do you really think it's a good idea to fight with opponents who have power of lighting, fire, ice, sharp teeth, swords, war fans, gloves with blades, spears, iron arms,4 arms mofos, toxic splits, rockets, guns, wearing just a bikini? How can Sonya, a Special Forces agent can wear just a "bullet proof" vest without a bra or a shirt. They look like stripers! (#nohomo). And how Baraka and Mileena can talk without lips and with those long a** theeth? Glad that they fixed women's uniforms and Mileena's mouth. I recommend this game to people who wants a good fighting game or a bloody one.","May 5","true","17.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/237110/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","First and foremost if you're looking for Mortal Kombat Deception clone (aka the best MK ever made), this isn't it.\n\nHowever,\n\nthis game does provide a sort of part two feel to Deception (even though it's a spinoff of Armageddon). There is a story line, there is a challenge tower, and the crypt (to unlock stuff with your MK coins such as alternate costumes) is there. The one thing deception had on every MK is that the scenery was interactive (pick-up weapons, throw someone through a wall or into a acid pit), and you could choose between three fighting styles, the third being with a weapon.\n\nSo is it better than Deception? No it isn't. Does it matter? Depends if you want the best MK out so far on PC (review written in nov 2014 :). There's still blood, there's still an immense amount of special moves and characters (including Freddie Kruger) each with their own unique combos and fatalities (and babalities...... yeah if you don't know what that is I'll let you figure it out). Stages are still as good as they have ever been. The challenge tower is fun and makes you fight with different characters and go through different challenges (headless Raiden and Kung Lao... can't use their hats to attack). There is story mode which literally takes you through a story and you fight with different characters as the story progresses. In between cut-scenes there are fights - it transitions quite nicely and fluidly.\n\nSo what do I give a Mortal Kombat that isn't my favorite MK (Deception)?\n\nIt's still a solid 7.7/10 due to game play and variety of characters. Would be 8.4 if it had the qualities deception did. I should mention though I bought this game ON SALE and got it with the first three versions of MK for a total of $7. Your call - if you're a hardcore MK fan you won't regret spending the cash on it. If you're a casual like me, maybe wait for a sale.","November 7, 2014","true","16.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The problem here is that the game is truly broken.  In many cases the game runs in slow motion throughout all the fights, which throws the sound off, and makes the game generally annoying.  It becomes obvious very quickly that this is a console port.  I love the console version with all my heart, but the bugs, sadly, make the PC version unplayable.

With the latter 's simple - a classic brutal killings : beheading , tearing in half lengthwise and crosswise , flaying , tearing of internal organs. Usually fighters to use their crown finishing tricks and equipment.

Plus, at some locations you can throw your opponent into the acid or spikes, push a car or train , dip into the lava face or to feed carnivorous tree. " Fatality " - a usual thing for Mortal Kombat, can not be said about the much-touted " X " strikes . In the course of the fight both duelists filled with special scale with three divisions . At the peak they have access to a powerful and beautiful attack. Ermak throws the enemy head on the ground and then jumping on the body lying , breaking ribs ; Kitana drives folded fan in the head and orbit accident ; Johnny Cage makes chop groin enemy ; Stryker and so generally applied to the opponent's head with a flashlight , baton ( with chilling ringing ) and stun .

Or, you know, do; you have free will.\n\nHowever; this fighting game is one of the best I've ever played; on par with Soul Caliber and Virtua Fighter.  It is the best of the MK series that I have seen, and I've seen them all.\n\nMisogynistic?  Any game in which a woman can eviscerate a man and rip him asunder, limb from limb, seems fairly pro-suffragist to me.  Do they show too much breast?  Maybe, but they show a lot of Liu Kang's chest.  You never hear people call that sexist; objectifying the man.  So, if the test of universality fails, I think you can pretty safely disregard the 'sexist' slur.\n\nAs for having no story, have these reviewers every played Tekken?  Maybe Virtua Fighter?  Soul Caliber?  Most fighters have absolutely no attempt to even try to have a story.  Mortal Kombat, out of all fighting games, seems to stand brightest in its mythology and background.\n\nIs it a deep story?  No.  Is it cliche?  A bit.  Is it there, do they try, do they give it a unique flavor?  Yes, yes, and yes!\n\nIn short, buy this game if you like fighters with blood, gore, violence, and sexy people; man and woman.","January 4, 2014","true","197.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I did find out how to get the game working and it has worked for my other friends aswwell\n\nthe fix\n\nWhat ur gunna wanna do is hold the windows flag key on ur keyboard and press r at the same time wich should bring up run, then u type in appdata and it should come up with 3 folders : local locallow and roaming then click roaming, then delete the MKE folder and it should work and u need to do that everytime u play.\n\nnow for the review\nmortal kombat has been my favourite franchises in the fighting genre. I played mk1 on XBLA in 2010 and i tried out every game by buying it online and really loved it so i bought this on sale and the error did ruin my taste for it but it soon made up when i finnally played it after finding the fix. I still havent got mkx but will be getting on ps4 tommorow. I really love the way this specific game has been set out and there was some frustrating parts ESPECIALLY the shao khan parts (ladder and story mode), but it made it better after i beat him. The gruesomeness is just not good enough for me though but the badassness of the skorpion fatalities was just plain amazing. Its is COMPULSORY to have a controller unless ur the best keyboard fighter as the fighting is impossible. The test ur luck is very interesting especially with the 7 slots. I wish it had variations for characters just like mkx. One thing they need in all mk games was the create a fighter from mk armageddon which i really enjoyed.\nThe chracters are really cool though like skorpion, sub zero and kung lao. I dont really find stryker that amazing but if u wanna be cheap which is the only way to beat shao khan then chose him but  reccomend raiden as u can just teleport uppercut over and over to beat him.\n\nPROS\n-great fighting\n-great fatalities\n-skorpion\n-good if u want a balanced fight and a tense one A.K.A expert mode\n-really fun\n-amazing fighting\n-fun overall\n\nCONS\n-shao khans cheapness\n-online private match dont work but glad to see u can sometimes get a fight but still a con\n-startup error that i showed how to fix at the top\n-not enough fighters still\n-cant be goro\n\noverall i can still recommend this above all the flaws\ni would give this altogether an 9.1/10\n\nthanks for reading and hopefully my fix worked ;D","July 16, 2015","true","26.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

But if I connect the joystick (joystick I have with numbers, and not figures the type of triangle, circle, etc.), I show the alleged control for numbers as me on the joystick.

The graphics and characters all look great, they move smoothly and combat seems to run at a normal pace. Its not super fast like the new Street Fighter. The fighters attacks arn't difficult to execute. A lot of them seem to share the same button patterns although they preform different attacks. This helps minimize the amount of codes needed to learn.\n\nI like the combos also. Granted their not very long (mostly 3 hits). Some can be easily chained together with special moves (like freeze ball or scorpions chain) without needing to study the move list. For longer combos you will need to find your fighters 'pop up' attacks. Pop them into the air with a basic attack or special move then lead into a combo.\n\nThey have added a "power bar" at the bottom that fills when you take damage. The same as in Street Fighter X Tekken. or Naruto Shippuden: Ninja Revolution. Although limited It does add a slight compliment to the gameplay. It allows you to: Power up special moves (3 times per round), Break combos (2 times), and use a super special move X-ray attacks (once per round). Energy does carry to the next round.\n\nThe X-ray attack does ~33% a health bar (roughly 2 combos). They do come with an awesome cinematic scenes of you smashing your opponents bones to bits but only 1 x-ray cinematic per fighter. They can give you a good advantage but note that most x-rays can easily be blocked.\n\nThere are 5+ modes you can play but I won't go over all of them. The Story mode is fun and gives you some background info on some of the charecters incase your new. It very roughly if not at all follows Mortal Kombat's original story. The difficulty gets unconsistently hard.\n\nLadder is like the original arcade mode, here you face 10 opponents. All but the top 3 are randomly chosen. As with the story I feel the AI difficulty isn't very consistent here eather. They grow hard very quickly. Also if your matched against the same character your using it can be difficult to tell you and your opponent apart. Your opponents costume will be only slightly off color.\n\nThere are a lot of unlockables; You open them with coins that you get from playing the game. The only ones worth mentioning really are: extra character costumes and extra fatailites! They've also included character costumes from the original Mortal Komabats!! (MK1 to MK3) For those nostalgic players that miss those sweet threads.\n\nLasty and most importantly the Fatality! You won't be dissapointed here. Each fighter has a handfull of finishing moves that are each unique and all so very gorey. They go cinamaticly way beyond the super special moves (X-ray attacks) I mentioned earlier.\n\nSo in conclusion this definitely is a great game and solid 'Fighter' for anyone looking for that genre. You will want to use a controller to play this; I had no need to remap any of the default buttons. You can remap up to 4 different ingame configs for a 4-player battle if needed.","December 7, 2013","true","39.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/moonshinefox/recommended/237110/","moonshinefox","[TLEG]Mana","http://steamcommunity.com/id/moonshinefox/","198 products in account","Excellent fighting game with really great mechanics. Even me, as a non brawler/fighting game player, could pick this up and learn reasonably well through the (somewhat slow) tutorial and story mode. Good variance on fighters and styles and their design, as well as stage design, are well made.\n\nAs far as story mode goes, it's often very obvious that the texture quality in places REALLY suck, especially during cutscenes, where it looks like some really poor models have been used. It's a stark contrast between cutscenes and actual gameplay, where gameplay easily wins out thankfully.\n\nEnemy AI is well programmed and the Medium one has been beating me fairly consistently, which is what I expect at my rather low skill level.\n\nDo I have any complaints? Yes, absolutely. The aforementioned texture quality for one, but also the boss design. Goro and Shao Khan are hideous examples of bosses. Not only does Shao Khan hit like a freight train dualwielding schoolbusses, but he's completely unstaggerable during any of his moves, guaranteeing that if you are anywhere in his vicinity, you ARE getting hit. He has multiple attacks that go straight through blocks and is quick as bloody hell. I don't mind that the boss hits hard, or have tons of HP and you need to utilize some strategy to beat him, but making him completely immune to interrupts? That's just low. In addition, his special attack does around 50% of your healthbar, but your own barely scrapes off 10%. I don't mind bosses doing much damage, but that is a ridiculus difference.\n\nAll this leaves you standing in a corner using teleports and spam ranged at him, which is definitely not fun whatsoever.","June 6, 2014","true","32.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Game still holds up strong to be a very fleshed out, competitive fighting game. Literally hundreds of hours of content here with many many things to unlock if you're into unlocking things like alternate skins. A good handful of fighters to choose from with all their own strengths and weaknesses and varied playstyles with each one. My only gripe with the game is the online. I hear some people find matches no problem however on the other hand, I hear people who can never find people online to play with. In my experience, I've only found 1 person to play with and the match was plagued with network issues. Online mode is hit or miss. I suggest picking this game up with a friend if you're into playing online.\n\n8.5/10","June 25, 2014","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Some days I would have no difficulties connecting and would not drop lobbies at all so the connection quality does vary. If you look past those difficulties it's a great game for the price and if you're looking to use a game controller (which this does support :] ) in any games this one is definitely worth a try.","June 10, 2015","true","11.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics and characters all look great, they move smoothly and combat seems to run at a normal pace. Its not super fast like the new Street Fighter. The fighters attacks arn't difficult to execute. A lot of them seem to share the same button patterns although they preform different attacks. This helps minimize the amount of codes needed to learn.\n\nI like the combos also. Granted their not very long (mostly 3 hits). Some can be easily chained together with special moves (like freeze ball or scorpions chain) without needing to study the move list. For longer combos you will need to find your fighters 'pop up' attacks. Pop them into the air with a basic attack or special move then lead into a combo.\n\nThey have added a "power bar" at the bottom that fills when you take damage. The same as in Street Fighter X Tekken. or Naruto Shippuden: Ninja Revolution. Although limited It does add a slight compliment to the gameplay. It allows you to: Power up special moves (3 times per round), Break combos (2 times), and use a super special move X-ray attacks (once per round). Energy does carry to the next round.\n\nThe X-ray attack does ~33% a health bar (roughly 2 combos). They do come with an awesome cinematic scenes of you smashing your opponents bones to bits but only 1 x-ray cinematic per fighter. They can give you a good advantage but note that most x-rays can easily be blocked.\n\nThere are 5+ modes you can play but I won't go over all of them. The Story mode is fun and gives you some background info on some of the charecters incase your new. It very roughly if not at all follows Mortal Kombat's original story. The difficulty gets unconsistently hard.\n\nLadder is like the original arcade mode, here you face 10 opponents. All but the top 3 are randomly chosen. As with the story I feel the AI difficulty isn't very consistent here eather. They grow hard very quickly. Also if your matched against the same character your using it can be difficult to tell you and your opponent apart. Your opponents costume will be only slightly off color.\n\nThere are a lot of unlockables; You open them with coins that you get from playing the game. The only ones worth mentioning really are: extra character costumes and extra fatailites! They've also included character costumes from the original Mortal Komabats!! (MK1 to MK3) For those nostalgic players that miss those sweet threads.\n\nLasty and most importantly the Fatality! You won't be dissapointed here. Each fighter has a handfull of finishing moves that are each unique and all so very gorey. They go cinamaticly way beyond the super special moves (X-ray attacks) I mentioned earlier.\n\nSo in conclusion this definitely is a great game and solid 'Fighter' for anyone looking for that genre. You will want to use a controller to play this; I had no need to remap any of the default buttons. You can remap up to 4 different ingame configs for a 4-player battle if needed.","December 7, 2013","true","39.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I recommend playing with xbox or pc controller. Back round Story\n\nis good, but the story mode sucks. Its  cheesy and you start fights for no reason, kinda funny at times. Considering this is\n\na fighting game you would expect the mechanics to be good, but for this game...the fighting is way better than good. Its\n\nrewarding to crush your foes with the X-ray attacks crushing their bones and ripping their flesh, especially the ones who\n\nhave been kicking your ♥♥♥ 10 times in a row.(Words cant describe that feeling you get when this happens) The fatalities\n\nare fun and I like how the character models get bloody and scared up.(first mortal kombat game ive played other than\n\nMortal Kombat Sholin Monks). Multiplayer is typical, go 1v1 with a friend or random opponent. Or do tag team with\n\nfriends, although I havent tried this, Ive read online that you can only do tag team online on a local computer(meaning\n\nyou and your buddy play on the same pc) so you cant have your friend who lives in florida play with you while you live\n\nsomewhere else. Just somthing important to mention, although I could be wrong. They also have ranked, king of the hill,\n\nand im sure some others I cant think of .The graphics are ok, and the voice acting is ok. If you really enjoy the Mortal\n\nKombat series then defenitly get this, even people who are new to the series can get into this game.

Some days I would have no difficulties connecting and would not drop lobbies at all so the connection quality does vary.

This is a reinvention and celebration of all that was and is good about the glory days of ye olde Mortal Kombat. The goofy kung-fu-movie camp vibe is still there in full force, and now the gameplay is good. The combat is weighty, visceral and satsifying, and the control is well-behaved. Very little AI ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to be had here, either. Losing to a computer opponent usually leaves me feeling like I lost to something a particularly competent human could have done, not to HAL9000 reading a human button input cheat sheet. This is especially true of the bosses, who are actually now a fun and well-designed challenge instead of an under-the-table deal to make people break their controllers and buy new ones. Yeah, they still do cheap stuff now and again, but overall I've had very little anger towards this game. The presentation is completely outstanding, and everything about the game shows that the creators really wanted to make it as good as it could be, like they owed it to the fans and the characters. _Even Stryker is kind of cool_.\n\nChallenge Tower mode and Story Mode are somewhat less satisfying than regular old Arcade Ladder mode, admittedly. The story's worth doing, but the fights are  less fun and the cutscenes can't be skipped. Challenge Tower at least frequently mixes up the action with wacky circumstances found nowhere else in the game, so that's something, but usually I'm just content to do Arcade. Also there's a tag team ladder mode where your partner, assuming he's conscious and alive, can hop onscreen and do a special move, or even tag in with one. It's pretty well thought out. In any case, even if I'm not doing well, I always have a good time with it, which puts it way, way ahead of a certain other street fightery franchise whose name eludes me.\n\nNow, to examine as a PC port: It looks like you're given plenty of freedom to tinker with graphics options so you can throttle it down, which I guess is all you really need to know. But the game is pretty 'puter heavy, as I expected. I'm running it at 1280x800 with pretty much all of the optional settings turned off, and I've got disappointingly muddy textures (which were gorgeous on the PS3, like you can even see the realistic brushed-metal texture on the cyborgs) and considerable frame rate jank, which surprisingly doesn't really affect my gameplay though.\n\nThat's about the worst thing I have to say. It's attractive and violent and exciting and just a good old time. Do it.","September 27, 2014","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Before motion capture, Boon and Tobias actually shot the characters of the game with actors on a blue screen and despite a limited number of sprites, created the most realistic fighting game at the time and kept making it as violent as they could. MK was the pioneer for over the top finishing moves (before every other fighting game started doing them) and all your favorite characters are back for the slaughterfest. I don't care too much for the new comic book like graphic style but the story mode takes you through all the events of the 3 tournaments in a fun 12 hour ride - even without the fatalities (they are disabled in this mode so that you can have several fights with the same opponent at different times with different characters or maybe just to make it more PG 13). The gameplay is pretty much the same except for the addition of the special move meter that gives you more powerful versions of your usual weapon of choise and the bone breaking X-ray combos.\nIt's also interesting to see how the design of the characters have evolved, the first games were obviously limited by the number of cast, costumes and props (hence Sub-zero, Scorpion, Reptile, Smoke etc... where the same except for their colour, just like Kitana, Mileena and Jade) and I'm actually looking forward to seeing each ending for each character as their genesis is nicely exposed in story mode (I've always been a fan of Kabal and I thought it was interesting to have him born there like the joker). It makes me wanna watch those cheesy MK movies all over again... Or better yet, the web series MK: Legacy!","June 28, 2015","true","39.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's affordable and is not too heavy on graphics for all of my fellow Intel Graphics noobs yet it has stunning visuals for 2011. This game is still relevant and my friends and I enjoy playing it. The online portion however is broken to the max. You can only play with another player through slow-connection lobbies that I found myself dropping in and out of often. Some days I would have no difficulties connecting and would not drop lobbies at all so the connection quality does vary. If you look past those difficulties it's a great game for the price and if you're looking to use a game controller (which this does support :] ) in any games this one is definitely worth a try.","June 10, 2015","true","11.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Realizing this is literally a franchise killer, midway evolves in to Netherrealm studios, showing their determination to all that they will never let Mortal Kombat truly die. They decide to literally rewind the screw up, and redo the story without changing it too much.\n\nThe Kombat: Basically, improved MK3. Same general fighting mechanics but more fluid, satisfying and easier to control without throwing dollars worth of quarters in to an arcade machine.\n\nThe Gameplay: Works great. You can actually play the game *COUGH* MKX *COUGH*.\n\nSadly, the kombat in mkx is still better than mk9, so this game really only holds well if you are new to the mortal kombat franchise and want to learn the story. If you already know the story of mortal kombat, MKX will make this one obsolete IF it is ever fixed to the point that it is playable.\n\nBasically, buy this if its on sale. Maybe mkx isn't doing it for you, or you miss your favorite character. Or you want a refresh of the story. It is fun, just feels more dated since fighting games have taken some huge leaps forward since this game came out.","May 12, 2015","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Before motion capture, Boon and Tobias actually shot the characters of the game with actors on a blue screen and despite a limited number of sprites, created the most realistic fighting game at the time and kept making it as violent as they could. MK was the pioneer for over the top finishing moves (before every other fighting game started doing them) and all your favorite characters are back for the slaughterfest. I don't care too much for the new comic book like graphic style but the story mode takes you through all the events of the 3 tournaments in a fun 12 hour ride - even without the fatalities (they are disabled in this mode so that you can have several fights with the same opponent at different times with different characters or maybe just to make it more PG 13). The gameplay is pretty much the same except for the addition of the special move meter that gives you more powerful versions of your usual weapon of choise and the bone breaking X-ray combos.\nIt's also interesting to see how the design of the characters have evolved, the first games were obviously limited by the number of cast, costumes and props (hence Sub-zero, Scorpion, Reptile, Smoke etc... where the same except for their colour, just like Kitana, Mileena and Jade) and I'm actually looking forward to seeing each ending for each character as their genesis is nicely exposed in story mode (I've always been a fan of Kabal and I thought it was interesting to have him born there like the joker). It makes me wanna watch those cheesy MK movies all over again... Or better yet, the web series MK: Legacy!","June 28, 2015","true","39.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Realizing this is literally a franchise killer, midway evolves in to Netherrealm studios, showing their determination to all that they will never let Mortal Kombat truly die. They decide to literally rewind the screw up, and redo the story without changing it too much.\n\nThe Kombat: Basically, improved MK3. Same general fighting mechanics but more fluid, satisfying and easier to control without throwing dollars worth of quarters in to an arcade machine.\n\nThe Gameplay: Works great. You can actually play the game *COUGH* MKX *COUGH*.\n\nSadly, the kombat in mkx is still better than mk9, so this game really only holds well if you are new to the mortal kombat franchise and want to learn the story. If you already know the story of mortal kombat, MKX will make this one obsolete IF it is ever fixed to the point that it is playable.\n\nBasically, buy this if its on sale. Maybe mkx isn't doing it for you, or you miss your favorite character. Or you want a refresh of the story. It is fun, just feels more dated since fighting games have taken some huge leaps forward since this game came out.","May 12, 2015","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yes, but definetly not at full price\n\nGore is the only thing going for this game.\n\nCharacter diversity, many of the female fighters are wearing the same clothes only difference one is pink, one is blue, one is blue one is black with white hair.... Male characters are pretty much the same, one in yellow with fire powers, one in blue with ice powers, one in black with shadow power, the other kind of male characters are the cyborgs pretty similar to each others\n\nYou need to charge yourself before being able to counter the opponent attacks (breaker), many character have more or less the same moves.\n\nMultiplayer is broken, AI is really basic mostly doing the same few moves and only blocking. Instead of making the final ennemies being decent fighter they went for the simplicity of making your guard not working against them.\n\nIt's a decent game but poor fighting game.\n\nThe different modes:\n\nStory\nLadder (Arcade)\nTag Ladder\nMultiplayer\nChallenge Tower\n\nBuy it if you want to enjoy the MK universe, the fatalities but wait for sale and don't except a Hof fighting game, even the  old Street Fighters or Tekken were more original than this one.","April 14, 2015","true","28.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

(6/10) Overall.\nI recommend Mortal Kombat X.\n\nStoryline - Intresting and fun to play but lack of replayability (6/10)\nGraphics - Colourful , Weather Effects , Beautiful Areas , Well made character models (6/10)\nCharacters - Around 15 if I'm not mistaken, plux 5 more with the update.\nMany moves to learn, combos, finishing moves.. You can even change their outfits (7/10)\nCombat - Fluent combat , chain combos, learn all your fav char moves by looking in the "Moves List". (7/10)\nMultiplayer - Ranked matches , Player matches ,King Of The Hill match. Can get you busy if you're playing with friends, even tho there is NO coop at all and when I say "busy" I mean for atleast 3-4 hours max each day. (4/10)\n\nReplayability - Only while playing ladders (tournaments). Or playing with friends over multiplayer. (3/5)\nEnjoyment - It is fun but I'm not feeling it after few hours of gametime. (2/5)\nFrustration - Getting kicked in the ♥♥♥ by 3000/1000 (win/lose) stats players in Player Matches.\nAnd also this game NEEDS co-op.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VampireBunny/recommended/237110/","VampireBunny","Sleepy Head","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VampireBunny/","143 products in account","First off, the critisisms. 6/10. Barely passing but not terrible.\nThis game is Mortal Kombat in all it's gorey glory. Don't be fooled by the promises of a full story because that story is a series of pre-rendered (That are lower quality and resolution than the actual game) cut scenes following a story that holds up like wet tissue paper. Beyond the lack of substance in the story the fights in it consist of fighting 1, 2, and at one point 3 enemies with bosses splashed in because they don't want you getting bored. The first few fights with each new character, you go through most of the popular cast, you will spend getting beaten to a pulp until you learn each new characters move set. Once you get comfortable with that character you fight a boss and are immediatly put in the shoes of a new fighter. By the end of the game *spoiler* you have to fight Shao Kahn *spoiler end* who has unblockable attacks, armored animations, and who takes 40% damage on everything you do. Your best move, the x-ray animation, does 20% of his health at best.\n\nIn summary of the story, you get what you'd expect from a Mortal Kombat story. The worst parts are the terrible audio/visual effects in the cutscenes for the story and the final boss fight. You might be saying 'But the final boss fight is SUPPOSED to be hard!' and you'd be right. Hard is what it should be. Damn near unwinnable on Normal difficulty is a design flaw not a feature. The fights inbetween the start of the train wreck and the end are pretty easy. You'll find 1 or 2 super moves you like and spam them until your (quarter circle back) motion is flawless.\n\nWith all that said I still recommend this game because it IS Mortal Kombat. The Ladder is still alot of fun and if you beat it you get a nice little ending cutscene for that character.(sadly better than the whole story mode) The challenge tower will give you something new to do once you've beaten the Ladder on your favorite characters. Instead of the usual 'Female Ninja #1 and #2' style of female characters each one has it's own unique skillset that FEELS unique. The graphics in the fights look pretty great *story mode cutscenes not withstanding*. Most importantly the skill sets are all easy to learn but hard to master. You'll get the hang of your favorite character pretty fast and the more technical skills of each character will take you ages to land everytime. You know, like the old Arcade game we all loved? You're given a move list but it's not easy-mode.\n\nBuy this game on sale and enjoy seeing your favorite character rend flesh from bone or turn your opponent into a baby. It's Mortal Kombat. If you're looking for a good story in your fighting game... try something else.","June 20, 2014","true","28.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The one thing that was a suprise icing on the cake however is the challenge tower!\n\nChallenge tower is fun!\n\nThe challenge tower is actually pretty fun, it constantly mixes up the things so it doesn’t really become repetitive while slowly incrementing its difficulty. While the difficulty will feel fluctuated between challenges at times since the challenges are very varied, it does maintain the feeling of progression fairly well.\n\nArcade Mode\n\nArcade mode is exactly what you would expect of any other fighter game, having a ending for each character that is tailored for them.

The story mode is actually quite fun and entertaining aside from the hideous cutscenes (♥♥♥♥♥♥ console resolution ported to PC). Raiden pulls what is commonly known as a "Star Trek" style reboot by traveling back in time, a la Spock to restart all the somewhat convoluted plot of the original games. This was an amazing idea, the plot is easily accessible to everybody even if you have no idea what a "Cyrax" is (like me).\n\nThe fighting is elegant in its simplicity, instead of complicated combos like many 2D fighting games, the game only gives you a few special moves and combination attacks exclusive to each character. This means the combat actually plays out like a challenging mind game, which is what fighting games are really all about, versus complicated button presses.\n\nThe animation and overall graphical presentation is impressive, the brutal X-Ray moves are wonderfully violent, and each character reeks of personality. The amount of blood that gets splattered during fights is ridiculously over the top and awesome. The characters also get pretty messed up and sustain horribly disfiguring wounds throughout the rounds, which is an nice touch. I haven't gotten to get the multiplayer to work yet, which is a huge bummer because I want to get my ♥♥♥ kicked online by other people and not just the A.I., but for single player and local, this is a great old school fighting game!\n\nP.S.

Most of the characters seems very balance and with a cool, "no spam the same ability twice rule" in the game. This game feels rewarding when you win the ladders, and challenging as ever of a finale boss. The story is decent,  but the game is still fun to play at its core. Which is the reason it kept me playing throughout the campaign. I couldn't really see much replayability in the story, but hey that's not what's important in the game anyway. 4 player co-op./competive play is also a a joy to have. It is real fun to get that, "console expirence" in a game like this.

Probably has something to do with all those quarters I sunk into that arcade cabinet years ago.\n\nThis game is everything Mortal Kombat ever was... violent, gorey and brutally satisfying.

It takes us back to the original game and starts afresh from there. Things will seem familiar but not quiet the same and this applies to the story, controls and style in general.\nWith the dawn of Mortal Kombat X in a few days, I thought it would be a good idea to take a look at 9 as X is meant to continue directly from the end of this. But with X out in just days, is 9 still relevant? Lets find out.\n\nStory:\nMortal Kombat 9 starts by pretty much killing the whole cast of characters, but Raiden manages to send a message back in time to his former self. This means you start the game at the time of Mortal Kombat 1, this is a great idea as it means you can revisit all those old areas from Mortal Kombat history. I really enjoyed the story line and how subtle changes to the time line changed bigger things farther down the line, it means even though your covering old ground its still fresh and new.\nBut unfortunatly even with this reinvention it still remains a needlessly complicated and over the top story. Mortal Kombat has always sported a overly cheesy and over blown story line, 9 doesn’t change this or even try to. But if you enjoy the Mortal Kombat plots of old you’ll be right at home here, and thankfully they have left out much of the later history where things became really strained.\n\nGameplay:\nThis is perhaps the most well put together Mortal Kombat to date, the combo system is far more advanced and natural than any of its predecessors. The fights flow nicely and there is a real element of skill here, you can’t button bash and hope for the best. The game though rendered in 3D is played on a 2D plain, much like Street Fighter 4 but this works well adding beautiful detail to characters but retaining the traditional style of previous Mortal Kombat games. We are also give a super move meter like other fighters, this lets you perform more powerful versions of your special moves and when fully charged X-ray moves. These are a brutal sequence of moves that not only greatly damage your opponent but also offer some bone breaking visuals to go with it.\nOne other mode that’s also been introduced is the new tag battles, this allows you to pick two fighters and change between them at any time. Even in the middle of combos you can tag in your second character, or if you wish they can jump in for a second to assist then return off screen. It’s a nice addition, but hardly an original one.\n\nPresentation:\nThe graphics are really nice, they walk a fine line between realistic and cartoon like, this is a good thing as some of the fatality’s might become difficult to watch if they became too realistic. The 3D models are fantastically detailed and the animation is smooth, they really have worked hard on these characters.\nThe stages are interesting and though old settings, are kept fresh by the 3D re-imagining. One of the really enjoyable parts of Mortal Kombat 9 is travelling the old setting that feel so familiar, but at the same time completely new as well. This really deserves credit as to achieve this without losing the original feeling is no mean feat and though the graphic of X maybe far superior, 9 is still a good looking title in its own right.\n\nSee this and more reviews at http://www.cyberusuk.com","April 9, 2015","true","11.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game is full of content and the gameplay is very good and fun. You have classic arcade non canon ladder where you fight seven opponents and then three boss fights (Shang Tsung, Goro or Kintaro and then Shao ♥♥♥♥ing Khan) to unlock individual character ending, you have tag battles (2v2), test your might, sight and strike, you have an awesome 300 stage challenge tower where every battle have some different stipulation, you have all sort of extra content to unlock in crypt (costumes, fan art, pictures, music...). The game also has an awesome roster where you have every favorite character you like from MK1, MK2, MK3 and the guest character Freddy Krueger. Story mods takes you from events from MK1 to MK3 with an awesome story starter and awesome story in general. The story mods is like four hour long but if you take story mod on expert that changes to around 5-6 hours. The game lacks good online (laggy as hell) and sadly the game is dead on PC and also the game has balance problems sadly.\nMK9 maybe isn't the best fighting game out their but MK9 has something special in it that is making you play it no matter why, where or when.\nThe game is worty to buy and I would recommend it to any fighting game enthusiast.\n\nMy rating is 8/10\n\np.s.

When i got a chance to go to a local arcade that we had in the mall they had MK4 and i played that for countless hours and built local rivalries. After midway collapsed i was in fear that my two favorite game series Mortal Kombat and Gauntlet would never be the same. Well i can say at the time of writing this review both series are still alive and kicking. Mortal Kombat 9 is the best mortal kombat ive played since deadly alliance. All the characters that you would expect to be here are and there are some pretty cool new ones also. Unfortuantly this game on pc is held down big time by a feature that should never have been put in the game and thats region locked servers. I live in the us which means i can only play with people in my country and well it is really hard to find a match at any other time then the weekend. There is however a fix for this u can change your steam download region to russia central which is overflowing with players. So at this point your thinking if theres a fix why is he complaining at all. Ah well let me tell you with me being in the us the russia servers lag almost the whole time and can affect a match to the point where the better player loses because his combos dont register or register late. I give MK9 a solid 10/10 for local and tournament play but if your gonna play MK9 online you might not wanna buy it and  thats why the steam version is on its finish him sequence waiting to have sub zero rip its spine out so it gets a 5/10.

The environments are also fantastic recreations of areas from MK 1-3, complete with stage fatalities. The only issue I have with the character designs this time around is that it is very clear that each humanoid male and female character all use the same underlying body model with the same normal map applied, some have variants like Johnny cages tattoos, but it is a shame we don’t see much variation in musculature and body proportion. This complaint it most apparent when looking at the female character models that show allot of their body, I understand that this may have been done to synergies the animation transitions and hit reactions with each characters rig but more body type variation would have gone a long way in hiding this minor gripe.\n\nThis edition contains all of the DLC characters that were released; the additional PS3 character Kratos is nowhere to be seen however due to that consoles exclusivity. The DLC characters themselves are great additions to the game, unique MK characters that may have been forgotten about are brought back in a great way here with unique move sets and fatalities. The only out of place character that falls short for me was the addition of Freddy Kruger, some say he fits in with the MK universe well but I don’t agree, his move set isn’t that interesting at all and for being a famous horror movie slasher villain his fatalities are quite rubbish.\n\nAside from having fantastic brutal combat and finishing moves, this game also gives you so much to do, various modes extend the lifespan of the game and the kyrpt contains hundreds of fantastic unlockables.\n\nIf you’re an MK fan like myself this is a must have, if you’re a fighting game fan I would also say it’s a must have.\n","November 24, 2014","true","22.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The fighters get battered, bruised and show physical blood scars during the course of Kombat which adds immersion into the violent bouts.\n\nFatality`s look stunning and are even more creative as the camera pans to give the best angles to showcase gruesome victory`s.\n\nWith loads of characters, arenas (love those stage fatality arenas), moves, content, blood and guts (loads of it) this game is fantastic value. You are garunteed to come back again and again for more kombat violence.\n\nFully recommend it!","February 1, 2014","true","5.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Here it is and here it is in my Steam library. I'm fortunate enough to play many games on my computer through the use of my 360 wireless controller, so that control aspect isn't a hurdle for me. Yet there seems to be an issue with the in-game cutscenes being rendered in low resolution despite the rest of the non-cutscene game being rendered with the in-game engine. There's no shortage of torrents you can find that have the high quality cutscenes ripped from the PS3 version of the game in 720p, thoguh. Otherwise, the rest of the game plays flawless and doesn't feel like a console port in the sense of lackluster functionality or bugs. Lots of content to keep one going for an MK game and probably the best one I've ever bought.\n\nI've mostly been hammering away at the story mode and the challenge tower and those alone are enough to scrape a good 20-30 hours out of. The game doesn't feel grindey at all and in this version you get all the DLC up front and don't even have to worry about unlocking any characters (except for achievements sake).\n\nThe online play is quite good, but like all fighting games long after release, gravely underpopulated. Unless you can find a good steam group or group of people that schedule times to play together, don't bother with the online part of the game.","November 26, 2013","true","33.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This also doesn't seem to happen to everyone - either you're lucky or you aren't, as well as it seems to fix itself randomly as you play. It's been almost 5 months since the game came out - there hasn't been a single patch and WB doesn't seem to care. Despite all that, you could be one of the lucky ones who doesn't have any problems with the game - apart from the framerate issue I haven't really had anything else - the game doesn't crash nor freeze.\n\nI still recommend it, and when (if) they finally patch it, it'll definitely be a must-buy. Oh, and one of the biggest pluses in my book - block is a separate button rather than holding back.","November 25, 2013","true","161.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The story wasn't the original, but still, it was nice and i don't mind they've changed it a little bit.\n\nI also would love to see more fighters in the roster (Shinnok, Reiko, Shao Kahn, Kintaro, etc.), and maybe more costumes, for example i love quan chi alot, but i can't stand any of his costumes, he's just.. i don't know.. His MK4 costume was the best in all MK games ever made.\nOne more thing i would love to see in the game, custom music, sorry, but at the point of fighting music you didn't do a great job, i like to get pumped by some nice songs while fighting.\nAgain, overall this game is great, but it needs some little adjustments and also they really need to fix Online Mode since it's pretty muh unplayable.\n\n6/10 (Only because of online mode and maybe because of the poorly-developed AI).\nGet this game if you don't mind the problem about playing online, it's worth it, tho i hope and believe they will fix online mode soon, i wanna fight!!\n\n","October 4, 2013","true","33.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rheostat/recommended/237110/","rheostat","bfRheostat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rheostat/","940 products in account","Game is good. Except performance problems.\n\nSome people say that Mortal Kombat demands a lot of hardware power (especially GPU) but i don't believe that's the reason of frame rate drops/slow motion. I've already tried it on lowest settings, nothing has changed. I mean nothing. Some stages has problems. Time by time stage and character combination causes slow motion problem as well. I don't know the reason but it seems like developer never fixed it.\n\nA THEORY ABOUT PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS\n\nI spent significant time on UnrealEd 2.0. It was the very first Unreal Engine but it had that kind of problem as well. If you use a lot of geometry brushes on a specific scene, while you're looking that scene, frame rate extremely drops and never increase until you stop looking there. Even if you're playing that game/map (i.e. Unreal Tournament map) on your current generation PC, you'll experience frame drops. Maybe that's the reason. I don't know how latest UnrealEd and Unreal Engine 3 works but as i see before, the logic behind it wasn't so different.\n\nOTHER PROBLEMS\n\nOnline mode has frame drops as well. Because of that, it's unplayable. Also, especially in recent 5 years, most of developers insist to use ping meters. Unfortunately, they are useless. Please show us ping values as digits. In addition, that would be great to see other players' countries as in Street Fighter IV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nSo, you might want to think about PC port of the Mortal Kombat before buying. Playstation 3 version had no problems, it also includes Kratos as a playable character. So, you might want to grab a console version instead of this one.","June 12, 2014","false","6.2"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

It's a terrible, terrible console port, you're not even allowed to use a mouse to navigate the menus. In addition to a terrible console port, it has to STUPIDEST control scheme, luckily you can re-bind it, but it still uses the stupid control scheme to navigate the menus. The game also has to change the controls THREE TIMES. The arrow keys and enter to navigate the menu, and once you get into a game it uses the WASD keys and G to select. And then, once you start playing, it swaps to the controls I set so they weren't stupid, which is the arrow keys and ZXCVB as attacks. And this isn't even into the game yet. So, in this game the main way of combat is combos, but the combos are so unresponsive. You have to press the buttons quickly, but if you're too quick one of the keys won't get registered so you just do a basic punch or kick insted of what you tried to do. So they messed up the main way of fighting. The games singleplayer is also very, very dull. I won on expert by just pushing the AI in a corner and button mashing. The only enjoyment I got was from me fighting someone I have over Skype, but even then the enjoyment came us not playing it right. The game is also not noob-friendly. If you're new and are playing as a character you've never played as and don't know any of their combos, guess what? Too bad, the multiplayer community don't give a crap, so you might as well commit suicide. If you like button mashing, crappy console ports, and hostile communities, then pick this game up. Anyone else, avoid this game at all costs.","August 7, 2014","false","7.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But some things make this story really interesting. Nine of the most interesting (and sometimes bizarre and a bit silly) points highlighted below.\n\n2 Ed Boon (Ed Boon) and John Tobias (John Tobias), the creators of the video game series Mortal Kombat, initially wanted to create a fighting game in which the player is to be the main actor Jean-Claude Van Damme (Jean-Claude Van Damme). But this did not happen. The only echo of the model Jean-Claude became a character in the game with the name of John Cage (Johnny Cage).\n\n3 When Mortal Kombat just left in the distant 1990s, a lot of parents, politicians and clerics rebelled against violence in games. In the end, the Great Congress gave in and put an ultimatum to Nintendo, Sega and other gaming companies: either they introduced the age rating of a game, or not released at all. The result was a national "Pact ratings of video games" of 1994. But, fortunately, the game industry has prevailed and persuaded to establish its own evaluation system ESRB or Entertainment Software Rating Board.\n\n4 The comedy duo Smosh Internet became famous on YouTube thanks to high scores lime-sinhovyh video about "Power Rangers" and "Pokemon." One of the first successes of the guys became a well-known movie about Mortal Kombat, which, incidentally, is almost 20000000 hits on this day. Smosh become certain "pioneers YouTube". At the time of publication of the video on video hosting servers were very little content. This is after the portal has earned his millions.\n\n5 Poor Australian gamers. It is not that they get new games a month later someone else, and that their governments carefully "monitor" the different editions of the game content. They are not confined rated "R18 +", and went on. From now on, the penalty for possession, sale or purchase of Mortal Kombat in Australia is $ 110,000.\n\n6 When Mortal Kombat developers have almost finished the game, they did not have the slightest idea how to call it. Some titles, definitely provoked caustic ridicule by colleagues from the gaming industry.\n\n- In general, the sixth of eight months of work on Mortal Kombat, we did not know what to call him. We sat in my office and just started writing everything vzbredet our heads. The most long-playing title was "Dragon Attack" and "Death Blow". And once we even really decided to call the game "Fatality", - said Ed Boon in one of his interview with IGN.\n\n7 If you were a popular franchise of the 1990s, then you probably would have descendants on TV as some musical adaptations. Mortal Kombat was no exception, but he was cool dance moves, laser beams, and insanely popular on the Pacific coast.\n\n8 When the first movie about Mortal Kombat has collected a huge box office in theaters, shooting the sequel did not make fans wait a long time. Despite the success of the first two parts, plans and rumors about the third part of the movie about a deadly tournament for a long time, flying over the Internet. Today, the release date of the film on IMDB in 2013 looks at least very attractive.\n\n9 Despite the quality of the series, Mortal Kombat: Conquest is remembered for a long time. At least, because it was one of the first TV series about a video game, broadcast on the Internet. Of course, it came just 22 episodes and all ended terrible ending "all die", but downloads it still outperforms MK: Annihilation.\n\nfacts from site - http://gotps3.ru/article/9_interesnyh_faktov_o_mortal_kombat-220411/","January 12","true","2.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/anema86/recommended/237110/","anema86","Anema86","http://steamcommunity.com/id/anema86/","71 products in account","A worthy successor to Mortal Kombat 2. I don't know about anything released between 1994 and this one, though...\n\nThat's meant to be cute, but it's also true. The last Mortal Kombat I played for any notable length of time was MK2, though I played MK Trilogy once or twice, and I even owned MK Deception--I think. It had a Kustom Fighter feature. Whichever one that was. It wasn't very good. There was some other one I played with a group of friends shortly after it released on Xbox back when I was in high school, but I'll be damned if I remember anything about that except that we decided the initials "DS" on one of the coffins we opened must have stood for "Dumb ♥♥♥♥."\n\nAnyway. The game.\n\nAlthough my artistic soul dies a little inside every time I see a reboot, and although I don't see how the 360/PS3 generation of consoles was anything but the "We ♥♥♥♥ed up gaming, so let's press the Reset Button and start over with everything" generation, a few of the reboots actually came out pretty good. No, I'm not talking about Tomb Raider.\n\nMortal Kombat 2011 is a good game because it's self-aware. It knows exactly what it is. It's a game about ninjas and 3/4-naked beautiful women inflicting gratuitous violence upon one another. That's what MK2011 set out to be, that's what it is, and it works. It's fun to stab Shao Kahn through the eyeballs with my dagger fans. Is it going to win any storytelling awards? Does it really introduce anything new to the series? Does it provide much for the single-player to do? The answer to all these questions is "No," but that's why the PC version is the superior version--that and because it's hard to tell the difference between the PC version of this on Max settings at 1920x1080 and the PS4 version of Mortal Kombat X. We also have... drum roll... free online multiplayer. I've always found the idea of paying for an online service with Sony and Microsoft to be a really strange idea; can you imagine how that would go over with PC gamers? We'd revolt. Just imagine Valve saying that. "We've decided that henceforth there will be a $9.99 per month service charge to play online and--" <Bricks crash through windows> "--Please excuse that guy. We were just firing him. What he MEANT to say is that online multiplayer is free and will remain free."\n\nYou've probably noticed that this review doesn't say much about Mortal Kombat. I ramble a lot, but Mortal Kombat doesn't really give me a great deal to say. It looks great, it sounds great, it generally functions--that r6025 error may bite you in the ♥♥♥ if you're unlucky enough to encounter it as I was--and it does what Mortal Kombat games should do: give me a fan made up of daggers and let me use it to slice people's heads off. Why are you still reading? Go chop people's heads off; it's great.\n\nI wouldn't recommend paying more than $7 for this, though. You're not going to get a ton of enjoyment out of it. I haven't played online yet, because I'm fairly certain that matches will play out like this: Match begins. I get my ♥♥♥ kicked. Match ends.\n\nI don't like story modes that don't let me pick my character. That was my number one complaint with Injustice. I don't WANT to play as Johnny Cage or Jax. I WANT to play as Kitana. I kinda feel like every character should have their own campaign in story mode, and I honestly don't think that's so much to ask. Maybe trim down the roster a bit, too. Half of these characters wouldn't be missed by more than 0.1% of people\n\nThe tournament mode for Kitana ends by saying that "after Shao Kahn's betrayal..." My girlfriend was watching the latter half of the matches, and asked if she missed something. I shook my head and replied, "I have no idea what they're talking about." So I went into Kitana's bio to read about Shao Kahn's betrayal, and there was nothing there, either, that really counted as a betrayal. Hey, Netherealm Studios--if you're going to reboot a series, maybe not make it so that understanding what happens requires pre-existing knowledge of the series. That IS the point of a reboot, after all, to reset the entry level back down to 0. Until I read Kitana's bio, I had no idea she was Kahn's daughter. That's a really sloppy "reboot".\n\nAnd it's not really a reboot, is it? It's more like Mortal Kombat 8.5 or whatever number it should be, but the developers were lazy and decided to just rehash the plot from the first Mortal Kombat. Or second one; I'm not sure. It doesn't matter, because the plot doesn't matter, but if you're going to throw in character motivations, it would be a good idea to throw in enough of the backstory for it to make sense.\n\nSo. Score.\n\nOne Mileena out of ten Kitanas.","November 28, 2015","true","12.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","1"

The game supports a gamepad which certainly makes things easier, but the keyboard controls aren't bad either if you remap some to suit you; just note that the game has no mouse support, even in menus, and a couple instances where the on-screen display shows your custom keys but only reacts to the default keys. Still, definitely worth a purchase for fans of the fighting genre or Mortal Kombat.","June 5, 2014","true","8.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

FYI, co-op is local only, not online.\n\nI'm not the best at fighting games, I'm some what of a decent player, know a few combos to be dangerous kind of guy. I beat most of my friends or if not, it is a fair fight. Go online with random people, get slaughtered if you are unlucky enough to find someone playing. The online mode is region locked so it makes it really hard to find someone to fight.\n\nSingle player is a giant troll. If you're a moderate player such as myself, you will rage. No questions asked. The boss fights are cheap and I felt the only way to beat them was to constantly use the same combo over and over again. I was playing on medium too! Even when I changed the difficulty down to easy on the last two chapters I had to use cheap moves cause the bosses still whooped me.","January 9, 2014","false","16.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/airloafz/recommended/237110/","airloafz","airloaf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/airloafz/","264 products in account","Mortal Kombat Komplete Edition(aka. Mortal Kombat 9) is just like any other Mortal Kombat. This works in its favor, but it also hinders its playability. Since this version of Mortal Kombat is newer than other installments it has perfected almost every game mechanic to a point where if you want to do a special move you will do it or when you want to do a fatality it will work. In other installments, such as Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance, this was such a hassle. However I find that going to a fatality for the first time requires a tutorial since the directions will be saying "Jump","Varies" and "Sweep". If you are new to the Mortal Kombat series you will need a tutorial. Luckly this version of Mortal Kombat has its own tutorial section. I found it helpful to figure out new things in MK such as X-Ray attacks and Tag Team Attacks. Overall Mortal Kombat Komplete Edition has improved on almost every aspect of the game, but it is not perfect. I can't help but feel that this game is too slow for me. Other versions of Mortal Kombat such as Deadly Alliance and Deception felt more fast paced than this. Also the new game mechanics don't feel as satisfying to me than in the other two games, but the X-Ray attacks feels very satisfying to me. Finally i feel the game is harder than the other games and the blocking mechanic is not as good as the other versions'. Overall it is an amazing sequel that has created a sense of nostalgia. Similar to Armageddon and Deception the story mode is cheap and gives the game a little more replayability. Although this story mode did it right by taking out the adventuring and went straight to the combat and main idea of Mortal Kombat.","June 25, 2014","true","18.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

It's like a throwback to Mortal Kombat II, but updated to today's generation.  The graphics are amazing and the characters getting damaged as they fight is such a great feature.  The Komplete Edition comes with all the DLC except for Kratos (PS3 Only.)  I recommend checking it out if you're a fighting game fan or just remember playing the originals.","August 5, 2013","true","25.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
