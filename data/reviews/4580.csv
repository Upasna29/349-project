This game is by far the best Dawn of War game to date, including Dawn of War 2 and its expansions. If you're an RTS fan, there is little here not to like. (Also, you don't need to own the original Dawn of War OR Winter Assault to enjoy this game)\n\nThe gameplay is simple and very fun, you start out with a base and a builder unit, you proceed to make buildings filling various roles such as research, unit creation, and defense. You proceed to make a base and units to defend yourself, and you eventually attack the enemy. You have two resources, power and requisition, power is used for vehicles, upgrades and research, requisition is used for everything. Requisition is easy to get, just capture points across the map and fortify them with listening posts. Power requires you to create power generators, but bases have a limited amount.\n\nCampaign is simple, you pick a race, and you are given a map divided into territories, each territory is provides you honor guard (Elite units to defend your commander) and a planetary requisition bonus (to buy honor guards or defenses for territories, or buildings if you get a specific plot of land) The map is turn based, with you and the 6 other AI going to territories and trying to claim them, when you attack or defend a territory, you are put into a basic RTS battle. If you win, you get/keep the territory, and whatever buildings you made (not research, though) on that territory. You are also rewarded for attacking/defending, allowing you to get wargear for your commander. Your commander can equip new items that can change your playstyle with him/her or simple make them better. Now, the best part of campaign is the stronghold missions, these missions are when you attack another race's main territory, so instead of destroy the enemy HQ, you are presented other tasks, such as destroy these artillery units to stop part of the map being bombarded or kill this commander and get these soldiers to fight for you. Strongholds are very long, hard and entertaining.\n\nThe game has a nice selection of races, each filling a playstyle.\nTau = Strong ranged units, good offense\nEldar = Stealth based, fast moving\nOrks = Melee swarm\nImperial Guard = Ranged Swarm, great tanks\nSpace Marines = All around, good melee and ranged\nChaos = Kinda like Space Marines, Melee focused\nNecrons = Slow as hell, turtling, but can be near unstoppable when they do attack\n\nMultiplayer and Skirmishing is fun, pretty basic for an RTS but with bots or people, and your own rules.\n\nThe graphics and sounds are nice, the graphics show battles in their full glory, with colorful explosions and blood flying from units, and the sound includes powerful gunfire and units yelling in battle. Not much more to be said, the game looks pretty and sounds like war. The soundtrack I do give a shoutout to, its very nicely done.\n\nThe only real thing I have a problem with this game is the crashing I get. Sometimes in a match or on the menus my game just freezes up or crashes on me, its not common, but commen enough to add it to this review.\n\nI think RTS or Warhammer fans will really like this game, given you didn't buy it already, 9/10, great game, but some crashing and freezing stops it from being perfect.\nAlso check out the mods for this game, some of them are very nifty.","November 25, 2013","true","303.9"," 189 of 190 people (99%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","99","189","190","2","10"

By far the best RTS your fingers will ever touch. My hours will shine light upon this statement.\n\nPros\n-7 Races but somehow cleverly balanced ( Tau and necron are broken but can still be countered )\n-Active friendly community in the sense of I see a lot of the same people everyday helping them improve and befriending them so we can have a lobby of 8 players who all know eachother.\n- One of the best resource systems in any RTS very simple to learn but a huge part of the game.\n- Micro can be used to an insane degree.\n- Macro can be easy to learn.\n- Decent graphics and voice acting for how old the game is.\n- Space marines, Chaos, Orks, Eldar, Imperial Guard. Oh My.\n\nCons\n- Steam servers have messed up a some multiplayer aspects of the game.\n-no more stat tracking ( you cant see how many games a person has played/won )\n-Sync errors happen every once in awhile very low chance but none the less really annoying\nbugged lobbys\n- Having to own every prior expansion to have all the races.\n-Sometimes the population of the game will have 200+ people online at other times 20 people online.\n\n\nI highly recommend getting this game when it goes on sale and you can pick up all the games at a low price,\notherwise I suggest every RTS fan in existance should own this game. It really is something amazing.\nI had no idea what Dawn of war was prior to this game, it shaped my habits as a gamer, and got me into computer games. So if you have the money pick up this game and learn how to play it, it's incredible. A game I wake up early in the morning to play before class, that's detication!","January 14, 2015","true","437.1"," 136 of 141 people (96%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","96","136","141","12","9"

Being able to play the campaign for world conquest with any playable race is fantastic, and the addition of so many races makes multiplayer even more frantic.

While my friends were busy playing Starcraft, commanding the forces of Terrans, Protoss, and Zerg, I was busy fighting wars in the 41st Millennium, taking on foes ten times my greater and defeating them with honor and earning glory.  This was also the version of Warhammer 40K's Dawn of War series that got me into modding, giving me a sweet, sweet taste of what the penultimate prize of Modding experience would be promised to me upon getting Soulstorm.\n\nIf you've ever gotten the previous two, Dawn of War and Winter Assault, you'd know gameplay-wise that nothing's really changed.  However, with the addition of two new factions; the popular Necrons and the mysteriuos Tau Empire; and new units for all other factions (including Grey Knights for the Blood Ravens, which remains my favorite unit choice to this day), it definitely shines in front of its predecessors.  That, and with an awesome campaign where you can play not just one but all seven factions, promising continuous replayability even after you've beaten the campaign once...there's nothing here that's  not to like.\n\nI'd be a fool not to recommend Dark Crusade.  Any RTS player would be a fool to deny that this game stood the test of time.  Stop reading the review, fork out some cash or grab that debit/credit card, and get the sodding game.  The best part about it all is that the multiplayer options are compatible with all versions and are standalone, so you only need one game to have fun.  I recommend giving it a go, it's worth it.  Let's keep this game alive.  For the Emperor!","November 4, 2014","true","13.3"," 94 of 97 people (97%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","97","94","97","3","7"

For those of us who enjoyed standard scenarios and multiplayer this is entirely an improvement.  Unfortunately, for those of us who were more caught up in the story-based campaigns where a story unfolded before you as you played, that feature no longer exists.\n\nThe world map does offer a few advantages that I will admit are enjoyable.  First off, you feel more like a true commander as opposed to a company leader in the prior Dawn of War iterations.  You decided on where and when battles will take place and often those decisions are based on which provinces offer the most requisition (currency) and benefits for your units.  The enemy also acts with the same goals and will actively invade your territory if it sees fit, bringing the battle to you.\n\nThe unfortunate part to this, in addition to the loss of a well developed story from earlier campaigns, most of your battles end up being frantic zerg fights where you churn out your units and upgrades as fast as possible and slam them into the enemy until they are dead.  Obviously, the old strategies do apply, and the classic rock-paper-scissors aspects of the units remain, but I myself always felt more caught up accomplishing objectives and advancing the story.\n\nIt was a toss up for me, as you may have guessed after reading the above, but I have decided that I'm going to recommend this game since it will satisfy previous DoW players who enjoyed the basic scenarios even if the heavily story-based campaign is gone.","December 26, 2015","true","5.4"," 35 of 36 people (97%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","97","35","36","4","0"

It gave players more freedom than the previous two games with its multiple factions, while not suffering from the recycled concepts and poor storyline/voice acting of Soulstorm. The RISK style dynamic is one that I have found inherently fascinating, and one that I hope that Total War: Warhammer will exploit in the future. My personal highlight of the game, and probably the series overall, were the stronghold assaults. With entertaining storylines and objectives that make it feel very much like a special mission in the tabletop game, I found them to be a refreshing and rewarding experience. My one gripe is what seems to have been faction favouritism amongst the production team. Multiplayer combat is made less enjoyable when people play as the Eldar, and make their webway gate invisible, warping it all over the map, and forcing you to adopt time-consuming  strategies to beat.

Dark Crusade is the best game out of all of the entire Dawn of War series.  Its graphics have aged extremely well, the campaign is fun and well written, and skirmish and multiplayer offer endless replayability.  The scale is not quite Supreme Commander but it is pretty large with armies oftentimes reaching the hundreds in infantry alone.  If you are a fan of the Warhammer 40k universe then this game is especially good as it showcases some of the more underapreciated races namely my personal favorite the Tau Empire.  As far as balance goes Relic balanced it in a very 40k style.  Instead of nerfing something that is overpowered they made everybody else equally overpowered because once everybody is overpowered, nobody is.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lummeck/recommended/4580/","lummeck","John Lummeck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lummeck/","22 products in account","In the grim dark future of the 41st millennium, there is only war.\nIn this standalone expansion to the epic series of electronic games known as Dawn of War, you can command armies of the Tau and fight for the Greater Good, or take control of the sinister Necrons and destroy all that crosses your path.\n\nWell, that's my lacklustre "epic introduction" done. Dawn of War - Dark Crusade adds the Tau and Necrons to the list of playable factions. While you can play as any faction introduced in Dawn of War or Dawn of War - Winter Assault in single player, unless you have both those games you can only play Tau or Necrons in multiplayer. Apparently there's a mod for this but I'm not entirely sure it's legal, so I don't have it. Being banned isn't much fun, and I like Tau anyway.\n\nThe campaign uses a RISK-style map, and you must conquer the planet Kronus and drive all other factions off it. This being Warhammer, all the factions are lunatics, to a greater or lesser degree.\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with Warhammer, stop. Why are you unfamiliar with Warhammer?\n\nThe available factions in this game, for those of you who for some reason are unfamiliar with Warhammer 40,000 or its fantasy counterpart, are:\n\nThe Tau. Blue space communist who fight for the Greater Good. Useless in melee.\n\nThe Space Marines, super-buff guys in powered armour. Nicknamed Catholic Space Nazis.\n\nThe Imperial Guard, the less-superpowered allies of the Space Marines. Technically part of the same faction, but they're separate armies so whatever.\n\nThe Eldar, high-tech space elves on the brink of extinction. Ridiculously overpowered in this game, since they can literally turn their whole base invisible and field ridiculous amounts of troops.\n\nThe Orks, fungus-based humanoids who just want to kill stuff for fun. Completely ridiculous but oddly endearing, they run partly on duct tape and space magic.\n\nThe Necrons, Egyptian-themed immortal robots who hate everything living.\n\nChaos, a collection of space demons who worship evil gods. Evil by Warhammer standards, and there are Warhammer factions that make Adolf Hitler look like someone's grandfather. Unless of course he is your grandfather, in which case I apologise.\n\nNow, if you had to have all that explained to you, go and study Warhammer 40,000. You scrub.*\n\nThe game is an RTS, since it's based on a tabletop wargame, and quite a good one. Instead of training individual units, you train squads. The graphics are a bit outdated and make some of the units look silly (Chaos Marines look adorable, for some reason) but having played Minecraft, literally anything is a step up. Boy do I love bashing Minecraft.\n\nPathfinding occasionally throws a tantrum and units randomly mill around before moving on to the point where you want them to go, but apart from that the game is generally fun to play and well-balanced, if a little outdated. Unless of course you count Eldar, who are ridiculously overpowered.\n\nIf you're a fan of Warhammer, and you like the Tau or Necrons, I'd recommend this game.\n\n\n*Please note that this is all said as a joke. Most people will know this, but there a few people who will leap to the comments section to rant about me calling non-Warhammer fans "scrubs".\n\n","February 28","true","15.9"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","80","16","20","9","6"

These matches are just like normal skirmishes from the earlier games. Only certain spaces (Enemy HQ, vital locations like spaceports) have a real objective and a neat little game-engine-made cinematic.\n\nSound deserves a special mention here. The music is one of the best I ever heard in games, cinematic quality,  and the voice acting is great too, but a bit cheesey sometimes, tough that fits.\n\nAnother great feature is the army painter, in wich you decide the color scheme of your units. Sadly this does not work in campaign mode where you play with fixed armies.\n\nSadly I can't cramp more into this little box, as I could go on for hours, but this game is one of the better sci-fi strategy games out there.","December 29, 2010","true","91.2"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Most of the battles are just basic multiplayer style skirmishs against the computer (with the exception of some missions that give you a space port or a daemons fury) but, in the heart of the enemy lines, there is a more mission based level, much like the previous games, that if you can conquer, that faction will be removed from the game, an you'll most likly get a wargear out of it too.\n\nOut of all the 40k games I have played, this is probably the best and most lore faithful (with the exception of the necron/human mix the Parias, they're gone now), sure it plays nothing like the table-top game, but lets be honest here. If it did play like 40k table top, the game would be alot slower and several hundred dollars more costly (But no less awsome)\n\n8.5/10","August 4, 2014","true","22.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Back around '07, friend had in disk form. Borrowed, loved it (more than Warcraft), and got it from him. The best part about the DC CD back then was that you didn't the CD to play it: install it, good to go.\n\nok enough memories. let's talk shop\n\nfun game, it can be played causally. it's mod friendly. Game is Fully voice acted. Warning: Chaos units shout a lot, it annoyed my cousin when he played (lol).\nWhile Units are not Hardcore detailed (easily changeable through mods) but it does the job pretty damn well as the bits and pieces pop out. it also helps increase framerate because of the broad details, and there is going to be a mass of units.\n\nYou have the Campaign, the voice acting pulling you into the intro. Battle map with different faction having a world war. Each with different quirks and you play one of them. Getting started (fighting the first few battles) is easy and used as a teaching tool and a way to explore the different units, if you don't plan on using the tutorial.\n\nGameplay:\nthe first game that I experienced that a unit has both melee and ranged combat. Explosions!! that actually does knock back!\nAbilities. Blood. Jumping assault units. Warcries. Deathcries. Blood!! Semi-gore pieces. More Blood!! Special melee kill animation (Sync-kills). Super Units. Heroes. Separate Cap for infantry and vehicles for full battlefield. BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD!!\nFlamethrowers\n^yes it gets its own line\nBasically, what the picture and video has.\nExperiencing all that in a single battle makes me drool.\n\nAI is pretty easy and repetitive unless you go high difficulty.\nMaps ranges from small 1v1 to large 8 player maps (Mods to get more and/or bigger maps)\n\nCustomization is a little limited, being able to change the color of only a few pieces sets of the whole army, but still fun in my opinion.\nchangeable Banner and flags (mods for more, or easily make your own)\n\nI have little experience with multiplayer, so I can't review that portion.\n\nI Highly recommend it.\nFor the Dark Gods!","November 26, 2014","true","1.5"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","11","14","2","0"

It should however, not really be played as a standalone. The complete absence of any sort of tutorial or incremental introduction of units and technologies makes this an incredibly hard place to start for new players as you're essentially thrown into the deep end from the get go and just hope you learn how to swim before you get overwhelmed. To add insult to injury you can only use the two new races in multi-player unless you already own Dawn of War and Winter Assault.\n\nThe two new races are very nice additions however. The Necrons are a pure powerhouse, the immortal machine servants of a long dead empire, serving vicious and hungry gods. In game they play quite differently from the others, ignoring usual resources and tactics their build speed is determined by the number of strategic points you own making them a very slow starter, to compensate their units are unusually tough and sometimes even resurrects themselves upon death. Lategame they transform into a steamroller as even their Headquarters becomes a flying, teleporting doomsday machine.\n\nThe second new faction to be introduced is the Tau and they similarly play differently from the old factions although not quite as big a deviation as the Necrons are. The Tau are a strange mix of specialists, heavily armed but poorly armored weapons platforms and a variety of beastly allies. The biggest difference between them and other factions is the lategame choice of either going to the heavily armed but poorly armed weapons platforms or the huge beast allies they can also summon as choosing one path excludes the other.\n\nThe single-player changes gear from the previous installments and replaces the linear and scripted missions of Dawn of War and Winter Assault with an open campaign map in a Grand Strategy style. Each faction starts with a stronghold province and must conquer the rest of the map as you play along gaining various bonuses from their conquests including various pieces of wargear for their leader. The problem with this concept is all the maps in between the various strongholds are just plain boring, both in attack an defense. Although the map changes it all plays much the same and it comes down to pure grind very quickly.\n\nThe stronghold attacks however is where the game gets interesting. Challenging maps with multiple sub-objectives and small video sequences before and after makes them the only bright side of the new campaign.\n\nIn terms of graphics and sound it maintains the same quality as the main game. A thunderhammer still makes a satisfying thump when impacting a traitor's breastplate and the Ork's still scream out their one word with relentless fervor.\n\nThat feel that comes from the WH40K universe still exists, but the grind of the campaign makes it have much less of an impact than in the original. Still a good expansion, just not an exceptional one and definitely not one to be played as a standalone game.","November 12, 2012","true","107.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","8"

When the Dark Crusade hits, nothing can stop the march of the Necrons!\n\nDark Crusade is the second expansion for the original Dawn of War and it adds two new races; the Necron and the Tau Alliance, as well as brand new conquest campaign and a multitude of new units for the old races. Both new races play distinctively different from the other teams and Relic has done its best to ensure plenty of options for you experiment and tinker with to have hours upon hours of playtime.\n\nUnfortunately, time has not been so kind to the game's presentation. Conquest also grows rather monotomous as you continuously have to rebuild, regroup and reengage on every new map. It is eventually best enjoyed with other players in the  beefy multiplayer department. With plenty of game modes and even the option to paint your army in your own custom paintjob; just like the table top game.\n\nAll in all, the expansion adds more options, more time and more fun to your warfare if you're into the warhammer universe. It is well worth its price, especially considering today's rates during sales, and when comparing it to the investment of getting into the tabletop game.","January 1, 2014","true","20.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The campaign is structured in a more non-linear way, allowing you to choose what areas you attack, whether you want to defend an area yourself or let the computer figure out what happens. It's like they spliced in elements of Risk, while maintaining the base building and combat mechanics you've come to expect from Dawn of War.\n\nOne thing to note is that you should save often, because if you screw up a mission you'll lose your turn. Also, when attacking an area build the best base and defenses you can because if that area comes under attack by an enemy you automatically start off with all your structures.\n\nThis would have been nice to know at the start, as I've pretty much screwed myself over and have to wait a few turns to build resources. Prepare for a little less forgiving experience, and a little more strategy in your attacks. Anyway, it's still Dawn of War and that means it's good.","July 23, 2015","true","3.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Which allows you to select one of the six factions and begin your conquest of the planet Kronus.  Each newly conquered section grants a new powerful unit, resources and upgrades for both yoru army and your commander.\n\nThe Combat system introduces typical ranged combat from rapid fire weapons, bombarding artillery and flame throwers.  BUt what really stands out is the melee combat.  Where squads of up to 12 or more engage hand to hand.  Many combatants will end with a finishing move, either putting a boot to the face or a pistol style execution.\n\nSize and scale are impressive in the game.  As we watch massive war tanks support the ground troops or watch the epic duel between two titanic demi gods.\n\nGravity matters in this game.  So if you hear or see an artillery shell land in the middle of your army, don't be surprised if you see them take to the air.  Don't feel ashamed if you see your infantry get kicked like a soft ball by the demi gods on the field.  But feel honored when you see your captain plant his hammer into said demi god's head with a thunderous BOOM!\n\nThe game is a typical Real Time Strategy (RTS) title, which means players must amass resources for buying troops and building facilities too upgrade current units and buy new more powerful ones.  The only difference with resource gather is capturing strategic points and building power generators.  So you don't need to worry about mining gold or chopping trees here.\n\nThe Community has been very generous with offering mods which allow gamers too try variety of custom made units, abilites and maps as well as alternating banners and badges for your units.\n\nThe original DAWN OF WAR trilogy is a must have for anyone who enjoys RTS with range and melee combat.  Likewise for those who are either familiar or unaware with the Warhammer 40,000 franchise.","November 25, 2013","true","47.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

At the start of it, you have one area on the planet which is your stronghold (every race have a stronghold which is a heavily defended and fortified). You capture other areas by fighting the controlling race in Real time on a map. Most areas unlocks an honor guard that you can recruit, so when you fight someone again, you start with that troop in the begining of the fight. (example: an honor guard for the Space Marines could be a small marie squad that has more health than you regular marines + more damage)\n\nThe planet map is turn based with a very simple resource managing.

It allows for training (because the AI can be quite a challange) or just for fun.\n\nThe MultiplayerI have not actually played much of the multiplayer, but from what I have played, its fairly stable and fun.

This is an excellent and fairly vast expansion.\n\nIn terms of its overall structure, this is probably the best Command and Conquer style "RTS" (Real Time Strategy as they are called, though applying the term "strategy" to this kind of game may be a little bit of a misnomer as most "RTS" games includes relatively little actual strategy but more often merely include certain tactical elements) I have ever played. It's most notable strengths are that it allows you to play as one of many different, unique factions, each faction has its own ending and the global-scale battle map allows the single-player campaign to give you, the player, a great many choices as you attempt to progress through the war.\n\nBut this game is not without flaws. Indeed, this game, particularly the single-player campaign, has some fairly serious flaws.\n\nAn example of The Good (if not Great):\n+The single player campaign map gives you excellent strategic options. Remember the old between-mission battle maps that were found in some of the oldest Command and Conquer games? This mode works a lot like that but instead of letting you select either one battle or another, your options are much more varied. If you capture the sector which has the spaceport your options become even more numerous because then you can attack most places across the globe. Likewise, capturing certain other sectors gives your forces certain other strategic and tactical benefits which make an enormous difference as the campaign progresses. This between-mission global strategic map mode is a truly excellent feature which lets you choose how you want the single-player campaign to progress while showing you your options (or lack thereof) and letting you see how your campaign is progressing. It is a feature I would honestly like to see in every other "RTS" game ever made as it offers unparalleled choice and strategic options well beyond what most other similar such Command and Conquer style "RTS" games ever come close to offering you. The inclusion feature should set the bar higher for every other command and conquer style RTS to follow. For me, this feature (combined with the inclusion of the Tau as a fully playable faction) made the game for me and made me want to keep playing the main campaign through to its conclusion.\n\nThe Mediocre:\n+/- This game requires you to make heavy use of your lightest infantry units. This severely limits the number of tactical options which ever become available to you while at once causing the body count in each battle to rise dramatically. This makes some sense for certain factions (like the Imperial Guard) but makes less since for other factions. Worse, the Imperial Guard factions still don't have unit sizes which seem to ever be large enough or populous enough while the Space marine units never seem to be durable enough for them to be remotely canonical. The Tau units take casualties far too often as well for them to be canonical. When playing as the Tau or the Eldar the game should penalize you (severely) for taking heavy casualties but it doesn't. All factions require you to heavily rely on infantry before building ANY tanks or other vehicles (making the game all too command and conquer styled for my tastes) and units do not seem to ever level up or gain any experience for being in combat which further decreases this game's tactical depth. Ideally, Imperial guard units should automatically include huge numbers of soldiers and some tanks should be available from the outset. Tau forces should heavily rely on tanks and their APC units from the outset. Necrons should be very, very, very slow (much slower than they are shown to be in this game) but almost indestructible. Space Marines should be much, much more durable but much, much fewer in number. (Remember, in Warhammer 40k, there is said to be fewer space marines than inhabited planets in the galaxy) and they cannot afford to lose the sheer numbers they lose in this game (and neither can the Tau or the Eldar or the Necrons). Since all the factions play so similarly to each other (and none of them truly play like they really should) the tactical options are severely limited as a result and the battles are, as a direct result, much, much more repetitious and uninteresting than they could have been. From what I can tell from reading a few of the Warhammer 40k codexes, what we have here in these Dawn of War games is not really Warhammer 40k, but something with its name that sort of looks like it but doesn't really feel much like it. Still, the world of Warhammer 40k is a big one and so there's some room for my suspension of disbelief. However, this game should also be highly commended for the sheer variety of factions which it attempted to include and everything it did well about each faction (especially their voices and sounds they make when responding to orders). The great many factions and thus the great many campaigns which this game includes greatly adds replay value to this game. My Tau campaign lasted over 30 hours. I'd imagine other campaigns would take just as long as well.\n\nThe Bad:\n- The singleplayer campaign is blatantly unfair. In the single player campaign, battles wherein you attempt to attack and take over enemy strongholds or main bases all have additional, almost unfair objectives which must be completed. (I found the Necron main-base to be worst because the mission would automatically fail if you failed to get your little commander-unit out alive (and this is not true in any other battle and that particular battle tried hard to make this objective particularly difficult resulting in some frustration.) Now needing to complete extra objectives to take over an enemy base is fine, if the game was fair about it but this game isn't remotely fair about this-EVER. If an enemy attacks YOUR main base then you only have one or two little bases and all the CPU computer enemy has to do to make you lose the ENTIRE game is to destroy those one or two bases. The CPU must complete absolutely no other additional objectives to defeat you. To make matters worse, regardless of which side you play, in terms of number of main-bases you are very nearly always out-matched in every battle, whether you are attacking a main base or not. In the vast majority of battles in the main campaign the enemy has at least 2 main bases when I had just one (and I was playing on EASY difficulty. Indeed, One might think this kind of blatant, in-built unfairness is due to the game's essentially poor AI but this game doesn't seem to have poor AI. The enemy AI actually acted quite well. And, of course, on higher difficulties the AI responds more quickly and acts more aggressively. The AI is at least adequate to provide excellent challenges when all things are equal (though it is of course less creative than a person can potentially be). Honestly, I don't think that the kind of in-built unfairness that I mentioned above needed to exist in this game and it made for a needlessly frustrating experience. However, I should mention that RTS games are generally NOT my main forte. Unless I'm playing Homeworld Cataclysm, RTS games are games I am generally not very good at. Maybe there should be an option programmed in to make the main campaign blatantly unfair or not if those who are great at RTS games need additional challenges (something like a Pro or Expert mode).\n-Space Marines still look cute and huggable in this game (big feet, little heads, big shoulders, puppet-like animations).","March 2","true","24.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","2"

PURGE! KILL!- Space Marines\n\nThis is one of my favourite games I have played. I owned the disk version first before steam, this game is amazing and is a must have for RTS lovers, especially those that love the Warhammer universe. You'll have a blast destroying your enemies. But take note that easy difficulty for the AI is pretty crap but when it says easy, it means EASY! no real effort needed to destroy your enemy. Standard difficulty is alright but for experienced players, they can deal with this, experienced players that want a good challenge, choose the hard difficulty or higher, it gets incredibly difficult and there are about 3 or 4 harder difficulties to choose from, hard on an 8 player map, it is going to be intense and it is going to get bloody.\nSummary: Don't choose easy, it is ironically way too easy.\n\nNOTE- This game used to be powered by GameSpy, and multiplayer is a big question, can we do it if we were to buy it today? The answer is yes, the servers have been transferred to steam, the game wasn't left for dead when GameSpy shut down. Multiplayer works and is functional. Note that if you don't own the original game or the winter assualt expansion, you will only be able to play as 2 of the 7 races in multiplayer, if you own the original game and this but not winter assualt, you will have access to 6 out of the 7 races in multiplayer. If you get this game, get your friends to get it as well, it is a great game to play with friends.\n\nCD keys are not needed to play multiplayer like it did for the disk versions of the game, instead you must simply have the games installed to gain access to races in multiplayer.","August 15, 2015","true","24.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","1"

The Campaign is narrated by one of the most coolest narrators I've ever listened to. I'd look up his name for this review, but it's 5am.\n\nAs you begin and end your campaign your adventers will be narrated in an epic voice, and you can immerse yourself into the world of Dawn of War. The cutscenes are whimsical and magical in a way I can't describe, like with the Orks, and the Necrons, the game presents itself with a certain type of charm that I can't forget. Dawn of War 2 didn't give me the same kind of character and gameplay that this game delivers. Dawn of War - Dark Crusade brings you on an epic adventure, to an epic Campaign. The game's narrator makes your actions feel truly noble, brutal, or just downright awesome. The gameplay can't be compared to something like starcraft or command&conquer, it is a truly unique way of presenting RTS with requisition and relic resources. It's simple, makes some sense, and effective.\n\nThe gameplay itself centers it's focus on your units and their various personalities. Like with the Imperial Officers shooting their own soldiers to gain morale, or the awesome Necrons and their units. The game's Campaign is just fantastic and epic, with a charisma that is almost on par with the Disney movies, but for gamers who love Dawn of War.

The massive scale epic battles of the original DoW series have been replaced for smaller more tactical combat these days, and thats not what 40k should be about. The MP was a perfect balance (starcraft 2 style) spread amongst very wildly different races and species. This game and Space Marine I think completely nailed the feeling of what 40K should feel like in video games. Had it not been for "Last stand" mode I might not have even bought the new series.  I have put more hours into this game than any other in my history of PC gaming, (played the boxed version so don't let Steam playtime fool you) and recommend it for any RTS fans , and a must own for fans of 40K.","June 11, 2013","true","53.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

There is no fog of war for computer. The orc Warboss or Necron Lord will teleport right into the middle of your troops that are way in the back behind your front line, and hidden by the fog of war, maybe even infiltrated and land right in the middle of them constantly. Jump pack troops will perfectly time their double jump to coincide with this, and all of them perfectly skirt the range of your turrets when it suits them. Makes the game more challenging but you watch a few replays and its hard not to feel you are getting cheated.\n\nSoulstorm is the one to play, (though ai will behave the same as already noted) unless you are wanting to play the campaign mode and NOT rebuild 100% of the map everytime you defend since it also has Dark Eldar and the Sisters to play. Except for those two things games are nearly identical.","December 19, 2015","true","187.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

They is a mechanic where you can develop your character with certain new items, which can turn the tide of battle. Overall you can play as seven different factions, this gives it alot of repaly value.\n\nThe AI may not be as intelligent as Soulstorm; which is a lesser game however, on hard difficulty they can still give you a run for your money.\n\nThe only issue the have with the game is that their is a certain balance issue with Necrons however, it doesn't spoil the game one bit.

This game is really the meaning of "Traditional RTS", set in the Warhammer 40k Universe. Dark Crusade includes 7 Factions to play as, including the T'au Empire and the Necrons of Kronus. The campaign has been changed entirely, into a risk type of game. The objective is to conquer the map as your selected race. To make booting another race off of the map a bit more exciting, each army (including your own) has a "Stronghold". This is basically the main base of the army, you could even consider it as a boss battle. Now I will move onto a more brief list.\n\nPros:\n\n- 7 Armies, each can be played in the Campaign. Replayability can last a while.\n- Balancing is fairly good, some things might still be considered a bit "OP".\n- The pinnacle of the DoW Franchise.\n- Multiplayer has still been kept online to this date, about 10 years later!\n- Each Army has a different playstyle, rather than just using the same tactic for every army.\n- Quite a large learning curve if you are new to the franchise.\n- In my opinion, this is still better than it's successor, Dawn of War 2.\n- Variety of unique units for each faction.\n\nCons:\n\n- Multiplayer community is quite small here, though it is still alive.\n- This game isn't really a "Pick up and be good" game.\n- Some units do have slight pathfinding issues in some cases, like the Necron Monolith.\n- There isn't really a playable story. Though there is a background story to the campaign, it's not like Winter Assault or Dawn of War.\n\n\nEven though it isn't perfect, I would reccommend picking this up any day. The latest Dawn of War 1 game is Soulstorm, however Soulstorm has it's fair share of dis-advantages. I'm just gonna put it this way; Dark Crusade for the Singleplayer and vanilla game, Soulstorm for the mods.\n\n11/10 would dakka again.","April 7","true","20.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As a fan of RTS games and Warhammer, I had to get Dawn of War, and I am glad I did. To this day the Dawn of War series is one of, if not my most favorite RTS series out there. If you are even remotely interested in the game I urge you to look further, there are alot of different Dawn of War games you can buy, I am sure that if your taking the time to read this review you will at least find one of the Dawn of War games to your liking!\n\nDark Crusade, like all the "standalone expansions" of the Dawn of War series, adds new maps, a new single player campaign, and one of more new races to choose from. Dark Crusade itself adds playable Necron, and Tau Races, and an Overhauled single player campaign experience. Overall though, I have got to say out of the 4 original Dawn of War games, DoW, Winter Assault, Dark Crusade, and Soulstorm, I think Dark Crusade was my most favorite. I however am not counting any of the Dawn of War 2 games in that decision, as I have not played them all.

Just like many other RTS's the objective is to destroy your enemy and you have an abundance of ways to do this, whether it be spamming solders in an attempt to slowly tear apart their defences or even to let the enemy pass over your fallen allies then resurrecting them behind them and crushing them. It’s a really diverse game and can be played in so many different ways, my personal favourite play style is too build lots of vehicles and supply cover and a fall back point for my allies. This works out well but only really for the race Tau considering they have a lot of long ranges tanks that can deal a lot of damage with the safety of fog of war.\nAnyway in the end I’ve loved the game since the first day I played it when I was a kid and personally I put it up there as my favourite RTS followed closely by Age of Empires 2 (Haven’t played it check it out, bit old but hey so are you)\nThanks hope I helped you decide whether to buy the game, if you want to know more just ask.\nPeace ♥♥♥♥♥\n","March 2, 2014","true","16.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

DO not buy this stand alone if you want to play online. buy the pthers aswell.\n\nThis game is amazing, mostly balanced and you can easily just reply as all the races (Multiplayer as well but you need winter assault and the original for full experience, but the game is amazing so you are going to buy).\n1) All races are OP which makes it balanced? In a way. For example the orks can create infinite turrets and free units about mid way. The necrons (terminators basically, cannot be killed) can revive themselves automatically or harvested for more troops. Chaos can have millions of troops. Tau can shoot from out of fog of war, elder create web way gates everywhere and there invisible... the list goes on\n2) There are plenty of different styles; due to the diverse races and how you play them... you already have yourself an amazing game. Each race is different and not all rely on just running at the enemy.\n3) Persistent body’s (nuff said). Ever played age of empires or mythology and wonder what would happen if the body’s did not disappear? Imagine 3000 body’s just scattered (this has happened; it was a stalemate for 2.5 hours).\n4) Troops are not essential like dawn of war II which means you end up replacing space marines like imperial guardsmen lore wise... idk it just mixes it up a bit for me and makes it dramatically less dull.\n5) The campaign is entertaining and the multiplayer is as well. You will enjoy the game... you will love the game... the game is all round... just pure awesome.\n*Side note* There is no need to buy soul storm after this, unless you want to play as bolter ♥♥♥♥♥es (sorry my friend calls them that and i have forgotten their real name) and dark elder. Then they apparently made it unbalanced with air units which ruined the game...\nThe only bad thing though is that some races are more OP than others which is a shame, but that’s only if you know how to use them, for example the necrons can attack you from the get go while the elder can just TP to your base if they build web way gates.

Based on a world map that you can invade other provinces instead of following a campaign story is much better.\nThe W40k universe is so huge and so fantastic that you'll be fascinated by the Imperium of Man with their Soldiers, or the God Emperors Space Marines, the dark necrons, or Chaos Space Marines... Or perhaps the Eldar or even the technological Tau with their Greater Good philosophy (or the orcs... but who likes them? ;) Haha).\n\nSet on the planet Kronus, you'll find yourself in the middle of a bloody war, a dark crusade. Where one faction will triumph and the total annihilation of all others. Make sure that it is YOUR faction. You can play as any of the W40k factions that you've grown to know and love... Or at least you'll come to know and love if you haven't experienced a W40k game yet though.\n\nDon't let the franchise fool you though, it's very easy to get into the frachnise, this was the first W40k game I've ever played (back in 2006) and I've played all of them since (and the ones before). I'm not a fan of the figures or the board game though, even though the games are based on it... Shh! Plus the CGI movies/clips are awesome. The whole W40k universe is fascinating.\n\nAnyway, about the game.\nIt's a typical real time strategy game, construct buildings, construct units from buildings, defeat the enemy. That's a simple run down of it anyway. All of the maps are static too. So when you've built a base in a province, if you're invaded, your base will be exactly the same as it was when you first built it. But any buildings destroyed in the next battle will be gone, but also new buildings will stay obviously. So definitely plan ahead when you first build in a province.\n\n(SPOILER: I've found myself trapping an enemy in a small corner of a map and building a huge base all over the map before I destroy them, so that my huge base is persistant if anyone invades it... But that's kinda cheating hehe)\n\nIt's a very fun game, but don't take my word for it, check out videos of it on YouTube and many of the other reviews of this game.\nIf you enjoyed this game, be sure to get SoulStorm, it's practically an expansion of this game and includes another faction, instead of battling all over Kronus, you'll be battling across an entire solar system on a variety of planets instead!\nGet everything W40k\n\n\n"So long as the enemies of man still draw breath there can be no peace."\n"Ever vigilant."","December 27, 2013","true","98.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I started playing Warhammer 40k on the tabletop in the early 90's and this game represents my ideal simulation of that experience.  The flavor and atmosphere of 40k is perfectly represented, and the game itself plays great with no bugs that I've ever encountered.\n\nThere are 6 factions to play, and each requires a very different approach to the game.  The only downside is that the campaign map and faction placement are always the same in every game, so it can get quite repetitive to play through the campaign with each faction.\n\nThat said, there's always skirmish mode, and an enormous amount of user-created maps and mods out there to play with.  If you never played this game, you're missing out.","March 13, 2015","true","11.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(new race, they didn't balance them very well.) (also has buggs) (2 monos work in this game unlike soulstorm) ( you can bugg your mono the same as soulstorm) ( i use necrons to deal with tau players) (immortals can own fire warriors, just 1 flayed one can utterly ruin tau moral) keep builders near to deal with the stealth suits.\n\nImperial Guard have fast tank counter\tech, weaker than winter assault however. some tatics can work like a preist\palsma tech, has decent rush.(nice mass of ig and the command squad work good) i personally use them agaisnt chaos when i can. tho you could use them agaisnt space\nmarines too, nade rush works just as good agaisnt marine squad masses\n\nEldar are OP ~ over powered. (strongest race in Dark Crusade.) (dont play them because they're utterly boring when you just Roflstomp anyone and everyones race.) (can reaper mass) FOF rush,\nspider tech will normally trash any t2 mob or t3 special units, dragons own any tank, felcon jump with them to decap any point can build anywhere on the map and instantly move full army to that location.... cheap tanks..... over powered fire prisim that destroy full squads in a few hits, and that are over ranged. worst of all the avatar that sits in the base, while eldar gain huge population bonus on tanks and units also any unit around thus avatar is immune to moral dammage, and ontop everyone gets a speed bonus and faster build time. yeah totally balanced and fair race, trust me if you join in a 2v2v2v2 or 4v4 or 3v3 take the eldar out as fast as you can. oh i almost forgot the annoying platforms that 1 can stop a full massed army to hedehog speed, and i'm not talking sonic. and the other one that removes any targets armor making it get eaten by even guardians hahahaha its such an unbalanced race, and enjoy your rage fighting eldar.\n\n& same with the Tau, (new race, they didn't balance them very well.) (dont play them because they're utterly boring) range race, that sits back with over-ranged units to roflstomp anybody who cant get close enough to fight back. annoying meele units that are too weak apart from the kroot heavys that can rip terminators apart solo back them up with fire warrior mass, and sky rays & you're finished buddy if you want to beat these cowards you will have to mass meele, or play some very good tatics with transports and teleporting, with special powers to chew up the wall of fire warrior mass you will come to be fighting 9\10 times not as OP as eldar IMO but still OP if you dont know what you're doing, and in the right hands can be close to unbeatable with most races.","May 22","true","0.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You have to take over territories, each giving a boon of somekind and the game is over when you have driven all other races off the planet.\n\nWith this change there are quite a few interesting things to note.\n\n1. Your general is upgradable. By accomplishing certain things you can upgrade your general in various ways which gives him/her boons. For example, one upgrade made it so Taldeer can spot infiltration enemies and another gave her the ability to regenerate faster and those of troops around her.\n\n2. Certain missions are far more than simply (destroy enemy HQ) and involve more difficult tasks like collecting a number of units or destroying certain objectives. All this makes it feel like they actually put thought into it.\n\n3. Invading the Homebase. The homebase battles are absolutely EPIC!

The game might get boring since it repeats itself pretty much but it is still very good. It has also different races such as: Orks, Eldars, Necrons, Chaos etc. The choosing of which troop to use might be a bit awkward but when you play it for some time you get used to it. Since it's an old game it doesn't have so great graphics but the graphics are not the most important thing.\n\nAlso if you're new to this game or these kind of games I prefer you to start with Necrons. They're the best race to begin with if you are learning to play :)","June 23, 2014","true","35.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheAlphaTerran/recommended/4580/","TheAlphaTerran","fixthatmechwithductape","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheAlphaTerran/","109 products in account","I really like this game and I just finished the campaign a moment ago (for the Blood Ravens). Dawn of War Dark Crusade is an expansion to Relic's real time strategy game Dawn of War, which is set in the Warhammer 40, 000 universe of table top wargames. I highly recommend it to any real time stategy fan who loves the grittines and toughness of battles which are primarily set in a distopian future where every alien you meet wants to kill you and eat you for jujubes :D, and that's not all; Your government, which is the Grand Imperium of Man, constantly drafts new recruits in the billions in order to sacrifice to The Emeperor, who uses His powerful psychic mind in order to stave the forces of Super Hell (or Chaos for short) which constantly gobbles up any known dangerous substances in order to get high for the dark gods. The 7 major races are The Blood Ravens; The Emperor's own space marines who came to the planet Kronus to search for the secrets of their lost history. The Ork's or should I say 'Da Orks', only come for the tendency of following their Ork Chieftains for the sake of the Waaaagh!!!! in order to satuate their cravings for constant battle. The Eldar, a mysterious alien race which are a splinters of their former empire 10, 000 years prior to the 41st millenium, have come to Kronus in order to stop their ancient enemies, known as the Necrons, from rising from their tomb worlds and purging the galaxy clean of all sentient life. The Necrons were metallic warriors who slumbered eons ago iduring the aftermath, which in Eldar legend was in the aftermath of the so called 'War in Heaven'. Then there are the imperial guard, chaos and the tau (my favourite), and for that YOU can explore for yourself. For the 4 races I've mentioned there is a ton of lore to explore and unfortunately I cannot tell you all of it. If you think Halo, Startrek  and Starwars had tons of lore, you have never read the Lore of 40k, it is just a massive game world that you need to delve into. As for this game I give a solid 9/10. Please relic in the name of the emperor, where is Dawn of War 3?","February 17, 2015","true","101.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While my friends were busy playing Starcraft, commanding the forces of Terrans, Protoss, and Zerg, I was busy fighting wars in the 41st Millennium, taking on foes ten times my greater and defeating them with honor and earning glory. This was also the version of Warhammer 40K's Dawn of War series that got me into modding, giving me a sweet, sweet taste of what the penultimate prize of Modding experience would be promised to me upon getting Soulstorm.\n\nIf you've ever gotten the previous two, Dawn of War and Winter Assault, you'd know gameplay-wise that nothing's really changed. However, with the addition of two new factions; the popular Necrons and the mysteriuos Tau Empire; and new units for all other factions (including Grey Knights for the Blood Ravens, which remains my favorite unit choice to this day), it definitely shines in front of its predecessors. That, and with an awesome campaign where you can play not just one but all seven factions, promising continuous replayability even after you've beaten the campaign once...there's nothing here that's not to like.\n\nI'd be a fool not to recommend Dark Crusade. Any RTS player would be a fool to deny that this game stood the test of time. Stop reading the review, fork out some cash or grab that debit/credit card, and get the sodding game.

With 7 playable races and a million ways to play them you're not likely to run out of ways to kill stuff in this game. Best way to play the game is with 2 or 3 mates whilst in skype calls. You can really get involved in the competitiveness of base building and accumulating an army. Whether your making a turtle style base,crawling with turrets and snipers or rushing with bulky green aliens the game is fun at any stage of play from the first seconds to the 15 minutes where someone runs into your barely prepared base with an army of necrons.\n\nCampaign is just a series of skirmishes and leaves something to be desired in the area of voice acting and storyline, however it doesn't mean it's not fun. You can have fun in moving from battle to battle. The campaign is a solid\n\nThe Game has a high degree of unit customization and army painting that makes your army unique to you, the more effort you put into the look of your army the more you can get behind it.\n\nGraphics are great and still hold after 9 years! pictures don't show just how good the game looks.\n\nAll in all the game is in my opinion one of a kind and an unforgettable RTS experience. If RTS and army building is what gets you hard then this game will leave you with a raging erection.\n\n","December 3, 2015","true","231.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

There is map with provinces and you can choose where to attack. Sounds cool right?\n\nWell, the problem is that there is a reinforce mechanic. You basically buy units to protect a province and when the enemy attacks you, you start with those units. So the defender has a HUGE advantage. There is a counter to it but it doesn't really work. The attacker can start with units but you have to unlock them by conquering provinces...which you can't do because you don't have them yet!\n\nAnd then the enemy can reinforce like 3x more units than you can so you can't attack him and hope to win. And then for some dumb reason the computer gets 2 bases when he attacks you, but you only get 1 when you are the attacker. So there is a huge bias to the computer.\n\nPlus, necrons are OP because they get infinite free units.\n\nTL:DR computer has huge advantage, necrons OP","April 10, 2015","false","11.2"," 3 of 38 people (8%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","8","3","38","2","2"

Tight controls, emphasis on units instead of turrets, and a unique resource mechanic based on holding strategic points rather than ore mining, and a plethora of race options make this RTS butter.\n\nOn a side note, Games Workshop needs to make Gorgutz as an character in the table-top version....they just do.\n","November 25, 2014","true","80.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've been playing this since release, purchasing it boxed, and it wasn't all that long ago I decided to get the Steam version and get rid of my 'hard' copies.\n\nThe whole capture and securing of points for resource is done perfectly, which I never felt was quite reproduced with Men of War. Which is a shame.\n\nThe balance is great, the gentle build up to top tech can be tense when you're struggling at the front line. Game wise it plays better than Soulstorm, though I think the flying craft kind of took away from the game a bit. Additionally the extra races in Soulstorm aren't that great, though I would be nice if we could steal the campaign map from it. Although keep persistant buildings which they oddly dropped when moving over to Soulstorm.\n\nAnd the campaign is great, each race has their own intro and ending (not sure what happens if you lose). I wish they had released additional campaigns though, and while the modding community do add to the game, an official high end new campaign would have rocked.\n\nStill, I've been playing this forever now, so it can't be that bad.","September 28, 2014","true","222.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you enjoy games like Company of Heroes and Starcraft then this is a can't miss title.\n\nThe game is set on the planet Kronus where the Imperial Guard rule in the name of the Emperor but all is not well on Kronus. The Ork invasion has begun anew on this planet and with all the fighting above the ancient killing machines known as the Necron have awaken which in turn has caused the Tau to appear on the planet in an effort to stop them from annihilating all life on the planet. Of course all this extra violence has attracted the attention of the Blood God of Chaos attention and brought the Chaos Marines onto Kronus. And with the Chaos Marines the Eldar quickly came in tow to stop them from ressurecting more demons and overtaking more planets. The Space Marines (namely the Blood Ravens) are ordered to cleanse the planet now for it is considered overrun with the Alien, the Unclean, and the Heretic. Upon their arrival on the planet they are told their are precious artifacts on Kronus that must be reclaimed at all costs and thus order the Imperial Guard to evacuate from Kronus in order for them to purge Kronus and reclaim the artifacts. The Guard promptly refuses and sparks an intense war with the Blood Ravens. This all quickly turns into a nasty open war.\nHow this war plays out however is solely up to you however. The game gives you a decent background for each race and the events leading to the war but it has not true canon story beyond that. Your campaign mode consists of picking 1 of several races (Space Marines, Imperial Guard, Eldar, Orks, Chaos Marines, Tau, or Necrons) and then using them to conquer the entire map. The campaign starts off on the world screen where you can reinforce your territories launch attacks or upgrade your Honor Guard, which are essentially free beefed up versions of your basic units, as well as upgrade your commander unit with Wargear, items that add health attack or other bonus abilities to your commander unit. Each race has its own Stronghold which if taken will kick them from the game for that campaign. Capture all strongholds to win.\nAll in all the game looks great despite some age, it sounds great and has a decent soundtrack and its positively steeped in lore for every race.

It's very well polished, has a great tutorial and is very well balanced.\nWhat makes the game a real winner is that it's easy to play, but hard to master. Camera manipulation, map scrolling, location bookmarking, building, recruiting, resource management, unit selection, unit grouping and unit direction feel very natural and logical and have been very well implemented. This is often something that is done so poorly in many RTS's and ruins what would have otherwise been a good game, but DOW makes it easy, which means that I can crack on with the more complicated management of my bases, armies and resource gathering.\n\nI also love the element where you take a bit with you at the end of each mission to the next mission because that makes logical sense if you're running a war campaign, instead of starting each new mission with 1 builder unit.\n\nOne thing that can be improved is troop path finding, including formations. Then again, I still haven't found and RTS that does this overly well and I just have to micro-manage my armies more like usual.","February 13, 2015","true","33.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've been playing this since release, purchasing it boxed, and it wasn't all that long ago I decided to get the Steam version and get rid of my 'hard' copies.\n\nThe whole capture and securing of points for resource is done perfectly, which I never felt was quite reproduced with Men of War. Which is a shame.\n\nThe balance is great, the gentle build up to top tech can be tense when you're struggling at the front line. Game wise it plays better than Soulstorm, though I think the flying craft kind of took away from the game a bit. Additionally the extra races in Soulstorm aren't that great, though I would be nice if we could steal the campaign map from it. Although keep persistant buildings which they oddly dropped when moving over to Soulstorm.\n\nAnd the campaign is great, each race has their own intro and ending (not sure what happens if you lose). I wish they had released additional campaigns though, and while the modding community do add to the game, an official high end new campaign would have rocked.\n\nStill, I've been playing this forever now, so it can't be that bad.","September 28, 2014","true","222.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/intrepidtraveler/recommended/4580/","intrepidtraveler","El Wray","http://steamcommunity.com/id/intrepidtraveler/","193 products in account","The Dark Crusade is considered the starting point in my campaign with the Warhammer series probably back in 2007. I always come back to this game year after year because I enjoy the single player and multiplayer game modes that include all the races unlocked out of the gate. The single player mode allows you to pick any race and drops you on the map with the rest of the races scattered across the globe. Each section of the map you win provides requisition and other bonuses to your army. The turn based "Risk style" mode begins after your first action and then allows each AI a turn in capturing territories. Similar to other RTS games, Dark Crusade is no different and allows you to construct buildings, vehicles and troops.\n\nThe maps in each territory are littered with capture points that you will need to grab before your opponent in order to gain resources to expand your base. While there isn't much story in the campaign beyond the first introduction scene, more details will unfold as you begin to win battles against the other opponents when you capture their strongholds. The main character for each race is also outfitted with war gear as you fulfill certain requirements throughout Dark Crusade. Once you start conquering section of the map, rest assured that each race will take opportunites to invade and try to force you out of the territory.\n\nIf I could recommend an RTS game then this would be the one out of all the Warhammer games. Whether it is a group of vehicles bombarding soldiers sending them flying or the up close action of Blood Ravens putting the boots to Orks for the Emperor, I feel there is never a dull moment in battle. I think Dark Crusade is the definitive pick over the newer Dawn of War games because of the maps, large scale battles and the non-linear campaign. Your best bet is to pick up the Warhammer collection, which usually pops up on sale. I had hours of time on Dark Crusade when I owned the original disc but had to purchase it again because I lost them.","August 16, 2014","true","22.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Rather than following a linear path of objectives like the previous DOW and Winter assault, it throws in a Meta game where you are fighting for complete control of a Planet, which throws in tactical decisions on where to buy more support for the territory you just won or to bolster an earlier victory site.

My first foray into this was a long time ago with some of my old friends.  I got out of the game but still have the minatures stashed in boxes around the house that i now have no time for and no space to properly work on them.  Anyway, the Dawn of war series has been a fantastic reimagining of the game for me.  Granted much of the game lacks the vast array of units that all the armies are able to field in the board game and it is not a turn based game.  Dark Crusade is the sequel to the previous two entries in the series and is a step in a new direction for the game.  The orginal and Winter Assault were story driven games based solely around the Blood Ravens in the first game and the Imperial Guard in the next game.  Dark Crusade is a way to have a single player story revolve around each race available in game by having a mini crusade span roughly an entire continent, which seems to span the entire planet or so.  Each faction has a starting location and they fight and conquer territory as they go.  Certain territories grant abilities that can affect gameplay and others add honor guard units that act as free infantry and units to fight with.  So far this has been the best game  in the series.","September 1, 2014","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First off it's a stand alone expansion pack so you don't need Dawn of War or Dawn of War Winter Assualt to play it. It adds two new factions that make the total number of playable factions up to 7 in the game. The new factions add more variety to an already great RTS game. The campaign has also been completely rehauled for Dark Crusade and it definitely benefits from it. The new Risk-like campaign allows you to play with all 7 of the factions on a world map where you managed your territories and then move your army to battle the other factions in the standard Dawn of War RTS battles. There are also many small new features Dark Crusade has like how the factions in the previous Dawn of War games got new units. In the end Dark Crusade expands on what made Dawn of War an excellent RTS game and will forever make Dark Crusade one of my favorite RTS games. If you enjoy Relic Entertainment's other RTS games like Company of Heroes then you'll definitely enjoy the gameplay of Dark Crusade. Fans of the RTS genre should definitely give this game a go as well as fans of the Warhammer 40k universe.","December 1, 2013","true","48.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you enjoy games like Company of Heroes and Starcraft then this is a can't miss title.\n\nThe game is set on the planet Kronus where the Imperial Guard rule in the name of the Emperor but all is not well on Kronus. The Ork invasion has begun anew on this planet and with all the fighting above the ancient killing machines known as the Necron have awaken which in turn has caused the Tau to appear on the planet in an effort to stop them from annihilating all life on the planet. Of course all this extra violence has attracted the attention of the Blood God of Chaos attention and brought the Chaos Marines onto Kronus. And with the Chaos Marines the Eldar quickly came in tow to stop them from ressurecting more demons and overtaking more planets. The Space Marines (namely the Blood Ravens) are ordered to cleanse the planet now for it is considered overrun with the Alien, the Unclean, and the Heretic. Upon their arrival on the planet they are told their are precious artifacts on Kronus that must be reclaimed at all costs and thus order the Imperial Guard to evacuate from Kronus in order for them to purge Kronus and reclaim the artifacts. The Guard promptly refuses and sparks an intense war with the Blood Ravens. This all quickly turns into a nasty open war.\nHow this war plays out however is solely up to you however. The game gives you a decent background for each race and the events leading to the war but it has not true canon story beyond that. Your campaign mode consists of picking 1 of several races (Space Marines, Imperial Guard, Eldar, Orks, Chaos Marines, Tau, or Necrons) and then using them to conquer the entire map. The campaign starts off on the world screen where you can reinforce your territories launch attacks or upgrade your Honor Guard, which are essentially free beefed up versions of your basic units, as well as upgrade your commander unit with Wargear, items that add health attack or other bonus abilities to your commander unit. Each race has its own Stronghold which if taken will kick them from the game for that campaign. Capture all strongholds to win.\nAll in all the game looks great despite some age, it sounds great and has a decent soundtrack and its positively steeped in lore for every race. Theres dozens of novels written on this series. I highly recommend this game to any and all fans of RTS games. Gotta cut this one short since Steam wont let me write any more about this game!

Rather than following a linear path of objectives like the previous DOW and Winter assault, it throws in a Meta game where you are fighting for complete control of a Planet, which throws in tactical decisions on where to buy more support for the territory you just won or to bolster an earlier victory site.

Similar to starcraft but with an overall map campaign that plays just like Rise of Nations but even better! As you conquer more maps, you upgrade the armor and weapons of your main commander making him that much more powerfull and dangerous. You also gain all kind of bonuses to beat the remaining oponents more easily.\n\nThere are a lot of factions to choose (8+) and each one play very differently (except the space marine and chaos marines, which are very similar because the chaos marines are space marines converted to the chaos side). The necron for example have very slow ground units so you must build them in big waves and then you send them slowly grinding your ennemies! They are quite resilient but you ain't going to zerg the ennemy with them. And once you get your citadel flying, then boom! nuclear attack all the time on the ennemy! hehehe\n\nThe ai is pretty rough even at normal difficulty. Prepare to be zerged fast in the maps you choose! Also, i noticed that the number on the map which is supposed to give you an overall difficulty factor for taking that territory is pointless. I've taken big number territory with ease and been destroyed in an instant on territory with a one difficulty rating! So i would not give too much importance to that number. From what i've seen of the factions, the chaos and space marine seem to be the toughest to beat. They are fast even with their infantry, they got troops that can fly and bypass all your defense while striking in your backline and they are tought. A bit unfair for the other factions tought.","January 19, 2014","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each territory (That isn't a Stronghold, which you must capture to eliminate that race from the game) has a related 'Honour Guard' unit which you can buy with planetary requisition (The resource required for overview map purchases) or a 'perk' such as Forward Bases, allowing you to use planetary requisition to buy buildings to start a battle with including your HQ.\n\nOverall a varied and in-depth RTS (Which is utterly different gameplay-wise to it's successor, DoWII), with hours upon hours of play time available to those with a mind to try all races, all campaigns, and play it thoroughly.","June 25, 2012","true","226.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's very well polished, has a great tutorial and is very well balanced.\nWhat makes the game a real winner is that it's easy to play, but hard to master. Camera manipulation, map scrolling, location bookmarking, building, recruiting, resource management, unit selection, unit grouping and unit direction feel very natural and logical and have been very well implemented. This is often something that is done so poorly in many RTS's and ruins what would have otherwise been a good game, but DOW makes it easy, which means that I can crack on with the more complicated management of my bases, armies and resource gathering.\n\nI also love the element where you take a bit with you at the end of each mission to the next mission because that makes logical sense if you're running a war campaign, instead of starting each new mission with 1 builder unit.\n\nOne thing that can be improved is troop path finding, including formations. Then again, I still haven't found and RTS that does this overly well and I just have to micro-manage my armies more like usual.","February 13, 2015","true","33.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Rather than following a linear path of objectives like the previous DOW and Winter assault, it throws in a Meta game where you are fighting for complete control of a Planet, which throws in tactical decisions on where to buy more support for the territory you just won or to bolster an earlier victory site.

Unlike the unbalanced garbage that was Winter Assault, the Dark Crusade is a lot of fun. There are plenty of factions to choose from, a whole planet to conquer, and a nice variety in scenery and missions. When all is said and done, it's actually longer than the original game, and that's just comparing one playthru of each.\n\n+7 factions to choose from, so while the campaign is basically the same for all of them, each faction is pretty unique and interesting\n+The story is decent for an RTS, and isn't riddled with overly long cutscenes like the base game\n+Scenery ranges from tundra to mountains to deserts to jungles to ancient ruins to an underworld.\n+One playthru took me nearly 20 hours, so you get quite the bang for your buck.\n\n-Pathfinding is still infuriatingly atrocious. It requires a lot of micromanagement, and will lead to you taking a lot of excess damage at times.\n-Graphics are dated, but that is to be expected, and it hardly makes the game unplayable. My biggest gripe is it can be difficult to command a large army when you can't zoom out very far.\n-Maybe it's just because I played as the Tau Empire...but I saw very few Warhammers, and I require at least 40K.","November 3, 2015","true","19.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's very well polished, has a great tutorial and is very well balanced.\nWhat makes the game a real winner is that it's easy to play, but hard to master. Camera manipulation, map scrolling, location bookmarking, building, recruiting, resource management, unit selection, unit grouping and unit direction feel very natural and logical and have been very well implemented. This is often something that is done so poorly in many RTS's and ruins what would have otherwise been a good game, but DOW makes it easy, which means that I can crack on with the more complicated management of my bases, armies and resource gathering.\n\nI also love the element where you take a bit with you at the end of each mission to the next mission because that makes logical sense if you're running a war campaign, instead of starting each new mission with 1 builder unit.\n\nOne thing that can be improved is troop path finding, including formations. Then again, I still haven't found and RTS that does this overly well and I just have to micro-manage my armies more like usual.","February 13, 2015","true","33.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All i knew about were the cool trailers that I saw in electronics shops on big TVs as demos... Never once I thought that I would rate any strategies on par with warcraft or red alert & similar but here I am to say that 40k is my new favourite strategy series. I got this in a bundle and started playing first. Worth every cent... however i would not suggest paying a full price for the original warhammer 40k even GOTY as it only had a single campaign of 11 missions by Blood Ravens(human race) only. Nevertheless fun but frankly speaking I`d rather pay same money to rule like 8 different races that must be commanded in 8 different ways (or more on your own preference) to conquer the entire planet. BUT HOWEVER!!!! If you are looking for a game like C&C where you can spam hundreds of units as long as you have the money and swarm the entire map with your units and enjoy the fact that you are not epileptic then im afraid that this game is a bummer... but if you simply want a GOOD well balanced and structured gameplay (although the story line presence is not that heavy in this game it is still a good one and makes sense) + good voice acting... Not the best graphics and unit design but present still... 8/10","June 22, 2014","true","51.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The campaign took me a while to beat and it sure had its challenges. The way the warhammer dawn of war game's is set up is very fun and it had a great story behind it. One of the reasons why I like this game so much is the way that you can organize a battle plan with different factions. For example if you're eldar you will always be outnumbered but you have some of the best soldiers behind your back.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ck39/recommended/4580/","ck39","Draco","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ck39/","727 products in account","If you are a fan of either the Warhammer 40K universe, or RTS games, or both, then this game is for you. Out of all the Dawn of War games (excluding Dawn of War 2), this one is hands down my favorite. I have sunk a LOT of hours into this game, and I'm only about a quarter of the way finished with it.\n\nHere's how the game plays: You pick a race (Space Marines, Chaos, Tau, Ethereal, Orks, Imperial Guard) at the start of the game. Each race has their own strengths and weaknesses. My personal favorite are the Space Marines, who are very versatile and can easily adapt to any situation. Once you pick a race, the game begins. It is set up like a board game, similar to Risk. Each race takes a turn, and on your turn you can choose where you want to move to. Where you choose determines what race you will fight in that area. Every territory also rewards you with Honor Guard, which are elite units (VERY powerful compared to your regular units). In addition to this, there are a couple territories that have special abilities, such as the Spaceport that lets you attack anywhere, or Forward Base which lets you start matches with some buildings already made. The game continues on like this, with you attacking and defending. Your commander unit also acquires War Gear as you play, which makes them even more powerful.\n\nThe real combat of this game is in the attacking or defending phase. The game plays as standard RTS fare. You gather resources, build structures, and grow your army. There is a lot of variety within a single race, which really helps to mix up the gameplay. You take over resource points and fortify them as your forces clash with your opponent. Once your army is built up enough, then you can obliterate your opponent and win the territory. Two things are important to remember, though. First, the way you leave a territory is what you will come back to when you are defending it. If you fortify it heavily, then you will be hard to defeat when the battle comes back to that area. Secondly, the special territories all have unique battles. The Spaceport, for example, has you gathering special units scattered across the map. The first side to collect 6 of these wins.\n\nGraphics wise, this game is behind what you'd expect from a modern RTS game, but it gets the job done very well. The units are all very detailed, and pleasing to look at when you zoom the camera in. The only downside is that the terrain looks a little bland sometimes. However, this game is not about looking pretty, it's about the battles. And combat is really well done in this game. If you've played the other Dawn of War games, then you know how it goes. It's really cool to see the animations of units in combat, they don't just pummel each other until a health bar is gone, there is interaction between clashing forces.\n\nIn addition to the campaign, there is a skirmish mode that you can play to your heart's content. If you and a buddy have this game, then you can also jump online and play against each other in online multiplayer. All in all, this is a great game. Don't let Steam fool you, I've been playing this long before I bought it on here, and my hours in it are easily 200+. I like replaying the game as the other races to see what I've missed. If you like Warhammer 40K or RTS games, this one's for you. If you aren't sure, then grab it if it goes on sale. Trust me, it's worth it.","February 24, 2014","true","63.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not only are their campaigns very very long (dependant on how you play them, obviously), but they're also always different, as they're non-linear and battles are decided by where a player decides to move their army on a risk-style overview map of the planet Kronus (Or The Kaurava system for Soulstorm), split into territories. Each territory (That isn't a Stronghold, which you must capture to eliminate that race from the game) has a related 'Honour Guard' unit which you can buy with planetary requisition (The resource required for overview map purchases) or a 'perk' such as Forward Bases, allowing you to use planetary requisition to buy buildings to start a battle with including your HQ.\n\nOverall a varied and in-depth RTS (Which is utterly different gameplay-wise to it's successor, DoWII), with hours upon hours of play time available to those with a mind to try all races, all campaigns, and play it thoroughly.","June 25, 2012","true","226.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you need to save money, this is the one to buy. It has better economic balances than either of the two preceding games (Dawn of War and Winter Assault). There are diverse races to choose from. The campaign map is set up like a game of risk, so you direct the war rather than following a linear campaign. Heroes advance in power through their wargear. You earn wargear by accomplishing special objectives over the course of a campaign. Eventually you unlock them all, so I wouldn't call it customization. The enemies push back. All of this is true for Soulstorm as well, but it falls short. Dark Crusade has a better world map in every way (it is easier to see where armies are, which territories you can move to, and what bonuses you have acquired), you can fortify your positions effectively, and the wargear, while barely different, is better.","May 20, 2015","true","85.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most factions will in general prefer one over the other, the exception being the Space Marines who are Jacks-of-all-trades. As such, if one faction prefers one kind they will naturally be weak at another. For example, I prefer the Imperial Guard, who use ranged units almost exclusively. As such, if I can't keep, say, the Orcs, or especially the Necrons at a distance, my men in their weak armor will get chewed up and spat out. If I can hold them back however, they'll find themselves unable to survive the continual barrage of artillery, autocannon fire, lascannon volleys, and tank shells :D the key, for the IG, is to keep them away. It works differently for each faction. Know your strengths and weaknesses and the day can be yours!\n\n10/10 would let Chaos burn the much-hated Necrons to the ground so I can win the game faster again.","August 11, 2015","true","40.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Assumed that it was an overratted series the internet hype way to much.  Merely bought this because it was on sale for a cheap price and so far the reviews are saying the game is good.\n\nAfter installing and spending three hours of this game: HOLY ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥!  WHY DIDN'T I GET INTO THIS SERIES BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL!?!  NOW I WANT PUNCH PAST ME IN THE FACE FOR SAYING ONLY NECKBEARDS CAN ENJOY SUCH A GLORIOUS SERIES AS WARHAMMER 40K!!!!\n\n\nNow for the actually  review:\n- As an expansion to the Dawn of War game, Dark Crusade live up to title of being the best of the four games.\n- The gameplay is easy to understand but a challenge to get a hang of as difficulty varies based on what army you are going up against.\n- The graphics aged well for a sixth generation game, especially when running on a lower processing machine not built for gaming.\n- The sounds are great whether it is the epic music the plays in the background or the ham infested voice acting of the characters in the games (mostly the latter, a game this over the top must have Brian Blessed level of ham).\n- The community for the game is friendly and would love to do a match or two (fair warning, you may wanna buy the previous two games of Dawn of War to be able to play all the armies).\n- The campaign is awesome and open ended for its Risk-style of settings and RPG-esque rewards it gives out for successful battles.\n- Customization is awesome as you can color your army in any way you want.\n- And lets not forget the mods!  If you are not getting any satisfaction from this game whether it is gameplay not akin to the original tabletop or a race you want to play isn't in the game, there is a mod that improves the game.\n\nSo in short if you are a fan of the tabletop game, this is a pretty good representation of the game it is based on and a must have.  If not, not only is it a good standalone game but also one that would make you a fan of the series real fast.","June 23, 2015","true","44.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I get myself going with a little protection, start building up some better marines, make a few heavies. I forget the name of the map, but it has a definite choke point, and it may be something as simple as "The Wall". So, I set up my turrets, pop over a few marines, and a few Ork come through and are just gone in a matter of second. So, I build up more turrets, some more heavy bolters, and let the Ork camps build themselves up as I do the same -- but I did half of my time on defense. So, a massive wave of Orks comes through, and wave after wave of Ork is just decimated by the defense grid, along with an Orbital Bombardment or two added in for mostly overkill. What was left behind was a sea of bloodied bodies; truly one of greatest things I've seen in an RTS.","August 14, 2015","true","127.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Something very simple makes this particular game stand out: fortifying individual areas on the strategic map.  Comparing this to Soulstorm, as they are similar, Dark Crusade eliminates some of the tiresome defenses you run into with Soulstorm.  Constantly fighting over a single piece of land gets old when you start every defense with one building and a servitor.  Compare that with DC starting you with everything but the units you ended the last tactical battle with.  Something small, but it made a big difference to me and kept me coming back.  I also highly recommend Titanium Wars for a mod as it adds tons to the game.","January 5","true","167.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With a world map conquest campaign, multiplayer, and skirmish matches there is plenty of content. With a uniqe concept of the stratgic points (Which i'm not sure if this game inveted them) adds a fresh feal to the useal mass,metal,ect in RTS. The game runs Beatiful, which is expected due to its age and i have yet to experance any crashes or other game breaking glitches. The game was a tutorial for each of the factions which explains the game very well, so even newcommers to genral RTS will pick up on in quickly. The only thing that trully bothered me was the camaras zoom. As a fan of the Supreme Commander games i'm used to being able to zoom out to see the whole map while in this game only allows the minum amount of zoom. Even with mods, the game will use a sort of fog to block you from seeing the whole map. This made getting a visual picture of the map difficult, even with the mini map in the corner. Though after enough playtime, you will get used to the maps and might not even need a map.\n\nInconclusion this is a game is a classic RTS worth a download, especialy if you love the Warrhammer universe.

The combat is relentless and forces you to think and react quickly and appropriately, and I enjoyed the feeling of conquering a world through the different skirmishes. Yet, even continuous winning can become a huge slog of tedium that will wear anyone down over time. I'm fairly certain this took longer to complete than the original Dawn of War and Winter Assault combined, and since the final expansion pack, Soulstorm, is the exact-same gameplay as Dark Crusade, with two new armies I don't care about, I won't be playing that any time soon either.\n\nWant to read the full review?

NOW I WANT PUNCH PAST ME IN THE FACE FOR SAYING ONLY NECKBEARDS CAN ENJOY SUCH A GLORIOUS SERIES AS WARHAMMER 40K!!!!\n\n\nNow for the actually  review:\n- As an expansion to the Dawn of War game, Dark Crusade live up to title of being the best of the four games.\n- The gameplay is easy to understand but a challenge to get a hang of as difficulty varies based on what army you are going up against.\n- The graphics aged well for a sixth generation game, especially when running on a lower processing machine not built for gaming.\n- The sounds are great whether it is the epic music the plays in the background or the ham infested voice acting of the characters in the games (mostly the latter, a game this over the top must have Brian Blessed level of ham).\n- The community for the game is friendly and would love to do a match or two (fair warning, you may wanna buy the previous two games of Dawn of War to be able to play all the armies).\n- The campaign is awesome and open ended for its Risk-style of settings and RPG-esque rewards it gives out for successful battles.\n- Customization is awesome as you can color your army in any way you want.\n- And lets not forget the mods!  If you are not getting any satisfaction from this game whether it is gameplay not akin to the original tabletop or a race you want to play isn't in the game, there is a mod that improves the game.\n\nSo in short if you are a fan of the tabletop game, this is a pretty good representation of the game it is based on and a must have.  If not, not only is it a good standalone game but also one that would make you a fan of the series real fast.","June 23, 2015","true","44.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Dawn of War vanilla was good, yes, but its only drawback was the short single player campaign.\n\nDark Crusade's single player campaign is designed like a Risk map, where you get a province on a planet and have to wrest control of the planet from the other 6 races (Space Marines, Chaos, Orks, Eldar, Imperial Guard, Tau and Necrons). In each province you have to buiold a base and then destroy the other faction's base. The more provinces you take, the more perks you get for your army (production bonuses, armor for your commander, veteran squads to boost your amry, etc.). It lacks a bit in story, but taking a enemy fortress allows for some narrative.\n\nAgain, it is in the multiplayer or skirmish games where this game shines (don't take my word for it based on the amount of hours I played - I already bought the Dawn of War box set and played the crap out of it - for the Emperor!)","June 24, 2015","true","38.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Something very simple makes this particular game stand out: fortifying individual areas on the strategic map.  Comparing this to Soulstorm, as they are similar, Dark Crusade eliminates some of the tiresome defenses you run into with Soulstorm.  Constantly fighting over a single piece of land gets old when you start every defense with one building and a servitor.  Compare that with DC starting you with everything but the units you ended the last tactical battle with.  Something small, but it made a big difference to me and kept me coming back.  I also highly recommend Titanium Wars for a mod as it adds tons to the game.","January 5","true","167.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Graphics are still good, even after so many years, and the gameplay is complex yet easy to understand.\nThe only problem I could find is that sometimes units' voices overlap those during cutscenes or "important" messages you hear during gameplay, causing a bit of a mess, although I believe this can be fixed by simply editing the standard audio settings.\n\nTalking about the game's Campaign, instead, I'm happy with it, although my previous review was negative because of the Tau (and then Eldar) Stronghold, which to me seemed to be a little too hard, easily becoming frustrating after a few tries.\n\nFor me, this game gets a solid 9/10.","June 1","true","17.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
