"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yyrkroon/recommended/410990/","yyrkroon","Yyrkroon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yyrkroon/","452 products in account","Horribly flawed and failed successor to two of the greatest turn-based strategy games of 1990's.  The developers' ambitions and designs far exceeded their abilities and funding.\n\nThe user interface is busy and cumbersome with no clear calls to action and a good deal of information with no purpose.  The interface fights the user at every step. It is far from obvious as to how one should navigate or even return to previously visited screens.  Despite the numerous switches, toggles, and other interface elements, feedback is abysmal.  For example, when designing a new ship, the game might tell the player the design is invalid, but it doesn't indicate why, or how to correct the flaw.\n\nBehind the horrific UI are abysmal systems that attempt to remove the player from actually playing the game - by design!\n\nThe AI is beyond horrible.  It is not uncommon for AI players to play with such a degree of passivity that it feels like there are no AI players at all, and the game turns into some strange space-solitaire.\n\nWhile it promised a trade off of losing some features from the previous two games in exchange for existing new features and systems, it only made good on half the bargain: removing beloved features, but not introducing anything of significance to replace them.\n\nI bought this game on its original release day, and again with the Master of Orion reboot.\n\nSave your time for play something worth your time, instead.","March 2","false","0.3"," 88 of 110 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","88","110","3","6"

And they do it consistently so I have no idea what that planet is really like.\n\nI'm sorry I purchased the bundle, and would like my money back. 49.99 is too much for a very dated MOO 1 and 2 and a buggy MOO3.  Steam may want to pass off the bugginess of software they sell as a manufacturer problem, but that's not who I paid money. I paid Steam. So Steam either needs to work on fixing the software, or not sell it. Have some pride.\n\nWhy? Because selling terrible software like this hurts the Steam brand.\n","March 4","false","38.7"," 48 of 85 people (56%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","56","48","85","7","3"

The efforts made to make the combat system work, the ability to customize ships, the cute and sometimes interesting tech descriptions, the variety of races, the hidden 3D galaxy map (It actually is 3D, you have to hit a certain key combo for it, I think it's page down?) give the game a charm. Are parts of it not polished to an ideal shine? Yeeeaahhh, but compared to a lot of newer games out there that are broken from day 1 and don't even approach being fixed when they're abandoned, MoO3 has a lot to offer.\n\nAnd yes, I know, I have barely an hours, I actually owned a CD copy for like the past fifteen years and it's one of the few games I return to every half-year when other games I might play a match or two and then never pick it up again.","April 5","true","12.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

If you got them you will find a remarkable experience. If you are not able to catch the games sense then you are not the right person to play this game, it´s not the games fault. For most of the players it comes down to a user error, the software works fine and does what it´s supposed to. The thing why people hate it, is because of it is a game that wants you to manage not only one aspect but lots of aspects on a micro, exo and macrolevel. If you hold at least a degree in sociology or psychology i recommend the game to you. If you are not of this kind go and play stuff on your level.\n\nOnly proceed if you are the kind of peson who can dive into something and stay calm whenever challenges come up. The game is imense challenging and you can play not only for hours on just one game, you can play for weeks (you should be able to study). It comes down that if you play on the highest settings you might aswell plan two month every day spending between 5 - 10 hours with the game to finish it at least once.\n\nNever ever again did I get so much out of a game. It is the ultimate challenge -- my advice do not play without brains and the abilities i put up first.\n\nThis is more then just a game, proceed with caution. If you are not capable enough, drop it, it will wreck you.\n\nTo make it easy to understand: If you like sweet things, then step away here, it will frustrate you,it´s definitly not candy! If you like bitter things and you can handle a beating from time to time plus you like learning, then this is the real deal. This game does what no other game holds to you.","May 15","true","3.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Well it turns out it's not me it's the game, I don't even concider this a part of the MoO 1 or 2 or even part of the forth game (which is really great so far).

The strategy guide was written like a text book by a guy who really didn't care or want to play the game. The game was just flat out boring. I remember a thread on their message board years ago called the Masturbator of Orion cause thats what you did in this game. It was the funniest thread ever and that thread was almost worth the price of the game!

The graphics may be severely dated, and the UI will be a challenge, but the content makes the effort more than worthwhile.","March 7","true","147.1"," 19 of 59 people (32%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","32","19","59","7","4"
