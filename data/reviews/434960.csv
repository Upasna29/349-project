You will be watching a generic blue/lightblue ball roll across the two generic sci-fi hex patterns that are featured in UE4 for the majority of the time. Most of the other assets remind me of generic space assets, probably freely available. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, again, there is $4 pricetag. Considering that the achievement art looks like it was tossed together in paint and the menus are reminiscent of 2003, I'd say that this is not a particularly artistically endowed game. Again, you don't have to be a great artist, but a commercial game project typically doesn't just recycle art. The music is also generic and loopy.\nPhysics get wonky when two or more things colide at once, and surfaces behave unnaturally. The friction of the ball on the generic platform does not correspond to how it looks like it should.\nEarly levels are tedious and uninteresting.\nThe camera is kind of uncomfortable to adjust, and the menu does not lock the camera.\n\nWhile this game shows some okay principles underlying the gameplay, the actual design of the game is less satisfying and definitely does not justify the pricetag, especially since it seems more like a "hey, look at what I can do with Unreal Engine 4" than a finished product.","February 8","false","0.4"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","26","27","0","4"

The majority of the challenge and frustration exists due to a fundamentally broken system.  The developer’s lack of any replies on the forum just adds to the sense that this was a half attempt at a game that he himself did not think it was worthy of his time to bother playing it through before selling it.\nPros:\n-Skip level feature.\n-Working achievements.\n-Handful of levels are nicely designed with a puzzle to solve.\nCons:\n-Changing the quality setting in the game actually changes the way the ball moves.  That’s right - some levels are easier or near impossible based on the set video quality.\n-Next button at the end of the stage sometimes skips ahead to some random level.  I guess that could be a pro for speed-running it.\n-Using Continue from the main menu takes longer to load the level than selecting it from the level select menu.\n-The pause menu doesn’t actually pause the game, it just stops the ball’s movement, but then gravity still has an effect and brings it down.\n-Closing the pause menu has to be done with the mouse and it moves the camera while doing so.\n-The camera defaults to a view where the ball is not in full view and you have to readjust the camera every time.\n-False advertising – the store page claims there are 8 unlockable skins, but these are nowhere to be seen in the game, even after completing all of the levels.\n-Broken levels.  One level in particular, 31, has a rotating staircase that does not allow the player to ever make it to the top.  I wasted at least an hour of my time before realizing that it just wasn’t going to happen.\n\nI really wanted to enjoy this game, but not possible in its current state.","April 7","false","7.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","4"

I don't know if it's the controls or the physics, but it feels like you're skating on ice with no brakes all the time.  So painful.\n\n2/10","April 30","false","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"
