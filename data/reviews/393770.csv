Sound easy right? Well if you go too fast or too slow you fail, if you don't swing long enough on a vine you fail.\n- The levels themselves are overly difficult early on with thorns and enemies to avoid, and deceptive vines that you slip off of.","April 3","false","0.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game starts up and runs fine, graphically it is nice to look at.. however, those are the only good things I can say about it.\n\nIn this game you have to jump, swing on vines, collect bananas, and land on platforms...on paper it sounds like a basic, but hopefully fun time killer game.  In reality, it may have the worst controls I have come across in a Steam game this year.  I played using a keyboard and grabbing the vines would only work "sometimes", and the jump mechanic is terrible and frustrating.  Overall, the controls are so bad I could barely play abou 30 minutes of this game before calling it quits.\n\nI understand that this game was supposed to be difficult, however bad controls should not be the reason a game is difficult.\n\nFor the price the game is listed at, it is way over priced.  If the developer would work on the controls it may not have been a total loss, but at this point, I do not recommend this game.  Honestly, this is the sort of game I'd expect to find for $0.99 on the mobile market, not on Steam.\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in a few minutes of my first impression gameplay, here's a link...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXk91l2Bo_E\n\nI make these videos to help viewers see more of the game as well as give my honest opinion.\n\n\n**Key provided by developer for review purposes*","April 7","false","0.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

For people who love tough platformers this game does it. Pretty decent graphics, controls are little pain getting used to especially with a controller.","March 27","true","0.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
