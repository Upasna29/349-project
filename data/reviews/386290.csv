I wouldn't say this game is for everyone. You basically try to bounce a ball between colored squares and then into blocks to rack up the highest score possible. The gameplay felt smooth.  Graphics were decent. Music was not bad. It's only 5 bucks and if you want to ricochet balls into blocks, by all means get this game!

And they are right. This vr stuff isn’t formulaic. There isn’t no easy answer, and I can’t imagine developing a game at the pace of innovation the vr world is going through. I’m not returning the game, and I hope that the devs are successful with making this game more comfortable for vr.\n\nI will double down on the fact that pressing a move forward button that doesn’t move in the direction you are facing is very disorienting.

I don't get vr sick easily but this game did it for me. There is no teleport mechanic. Also there is no easy way to tell which way 'you' are facing.

GREAT!\nHello everyone I'm reviewing Kumoon : Ballistic Physics Puzzle\non behalf of the groups Youtubers Unite and Twitchers Unite\nThe developer for the game was kind enough to hand out beta keys for the groups which was super kind of him.\n\nNow for the review\nAs a puzzle hater by nature I must say I really really enjoyed Kumoon! the game runs smoothly and it does not take too much time to figure out what is going on.\nthe mechanics are simple and the sole idea is just great and fun!\n\nThe 3d Puzzle game that it is has its limits but I think that the developer did a good job on this.\n\nThe objective\nsimply score points by hitting your bouncy balls on the walls placed around the levels and hit the blue boxes to proceed!\n\nThe game progresses to develop difficulty but it didn't get on the level where as someone could begin raging on it!\nI was blown away of the physics and simplicity of this game.\nWhen the walls began falling down from the cieling upon hitting them to create new ways of trickshotting with your bouncing balls, really nice idea in my opinion!\nSome of the maps have basically, tilted rooms, what i mean is, the floor is not horizontal. This really really got me hooked because I loved the new ways of trickshotting like that!\n\nYou can also use your character, which reminds me of Eva from Wall-E :), to make the walls placed around the levels fall over, this creates new ways of trickshotting again!\nThe game REALLY develops into something challenging the more you play it!\nOh, by the way. Love the menu, especially in-game where it kinda just, floats in front of you!\n\nThe game is wicked fun! I can only fully recommend it for people that like these kinds of games!\n\nA few specifications\n3 Tutorial Levels to get you inside the head of the robot.\n15 Easy Levels, to get you acquainted and to have fun with even those holding a gamepad for their first time.\n15 Medium Levels, for those comfortable with the controls and willing to forge further.\n15 Hard Levels, for aspiring speedrunners, aficionados of intrigue, and those who think pain is the definition of fun.\n\nVR - support via the oculus rift!

The more walls the ball bounces off of the higher the score will be when/if the ball hits the box/stack.\n- The game feems somewhat mindless, as instead of lining up your shot it's far easier to just mindlessly throw balls around until you score enough points without really aiming. (this could fixed if there was a limit to the amount of balls you could throw)\n- The levels lack variety in terms of the environment making it feel very repetitive\n- Lacks a "purpose" or a story to go along with the game, what am I doing? why am I hitting blocks?

It controls well and I thought the tutorial was informative enough. The object of the game is to bounce balls off of blue walls to hit cubes. The more blue walls you hit with the ball gives the cubes more points. Some levels I got almost double the points required to advance, others barely enough.

It's an immersive and enjoyable experience, learning the rules of the environment. You are looking to score a certain amount of points for each level, and have to knock over blocks to score points. It's a simple premise but each level has it's own challenges requiring you to adapt. It's not a crazy-deep game you'll spend years trying to defeat, it's an enjoyable journey through level. I highly suggest it, in that I feel more relaxed after playing and frankly I could use more games that have that centering effect.","February 24","true","4.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The game is a really laid back puzzle game so if you only like action games, Kumoon will not be for you. If you are looking for a puzzle game where you can relax while playing, Kumoon might be what you are looking for. Kumoon is an interesting game and I had fun playing it. If the game's concept interests you I think you will enjoy the game.\n\nUnfortnately the game is on the easy side. While I haven't finished the game yet, I am on the hard levels and I am still not having that much trouble defeating the levels on my first attempt. Unless the last levels are much harder, I think most people could breeze through the game pretty quickly. Due to this fact I wish the game included more challenging levels.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy from the developer but received no other compensation for this review.\n\nRead My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com]","November 10, 2015","true","3.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

So far I have enjoyed what I have seen.  The optional VR support is quite a cool feature, that I think should work well with a game like this.  However I do not own a DK2 so I was only able to test the game in its standard form.\n\nIf you are into Physics based puzzle games, I surely recommend this one.  The controls work well, and graphically it is well done.  I am curious to see if this game ever opens up to workshop mods since there are not that many levels in it at the moment.\n\nIf you are interested in viewing my Quick Review on this game, here is a link.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zGdEUcBkg8","December 3, 2015","true","1.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The simple and mostly wordless in-game interface, HUD and tutorial are a plus, and likely made it easier for the developer to provide a LOT of language options without worry about poor grammar or syntax. My only concern is that really small children will get frustrated when they can't figure out how to ricohet the ball enough to get the high scores.

Firstly, that you’ll be firing something to solve physics based puzzles and secondly that this game is dull. In the case of Kumoon however first impressions are accurate.\n\nYou play as a cute little robot (think the lovechild of EVE and an orange bin), a robot that the developers decided was so cute that they put a mirror into the first level so you can see it properly. You have the inexplicable ability to fire a seemingly infinite amount of balls at cubes, although why is never really explained.\n\nThe objective of each level is the same – hit all of the cubes and make sure you get above a set amount of points. Normally hitting a cube is worth only one point, but every bounce off a blue area before contacting the cube increases the value of the cubes by one point up to a maximum of nine points. So the idea is simple – make the ball bounce as much as possible before it impacts the cube to make sure you win.\n\nThe problem is that whilst the physics is predictable the path of your balls really isn’t. This means that setting up clever shots, presumably what you’re supposed to do, isn’t a very effective way of clearing the level. Because you can fire multiple balls and the counter only resets whenever you fire a ball the best strategy seems to be figuring out some kind of rough shot that would give the desired effect and then letting loose six or so balls. Alternatively, shooting balls at random can sometimes get the job done just as well.\n\nThe game has 45 levels and they do get progressively harder as the cubes get more out of the way, and you have to do some simple platforming to get into spots to shoot at them. But that’s really all it has to offer – there are no added mechanics or anything of much substance. Completing the levels also generally feels more like luck than skill, and this leads to a rather unsatisfactory experience.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, the game is perfectly functional and doesn’t look awful but it’s dull, uninventive and unsatisfying. It’s title as a puzzle game is also somewhat dubious and in all honesty it’s better avoided.","December 5, 2015","false","2.7"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"
