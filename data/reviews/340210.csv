(I don't remember any crashes\nor game-breaking bugs)\n\nWhat I liked most is that the mechanics feel fresh for turn-based 4x games.\nLove it to start in the Pre Warp Era (a setting, you can also start later), first\ncaring for the main planet, finding the right city layout for the 4 cities you\ngot on each planet and racing to the next era in order to colonize more\nplanets. It's really well done.\n\nThe only thing I was a bit disappointed about, was that there were absolutly\nno news on steam and there were no updates.\n\nBut whoooo! Today my steam account loaded a new version of this game,\nand it's not just a small bugfix. There's a new major feature (trade routes)\nand as i started I realized that the game mechanics were refined and i have\nto learn new tactics and it adds some extra spice.\n\nI think this dev-team does it right, not a small update every 2 weeks, with\npotential problems that afford hotfixes.\nNo they take there time and then boooom, there comes something new.\nFor my part I'm satisfied again.\n\nReally wish them the best and that they have enough funds to realize\nthis project.\n\nIf you wonder that my gametime doesn't go above 18 hours this time,\nI convinced two of my friends to play ESO with me, and if i dive into\na new game, especially an mmo, i focus on that one.","July 1, 2015","true","19.2"," 33 of 35 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","33","35","2","0"

Yes. Should you buy it right now? That depends but do be warned that it's in a pretty early state.\n\nWhat I love about this game is the consistency of Space. So many games set in space just use it as a backdrop to play out the same mechanics as a game based on a planet. It's more of switching the ocean to black with dots and pretending it's a space game now. Predestination does not do that, it's a game that happens in space and that's pretty fantastic.\n\nThe truth is I have a hard time playing it because I like everything it does so much I just want it to be finished so I can sink a boatload of hours into it.","February 14, 2015","true","1.4"," 49 of 66 people (74%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","74","49","66","7","2"

The colony side is fun, simple enough to be easy to learn, complex enough to have plenty of room for strategy and, hopefully they'll expand it even more. The space aspect is also pretty good in it's early state, but is a bit bare boned (which is to be expected)\n\nThe only complaints I have is the technology screen, to me, it feel like it's restricted, and some of the technologies that you have to choose the one over the other seem to not be comparable trade off's. And of some of those technologies (the difference between solar/geothermal/wind and wave) are not explained well in terms of their bonuses and their negatives\nAnd my other complaint is the UI. There have been several points where I right click to cancel/back out of something and it brings up a radial menu. And the spatial map could need some improvment when it comes to ship movement and the general going into and out of the planet/orbit/space view.\n\nOne thing that I'm hoping that they'll look into is ground combat. So far as I've seen they've mentioned nothing of the sort, but I would like to see them do something with it, maybe along the lines of loading up troopships with units and landing them on the planet to overwhelm the planet defenders, have orbital ships provide bombardment, and have certain spaceships be able to land and be naval ships","May 24, 2015","true","2.8"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","21","21","0","0"

Very strong emphasis on planning ahead, exploring planets before colonizing them and identifying key sites for resource location and efficiency for cities.\n\nIt seems like you will be mostly battling your own population (either against the economy or morale) for the first part of the game before you even ecounter anyone else. Definitely not a "grab every planet and available spot in sight" type of game but big rewards for placing cities intelligently and conservatively.\n\nIt's a 4x game with a refreshing twist. Still in Alpha and it shows at times but definitely enjoyable in its current state and should only get better with more updates.","December 27, 2015","true","15.8"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","20","20","0","0"

I've been playing this as it develops through alpha and it's been a great experience.  Devs are active in updates and discussion boards, gameplay is unique, and most importantly it's just fun to play.  Hell i could play a map without opponents and spend hours just exploring and developing my different stars/worlds/trade routes/cities.  Don't get me wrong there's still work to be done and rough edges that need rounding but all the ideas are there and the implementation feels natural, like I'm actually running a growing galactic empire instead of playing a game on a screen.","December 19, 2015","true","50.6"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","23","26","0","0"

You may love this game.\n\nIf you wanna participate in what seems like a pretty badass game in the making, buy. if not wait.\n\nStart out in "civilzation" stage and work up to "space" stage.\n\nI only put a little time into it, thats kinda what I'm seeing so far, havent made it to space stage, hoping its as satisfying as the planet managment.\n\nNice simple layout of all the important bits. Some things would be easier if right click canceled current action, or backed out of city view. Could use a mouse wheel zoom function as well.\n\nThey say they are working on adding models to city buildings rather than the little hexes.\n\nso far pretty fun, just got tired of the red line rendering bug. gonna give it a few days.","March 2, 2015","true","1.4"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"

I am pretty excited now about the release version. My history is with MOOII, Space Empries, Civ Series, Gal Civ series, and so forth. This game has one really unique aspect that I have thought about "if I ever were to make my own game" in that it is two games in one. There is first a significant phase just on one planet, getting yourself to the starship phase. Only at that point does the second part of the game open up.\n\nI would be playing more of the game now, but it's difficult because a few parts of the release version are not in place yet, mainly fleet and planet organizers. Without those, it's hard to continue deep into the game. But my taste of this game has been very good. I probably say that in about 1 out of 10 games I taste. So I am anxiously awaiting game completion.","February 14","true","8.5"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

It is impressing. Also it is noticable an indie game, but that's also charming in my eyes. If all 4X games look and feel the same...where should be the difference? The UI is sufficient, while I might have preferred a switch for hex-view. Probably it's allready there and I didn't find. Hm...\nFirst I've done a short tutorial, which answered most question, but left me with some more. It's kind of try-and-error in my first game, but all buildings could be replaced. Game gets you into one-more-turn hype.\n\nSummary it's more weighted toward building up planets, cities and colonys then just counting your planets and ships. Yeah, it's more into micromanagement. So far I'm pleased about...don't know how I think after some more hours. No doubt, it is Early Access, so you have to be sure about. Some hard edges are there, no question. But the small company brings up fresh new ideas, which other titles like Galactic Civilization 3 or else are so deeply needing.\n\nIt's fun to play and to explore all mechanism to prosper. First I thought it's only singleplayer, but InGame I found a multiplayer button (currently not working, but...). So I guess it is a good time to invest some bucks and grab it while on sale. Those devs do a good job, seem reliable and are really interested into our feedback.\n\n--- Update ---\n\nAfter some hours testing arround I ran into some gamebraking bugs. Well, game is on very very early access from my view. If you buy it, you are some kind of beta-tester. You should know and accept this. Do like some new ideas which this game came up with and looking forward to see (and influent with my response) patches the other year.\n\nStill think the game has good potential and like the way devs hold contact toward the customers. So I stay with thumbs up...if you realize what you get atm.","December 23, 2015","true","14.8"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","0"

It is in the alpha stages so this is my impressioins of that so far. I will add more comments as I learn more about this game. So far I have liked what I have seen of the game. I have spent the first hour or so (No tutorials for me!) diving into building up my little planet and researching the technologies for warp space travel. I have not even got that far! So far all I keep doing is restarting the game figuring out how to optimize my planets production/research etc.. I have enjoyed doing that, it seems very well designed. It is obviously missing some graphics, but it does not detract from my enjoyment of the process. If the rest of the game is as well designed as the planet  as a resource model I have high hopes for this game. Will add more to comments as I get further into the game.","December 23, 2015","true","83.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","7"
