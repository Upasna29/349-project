Common complaint is that it is short, but for the price I still see this as a good value title. There are around 30 logic puzzles, still offering several hours of challenges to exercise your mind. Concept is most like the classic Minesweeper that was included with Windows OS back in the day. You need to use logic to determine if there is a 'number' or 'vacant' hex in the adjacent cell from the already revealed hexes.\n\nThe simple designs, grows in complexity as you progress through larger levels with new rules being added & for the purists there is also the challenge of completing each puzzle without any mistakes. Graphics are bright yet clean & basic, but suitable to the game. Sounds are relaxing & controls are easy (just left & right mouse buttons).\n\nOther than the exceptional LYNE, this is one of the best puzzlers I have played in recent years & look forward to trying out the sequels (which I am told are a much harder challenge too!).\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","September 11, 2014","true","6.1"," 34 of 37 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","34","37","2","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/265890/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Hexcells is the illegitimate love child of Minesweeper and Picross. Using a series of number clues, you must logically remove and mark hexagons in order to fill out the pattern hidden underneath. If you've played either of the two before mentioned games this will be entirely intuitive, with numbers within a hexagon corresponding to the number of blue tiles (ie. mines) surrounding said hexagon, and the numbers on top of a column signally the number of blue tiles within it (with a few special signals providing additional info).\n\nWhat Hexcells adds over vanilla Minesweeper is the more puzzle oriented design of its levels, each being individually designed to test your skills of deduction with cleverly disguised patterns that are often far more obvious than they first appear. Solving them is abundantly satisfying, and makes it rather hard to go back to the randomly generated boards of its spiritual predecessor.\n\nBut this is also the cause of my biggest complaint, that being the times when logic is thrown out the window and you are all but forced to guess in order to move forward. This is frustrating because you're allowed but one mistake before forfeiting your perfect rating, essentially requiring you to memorize patterns and replay levels or cheat and use screenshots of the completed puzzle to go back and perfect the stage. It's odd that a game essentially designed to entirely do away with the use of luck to solve puzzles falls into such a disappointing pitfall, but I can only assume it was an oversight by the developer as for the majority of the game it's entirely possible to intelligently complete stages, which I suppose is why these moments of guesswork stand out so strongly.\n\nAlthough it just barley misses the mark, the overwhelming opinion I took away from Hexcells is that of a strong new logic puzzle that has the potential to perfect itself in future iterations, and may one day sit beside the likes of Picross and Sudoku. If you have any appreciation for the games I've compared it to, I wouldn't hesitate to check Hexcells out. It's budget priced so you've got very little to lose, and may find yourself similarly enamored by what at first seemed but a cheap knockoff.","August 28, 2014","true","3.4"," 30 of 35 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","30","35","2","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tawnylawns/recommended/265890/","tawnylawns","Tawny Lawns 💗","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tawnylawns/","1731 products in account","I usually satisfy myself with mindless clicking at things that move, clubbing zombies and “flamethrowing” aliens enough to make a batter-happy Flintstone giddy. After a while the repetitive slashing and gouging puts a strain on my steadily numbing mind and I need a break. Brainiac games like Hexcells provides that pause from the world of action titles that many gamers find soothing from time to time. The minimalistic interface calms you to the core like entering your hotel room, the first day of your sunny beach-filled holiday. Easy-peasy controls and rules, as most strategic puzzle games tend to excel in, are explained through directions (though for Level 1 I felt the couple of trial plays planted in the beginning of each rule change, would have sufficed). I’ve seen plenty of reviews exclaiming it as comfortably easy to finish, which isn’t quite true as new rules are added regularly and consistently starting at Level 11. This lessens repertoire and makes Hexcells highly entertaining for a puzzle game of its kind. It calls for the elimination and deduction tools we have honed through countless hours of playing games such as Sudoku and Minesweeper. There is no timer so in a sense is closer to a Sudoku that’s pleasing to the eye. Hexcells adds the “chic” that Sudoku lacks and the logicality which Minesweeper is deficient in through functions which allow no room for the guessing games and visuality to match. No function is lacking or overdone in Hexcells. As Goldilocks would say, “It’s just right.” It is one of the most accessible and convenient game I have ever played. The UI looks fantastic for touch screens and as I’ve been marooned on my laptop for a few months, it’s always heaven to play low spec games that won’t freeze mid-play and still provide high quality content to keep me amused for consecutive hours. It is also a great game for a few minutes here and there as an easy to start, continue and leave at any time type game that doesn’t bore. For example, the widely loved classic, Peggle will have me dozing off in a few minutes flat although it’s a sweet little thing.\n\nThe intermediate level starts around Lv. 18-19 and I started finding it mind boggling beginning at Lv. 22. After that point some are comparatively easier than others which didn’t reflect the actual order or the levels. Thank goodness because the couple of easier levels here and there let me hang on to my sanity!\n\nMost of the reviews I’ve read stated plenty of appreciation towards the needlessness of guessing the answers. There is 0% need to speculate and everything must be calculated if you want to play the game to its maximum. Keep in mind that if you mess up once you’ll end up with the obvious answer which means it’s extremely easy to use trial and error to pick through the games effortlessly. This sucks all the fun out of it so I suggest you aim for 100% accuracy each time you play or try and forget the hex you just wrongly clicked and move on to something else so you won’t end up getting everything easy. Another tip I have is to try playing it as fast as your mind will think and fingers will click because the music sounds better that way. It has one of those almost interactive tracks so that what and how you click will determine a different sound that in turns melds into the original score underneath it.\n\nIn all honestly, the aspect the feature I enjoyed the least was the music in Hexcells as it is repetitive and some parts sound like an orchestra of mobile phones with annoying, monotonous ringtones. (Note: I understand that there was only so much the developer could do and it wasn't that bad, I'm just used to better soundtracks is all. ;D) Which is why I eventually turned down the volume and even then I still couldn’t quite stand it. It wasn’t the relaxed ambience I was hoping for but it wasn’t as noticeable when playing at a faster pace (clicking hexes in acceleration) for reasons already noted above. A better example would be Duet, the strategic arcade game by Kumobius (iOS/Android). The music is directed via the player’s fingertips as they go through the puzzles and it is scored in a way that’s surprisingly meditative for a game of somewhat high difficulty. The fluidity of a game’s soundtrack influences a massive portion of its play mood in any genre. Other than that, I’m interested in buying the other two as well for a rainy day and hope the background music is a tad better than the first one.\n","February 19, 2015","true","4.2"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","20","24","3","2"

When I saw Hexcells on the Steam New Releases section, I was quite happy; I have always thought these kinds of logic puzzles were better on a platform with a mouse. A few bucks later (thanks to Steam trading card sales - this game doesn't give out cards, btw), I had Hexcells in my library.\n\nThe actual logic of Hexcells is not difficult to grasp. If you've played Minesweeper or Picross 3D, you'll be right at home. You'll be following numbers inside of hexes, with symbols indicating whether the surrounding blue hexes will be consecutive or split, and later you will find numbers on rows or columns as well, with similar symbols. These symbols are, admittedly, not as easy to remember as I'd like (a problem that even Picross 3D had). I've made a few mistakes in puzzles because I misread the symbol in a given hex. In a related note, it's also somewhat easy to forget which mouse button performs which function, causing stupid mistakes that get recorded in your level score. Hexcells does not have a time limit of any kind, so you are essentially free to brute-force your way through a puzzle if you so desire, but making mistakes reduces how many hexes you receive as a reward for that level, and Steam Achievement nuts will probably want to avoid doing that if possible, as there is an achievement awarded for getting a perfect score on every level.\n\nPresentationally speaking, Hexcells is simple and pleasing. The visuals are extremely minimalist (hexagons, and only hexagons); the only visual effects you'll be seeing are the tiny animations for shading or breaking hexes. The music is electronic ambience, in the style of Solar Fields (i.e. Mirror's Edge or Capsized), with the added effect that in-game sound effects are played on rhythm, a la Lumines or Rez. If I could complain about the presentation in any area, though, Hexcells does not provide a color-blind option (though I am not color-blind, I am unsure if the game's use of blue and orange would cause problems for those who are), and the low-contrast nature of the backgrounds makes the "Menu" button difficult to find.\n\nI am pleased to report that Hexcells performs admirably on both Windows and Linux, owing to its nature as a Unity game. I would presume that Macintosh support is also good, as a result. Both of my test machines (no slouches, admittedly) ran the game with no obvious slowdowns or graphical glitches. I'd wager most machines made in the last half-decade will work just fine; I suppose netbooks may be feasible as well, but as I do not have access to one right now, I cannot say for certain, so Your Mileage May Vary.\n\nAbout the biggest complaint I have about Hexcells, though, is that there are just not enough puzzles. Hexcells offers 6 "worlds," with five puzzles each, and the last puzzle essentially acting as a credits reel. I finished the game in a little over an hour, though I have not achieved Perfect on every puzzle just yet.\n\nAll that said, though, at $3 or less, Hexcells is certainly not a waste of your money. I'd like to see more logic-puzzle games like this on Steam.","July 25, 2015","true","2.9"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","14","15","2","3"

Your goal is to determine which of the hexagonal cells on each grid should be marked blue, and which should be eliminated from the game, using the various clues given to you for each puzzle.\n\nUnlike that classic, however, there is always a way to logically determine how to solve the puzzles in Hexcells without making a mistake.  This sets it apart from games which use trial and error as a mechanic; while there is nothing wrong with trial and error, it's nice to see game that is designed thoughtfully enough to allow each level to be solved the first time without making a mistake for the observant.\n\nHexcells falls into that category of games which are easy to pick up and play, but difficult to master.  Controlling the game could not be simpler; you need only use the mouse to confirm or erase cells and to navigate menus.  The overall design aesthetic is pleasing both visually and aurally, with nice ambient music accompanying each section of the game.  The music can easily be muted if you prefer, however.  There is also no pressure; you can take as long as you need to solve a particular puzzle, and it's easy to back out if you need to take a break.  All puzzles can be retried, and you can preview later stages as you unlock them through successful completion of the early stages.  The only possible criticism, as I have seen pointed out in reviews on-line, is that you can't determine which puzzles still need to be perfected once you've cleared many of them, unless you write them down or something.  Once a stage is cleared, its symbol in the puzzle index is marked blue, without any discerning marks to distinguish those you have perfected from those in which you made a mistake.\n\nHexcells is not a short game, but it's primary downfall is that once you've played through a few times, the replay value goes down.  It's almost like the Portal series; once you have that initial moment of wonder and discovery as you solve each level, it wears off.  You can't have those moments of discovery ever again as you have basically figured out everything there is to learn after so long.\n\nBut that doesn't mean you shouldn't give this game a try, and the price is right.  The puzzle design is very thoughtful; it's clear a lot of work went into each one to make sure that players can perfect them all.  This is the type of design that appeals to me.  Even if I make a mistake, I know I can come back later and re-examine the puzzle for the correct solution.  Unlocking all six achievements is absolutely possible time and practice, adding an additional layer of accomplishment.  If you like puzzle games, give Hexcells a try!\n\n8.0 / 10\n\nIf you need some extra help with this game, check out my newly-published guide to Hexcells: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=320523083","November 1, 2014","true","88.7"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"

It's a bit like minesweeper but without the frustration of logically impossible puzzles, and it's honestly much more fun and interesting.  It's simple to understand the basic rules/tricks but levels can definitely be tricky. Luckily there is always a logical next step based on the clues you get such as "there is 2 blues touching this hexagon" or "there are 3 blues in this column and they are all touching each other". The clues get more subtle as you go on, and by the end you need to combine multiple clues and always be considering what clues have now become relevant with your latest move.There's not a huge amount of puzzles, but the quality of them is good and the solutions/levels are nicely varied.  It's already a low price and in the sale it usually drops by a good margin, so it's definitely value for money whenever you decide to pick it up.","October 17, 2014","true","10.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

You had to find the mines and avoid them by marking them. It worked with some clues, since numbers gave away how many mines are close by.\n\nThe Hexcells games are very similar to it, but they are not working in square blocks, they come in hexagon shape and often remind of chemical combinations when you open the next level. These shapes make it sometimes hard to figure out what is going on and in later levels you get extra clues for the lines of hexagons and stuff like that.\n\nplaying Hexcells is fun in a kind of weird way. Even if you don't want to make your math homework, you sit down to "calculate" the grids, but it is not that much math anyway, more like drawing lines from dot to dot.\n\nLater versions of Hexcells (Hexcells Plus & Hexcells Ininite) are basically the same thing on harder levels and Infinite includes an Endless-Mode that let's you play levels created by chance. Start with the normal game and get infected, this game is addictive and you should consider buying the complete pack right from start.\n\n\n10/10 I think I've seen more hexagons than a beekeeper did\n","May 28, 2015","true","7.1"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

I'm exhausted.\n\nHexcells is a logic puzzle that's similar to other number games like Minesweeper and Picross, as you use processes of elimination and deduction to fill in patterns of tiles.  The distinction here is that since the tiles are hexagons, they're not restricted by square grids, and most puzzles look like abstract shapes or very loosely defined objects.  Black-background hexes have numbers on them from 0-6, indicating how many of the gold tiles around them can be clicked to turn blue, which counts toward stage completion.\n\nThose hexes are a mixed blessing--finding all of them is the whole point of the game (though you do have to mark every single tile, whether you believe it to be a blue "hit" or a black "guide"), but unless you know how many blue tiles are in a given area, these don't often give any information on the tiles around them.  The numbers themselves eventually adopt additional characteristics that give you more information on how to complete a stage, but it's well worth remembering that making a decision about one tile necessarily is effectively making a decision about all of the tiles next to it as well.  Levels are divided up into groups and sometimes able to be completed out of order, and completing each level perfectly will often mean you unlock the next set even without fully having to finish the previous one.\n\nThe game is easy to learn, with simple controls and all of the rules explained as you need them, and there are no hectic time limits to worry about.  (I don't know if there's a way to save during levels.)  You'll probably build up enough stress just by trying to finish levels without making mistakes, as difficulty ramps up quickly and there's no quick way to restart stages, that I know of, without exiting back out to the level-select menu.  This may serve the purpose of discouraging cheating, though.  It would be nice to be able to turn the music on and off during a level, but the little 'bloop' sounds the tiles make when clicked go really well with the gentle soundtrack, so much so that you might not notice them at first.\n\nYou can make guesses about what tiles are where, but it's much more satisfying to finish a stage or even a small section of one because you understood the rules than because you happened to get lucky.  The game doesn't need reflexes, but it expects and encourages patience and discipline (try not to scream if you misclick toward the end of a level you've been chipping away at for half an hour), all for the cost of a small meal.","February 12","true","4.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I wish there were more puzzles at this difficulty. This game is easy and very short. Completed to 100% in less than 5 hours while tired and not thinking as fast as I would while fully awake. I think most will find the price is a bit high for the amount of content.\n\nMany say that the game mechanics are similar to minesweeper crossed with Picross (nonogram puzzles) on a hex grid. I would say instead of standard picross mechanics it is closer to the mechanics used in Picross 3D which are actually somewhat different than standard nonogram puzzles.\n\nAt the end of each level, you are awarded with a certain amount of progress hexes which are used to unlock more levels. The amount of progress hexes earned depend on the difficulty of the level and the amount of mistakes you have made during the level. There is no way of knowing how many progress hexes there are for a specific level or, if you missed any in prior runs, how many are still left to earn. This is only indicated at the end of a level and can not be checked on again without completing the level once more.\n\nNote that Hexcells Plus has a much higher difficulty than this game and not just more puzzles at a similar difficulty. If you found this game too easy or think you may be ready to try to take on more challenging levels, go try that. Don't be fooled by how easy the first few levels are on Hexcells Plus. By level 12 you've already exceeded the difficulty of this game. If you've played Hexcells Plus, my advice is to not bother with this game unless you found that the difficulty curve was too steep and are looking for more simple levels to better get used to the basics of the mechanics.","November 6, 2014","true","10.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

In Hexcells the game area consists of hexes, each having zero to six neighbours. Hex is either blue or black with a number. Mechanics familiar from Mine Sweeper (MS), the number states how many blue hexes are next to the black hex. Your job is to reveal for all hexes whether they are blue or black.\n\nUnlike in traditional MS, everything can be deduced - guessing is not required at all if you know what you are doing. The controls are similar to MS, with left- and right-clicking determining whether you think the hex is blue or black one. Also, in case of a mistake you don't need to start at the beginning, though if you do more than one mistake, you have to start again if you want a "perfect" score (and ultimately an achievement).\n\nThe learning curve is very smooth, the challenge rising gently towards later, larger puzzles. As you get further, new mechanics are introduced, with similarities to nonograms/hanjies: a number will state that a column or a diagonal will have certain number of blue hexes. There are two special cases to this that either say that all blue hexes will be interconnected or that they must have a break in-between. All mechanics naturally introduce new ways to think and deduce through the puzzles.\n\nMusic is ambience like "glowing crystals", and when you make right moves there's a distinct "ding!" sound echo that adds fluidly to the ambience.\n\nAll the 36 puzzles are well-designed and fairly interesting. This is also its biggest drawback: there is little replay value after beating all the puzzles, a task that takes just a couple of hours. The other drawback is the lack of a save feature (for single puzzles; game obviously remembers if you have beat a puzzle before), so you have to complete each puzzle fully or either leave the game running or start the level again later. If these features are a bottleneck for you, both of them are introduced in Hexcells Infinite, the third part of the series.\n\nIf you're left craving for more, Hexcells Plus is the de-facto sequel. You should really play Hexcells first and only then go to Plus though, for the sequel is way more challenging and introduces all the mechanics from early on and even adds one new one. Hexcells Infinite is a good alternative to both: it has its own puzzles and all the mechanics and features from Hexcells and Hexcells Plus, but the challenge curve starts from easy like Hexcells and goes to difficult like Plus. In that respect it's more stand-alone than Plus sequel.\n\nAll three are nevertheless good puzzle games. As for challenge, Hexcells is the easiest one and therefore the natural place to start. Also, it's a fairly cheap investment.","May 20, 2015","true","1.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Of course, at such a tender age I had no clue what I was doing. I clicked random squares and there were numbers and I could put flags down if I wanted to, but they didn't seem to actually change anything because sometimes I lost and sometimes I won, but I wasn't quite sure what caused it to go either way. And then I typically got kicked off of the computer anyways.\n\nHexcells is a game that will take you back to the days when Minesweeper was the only game that the school computers could run. It's an updated version of a classic strategy game with a bit of added style: you play with hexagons instead of squares. The board starts with an oddly shaped field made of orange hexagons. Mines are marked by left-clicking a hexagon, turning it blue. Hexagons are revealed by right-clicking, showing the number underneath if you click correctly and shaking the piece and adding a tally mark to your mistake count if you're too hasty in your decisions.\n\nUnlike the original Minesweeper, Hexcells adds more complex features as the player advances further in its six sets of levels. Soon the board will be marked with various clues. Symbols mark whether or not the mines surrounding a hexagon are grouped together or spread out and how many mines are in a column on a board. These clues are cleverly used in each level to prevent players from reaching the frustrating Minesweeper stalemate: the point in the game where you are forced to rely on chance and click a random piece in order to continue to advance.\n\nThe downside to Hexcell's logic-friendly gameplay is its inability to randomly generate levels (at least, in the original Hexcells—more on that in a few seconds). Each level is hand-crafted to prevent players from getting stuck, which means that when you run out of puzzles, well, you run out of puzzles. However, for the cheap price point Hexcells provides a good few hours of entertainment, particularly if you're already fond of Minesweeper or enjoy puzzle games in general. In addition, Hexcells also offers a purchasable expansion called Hexcells Plus, as well as the inexhaustible Hexcells Infinite, which includes a rather effective level generator and the ability to play user-generated content. As such, the Hexcells Complete Pack is a cheap must buy for all puzzle aficionados.","December 29, 2014","true","4.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's not about hexes. They changed numbers (bomb-number in Minesweeper) and they mean in some cases a bit differ. As a result, you need use familiar logic, but differently.\n\nThe second gameplay feature is that designer(s) made fixed levels which are created by hand. It sounds strange for classic Minesweeper, but here it's amazing. The author(s) made up tricky and interesting levels. You can pass all of them without single step on bomb, but you need to think and the answers make you feel great.\n\nAchievement hunters will be delighted to get to know the game. You can easily get all of achievements in three games, and they cost little money (specially with discount).\n\nIf you want to play or check it, I recommend to buy "Infinite" version.

The objective is to reveal the number of blue hexes in each puzzle level.  There are only thirty or so puzzles to beat and the game can be completed in a few hours.  Early levels are relatively easy to complete but as you can imagine the last few are pretty complex to overcome without making a mistake.\n\nEach level begins with some hexes providing some initial clues as to where the first blue hexes may be found.  Numbered hexes reveal the number of possible adjoining blue hexes.  Additional elements such as connected or unconnected chains, blues in a row providing additional clues.  Together with these assisting functions the player must use their powers of deduction to complete each puzzle without making a mistake.  Though each puzzle is entirely solvable, trial and error is possible though making a mistake with affect a "perfect" completion.\n\nIf you arent a whizz with logic or deduction then you will become frustrated on these harder levels.  The fun though is completing each puzzle entirely through deduction rather than through trial and error.\n\nI thought it was very enjoyable though personally I preferred LYNE.","January 30, 2015","true","4.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Low stress too, since if you get one wrong, the board doesn't blow up - you just increment an error counter.\n\nThe ONLY thing wrong is the lack of a random level generator.  Once you beat the included levels, you're done.  But looking at the value (time/money), it's still a great deal.

A fantastic advertisement for Hexcells Plus, and Matthew Brown's games in general.\n\nWhen this started, I was thinking (as apparently everyone else does) "updated Minesweeper, with better music and graphics."\n\nAs more gameplay mechanics were introduced, I stopped thinking about minesweeper - this is something mch, much more intelligent and much, much more involving. It's still a game where you're deducing the position of tiles that should be left-clicked and ones that should be right-clicked, but the ways you determine which are which change as the game progresses, allowing for some intricate and elegant puzzle solving.\n\nThe new gameplay elements represent both a challenge and a tool, meaning the game feels incredibly well-balanced - you're unlikely to ever throw your hands up because something became too complicated. Rules are added as if the entire game were a complete tutorial, to the point that in the later stages, you notice the position of something at a different angle to before, and you instantly understand what this means.\n\nAll new rules are introduced with a mini-tutorial puzzle so you get the chance to try them out on the small stage before moving on to a larger-scale puzzle. You can restart and replay levels, which is great if you're like me and have the kind of fingers that left-click when you wanted them to right-click. I think I had one level where I made the same one mistake 5 times, just through being cackhanded... and it's not like I've never played any Portal game, so the blame is squarely at my feet for any frustration I experienced there. That's a nice thing about this puzzle game - it's very friendly, very calming. I complained only at myself (for having stupid fingers, or for making a dumb move), never, ever at the game.\n\nThe game looks beautiful - cool colors, minimalist layout - my only gripe is that the menu text looked a bit washed out on my screen - it took a while to be able to see the 'Quit' text - for example - and the music is excellent, accompanied by ambient chimes that play in tune with the music - if you wanted to you could turn the solving of a level into a pretty pleasing musical performance with a little practice.\n\nAchievements are slightly bugged, in that you'll only get them (or at least I only did) the next time you start the game and continue your last save slot. And that's where the game has its biggest letdown - as I understand it, it only has 6 worlds. Not getting the achievements the first time through, made me think that perhaps each world was made up of 6 sets of puzzles, and that the numbers on the homescreen represented the first 3 worlds. Not so. I've unlocked the final world just now, and my game is registering around 2.2 hours played - and that includes leaving the game running for at least half an hour while I did something else.\n\nThere's probably 2 hours of gameplay for most people in this, which you may feel is not enough to justify whatever price is being charged. I got this via the Bundlestars Indie Capsule 2, so at most it was around $5 (if I ignored all the other games in that bundle), and I feel that was definitely worth the price.\n\nTo sum up - Hexcells is a game that seems at once familiar and modern, is challenging without being frustrating, looks good, sounds good, is good value for money, and is a satisfying gameplay experience that leaves you wanting more of the same.\n\nGet it. It is good.","April 14, 2014","true","3.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You don't have to guess.\n\nEventually you will get to a level where you just sit and stare at the screen, desperately trying to find an opening. When you finally find that opening, you can't help but feel a little cool. You make a couple of moves, only to get stuck again.

You do this by using Minesweeper-like logic where a non-blue hex will tell you how many adjacent hexes are blue.\n\nAll the puzzles are completely logical and do not require guess work, which is a critical part of any good puzzle game.\nAs you progress through the 6 words some extra tricks are introduced that make the puzzles more complicated and more fun (for people who have already played Plus, everything you've seen there except the numbered blue hexes and the ?-hexes).\n\nShould you get this game?\nGenerally: yes.\nIf you've already played Plus: As long as you don't expect to be challenged.\nIf you can only afford one of the Hexcells games: Maybe get Plus instead.","November 25, 2014","true","1.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WhiteWarden/recommended/265890/","WhiteWarden","WhiteWarden","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WhiteWarden/","80 products in account","A very interesting and fun puzzle game that reminds a lot of minesweeper with a hexagonal grid (and probably a few other logic-based games). There are more rules, meaning that there is potential for much harder puzzles than minesweeper can offer, but since there are no randomly generated levels, the amount of time you'll spend on this game is minimal. Said potential is not reached, so the game is never really challenging, which does nothing to increase the length. (I had no problems completing all the puzzles in around 1.6 hours, so you could easily play through it in one sitting.) Still, there is one huge advantage: guessing is never required. Guessing is the one thing I really hate in minesweeper - of which I am a big fan, regardless - and to play a similar game without it simply feels wonderful.\n\nI find that the sounds fit the game nicely; they feel calm and soothing and play short melodies as you click the tiles. This, along with the focus on number of errors rather than time spent (I'm looking at you, minesweeper clock), makes the game feel very relaxing, despite it being a puzzler.\n\nPros:\n+ No guessing\n+ Nice, relaxing sounds\n\nCons:\n- Too short\n- Too easy\n- No randomly generated levels\n\nIf you like minesweeper (and/or similar games) this game is definitely worth the purchase. If not, I'd recommend you to try it anyway, since the game is quite cheap. For those who fancy something more difficult (and thus longer), Hexcells Plus and Hexcells Infinite increase the difficulty by several notches, fixing the first two cons mentioned above. (As you might also guess, the last one also has randomly generated levels, although they are significantly easier than the rest of the game.) In that case, this one might serve as a short introduction to the concept.","October 30, 2014","true","1.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It sets the foundation for the remainder of the trilogy.\n\nThe way I'd describe Hexcells is that it's a brainy love child of Minesweeper and Sudoku.  The puzzles are all solvable, despite how frustrated you might originally get when attempting them.  There is a nice endorphin rush when you realize you've figured out which cell to click on next because you made a second-level deduction that isn't immediately obvious.  However, the first time you play you'll probably just accept that you made a mistake and keep going.  When you're done, you'll want to do it all over again, but trying for the "Perfectionist" achievement (no mistakes).  Even if you do make a mistake, you can simply start the level over again to try it mistake-free.\n\nHexcells probably has about 2-3 hours of game play in it, but you might come back to try again for that achievement...\n\nI would definitely recommend this game to anyone that enjoys logic puzzles or spatial puzzles.  When you are done, you'll immediately want to pick up the next game in the series (Hexcells Plus).","January 19, 2015","true","3.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Remember how fun it was finding those hidden mines, and how you could feel your brain scream "NOOOOOOOOOOO" whenever a mine would pop its stupid head up and kill you? Remember how immensely frustrating it was when it was entirely impossible to solve levels without guessing?\n\nWELL, NO MORE! Hexcells to the rescue.\n\nHexcells is very similar to Minesweeper in that you have to use various clues and reasoning to find the hidden blue cells on each level, but unlike Minesweeper, Hexcells' soultions can ALWAYS be reasoned, and if you're doing it right you will never have to guess.\n\nThe levels start out easy, with simple rules and puzzles, but new tricks are added just regularly enough to fully grasp, and before you know it, you'll find yourself scanning through 15 different criteria to find the 1-in-100 blue cell to start a level off. It's very satisfying.\n\nSpeaking of satisfying, the puzzles here never seem overwhelming or too tricky. Take my opinion with a grain of salt (since I have always loved games like this), but the level of difficulty in these puzzles was just perfect, and while some levels did force me to stare at them for a while, the solution was always there somewhere just waiting for me to grab it.\n\nThe Hexcells series is really 3 games: Hexcells, Hexcells Plus, and Hexcells Infinite. They each have different puzzles, and they are each worth getting, but Hexcells Infinite is the one to get if you're on a budget. It has the most advanced puzzles, and it includes a random level generator, so you can literally play to your heart's content. All 3 of them will slowly progress you through the mechanics of the game, though, so don't feel like you will be overwhelmed if you jump right into Infinite.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that the random levels in Infinite are mere pale shadows compared to the premade levels (they are often quite easy), but for fans that cannot get enough and don't want to go back to the guess-fest Minesweeper, they can be a lot of fun.\n\nI highly recommend this game. If you're a fan of logic-based puzzle games, you can't go wrong with any of these 3 games. The prices are cheap, and the series is rather unique. If the devs could have just tightened up the infinite level generator ever-so-slightly, this game might be the only game I've rated to pass Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons.\n\nScratch that Minesweeper itch, my friend!","January 21, 2015","true","0.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

Think of it as the love child of picross and mine sweeper, except that child grew up to be a bit simple and shallow. So although it looked ok as a young adult and some some people kind of fancied it, ultimately it is a one night stand kind of person and not a real candidate for a long term relationship.\n\nSo you can have sex with this game for a couple of hours, but it is never going to be "good sex". You'd probably be best just firing one off in the bathroom to be honest. But if it is already in your house and you have nobody better to call on? Yeah why not, sure.\n\nJust be careful because the mechanic of marking each cell is a little fiddly and you will frequently make silly mistakes. You will get used to it, but it is a bit of a distraction when a proven method for "flagging" a cell is available (rather than committing to it). It holds the game back a little, but otherwise it does the job.\n\n","February 25, 2014","true","2.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I got this for 1€ in a flash sales so it was OK, in terms of the figure-of-merit: 1€ cost per 1hour of play.

While a naive comparison, the game plays similarly to a very advanced Minesweeper. By the second act, though, you'll have discovered the futility of that comparison; this game is on an entirely different level and has an elegance in the solutions that random Minesweeper puzzles cannot ever hope to achieve.\n\nThe soundtrack is quite relaxing. It's really fun when you get on a "roll" of solving the puzzle, too, because you generate little ditties as a reward.\n\nThe entire Hexcells series contains puzzles that are among the greatest I've ever solved. I highly recommend the entire collection, and also very strongly recommend that you start with this one. Don't worry if you breeze through this installment; I put a little over three hours into this one and Plus took me over 15.

It's like a combination of Minesweeper and Nongrams (a.k.a. Hanjie or Griddlers), but played on a field of hexagons instead of squares.  There are about 30-36 levels in the game, six sets of five or six, and the puzzles get harder as you progress through the levels.  Overall though, they're not too difficult, and as far as I can tell, they can all be solved with logic alone, so you shouldn't have to guess to complete them.  I think I finished all of the levels in about 2 hours, and that included replaying some when I accidentally made mistakes so that I could get them done without any mistakes.  I'm not sure about the replay value here, as it would just be the same bunch of levels.  But it's unlikely that you'll remember all of the solutions, so if you put the game aside for some time and come back to it later after you've kind of forgotten about the puzzles, it would probably still be fun to play.  Alternatively, you can get Hexcells Plus and/or Hexcells Infinite for more new levels.  :)  I think this is a fun game and would recommend it to others who enjoy puzzles.","November 25, 2014","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The basic mechanics are pretty much the same, the difference being that squares are now hexagons. It's also a lot more forgiving, although you'll likely find yourself restarting games just because you want to complete each level without any mistakes. Besides, all levels are solvable without guessing, and  completing a difficult level will often fill you with satisfaction. The atmosphere is quite enjoyable, although I found myself switching off the sound because it could be slightly distracting.\n\nHowever, there is some criticism to be made. Once you get the grip of the game mechanics, which should happen quite soon, the game becomes rather limited. The most challenging levels become a time for staring at the screen, wondering "what am I missing?". You'll often get stuck and resort to carefully scanning the screen, trying to find out which is the next tile you can click on. And that is why I'd game this game a mixed review if I could - it can become a test of patience rather than one of cleverness. Although fans of Minesweeper will not probably be bothered much. ;)\n\nThe game is also quite short, considering that I beat all levels with a perfect score in just two hours. However, if you can get this one in a bundle or in an offer (I got it for 0.89 Euro), then it's likely that you'll have put your money to good use.","June 19, 2015","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As it progresses, the elements of logic coalesce into molecules and you'll routinely need to retain and apply handfuls of algebraic deductions just to make a single correct move.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/265890/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Hexcells is a simple logic puzzle game. While it starts off very easy, it later on can get a bit more complicated, often taking me a while to "see" some clue I was missing.\n\nI've had this on my library for a long time, and only recently have I decided to play it, after Kami.\nThis is more up my alley. The game can be very formulaic, perhaps, as there's never the need to "guess" any move. If you observe the board carefully, you'll have everything you need to make the next correct move. Initially, I didn't think it was that good, most levels being rather short and obvious. Thankfully, things got more complicated, levels bigger, and the game proved very satisfactory!\n\nIt's very similar to minesweeper, although there's no losing. You won't touch a bomb and restart. Instead, you'll have +1 mistake, that later affects how many gems you get, for completionists' sake.\nThe game also has various sets of puzzles, introducing a new mechanic between each one, keeping things interesting, without overwhelming the player with everything at once.\n\n\nPuzzle-wise, it's alright. I enjoyed it, but it's nothing mind blowing, in my opinion.\n\nWhat makes it stand out, for me, is the audio design. It's amazing! It's very minimalist, but it works really well!\nWith most puzzle games, I just have my own music on... in the case o Hexcells, it felt rather out of place. There's an ambient track constantly playing in the background, but your actions in the game produce sound-effects in sync with the background track and create a great sense of "atmosphere", even in a puzzle game!\n\nIt's something I rarely see in videogames that aren't music related. They tend to ignore how sound and music is important, so Hexcells is a breath of fresh air, to me!\n\nFor that reason, above all else, I'll recommend this game. Looking at the developer's games, it seems indeed that sound always plays an important role, so I'll definitely be looking out for me!\nElegant is a good word to describe it, I'd say.","September 1, 2015","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

You do this by looking at the clues already given to you in the form of numbers and arrangements. For example, if you have a hex that has a number 2 inside it, that means 2 of the neighboring hexes will be blank blue ones and the rest will be other numbered ones. As you go through the different combinations and solve more of the puzzle, more clues and patterns will become apparent to you, until you're able to fill up everything.\n\nThe strategy is simple and intuitive, with easy to understand instructions whenever a new rule is added, so you never feel like you don't know what you're doing. It's very satisfying when you solve a super complicated puzzle and see how it all fits together like an equation. There were a couple of times when I felt like I wasn't given as many clues as was necessary and just had to guess, which is annoying, but these times were few and might have been simply my own incompetence.\n\nThe graphic scheme is obviously very bare-bones but it's very visually eye-catching, in my opinion, which is nice. There are only a couple of music tracks but they're very serene and help get you into the mood while you're puzzle solving.\n\nOverall I think Hexcells is a pretty good game, challenging but not frustrating, and one that will give you a good 3-6 hours of play-time, and for that price it's definitely worth it.

If you are one of those cool people who pass their idle time on their PC by playing the classic minesweeper game, Hexcells takes that to a whole new level.\n\nThings I like about the game:\n+ I bought all the three games (not costly at all) and it is absolutely fun.\n+ The levels are totally solvable by logic and you wont face a guessing situation like you would in classic minesweeper game. This requires a lot more logical reasoning than minesweeper and I really loved it.\n+ This game has its own ambient music (which some of you may like).\n+ The display is clean and the game gives proper introduction on every new rule as they appear.\n+ The game runs equally smoothly on Linux, Windows and Mac. So I am able to play on different machines at work, or home.\n+ Very small installation size, Downloads the game in a new machine instantly.\n+ This game even has steam achievements.\n\nThings I did not like about the game:\n- No profile synchronization among devices. Everytime you install this in a new machine, you have to start from the beginning.\n- Music could be a bit more mild, I did not like short length repeatative music, had it turned off within first few levels.\n- Levels do not change, you can make mistakes and repeat the level with 0 mistake. Although if you challenge yourself honestly, this is not much of a problem (In the Infinity version, there are random levels though).\n- I am not sure about the scoring system. How making mistake affects your score and if there is any relation with time etc.\n- Short gameplay duration (this wont take you very long to complete, but I personally wont mind replaying).\n\nSo far, I like the game and would recommend to anyone who is into these type of tiny games.","December 30, 2015","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Words alone are not enough to describe this.  Every tile you touch adds a pleasant echo of a note to the tranquil melodies singing you to sleep as you progress.  It's the most soothing and relaxing puzzle game I have ever played, each step as rewarding as suspenseful in mild strokes.  Not only that, but the level design is brilliant.  Start from multiple points and work your way through your own way, depending on which clues you find first.\n\nYou will especially love it if you have ever played a Picross game.  I highly recommend Hexcells and I shame myself for having taken so long to try it.  I have not been so tickled by puzzles like these since my old subscription to Games Magazine in the 90s.\n\n\n\n\nEdit:  One small issue I should mention.  I could find no volume option other than to mute and the game was initially too loud for me.  If you're playing on Windows, right-click your volume on the taskbar and use the Volume Mixer, and this is easily remedied.","January 15","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Then some numbers are marked to let you know if the blue cells have to be all continuous or have at least one space in them.\n\nIt's a fun game, but very short.  The puzzles increase in difficulty at a decent rate, never getting either boring or too frustrating.  But I was left wanting more puzzles.  (Fortunately, there are two other games.)  The music is terrific, and surprisingly relaxing.  Sometimes the chimes when marking a hex got on my nerves, but most of the time they were enjoyable.\n\nOverall, it's a great little game, but the length means it's not worth the full price, in my opinion.  I tend to require about 2 hours worth of enjoyable playtime per dollar spent to feel like I got my money's worth, and if I'd bought this at full price, it wouldn't have reached that.  If you can get it for 40-50% off, however, I think it's definitely worth picking up, or if you have less harsh criteria for money spent (or do puzzles a bit slower).  I haven't yet played the sequels, though I picked those up, too - I understand the third one has a puzzle generator with thousands of possible boards, which would take care of the shortness issue.\n\nOne other minor critique - one of the achievements is to finish every level with a perfect score, but I could find no indication in the level menu of which levels had finished with a mistake.  (I may have been missing it, of course.)  If you don't care about Steam achievements, it's no issue, but if you do, I suggest immediately replaying a level if you make a mistake.\n\nSince I've seen a lot of reviewers do personal scales, and it's helped me a lot to decide what to buy, I put my own here. I give Hexcells a 4 out of 5. Additionally, I usually only give a thumbs up if I got at least two hours of enjoyment out of it for every dollar I spent, and this game did that. (It wouldn't have if I hadn't bought it on discount, however.)\n\n5: Amazing game, easily worth the full price.\n4: Good game, solid addition to the genre, might want to wait for a discount.\n3: Pretty entertaining game, but some issues. Buy at a discount unless you love the genre.\n2: More cons than pros, a lot of issues. Only buy with a strong discount, and only if the game truly sounds like something you'd enjoy.\n1: Don't get this game unless it's free. Even then, consider spending your time playing something decent.","May 9","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Having spent a great many hours playing minesweeper back in the days, it was great to discover a game that fulfilled all the enjoyment minesweeper offered, but without the frustration of having to randomly guess (and possibly die) to complete the puzzle.\n\nPros- Good puzzle game requiring some thought to solve the harder levels\n- Making mistakes isn't a problem - you can keep going and complete level\n- 1 'free' mistake every puzzle - you get full amount of hexcells which is good when you accidentally click left instead of right!\n- All levels are completely solvable without guessing (seriously, anyone posting otherwise just hasn't figured out the puzzle - they're all solvable through pure logic, no guesswork required)\n- Relaxing music, which is even interactive with each click.\n- Has sequels to give you more puzzles to play once you finish!\n\nCons- Short, I finished with 100% in under 3 hrs. However, you can pick it up as part of the Hexcells package with the two sequels for cheap, which gives you plenty of game play.\n- Left-click/right-click can sometimes mix you up, so you click the wrong button. Can cause frustration when you're trying to get 100% if you're the type of person who hates doing puzzles over again.\n- Addictive - not really a con, but once I started, I couldn't stop....\n\nRecommended!","May 13","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So, like, the exact opposite of Minesweeper. I don't know about you guys, but Minesweeper makes me want to poop my pants. And unlike that last sentence, this game is pretty beautiful. There's just 30 levels, which is totally fine for that $3 price, but I can't help but think this game concept has the potential for many more levels. Infinite possibilities, really. It would be truly, truly awesome if this game had Steam Workshop support. Nevertheless, this game is damn good. At first I thought "I've played Minesweeper, why should I care about this game?" Well, I have somehow found myself in possession of this game, and I have now played it, and I am glad to say that I was stupid for thinking that.

The gameplay is pretty intuitive and the nice ambient music and sound effects add to the experience. The graphics are pretty sparse, but they get the job done. I would say the closest game to this would be minesweeper funnily enough. It actually has many similarities with that game, but it has unique level layouts instead of a square of increasing sizes. I wouldn't say it is hard per se, it just takes patience to see what moves you can make without making any mistakes. I got it in a bundle so I payed barely anything, but at $3 full price, you can't really go wrong. At only a couple hours in length and lacking any random levels or a map editor, the replay value will fall off significantly after completion. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the game, but I doubt I will revisit it anytime soon.

You can replay the levels of course, but I'm not sure how long it'll take you before you can solve the puzzles by memory rather than by logic.\nBecause of this, I'd recommend buying this with Hexcells Plus included, which will give you an additional 36 puzzles.","March 6, 2014","true","4.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Hexcells makes for a good logic puzzler, it's just... underwhelming. Heck, at least Minesweeper's levels are randomly generated; there's always a new experience for when you're bored. Once you're through with this game, there's no further value.","September 23, 2015","false","3.5"," 17 of 34 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","17","34","0","13"

The final levels of this game are quite challenging and require intense focus. The soundtrack of this game is a phenomenal addition to the experience too. As I am sure many people have said, this game takes classic Minesweeper and adds plenty of seductive additions.

The visuals are minimal, but pleasing and the ambient music mixes well with the sounds generated by your progression towards the solutions.\n\nThe BIG problem is that it's way too short and easy. None of the 29 puzzles presented any kind of challenge to me, and we all know that I'm no Puzzle got (Remember my Spacechem debacle). I was really taken aback when I discovered the "1", "2", "3" entries in the menu didn't bring me to different puzzles but were just save slots. I couldn't believe it was that short. The puzzles may be handcrafted, ensuring that there never is need for guessing, but they aren't all that elegant for it. Not only are the puzzles easy, but they also contain way too many redundant clues.\n\nAnother minor problem is that, by default, the mouse buttons used to open a cell or indicate it's part of the pattern are reversed from Minesweeper, which caused a couple of mistakes from my part.\n\nNow, I've already begun playing the sequel, Hexcells Plus and the puzzles there aere much more challenging, which is a good thing.\n\nAnyone with a certain level of puzzle exprience should probably skip this one and go straight to Hexcells Plus.\n","July 3, 2014","false","1.3"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

The difference are that few levels of Hexcell aren't randomly generated and more complex mechanics are introduced as you go on.\n\nThe first problem I have with this game is that it does not let you fail. Rather than failing a level for hitting a 'mine', it only count your mistake. It sound like a good thing, but it simply inadvertently spoils the game. I admit that I don't know what could be done to fix this, but nevertheless its the equivalent to trying to solve a math problem with the answer in front of you. You might do your best not to look, you still end up figuring something that you wouldn't have normally.\n\nThe second problem is related to the few inconsistencies of the game. It's a minor issue, but sometimes, it seems that the game take liberties with its own rules (or simply doesn't set them). For example;\n\nTwo mines in a row of four tiles are said to be next to each other? Turn out that 'next to each other' still count when the row is separated by a huge white space.\n\nsymbols like '--' indicate that mines aren't next to each other? It only mean that at least one mine is not connected to the others.\n\netc.\n\nLike a said, this is a minor issue, but combined with a very short unpunishing game, it doesn't leave you anything worthwhile. I can't recommend this game when other interesting puzzle games are available for the same price.","November 27, 2015","false","2.7"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","1"

In playing it, I was pretty underwhelmed. What I loved in minesweeper when I was younger was the sense of victory when you finally cleared a game. You'd have this whole hard level to get through, you'd start small, the tension would rise as you get further and further, and eventually you win and feel great. In Hexcells there was no sense of victory. You play a level, you screw up a couple times, and then you finish it and move to the next one.\n\nI'll probably play a bit more. Maybe I will like it as the levels get more interesting, as it is though I was not overly impressed. As it is, if you want a calm puzzle game then it's probably worth it. If you want a modern day minesweeper I would not recommend it.","January 13","false","0.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

It's extremely easy. In fact, the only level that presented any challenge was the next to last level. During the other 29 levels you can easily figure out which cells to break and which to mark. That one level that is a challenge is only a challenge in the sense that it is tedious. Since you can't figure out which cells to mark based on any clues given you have to guess.\n\nIn other words, the whole premise of the game is flawed. The game is painfully easy except one level which plays exactly like minesweeper. The puzzles are either too easy or require blind guessing, neither of which are fun to me. I got 3 levels into the sequel before quitting.

There is no element of guessing and no ambiguity. You always have all the information there to solve the puzzle, if only you can notice it. That makes it very satisfying to solve and when you make a mistake, you're the only one to blame, which motivates you to replay levels where you made a mistake. The only very minor irritant is that it's easy to make a mistake by twitching at the wrong moment or just using the wrong mouse button if you get distracted. There's no way to say, "No! That's not what I meant to do!" It's very short: only 36 levels, but I'd rather have 36 levels of good puzzles than 100 of a bad one.

A couple of things that make it frustrating are the times you have to guess to do the puzzle - there's no other way to figure it out. Of course, if you guess wrong you have to start over if you want a perfect score. I guess this extends the playtime of the game because you have to do the levels over again until you can do it by memorization.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zulmetefza/recommended/265890/","zulmetefza","zulmetefza","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zulmetefza/","1233 products in account","This is a fun program to use.\n\nI would not call it a game. I would not call it a puzzle game. To cut it short, I would not call it a video game.\n\nMy point can be summarized as the following:\n\nIf my experience from a 'game' does not decrease with printing out a screenshot and try to solve it on the table with a pen, what is the point of purchasing a videogame for the mentioned experience? There are billions of good puzzle newspapers, magazines which are much cheaper (per puzzle basis), and most of those even includes more than one type of puzzles.\n\nWhat I am talking about? There is no save in the middle of a mission. So if u are bored with a specific puzzle, you must start from anew. Paper and pen solution is better in this case. There is no undo for moves. While it is a good exercise for mistakes and incentivize perfecting things, sometimes I just misclick and got a correct filling. Since I am a bit obsessive about doing things without any hints, I really try hard to ignore that extra hint in the aftermath of the mistake. Again. Pen and paper approach is still nicer. Ok, not pen, but a pencil would do the job. Music is not outstanding, it is not even a music, just ambience sound, mostly I muted the game and opened some music of my own. Pen and paper approach is not worse in this aspect as well. It has no options, no metagame, no seeing how long your other friends took for solving some different puzzle. It has no occulus rift support :)So again, pen and paper approach is not inferior.\n\nTo summarize my point, I am not declaring this program is not fun to use. It is. It is a good mixture of minesweeper and griddlers, and especially as a fan of griddlers I enjoyed my time solving the puzzles. But I would also enjoy my time with solving them from a newspaper. While I mostly enjoy minimalistic setups in puzzle games, this one was too extreme in that. I really cant point out what is the difference between this program (I am insisting on not calling it a game) and a published puzzle thingy except it lets u know when u did a mistake instantly.\n\nSince puzzles are much easier in this compared to Hexcells plus, having no save feature is not that devastating in this first title. It still is annoying though.\n\nNeeds much polish before I can call it a game. Since all of the puzzles have a unique solution, I dont think we need a programmed thing for this kind of puzzle even.\n\nTLDR: Did I enjoy using this program? Yes. But I also enjoy my time solving some sudokus, or griddlers online, and this one does not stand out that much from some best voted griddlers in https://www.griddlers.net. So I dont think paying for this is well legitimized, especially after considering its short gameplay time.\n\nPS: Some of my points are taken care of in Hexcells Infinite, by saving feature, a few options, and infinite puzzles thingy. But since those changes are not retroactive, they are not relevant reviewing of this game.\n\nPS2: Most of the ones who check out for hubs of older games are fans of it. That is why, a negative review for an old game will most likely be heavily downvoted, since the ones did not like the concept already will not wander around that much. So, take possible downvotes with a pint of salt.","December 8, 2015","false","2.9"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","9","21","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kargor/recommended/265890/","Kargor","Kargor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kargor/","829 products in account","Not much to say, really. It's a minesweeper-ish puzzle, with more information so you never have to just guess. It's never complicated; if II'm not mistaken I rarely had to mentally play through a combination of two close hints to see where the possible solutions intersect to reveal a hex that has the same state in all possible solutions -- for most cases, it's just a simple going through the patterns.\n\nNonetheless, it's a decent little game. No replay value or anything like that since the levels are NOT randomly generated, and it's not going to take all that much time either, but it does what it sets out to do. If you can deal with just playing through this once in a rather short time, go for it. Avoid making guesses, you're just spoiling the experience for yourself.\n\nA "recommendation" might be a bit too strong, but I can't really vote "No" for a game that does what it wants to do, and does it well enough. Consider it a weak recommendation.\n","March 25, 2014","true","1.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Still it all plays really well, and the levels have a really nice well engineered feel to them, and a few great moments where you have been stuck for a while thinking there must be a bug and that you have to guess the next step and then things finally click and you see the extra bit of information or logical inference you need to progress.","January 16, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not to say that this is a rip-off, but the game does fall into that puzzle genre, so those who like cleaning up the fields based on surrounding information of placement of "mines" will dig this game as well.\n\nThe main difference from minesweeper in your Windows is that slots are hexes and that the puzzles are pre-made, not randomly generated. And while hex form doesn't make much of difference, it's the fact that puzzles are pre-made that makes this game THE thing. Those of you who enjoy playing Mines sure remember the times when the randomly generated field would give you a situation that you simply can't solve logically, only by guessing (dang corners!). Not in this game. All 30 puzzles are cleverly crafted to make sure that there is always enough of information at any moment for the next step. It's great to know that there is always a way to proceed, you just have to recheck everything and figure out the patterns.\n\nWell, it would have been great, but Hexcell 1 is mostly a tutorial title in series. out of 6 worlds, 5 of them introduce new elements, ways of thinking and are easy to beat. Real challenge comes only in final world puzzles, that is 4 pieces plus 1 bonus. If you plan to get only one Hexcells, then you should go for Plus or Infinite, which (re)introduce elements quick enough and then it's pure challenging field cleaning.\n\nI also don't approve the game letting player to just click on everything on the field. While the game punishes it by giving less points, that you need to proceed to the next worlds (and for perfect achievement), the puzzles don't change when and you can just remember the placement of blue fields and redo it perfectly, in a cheap way. Just don't do it. For your own enjoyment. Ok?\n\nArt is minimalistical. Artistical minimalism. Minimalism artistico. Usual spacey ambient soundtrack. Doesn't take away attention. Some may like it. I only like music that can also be heard in the trailer and that's about it.\n\nSo, people who like minesweeper puzzles should pick this one along with whole Hexcells bundle. Otherwise, if you want only one such game, then go with other Hexcells titles.","January 9, 2015","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With Minesweeper, winning fells like the luck of the draw rather than a logic exercise.  Luck adds a certain flair to other types of games, but with puzzle games like this, it does not do the game any favors.  Fortunately, Hexcells does not make the player rely on luck to complete puzzles.\n\nHexcells forces you to use reason and logic to solve a puzzle.  The goal of each puzzle is to clear the orange hexagons to reveal a certain pattern.  The numbers in each cell indicate how many surrounding cells are part of the pattern (this is where the similarity to Minesweeper comes in).  As you progress, new elements are added.  These elements are reminsicent of Picross.  There is a number above the column that indicates how many cells in that column are part of the ultimate pattern.  There are also numbers in brackets that tell you how many cells are connected.  The puzzles also get larger.\n\nThis is a relaxing puzzle game that is definitely worth the time if you enjoy logic puzzles.

In some cases you may play puzzle games to be challenged, and while you will certainly find that here, the ambient soundtrack and sound effects allow relaxing gameplay. The downside is the short amount of levels - 36. Half of those you will breeze through learning the game, and the most taxing puzzles you can steamroll if you are not dedicated to making any mistakes whatsoever. If you are, it's likely to last 2 or 3 hours, perhaps more if you are not familliar with logic puzzles, but the very low price conterbalances that issue for this different take on the puzzle games.\n\nI'ts more compelling than minesweeper, its less frustrating than minesweeper, it's better than minesweeper.\n\nPROS:\nGreat mix of relaxing ambience and challenge\nFreindly difficulty curve\nMinesweeper without the 'red wire, blue wire' moments.\n\nCons:\nLittle content.\n\n8/10\n\n","October 30, 2014","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With Minesweeper, winning fells like the luck of the draw rather than a logic exercise.  Luck adds a certain flair to other types of games, but with puzzle games like this, it does not do the game any favors.  Fortunately, Hexcells does not make the player rely on luck to complete puzzles.\n\nHexcells forces you to use reason and logic to solve a puzzle.  The goal of each puzzle is to clear the orange hexagons to reveal a certain pattern.  The numbers in each cell indicate how many surrounding cells are part of the pattern (this is where the similarity to Minesweeper comes in).  As you progress, new elements are added.  These elements are reminsicent of Picross.  There is a number above the column that indicates how many cells in that column are part of the ultimate pattern.  There are also numbers in brackets that tell you how many cells are connected.  The puzzles also get larger.\n\nThis is a relaxing puzzle game that is definitely worth the time if you enjoy logic puzzles.  It took me about 4.5 hours to complete 30 puzzles.","November 15, 2014","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The way the game works is you have a… let’s call it a board, filled with hexagons, which we’ll call cells. You need to determine which cells are occupied with a blue hexagon, and which ones are vacant (which will be grey). The vacant cells will also have a number inside them, indicating how many adjacent cells are occupied. You simply left click a cell to mark it as occupied, and right click a cell to mark it as vacant. If you’re correct, the cell will change accordingly. If you’re wrong, it’ll shake and mark you as getting making a mistake (more on this in a moment).\n\nAs you progress through the game, the puzzles will get more complicated, and additional ways to indicate whether or not a cell is occupied are introduced.  Sometimes numbers will be encased in curly brackets, indicating that all the occupied cells adjacent to the vacant cell are touching each other.  Where-as a number that has a hyphen on each side means that at least one of the adjacent occupied cells is not touching the other adjacent occupied cells. (Note for clarity: When I say the cells are touching each other, I don’t mean ALL the cells are touching ALL the other cells, but that they are connected like a line curved around the vacant cell. For the hyphenated numbers, some of the cells may be touching each other, but there is at least one break in the group. There may be two groups of two touching cells for example).\n\nNumbers will also appear at the top of columns, or even at a diagonal, indicating how many occupied cells are in that row or column (reminding me ever so slightly of Picross). This numbers also will use the same additional mechanics as the vacant cells, with the curly braces and hyphens indicating if the cells are all connected, or have a break in them. The later stages will require you to use these different numbers in tandem to solve the puzzle.\n\nNow, even in the later stages of the game, Hexcells never gets too difficult. It’s a fairly easy game, and you’ll be able to complete it in 2-3 hours without much trouble. After that, you’re done, there’s not much replay value (unless you try to perfect every level, which you might do just playing through it anyway).\n\nThe levels in Hexcells are divided up into 6 worlds. Each world consists of a couple of stages (4-6 stages, with a total of 26 stages). When you complete a level you are awarded blue hexes towards a total score of them. By earning enough of these blue hexes you unlock the next world. The number of blue hexes awarded for completing a stage varies depending on its difficulty, and you will be awarded less blue hexes the more mistakes you make in a level. (Don’t worry, you can redo levels do earn the blue hexes you missed).\n\nThe music in the game is fairly calm and simple, it’s not anything particularly note-worthy, but it fits with the relaxed feel of the game. (Both the game and the music are overall rather relaxing).\n\nAs for criticisms, they’re two main things I feel this game lacks. 1). There’s no option to save a level mid-way through, so that you can leave the game and return to it later. My work around for this was to take a screen cap if I had to stop playing for some reason, and then just redo my stage progress from there. 2). It’d be nice if there was a way to map out a potential solution (similar to Picross’ overlay feature), so that you can indicate which cells you think may contain blue hexes, and which you think may be vacant without selecting them. Though, this is less needed in this Hexcells game than it is in later ones where you must figure out how large swathes of a level work together to determine if a cell has a blue hex or not.\n\nSo if you’re into puzzle games, then consider picking up the Hexcells pack when it goes on sale (often you can get all 3 games for less than $3). If you already have the first Hexcells game and want more, Hexcells Plus is basically the hard mode for this game, and Hexcells infinite will also provide you with more puzzles to play. If you only want one Hexcells game, go for Infinite, it has some improvements over the other two, and a random level generator, so it’ll offer more play time, (see my review for Hexcells Infinite for more details on that). Whichever route you opt for, it’s a fun puzzle game.","February 25, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes, there are some additions. Yes, the levels have "shapes". But it's basically "minesweeper".\n\nIt's not too hard - took me just over an hour to finish. It's kind of fun for those who like this sort of thing.\n\nHowever, it's not polished enough:\n\n- The controls are confusing (right-click "opens" the cell, left click sets the "mine" - the opposite of minesweeper) so that most of the mistakes I made were from mixing up the buttons\n\n- whenever you move the mouse over a hex, it "reacts" similar to a wrong click. That is very confusing when you play "fast", as you get the "you did wrong" feedback all the time making you hesitate\n\n- The "extra" information ("the mines are all adjacent" for example) are often unnecessary (meaning you could have solved the puzzle even without it)\n\n- - best example for this is the appearance of {5} in a cell - meaning "five neighbors have mines, all adjacent to each other". This is silly, as it's the ONLY way to put five neighbor mines in a hex grid!\n\n- - but there are other examples of this information just serving nothing help at all. I would expect puzzles with this sort of "extra information" that doesn't always appear to be unsolvable without it. This isn't the case here.\n\n- You can't easily fine the levels you didn't finish "perfectly" if you want to try and redo them.\n\nSo that's it. I payed 1$ for the game, and it's OK for that price. I wouldn't pay more, nor would I recommend anyone else pay more.","September 4, 2014","true","43.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Clean and elegant to look at, Hexcells plays like a cross between minesweeper and sudoku; in fact the feel of Hexcells is so similar to those style of puzzles that anyone who likes them will like this.  It won't take long to scoot through the game, but the puzzles are genuinely enjoyable and in the later levels you can spend a good few minutes stalled, hunting for the clue you've missed and deciding whether or not to just take a punt and click a tile.  In fact that's the best thing about this game: unlike minesweeper and many sudoku, you don't at any point need to guess; the entire solution is workable from the initial position of the tiles.  So if you don't get it ... well, it's on you.  If you can pick this up for a few dollars, it is definitely worth the time.","September 3, 2014","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes, there are some additions. Yes, the levels have "shapes". But it's basically "minesweeper".\n\nIt's not too hard - took me just over an hour to finish. It's kind of fun for those who like this sort of thing.\n\nHowever, it's not polished enough:\n\n- The controls are confusing (right-click "opens" the cell, left click sets the "mine" - the opposite of minesweeper) so that most of the mistakes I made were from mixing up the buttons\n\n- whenever you move the mouse over a hex, it "reacts" similar to a wrong click. That is very confusing when you play "fast", as you get the "you did wrong" feedback all the time making you hesitate\n\n- The "extra" information ("the mines are all adjacent" for example) are often unnecessary (meaning you could have solved the puzzle even without it)\n\n- - best example for this is the appearance of {5} in a cell - meaning "five neighbors have mines, all adjacent to each other". This is silly, as it's the ONLY way to put five neighbor mines in a hex grid!\n\n- - but there are other examples of this information just serving nothing help at all. I would expect puzzles with this sort of "extra information" that doesn't always appear to be unsolvable without it. This isn't the case here.\n\n- You can't easily fine the levels you didn't finish "perfectly" if you want to try and redo them.\n\nSo that's it. I payed 1$ for the game, and it's OK for that price. I wouldn't pay more, nor would I recommend anyone else pay more.","September 4, 2014","true","43.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is simply about turning all the orange hexes to either blue hexes (left click) or to black hexes (right click) with numbers. The numbers says how many blue hexes surround the black hexes. If the number have {} it means all the blue hexes are connected, if the number have -- it means that they are not all connected.\n\nThe game is indeed very fun to play especially if you like mathematical puzzles and strategy games. It starts out easy so you get to learn the different strategies and then slowly becomes more and more complicated. Its one of those games that are easy to understand but hard to master. I was so addicted to the game that I just played all the patterns from start to end until i have mastered them all without any errors. The game is not timed but register how many errors you make and give you points. When you have enough points it unlocks the next group of patterns. The game have nice simple graphics and a pleasent music.\n\nI give it a 9/10","September 27, 2014","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Players are presented with an orange grid comprised to hexagons and it is up to them to determine whether these cells belong to the blue pattern or not (black cells). The black cells not part of the pattern have a number in them to indicate how many blue cells are adjacent to them, thus providing a clue as to how to proceed.\nAfter completing a puzzle the player is awarded blue hexcells based on the amount of mistakes made; these in time accumulate to unlock one of five new areas - allowing you to complete more difficult puzzles. Some areas also introduce new clues and rules to help you, making the puzzles more complex over time.\n\nAlthough similar to Minesweeper as mentioned, there is a key difference: there is always a logical next step. You never have to take a gamble so if you feel stuck, take a step back and focus on another area.\n\nWhy I recommend the game\nHexcells is a very simple puzzle game in its visual design. The menu is simple and provides the players with the option of turning the ambient music on or off and selecting one of three save slots. The same can be said for the puzzles themselves; a grid of hexagons on a white backdrop. To me this is good design, as I'm here for the puzzles and that's where the focus clearly lies.\nThe 30 puzzles themselves are interesting and there are enough additions in terms of new rules/clues during the course of a playthrough to keep them fresh and interesting. I just wish there were more.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that the game is without flaws. For instance, it is not possible to erase a save slot so starting completely from scratch is not an option if all three slots are in use. Furthermore, the puzzles tend to be on the easy side, for me anyways.\nMy biggest problem with the game is that there is no option to save mid-puzzle forcing you to either finish it or redo the part you already completed next time.\n\nAll that being said, I've had a lot of fun playing this game and would recommend it as the pros outweigh the cons for me. I would encourage those interested in puzzle games to give this one a try.","March 31, 2015","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first, this seems like a gift that makes the game that little bit easier, but this ends up tricking you, and you make mistakes that could have been avoided were you paying attention to the rest of the game. This is only one of the brilliant new ideas that Hexcells brings to the classic Minesweeper gameplay, aside from this game's gorgeous, quirky and unique shape and finish.

You start off learning that you can change hexagons blue or black with a number in the center, simple enough right? Just wait. It starts off easy yet the farther you go, even from world one to two you learn things that help you like where the blues will be, but those wont save you. I have completed this game before doing this so I could write an honest reeve about it. To be honest it didn't take long (1 day) and if you aren't an achievement hunter this is fine but since I saw there were only 7 I decided to give it a go. I have 6 at the moment and the last one loused me "Perfection" this is where you complete every level with 0 mistakes.

The controls are simple and flawless, just using the left and right mouse click as in the classic Minesweeper game.  It is rare for an experience so simple to be this enjoyable.  I can't wait to play Hexcells Plus to see if they add either more to the already great puzzle system they have put into place, or if it is just more of the endgame style puzzles to be wonderfully entertained by.  Again, if you like Picross and Minesweeper, even things like Sudoku or other logic games, do yourself a favor and toss the few bucks it is asking.

The final sets require a variety of styles of deductive reasoning to solve the cleverly designed puzzles without errors.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are fantastic and engaging, but the ambiance is what should make this a must-buy for fans of any genre.

With Minesweeper, winning fells like the luck of the draw rather than a logic exercise.  Luck adds a certain flair to other types of games, but with puzzle games like this, it does not do the game any favors.  Fortunately, Hexcells does not make the player rely on luck to complete puzzles.\n\nHexcells forces you to use reason and logic to solve a puzzle.  The goal of each puzzle is to clear the orange hexagons to reveal a certain pattern.  The numbers in each cell indicate how many surrounding cells are part of the pattern (this is where the similarity to Minesweeper comes in).  As you progress, new elements are added.  These elements are reminsicent of Picross.  There is a number above the column that indicates how many cells in that column are part of the ultimate pattern.  There are also numbers in brackets that tell you how many cells are connected.  The puzzles also get larger.\n\nThis is a relaxing puzzle game that is definitely worth the time if you enjoy logic puzzles.  It took me about 4.5 hours to complete 30 puzzles.","November 15, 2014","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I didn't expect to enjoy these games as much as I did. The games are a mix of Minesweeper and Sodoku, plus a few extra twists.\n\nThis game ran very well on my netbook at 1024x600 resolution (CPU: 1GHz dual-core AMD C-50), so I think that virtually any computer will be able to hande this game. If you are contemplating buying this game then you might as well get the Hexcells Bundle with both games (especially if you are proficient at logic puzzles). The difficulty curve in the second game starts exactly where the first game ended.\n\nAll the levels can be completed without having to resort to guessing, although sometimes you wont believe this. But even when you are unable to determine (for example) which two cells contain the mine, knowing that it is either one or the other may give you enough of a clue to clear a third cell. It is very satisfying when you eventually figure out the puzzle.\n\nThe only real con that I found to this game was that despite the harder levels taking some time to complete, there is a great sense of wanting to play just one more level when you do manage to finish it. This can be lead to some very late nights!\n\nFinally, a tip. If you are used to playing Minesweeper, you might like to swap the left & right mouse button actions in the configuration screen so that the right mouse button flags a cell as a blue cell (or a mine in Minesweeper parlance). I kept making mistakes all the time until I did this.","June 21, 2014","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a combination of Minesweeper and Picross, two of my favorite puzzle games. The puzzles started out simple but got surprisingly complex later in the game. The game is fairly short, with only 30 levels, but I expected that because of the low price. I completed the game in 2 hours, but I was so engulfed in the game that it felt like 30 minutes. The puzzles were fun to figure out and I'll probably buy the sequels.","September 3, 2014","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately the rules get inconsistent in the later levels. Whereas the tutorial tells you that -3- means that adjacent cells should have one gap between them, in later levels this rule gets negated which leads to many mistakes. Should be a logic and easy playing game but changes to very frustrating later on due to the above mentioned 'bug'.","September 3, 2014","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While playing i never felt like i was playing Sudoku or Minesweeper, i felt like i was playing something new. And i think that's the real strength of the game - the individual elements of the game may not be unique, but the combination of them makes it truly unique.\n\nI recommend the game on the basis of its originality, and also i find the puzzles very enjoyable to solve.\nThe game has 30 puzzles, some are shorter than others, but none is really long. When i completed the game Steam claims i spent 5 hours, but a lot of this time i was alt-tabbed, so in reality took me like 2 hours to beat the puzzles. For some, the short duration might be a problem, it was not for me. If you look for more puzzles, you can also buy Hexcells Plus (more puzzles) and Infinite (more puzzles, and the possibility of generating an infinite amount of them.\n\nI read some negative reviews claiming that the game is also too easy, and i can't really argue with that. For me it was a decent challenge. But that's maybe because i'm not very good at this kind of puzzles even though i enjoy doing them.\n\n","September 3, 2014","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With Minesweeper, winning fells like the luck of the draw rather than a logic exercise.  Luck adds a certain flair to other types of games, but with puzzle games like this, it does not do the game any favors.  Fortunately, Hexcells does not make the player rely on luck to complete puzzles.\n\nHexcells forces you to use reason and logic to solve a puzzle.  The goal of each puzzle is to clear the orange hexagons to reveal a certain pattern.  The numbers in each cell indicate how many surrounding cells are part of the pattern (this is where the similarity to Minesweeper comes in).  As you progress, new elements are added.  These elements are reminsicent of Picross.  There is a number above the column that indicates how many cells in that column are part of the ultimate pattern.  There are also numbers in brackets that tell you how many cells are connected.  The puzzles also get larger.\n\nThis is a relaxing puzzle game that is definitely worth the time if you enjoy logic puzzles.  It took me about 4.5 hours to complete 30 puzzles.","November 15, 2014","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is nothing like the default windows minesweeper has been since windows 95. There are no chance situations, you can 100% figure out every situation, it's just hard to do sometimes.\n\nThe only downside to this game (that I see) is that there's no save function mid-game.

The way the game works is you have a… let’s call it a board, filled with hexagons, which we’ll call cells. You need to determine which cells are occupied with a blue hexagon, and which ones are vacant (which will be grey). The vacant cells will also have a number inside them, indicating how many adjacent cells are occupied. You simply left click a cell to mark it as occupied, and right click a cell to mark it as vacant. If you’re correct, the cell will change accordingly. If you’re wrong, it’ll shake and mark you as getting making a mistake (more on this in a moment).\n\nAs you progress through the game, the puzzles will get more complicated, and additional ways to indicate whether or not a cell is occupied are introduced.  Sometimes numbers will be encased in curly brackets, indicating that all the occupied cells adjacent to the vacant cell are touching each other.  Where-as a number that has a hyphen on each side means that at least one of the adjacent occupied cells is not touching the other adjacent occupied cells. (Note for clarity: When I say the cells are touching each other, I don’t mean ALL the cells are touching ALL the other cells, but that they are connected like a line curved around the vacant cell.

There may be two groups of two touching cells for example).\n\nNumbers will also appear at the top of columns, or even at a diagonal, indicating how many occupied cells are in that row or column (reminding me ever so slightly of Picross).

The number of blue hexes awarded for completing a stage varies depending on its difficulty, and you will be awarded less blue hexes the more mistakes you make in a level. (Don’t worry, you can redo levels do earn the blue hexes you missed).\n\nThe music in the game is fairly calm and simple, it’s not anything particularly note-worthy, but it fits with the relaxed feel of the game. (Both the game and the music are overall rather relaxing).\n\nAs for criticisms, they’re two main things I feel this game lacks. 1). There’s no option to save a level mid-way through, so that you can leave the game and return to it later. My work around for this was to take a screen cap if I had to stop playing for some reason, and then just redo my stage progress from there. 2). It’d be nice if there was a way to map out a potential solution (similar to Picross’ overlay feature), so that you can indicate which cells you think may contain blue hexes, and which you think may be vacant without selecting them. Though, this is less needed in this Hexcells game than it is in later ones where you must figure out how large swathes of a level work together to determine if a cell has a blue hex or not.\n\nSo if you’re into puzzle games, then consider picking up the Hexcells pack when it goes on sale (often you can get all 3 games for less than $3). If you already have the first Hexcells game and want more, Hexcells Plus is basically the hard mode for this game, and Hexcells infinite will also provide you with more puzzles to play. If you only want one Hexcells game, go for Infinite, it has some improvements over the other two, and a random level generator, so it’ll offer more play time, (see my review for Hexcells Infinite for more details on that).

The way the game works is you have a… let’s call it a board, filled with hexagons, which we’ll call cells. You need to determine which cells are occupied with a blue hexagon, and which ones are vacant (which will be grey). The vacant cells will also have a number inside them, indicating how many adjacent cells are occupied. You simply left click a cell to mark it as occupied, and right click a cell to mark it as vacant. If you’re correct, the cell will change accordingly. If you’re wrong, it’ll shake and mark you as getting making a mistake (more on this in a moment).\n\nAs you progress through the game, the puzzles will get more complicated, and additional ways to indicate whether or not a cell is occupied are introduced.  Sometimes numbers will be encased in curly brackets, indicating that all the occupied cells adjacent to the vacant cell are touching each other.  Where-as a number that has a hyphen on each side means that at least one of the adjacent occupied cells is not touching the other adjacent occupied cells. (Note for clarity: When I say the cells are touching each other, I don’t mean ALL the cells are touching ALL the other cells, but that they are connected like a line curved around the vacant cell. For the hyphenated numbers, some of the cells may be touching each other, but there is at least one break in the group. There may be two groups of two touching cells for example).\n\nNumbers will also appear at the top of columns, or even at a diagonal, indicating how many occupied cells are in that row or column (reminding me ever so slightly of Picross).

After a few levels, the game begins its brilliance by adding new types of clues beyond "three of the surrounding hexes are empty," turning the game into something resembling a nonogram-like puzzle (the kind of puzzle featured in Nintendo's Picross games). These mechanics are backed up by excellent puzzle design and an ambient soundtrack that keeps players relaxed and focused as they work their way through the puzzles.\n\nThe only serious flaw in the game is that there isn't any replay value. There is still quite a bit of skill in repeating the large puzzles without making a mistake, but gradually players will remember the patterns and can cheat by learning from previous mistakes. Smaller puzzles also suffer as they can become simple exercises in trial and error.\n\nYet that flaw is a minor complaint. Anyone who enjoys logic-based puzzles should give this one a go.

Still it all plays really well, and the levels have a really nice well engineered feel to them, and a few great moments where you have been stuck for a while thinking there must be a bug and that you have to guess the next step and then things finally click and you see the extra bit of information or logical inference you need to progress.","January 16, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's my first ever real puzzle game I've ever bought on Steam, and I might have to say that it's my most favorite puzzle game I've ever played (Including all the 'less-puzzle' ones I own). The Gameplay is somewhat easy to learn.  At a certain point in the game they don't tell you anything about an introduction of a new mechanic and they just throw you into the cold water expecting you to figure it out....well they have done that at the right moment where you were kind of expecting that.  The music is probably the best thing about this game, along side with the gameplay of course. The music sounds as if it's synced by the way you're playing, which is amazing, and the calmness it gives you is amazing. Even better, no time limit, so you can take your time listening to the music and have a great time. The only negative part about this game is the length, it's quite short, I finished the game in about 3Hours and it took me another 1Hour to get a Complete 100% Game, but there is a 'cheap' addition to the game for this issue. If you're on the lookout for a fun and calm puzzle game, pick this one up.","May 16, 2015","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only sad thing is that a lot of puzzles look like tutorial puzzles, you can easily solve them within a minute. The good puzzles show up at the end, those can be very difficult but extremely challenging! You should definately give this game a try, I bought the Hexcells collection (Which includes all the 3 games) in sale for only €2,70, but it's also worth the full price in my opinion. If you want to spare some money, but the Hexcells Infite game which includes infinite puzzles which are way more difficult too!\n\n+ Whole new puzzle experience\n+ Some puzzles can be difficult\n+ Good tutorialpuzzles included\n+ Cheap\n\n- Puzzle doesn't save when you quit\n- Overall difficulty is too low\n- Small playing time\n\nOverall I give it a 7.0/10, it's worth a try and includes some whole new puzzle mechanics.

The advantage to actual minesweeper is that the levels are pre-designed to make sure its NEVER a 50/50 chance and always logical. Pre-designed levels also means its really really short though, I played multiple levels twice and still it says 1.7 hours for me. There is also no need to play twice, no achievements not granted or mines exploding when you make a mistake, the mistake counter just goes up. which bothered be enough to perfionist myself to 100% completion. This btw also has the nice side effect of adding another perfectly completed game to your profile, since getting all the achievement is really really easy.\nThe mechanics are introduced one after another. This means there is no overload with rules, this also means that the game only really gets hard towards the end once ALL comes together.\nAll together a nice albeit short puzzle game that I can recomend to anyone who is a fan of minesweeper and kakuro and to those who just like puzlle games, particularly when on sale.\n\nEDIT: I mentioned Kakuro quite often, perhaps I should clarifiy that no you dont add numbers to get the crossum in the end. The numbers on the side only tell you how many blue fields are in a line and how they are connected. I figured that this was the next best thing though, thats whats cool about this game there is no perfect comparison out there. Still totally sticking to my minesweeper comparison though.","June 4, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You start off learning that you can change hexagons blue or black with a number in the center, simple enough right? Just wait.

I have completed this game before doing this so I could write an honest reeve about it. To be honest it didn't take long (1 day) and if you aren't an achievement hunter this is fine but since I saw there were only 7 I decided to give it a go. I have 6 at the moment and the last one loused me "Perfection" this is where you complete every level with 0 mistakes.

Go through different levels of difficulty and solve all of the puzzles to get to 100%. Can you get every one with no mistakes?\n\nHexcells (apparent from the name) adds new dimensions to the classical game of Minesweeper: More adjacent fields to one hexagon as well as border numbers, which indicate how many fields of the pattern are in a line/row/diagonale. Each boder number can indicate different things, everything is explained within the game. No need to rush things. You are now thinking outside of hexcells.\n\nSound & MusicShallow but fitting background soundtracks and sounds. Nothing special, but that wasn't needed here. The soundtrack and soundeffects change every once and a while when you complete a puzzle.\n\nGraphicsDon't expect anything here. The game is primarily a puzzle game, so no high end graphics or effects. The design does its deeds and fulfills its task. Visuals are never irritating and do what they need to do.\n\nWeakpointsSometimes, portions of the soundtrack are a little too high-pitched in my opinion. This can get annoying, if you are not used to hearing the same sounds over and over again. They are adjustable ingame though, from soundeffects only to completely mute.\n\nConcluding ThoughtsGreat puzzlegame, compelling, challenging, tricky but fair.

After a few levels, the game begins its brilliance by adding new types of clues beyond "three of the surrounding hexes are empty," turning the game into something resembling a nonogram-like puzzle (the kind of puzzle featured in Nintendo's Picross games). These mechanics are backed up by excellent puzzle design and an ambient soundtrack that keeps players relaxed and focused as they work their way through the puzzles.\n\nThe only serious flaw in the game is that there isn't any replay value. There is still quite a bit of skill in repeating the large puzzles without making a mistake, but gradually players will remember the patterns and can cheat by learning from previous mistakes. Smaller puzzles also suffer as they can become simple exercises in trial and error.\n\nYet that flaw is a minor complaint. Anyone who enjoys logic-based puzzles should give this one a go.

But new mechanics are introduced which pushes it toward the realm of Sudoku.  I never found it frustrating or confounding, because the rules are simple enough that you only have to look for the next step, not make crazy leaps of logic.  Also, while you don't get a full score for making several mistakes, each mistake you make at the same time serves as a hint and moves you closer to the solution (a nice parallel with positivity in real life!)\n\nSo the gameplay requires you to be active and logical mentally, but not so much that you can't relax or have to get stressed.  And the rest of the game with its simple visuals and procedural ambient soundtrack works to make one of the most relaxing experiences I've seen in games.  The puzzles and music are in a nice area between idleness and frustrating which lets you slip easily into a meditative state while playing.\n\nI highly recommend this game, especially if you turn off the TV, turn the lights down a bit, kick up your feet, turn on a humidifier, lay a damp washcloth on your forehead, and just completely relax while playing.  For anyone dealing with excessive levels of stress or anxiety, this game could be outright therapeutic!","November 28, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first, it felt much like a hexagonal version of Minesweeper. When the lines were added, I was reminded of nonograms / paint-by-numbers puzzles. Then, as the puzzles continued, my mind became so occupied with the intersecting logic that I stopped trying to compare it to other games at all.\n\nIt may be worth skipping this and going directly to Hexcells Plus. First, if you get easily addicted to logic puzzles, Hexcells Plus will keep you thinking for much, much longer. Second, Hexcells Plus' difficulty ramps up slowly and consistently, never adding more than a few techniques at a time.

I didn't expect to enjoy these games as much as I did. The games are a mix of Minesweeper and Sodoku, plus a few extra twists.\n\nThis game ran very well on my netbook at 1024x600 resolution (CPU: 1GHz dual-core AMD C-50), so I think that virtually any computer will be able to hande this game. If you are contemplating buying this game then you might as well get the Hexcells Bundle with both games (especially if you are proficient at logic puzzles). The difficulty curve in the second game starts exactly where the first game ended.\n\nAll the levels can be completed without having to resort to guessing, although sometimes you wont believe this. But even when you are unable to determine (for example) which two cells contain the mine, knowing that it is either one or the other may give you enough of a clue to clear a third cell. It is very satisfying when you eventually figure out the puzzle.\n\nThe only real con that I found to this game was that despite the harder levels taking some time to complete, there is a great sense of wanting to play just one more level when you do manage to finish it. This can be lead to some very late nights!\n\nFinally, a tip. If you are used to playing Minesweeper, you might like to swap the left & right mouse button actions in the configuration screen so that the right mouse button flags a cell as a blue cell (or a mine in Minesweeper parlance). I kept making mistakes all the time until I did this.","June 21, 2014","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is easy to learn, In fact, it's a LOT like minesweeper without actually being minesweeper.  It's much better in my opinion.  The graphics are minimalist, which emphasize the clean logic of the game.  The music is calm and relaxing.\n\nCons\nIt's short.  I finished all the puzzles in 2.5 hours.\nThe logic only goes so far.  For a casual gamer this is probably a plus.  You don't have to derive clues from more than 2 orders.  But a few of the later puzzles will make you do a lot of 2nd order deductions.\nBut just when it was getting really, really good..it ended *pouty face*\nNot much for replay value.  You can play the puzzles again.  But you should probably let the game accumulate some dust and come back to it in a year, then it will probably be fun all over again.\n\nSummary\nIt's fun.

I'd recommend it to anyone who likes logic puzzle games. The point could be made that the gameplay is somewhat repetitive, but I think the creators have done more than enough to keep it interesting and fun. The puzzles aren't quite as difficult as they can get in the first game of the Hexcells series; if you'd like some more challenge, you might want to purchase Hexcells Plus and Hexcells Infinite, as well. In Plus, a new mechanic is introduced that adds a lot of depth to the gameplay and in both that and Infinite, there are some really challenging puzzles to be found. I wouldn't recommend buying those games without the original, though; the tutorials in Plus and Infinite are very, very hasty, while in this game, the learning curve is really smooth.\nThe game is quite casual and has a bit of a zen-ish feeling to it. Especially on endless mode in Infinite, but actually through the entirety of the three games, I got in a state nearing flow or trance or something like that.It's very relaxing to play and very compelling.\nIt's pretty short, however, as many other reviewers have mentioned before me; once again, I really do recommend you buy Plus and Infinite, because the two sequels also provide quite a lot more playtime.","December 31, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/paced_/recommended/265890/","paced_","paced","http://steamcommunity.com/id/paced_/","74 products in account","Some games have difficulty curves, but this has a difficulty wall. It occurs on World 6 (Level 24) and makes what would otherwise been a very easy game rather challenging. The puzzles do not seem to regenerate themselves after you quit a level which makes be believe the levels were designed by trial and error rather than algorithmically. If they did it algorithmically there could be an infinite amount of puzzles with different criteria matching to difficulty levels like you would see in Sudoku or nonograms/Picross which would add for potentially infinite replayability (and a fun Android game).\n\nSome other gripes: the annoying music and the difficult to read "MENU" text in the top right. I actually quit the game and started it up again when I made mistakes since I didn't see that I could just return to menu. You'd intuitively think that "Escape" would allow you to go back to the menu after a confirmation but it doesn't do that. Sacrificing functionality for minimalism is indicative of the worse aspects of this trend towards minimal design.\n\nIn short, this game is like a cross between Minesweeper and Picross with incredibly easy levels except the last world which I am trying to 100% as I write this.

If you like puzzles, you'll very probably finish this one in one sitting - it took me about an hour an ahalf to finish all the levels, plus another 10 minutes or so to go back and perfect my mistakes.\nThat being said, it serves very well as an introduction to the series. I got this one on sale and now I'll probably buy the other ones too.\nAll in all, it's very nice to play. Very simple concept, comfortable difficulty curve, well-built levels. The music is also quite good, with your moves participating in the sonic environment.\n\nAgain, very much recommended.","January 3","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On its own, Hexcells is a very short game (about 3-5 hours). With only 30 levels to play through, it is not the type of game you will get much replayability out of either, as the puzzles don't shift or change.\n\nIf you find this type of game up your alley, pick up the other two games (Hexcells Plus and Hexcells Infinite) as well.

It feels kind of like minesweeper, but with different ways of visualizing the pattern instead of just the number of "mines" surrounding a block.  Best of all, I have not had to guess once yet and I have beaten Hexcells, and am halfway through Hexcells Plus.  It does get challenging, but the solution can still be figured out using logic.  My wife even enjoys this game quite a bit, and she doesn't play games often.\n\nMy main gripe with this game is that the controls feel backwards from minesweeper in that you left click the block that is part of the pattern (a mine), and right click an empty block.  I have played a good bit of minesweeper in the past and right click for mine and left click for empty was a very hard habit to break.  I had to restart many puzzles due to click confusion.  Unfortunately the game doesn't make you restart when you make a mistake, but it does keep track of the number of mistakes.  If you want to go for the perfectionist achievement, you have to beat every level without mistakes, and it doesn't seem to tell you which levels you made mistakes on if you choose to complete the stage with mistakes.  I get around this problem by restarting the level when I make a mistake.\n\nOverall, this is a great addition to the library!","December 24, 2015","true","17.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, unlike Minesweeper which is randomly generated, each level in Hexcells is pre-made by the developer to have a unique and deducible solution. There are bits of spacial thinking that come in play, from crossword puzzles like Sudoku.\n\nHexcells also takes the minesweeper playstyle and increases the complexity (always offering a deducible solution though), by introducing row/column markings in lieu of additional viewable pieces, as well as special tile number markings that denote certain behavior of where the blue pieces will be.\n\nI was a bit skeptical at first, but I'm really enjoying this series. I'm not noticing a terribly large complexity in this game, but I haven't gotten to the other two Hexcells games yet. I would recommend to people who enjoy puzzles.","December 25, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
