Artefacts of an ancient, highly advanced civilization have been left scattered throughout occupied space. Halcyon 6, a derelict starbase, is one such artefact. Now in the hands of the Human Federation, Halcyon 6 is yours to command and restore, but with several factions around you, including a mysterious alien force, it’s going to be difficult to restore the base and protect nearby human settlements.\n\nVisually, Halcyon 6 is fantastic. The pixel graphics are awesome, the menus and UI are great too. The design, though, is what really makes the visual side of things shine. The different factions are all well thought out and they look awesome, plus the different factions all have their own ships which are also very well designed.\n\nHalcyon 6’s gameplay consists of several different elements which come together to create one game. Firstly, we have base building a la XCOM. You clear out rooms on the starbase which can then be used to house anything from power generators to ship hangars. Then we have a research tree similar to the one in Civilization: Beyond Earth (though Halcyon 6’s actually makes sense) through which you can unlock new ships, new rooms as well as improve fuel usage etc. Research is carried out instantly but it costs Materials and Dark Matter (two of the three resources in the game, they’re also used to build new ships and rooms though ships and rooms also require a certain number of humans to work on them, more humans can be found at colonies from which you can evacuate them). Fuel is the third resource which is consumed by fleets when you send them out. The game’s hints of FTL come from the different factions and the overall feel and the game’s design. The similarities also extend to the map which is a reasonably large portion of space filled with different sectors. When you send out a fleet and they move around the map is when time moves (though you can also unpause the game to hurry along any construction). Enemies and neutral or friendly ships can only move when time is unpaused so pausing the game can be used as a way to assess what’s going on and plan for any incoming attacks.\n\nCombat is turn-based and can be up to 3v3 ships (though if you move to a sector with multiple groups on enemies you’ll have to fight one after the other). You have three different ship classes, each with a corresponding crew member class, there’s: Science, Engineering and Tactical. Each class has specific skills that you can unlock (and level up with your character) and each ship has three default skills as well which also improve when you level up. Skills usually inflict damage on a single target (though there are group attacks as well as buff skills for yourself/team) and they also inflict, exploit or inflict on-self different effects (usually a mixture of the three). Inflicting something generally deals damage over time or has some kind of status effect, for example you can disable a ship for a number of turns or damage the hull which deals a certain amount of damage over a number of turns. Other skills will then exploit these effects to create combos which deal considerably more damage than usual. For example, one of my Science ships can disable sensors which can then be exploited by my Tactical ships to deal considerably more damage than usual. To be effective in combat (and not get your ♥♥♥ handed to you) you’ll need to use these combos as much as possible. Inflict on-self will inflict a negative (occasionally positive) status effect on you. Combat can be very challenging so it’s important to make sure you’re prepared before you can and attack something, especially as you can’t save/quit once you’ve entered combat (though you can at any other time).\n\nWhen you unlock a new crew member slot, you’ll be able to choose between the three classes for what you want. Each crew member has specific ship and ground combat skills that they can unlock later when they level up. Ground combat works in the same way as space combat and occurs when enemies are found after clearing out a room. Your crew members earn experience, and in turn level up, by surviving combat and they’ll sometimes earn bonuses such as a damage increase against certain factions as well.\n\nHalycon 6 does have a story and it plays out in a similar way to XCOM. Like with XCOM, you can pick and choose when you want to progress with the story of the currently available first act (act two and three will be added later). The other factions will become more powerful over time but rushing in can be just as bad as taking too long. The story progresses through main missions and side missions. Side missions usually consist of simply protecting a human colony from a fleet of pirates or aliens but there are other tasks you’ll have to complete too, such as defending your starbase from an attacker (incredibly important since the humans on-board will gradually die while you’re being attacked). There are a couple of different storylines running through it so you may receive several main missions at once which usually require a couple of extra steps than a side mission. I won’t go into any more details to avoid spoilers though I will say that the first act already offers quite a lot which is obviously stretched out by the fact you can go through it at your own pace.\n\nCompleting missions awards you with valuable resources and this is one of the three ways you can get resources in the game. You can also visit human colonies that have resource extraction facilities (fuel, materials and dark matter) which will collect a certain amount of resources for you to collect, once you’ve collected them the colony will begin producing more. The starbase also produces resources though it does this incredibly slowly to begin with, you’ll need to complete research for this to be a viable means of collecting the amount of resources you need. Just like in XCOM and FTL, resource management is INCREDIBLY important. Run out of fuel and you can’t send your fleet out. Run out of dark matter, you can’t repair your ships. Run out of dark matter and materials you can’t build anything new. Run out of everything…well you’re just screwed.\n\nJust a couple more things to wrap up. The game is pretty difficult to begin with and you’ll probably die quite quickly but once you’ve got the hang of things it’s a manageable difficulty. The soundtrack is excellent. Controls are basic, you don’t have to use anything other than your mouse but there are also helpful hotkeys. And lastly, despite being an Early Access game I didn’t encounter any bugs while playing it.\n\nVerdict\nHalcyon 6: Starbase Commander is an excellent, well designed, space strategy game with great gameplay, a good amount of content (with more to come) and an interesting story. If you’re a fan of strategy games you’ll definitely like this, even in its Early Access state.\n\nLone Ranger Reviews.\n\nEl K.","April 27","true","7.5"," 52 of 61 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","52","61","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/graystillplays/recommended/371200/","graystillplays","GrayStillPlays","http://steamcommunity.com/id/graystillplays/","42 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nHalcyon 6 wasn't just going for a genre, it was going for ALL the genres, and the question becomes whether it can keep gamers entertained, or confuse the sweet internet JESUS out of them.  There are a huge amount of options, menus, choices, resource gathering, and of course combat in Halcyon 6, and in this review we'll be going over what we've currently been given as an Early Access Beta.  As usual we'll be looking at three categories in particular, Gameplay, Sound, and Look.\n\nFor those that would rather listen/watch an in-depth review rather than read it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-052Wmwt8\n\nGameplay: Halcyon 6 is a game that has a clear and defined attention to detail when it comes to the various game mechanics, and believe me, there are a LOT of game mechanics.  It's one thing when a game tries to do too many things at once, but when a game succeeds at doing most or even all of those things, THAT is the real triumph.  All of the things that I mentioned Halcyon 6 does it DOES do well.  Combat is filled with a measure of strategy, including a vulnerability exploration combo style system.  Exploration is fun, but somewhat limited in scope, allowing you to visit various planets and moons in an attempt to find additional aid, enemies, or resources.\n\nYour team is built exclusively by you choosing from three random prospects whenever an open slot appears thanks to you increasing your fleet to three officers, or one of them meeting an untimely death.  You must utilize the resources you find to improve your technology, build additional ships, or upgrade the Halcyon 6 itself.  And the game itself gives you the opportunity to make choices, like allying with Pirates for, air quotes, “mutual gain” or canceling out a 2666 year loan by participating in a trial by combat (PICK THE TRIAL BY COMBAT).\n\nHalcyon's only weakness is that the development team is still clearly measuring how to balance the progression of the game and the strength of the enemies the player has to deal with.  Since there's no difficulty button, several players have quickly found the game can go from tutorial mode to DIE ♥♥♥♥♥ DIE rather quickly.  Despite a few minor setbacks, the gameplay is not only solid but fun and varied, giving Halcyon a 9 out of 10.\n\nSound: The sound in Halcyon is superb, when it exists, which luckily is most of the time.  I only found a few small instances where ships or weapons didn't have accompanying sound effects, but the rest of the time the retro sci-fi music and the various blips and blasts of your offensive and defensive powers were a joy to listen to.  Halycon 6 remains classy and professional, while not letting go of that 1990's arcade style soundtrack.  There are no voice overs, but I wouldn't have expected any in a game like Halcyon 6, instead it's all about having satisfying effects for the players choices.  Right behind gameplay, Halcyon scores a 9 out of 10.\n\nLook: Halcyon 6 is a pixel art style game, which means you're going to get your Chinese buffets worth of pixels.  If you go into the game understanding that this is the art style, you won't be disappointed.  The character designs are quite well done, and in some cases outright fantastic.  Even the effects can appear to jump off of the screen in some instances, showing Massive Damage definitely has a knack for working with this style of artwork.  Most importantly, while the game is pixel-art, you can actually see and understand what is happening.  An alien looks like an alien.  A space ship looks like a space ship, and more so, each races spaceships are different, which is a damn fine example to set, rather than cutting and pasting the same few models over and over.\n\nYou'll notice that in most scenes, such as combat scenes, the background not only varies, but is animated, which scores big points for Halcyon 6.  Even if it's just a few chunks of space rock floating to and fro, it adds so much compared to a simple, static background that remains completely stagnant.  Most importantly, the text and numbers are clear and easy to read, which has been a pet peeve of mine in some pixel-art style games.  One of the few immediate suggestions I would have is to make the health bars much more contrasted so that the overall amount of life the various combatants have is easier to see.  Outside of this, Halcyon 6 follows up with it's third straight 9 out of 10, giving it a total average score of 9 out of 10.","April 20","true","10.5"," 39 of 47 people (83%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","83","39","47","8","0"

You will pick officers and space ships with different skills to defeat enemy space pirates. By doing so and conquering outposts you will acquire resources used to research technologies and upgrade your starbase and ships. You will dynamically receive new quests from lunatics around the galaxy with hilarious dialogues while also defending from enemy aliens.\n\nReally awesome game!","April 20","true","26.8"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","28","32","4","0"

The scope and ambition is huge, and so far, the game totally delivers. The music is incredible - totally reminds me of Star Wars (although it is definately its own thing). I will likely get dozens of hours out of this easily. Only episode 1 of 3 is available now, but you get all 3 for the reduced Early Access price.\n\nThere are so many wonderful elements mixed in here that it is difficulty to describe them all. You have XCOM-like base building. JRPG battles that work great (think Final Fantasy-ish). Random elements a la modern roguelikes (although this game is not a roguelike). And debatably one of the best features IMO - the story unfolds that unfolds is awesome. And its created by you as you play. The whole thing feels really organic and actually has me reading the text, which in many other titles I find myself wanting to skim or skip altogether.\n\nIf this game looks like even remotely like your jam, I wouldn't even hesitate.\n\nPros:\n+So many different game elements combined, and they are all top-notch and work so well together\n+Excellent excellent pixel art\n+Music is top-notch and really adds to the atmosphere\n+Character personality developement is really well done\n+How the story unfolds, and your part in that, is very cool\n+Definately has complexity, yet is easy to learn (UI is intuitive, etc.)\n+So much content now, and ~2/3 of it isn't even released yet\n\nCons:\n-'Partial' controller support didn't make sense to me - I have to use the mouse (unless I use the Steam controller, which is a totally different thing)\n\nVery ambitious project that has delivered even before full release. Easily two-thumbs up from me. I think it's underpriced, honestly.

Coming home from work to check the featured list and finding this elegant package waiting for me was a pure delight.\n\nHalcyon 6 is the synthesis of titles such as FTL (though I don't entirely agree with that comparison given how different the mechanics are at present) and a three-party turn-based RPG such as Final Fantasy.\n\nAlongside the combat mechanics which are beautifully rendered in a colorful and approachable palette is the strategy section between missions where you manufacture and make improvements to ships, your officers in command of said ships,the Halcyon 6 base itself, and patrol your local system keeping the peace.\n\nIt's a great example of how less is more. H6 uses a substantially less complicated interface and economy than that of it's 4x's counterparts to allow for accessible and genuinely fun gaming while maintaining a similar level of complexity and challenge. The art of managing your vessels in order to strike a balance between preservation of current resources while scouring potential planets for resources is challenging though and still in need of balancing.\n\nThe ships are a treat to behold and each one is borrows from awesomely cheesed up TV series such as Star Trek while being uniquely singular and beholden to the universe the game takes place in.\n\nInteraction with other species is more on the comical side of things in the same way the ios game Star Command is (which was also a Kickstarter backed title). They share a few similarities in aesthetics but H6, despite the various comparisons with equally fantastic games such as FTL, manages to stand apart from such titles with a unique, fun, and stimulating degree of challenge and reward.\n\nhttps://ethnographix.squarespace.com/blog/2016/5/7/shohdeeze-halcyon-6","April 24","true","8.3"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dkewe/recommended/371200/","dkewe","Danny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dkewe/","289 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis was a hidden gem I only came across on accident but I think it deserves to be noticed. It is a great combination of many different ideas that come together to make a grand game. Building up your station is a fun thing to do but comes with dangers as you try to expand and find creatures living in your base. I lost many a cadet to those critters, good thing they are so expendable! Very hard to say what exactly I love the most when the whole package ended up being so fun.\n\nThe tactical combat is a welcome difference from all the extremely fast paced but boring combat of most space games. It is still very high energy as you struggle to fight against fleets stronger than you while trying to line up devastating combos that can obliterate a powerful vessle in two blows. My favorite being stunning the crew and then using suicide run to smash it to pieces. You feel strong when using your brain you defeat an enemy far stronger than you. Since this is a roguelike game expect that to be the case more often than not as they have some powerful fleets they will toss your way.\n\nThe star map is fun as it is frantic. Flying around space desperately trying to protect your stations from the aliens and deciding which ones just aren't possible to hold out any longer and evacuating them to save the crew. It is a tough decision because you will lose the resources it will generate but you get the crew of the station to build new ships and aid in defense. I had a lot of fun on my run plotting out paths that were the most efficient to pick up the resources while also obliterating any harrassing fleets trying to take out my infrastructure.\n\nThe side factions are also interesting. They seem to half want to kill you while on the other half looking to be your best pal. You'll have to discern for yourself who is truly at your side and who would love to punch a hole through your chest. My favorite being the pirates. They end up being much more than simple bandits that they first appear as you learn more about them and their internal struggles.\n\nCouldn't recommend this game anymore than I can with just a thumbs up. It is well worth the money even in its limited early access state. Only one act out right now but for how fun it was, and that there is definitely replayability in decided who to help and who to blast into bits, its well worth the cash. Take a chance on this one, its worth it.","April 23","true","8.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Hand pick your officers and build a fleet as quickly as you can - the aliens aren't going to wait for you to come to them.\n\nSeveral different races and factions are out there - you may be able to negotiate with some, but violent conflict is often inevitable.\n\nCombat starts out pretty simple, but has the potential to blossom into a complex web of status effects, vulnerabilities, and exploitations.

But just gathering won't be enough - you'll also need to protect those planets and stations from aliens who'll try to destroy them. You can, of course, always close them down and just rescue the crew, but then you won't get those precious resources.\nThe time on the map works the same way it did in XCOM games - enemies move whenever you do. So you'll have to decide very carefully on where to fly next.\nOh, and don't send them too far away - your space station will get attacked sooner rather than later and you will have to defend it!\nAnd you'll also need to expand your station. First, clean out the rabble, then build something in new clean room (very much XCOM-like).\nThere's also a tech tree with a variety of unlocks and upgrades that include new rooms for the base and new ships.

And the longer you play, the more important that synergy becomes. I found it to be pretty cool.\n\nFrom my time of playing it, I haven't encountered any serious issues.\nThere are some minor annoyances in UI (that no doubt will be ironed out eventually) and I also had a few glitches, but that's about it - pretty solid v0.1 :)\n\nIf you are interested in seeing gameplay, have a look at my in-depth video:\nhttps://youtu.be/Wfo3YId1PcQ","April 30","true","6.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

You then repeat this process many times until you win.\n\nThere are other aspects to the game beyond the combat, but due to the nature of the alien enemy, they will spawn endlessly from their spires (spawn points) until you reach a certain research level (tier 3 I presume, I haven't actually got there yet).\n\nDuring that time in which you cannot attack their spires from which they spawn, you will have to deal with endless waves of enemies that progressively get larger and stronger as I said above. You have to progress in tech and build larger ships to combat these stronger aliens but it doesn't feel like I'm making progress, I'm constantly trailing the enemy in an attempt to keep up. I never have the advantage.\n\nThere will times when your resource colonies fall before you have a reasonable chance to save them. Mostly they don't, but I have had it happen a couple times already. This is frustrating but what's worse is that you cannot restart colonies in ruins(from what I'm able to see), so once they are gone, that's it. This would be a good thing to change if you were going to change something.\n\nYou do not get a very high pool of officers to use in the game. You can only reasonably run 1 fleet of 3 ships for most of the time you're playing. Researching later technologies and building the appropriate buildings within the station increases the amount of officers you can have, but it's very slow. As it is now, I'm struggling to use my meager one full fleet of ships trying to do everything while 2 other officers sit at the station doing nothing but short supply runs because you can't reliably combat anything without a full fleet.\n\nExploring the H-6 Station requires having other characters on the station doing nothing in order to deal with combat situations that arise. Sending a character to explore without Officer support is extremely risky. The "Red Shirts" that you can recruit to help you during on station combat when no other officer characters are around have the most basic abilities and die extremely quickly. They shouldn't even exist really. Most of the enemies you encounter during on station combat have AoE abilities and kill these characters in the first round. Exploring the station requires multiple officers.\n\nThe research system is fairly basic as well. You don't wait for research to occur over time, you simply purchase the technology out right. As long as you have the materials and dark matter (the game currencies), you can purchase and use any technology right away. The fact that laboratory type buildings don't exist on the station is a massive missed opportunity. Especially given the nature of the story within the game. I honestly can't believe it.","April 22","false","7.7"," 35 of 61 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","35","61","0","9"

You can make choices that affect the game, depending on what you do with each of the factions.\n\nThe combat is Final Fantasy turn-based style, but not lame or old fashioned.  There are lots of synergies that you can have between your different ship types and officers, and the name of the game is to set up the right buffs/debuffs to get large damage hits due to the bonuses.\n\nIt's 15 bucks.

A few typos in various dialogues and some funky grammar, but those are things to go over during Polish Phase and didn't detract from my  own personal enjoyment of the game.\n\nOverall score right now: 9/10, it's not perfect, but nothing is.

But oh boy, don't think I haven't learned a bit from this time playing.\n\nThere are many things to do in this game such as, clear out your f*cking massive starship to build rooms inside of, and fight possible ground enemies in order to clear said rooms (What, did you think it'd be as simple as X-Com?). Second, you have space travel in a large-scale starmap with plenty of planets, and resource producing areas you will find available after you save a planet from an attack of some kind. Be warned however, the main scourge of the game will attempt to raid these planets & work areas, if you do not intervine, those areas will be permanetly destroyed.\nYou're probably thinking something along the lines of, "Oh, we have to stop these guys, okay, but how do we kill them if they have ships and we're just on the ground?", guess what, you have ship-combat in this game, and boy does it take strategy if you plan on winning those big-bad fights that hang highly important things on the line. And before you bring the thought into your head, yes, the resource gathering planets do indeed have a capacity, so make sure you keep an eye on that and always attempt to collect, as to not waste any valuable fuel & or crew. Last of all, you can make allies, and a whole lot of enemies. Every once in awhile a ship/ambassador of some kind will visit your stapship and communicate with you, they will ask requests ranging from, them needing someone or something killed, a trade of some sort, and a alliance of the sorts. All of these have their own options, all of which will change how the path of you game goes in the long-run, weather it be that oh-so needed last bit of dark matter & materials, or that alliance that could've saved your now near-death fleet.\n\nPros;\n+Fun, addictive, gives you quite a challenge to work with\n+An ant-farm style base to build areas (similar to X-com)\n+The fact that your choices in this game can determine a whole lot about how everything and anything happens it the game.\n+It's very easy to get in over your head, chances are within your first two hours, you are going to lose, which isn't exactly a bad thing, it's the type of game that seems easy to learn, but is ♥♥♥♥ing hard to master.\n+As of yet, even though the game is currently in early access, i've only come across one bug\n+Un-limit-ed re-play-ibil-ity. Everytime you lose, the game changes pretty much everything, from the alien factions, to the crew, the starship location, and planets, etc. etc. I could go on-and -on, but I have games to play and possible reviews to write :3\n\nCons;\n-Bug where sometimes when leaving New Terra, you will still be forced to fight the fleet even though you decided to leave. This has made me lose 2 solid games in a row :/\n-If difficulty in a game off-sets you, I'd have to say avoid this title, as it's tough to find out what reserches are most optimal and needed for your survival, and multi-tasking your fleet, pirates attacking, planet raids, and resource gathering at pretty much the same time\n\nIf tl;dr, Get. This. Game. I swear you'll fall in love with it as have I.\n\nOverall, 9/10 -Me\n>Inb4 "Oh, you've only played for 3.4 hours, you have no right to say anything about the games current state" One game can feel very very long, but oh does it only last for a little time before you make those rookie mistakes ;3","April 23","true","3.4"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","10","15","3","4"

Everyone else is talking about the graphics and gameplay, but let me tell you something about this game.  If you play it for 24 hours straight after your girlfriend tells you that you're playing too many video games, she will leave you.\n\nBut that's ok because you'll still have this sweet game to play.\n\nGreat graphics, great quests, fun upgrades, tons to do, the game progressively gets harder.

Love making things vulnerable and then exploiting. Lots of fun customization with the ships and the crew. The rate with which you obtain new captains to fly more ships is a little slow though. Also the visuals of the health bars don't make sense to me, and you have to hover over them to find out the actual damage that has been done.

It can be a little aggravating trying to get through everything when your initial officers die and you lose out on your initial ships.\n\nLooking forward to see how the developers play this one out.

Just keeping your galaxy pruned and healthy to keep that Dark Matter flowing is an engrossing job. Combat is good. Nearly every attack either can create a debuff or EXPLOIT a debuff, dissolving the debuff for a damage bonus. Many of the debuffs are quite helpful, so it creates an interesting game to keep or exploit. Team composition for land and space combat is everything, as is playing to your strengths. The best attacks may debuff the attacker as well. Be VERY careful you don't get exploited right back!\n\nThis reminds me of many a game with a main story, but enough side things to keep you well occupied without digging. I've not pushed through the main story, but if someone hadn't told me the game wasn't finished yet, I wouldn't have noticed. Has the potential to be a show stopper, but is fun as hell right now.","April 21","true","10.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It reminds me a little of star trek birth of the federation but much more tongue in cheek. There is humour and fun to be had but also tense action when the enemy has the upper hand. I assume there will be lots of balancing but at the moment there is a steep rise in difficulty when the Cruul send a ship that is unbeatable unless you kill several other waves of enemies.\n\nThe ground based combat is on its first taste at the moment but that doesn't mean it is lacking in quality. It follows the same style as the space battles with abilities that cause statuses and abilities that take advantage of such abilities and it's all about exploiting these combinations to get success!\n\nAll in all a good fun game that I look forward to seeing how it progresses","April 21","true","14.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I mean this is the best possible way as that is one of my favorite childhood movies.  There was this feeling of solace that has since transformed into a developing relationship with a community of encounters during the exploration of this massive galaxy; meeting new alien races, getting into antics, rescuing people, building a space station, collecting resources, and ever-changing storyline.  I am so pleased with how this game was developed and implemented.  Its like Star Trek meets Alien meets SpaceBalls (The dialog is silly and engaging).\n\nGraphics: 10 - meaning they capture the old school 80's graphics perfectly.  This isn't some high end CGI production.  It is more aimed at ROGUE-like  nostalgia and it captures the feeling perfectly. The ships and characters look amazing\n\nSound: 10 - it is eerie, dark, playful, and fitting for the environment of the game.\n\nGameplay: 10 - this is addicting, the recourse dependent exploration and growth environment is so addicting and will keep you glued to the screen for hours.  Also the ability to build ships, recruit officers, acquire and obtain  skills, and develop your space station is so addicting.  I cant praise this part of the game enough.  Seriously worth every cent.\n\nCombat: 10 - the turn-based combat that focuses on abilities and strategy is executed perfectly.  The combat has a learning curve which keeps it challenging but greatly fun and enjoyable.\n\nStoryline: 10 - the story changes with the decisions you make.  It is fun, dark, silly, and engaging.\n\nConclusion: Get this game.  It is fun and enjoyable and you will not be disappointed.","April 21","true","1.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It's a mixture of horror and humor that is very well balanced to keep you laughing while at the same time just constantly uneasy. The character descriptions are especially good; whoever is writing those deserves a raise. Interacting with other factions diplomatically is a real treat. Do yourself a favor and really read all the text presented at you as you play. At any given point you realize you're in a blend of scifi parody and terrifying dystopia where technology is your last best hope for humanity but also incredibly dangerous. In that sense, I am reminded of XCOM, and the base-building and research gameplay reminds me of it as well. Other reviewers talking about FTL are right on the money, too, both in artistic style and game theme.\n\nThe story is compelling, but the game also has a wonderful soundtrack to really get you in the mood. It evokes a retro era while being unmistakably scifi with an epic scale. I'm a Kickstarter backer, and honestly the reward I am most looking forward to getting is a download of the soundtrack.\n\nThe game is currently in Early Access, so it should go without saying there are still bugs and balance issues, but the developers are addressing these quickly. I've been impressed with their professionalism and enthusiasm. The game is not yet content-complete, but it'll get there, and it promises to be highly moddable in the future. They've made a lot of tweaks to gameplay and the UI based on feedback, and I'm confident they're a talented and dedicated team.\n\nI haven't talked a lot about gameplay here, but a lot of other reviewers have covered that already, and again the game is still being balanced so chances are whatever I'd say would be outdated by the time you read this. If it sounds like a game you might be interested in, you'll probably really love it. There are other games out there with similar gameplay elements, though I feel there's some useful innovations here.

Not exactly a roguelike, even though it's galaxy map and events are random each new game, in this way it's more like a 4x, but the focus here is your ships, crew and starbase (which is the only real construction hub, despite having access to many other facilities you may find). The focus on survival of your ships and their commanders (and their crew of course... though many will be lost on regular expeditions after the first few ingame weeks. lol), make this one feel something along the line of Star Trek meets X-Com.\n\nEven this early on it's a good time. Personally it seem very stable for me (never crashed), nor did I encounter any game ending bugs. Worth noting as well that it also seems to be quite well balanced as far as difficulty is concerned.\n\nI am looking forward to see this game evolve as it develops (hopefully), but it's already very much worth the purchase fee.","May 11","true","1.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

On to of that there is a bunch of random events (ala text based, multiple choice shorts) that you will need to make decisions on with varying results  and from what I can tell same choices do not necessarily result in same results all the time which is great in my mind since it always leaves you guessing if you want to take that risk and keeps it fresh.\n\nI wish the map was procedural generated to (correct me if I am wrong) or maybe it will be in the future (I hope it will be since at this stage I can see that there is some system still not in place in this early builds)\n\nOverall, I am enjoying the heck out of the game and can easily see it becoming my favorite during my lunch breaks at work.","April 22","true","3.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

On to of that there is a bunch of random events (ala text based, multiple choice shorts) that you will need to make decisions on with varying results  and from what I can tell same choices do not necessarily result in same results all the time which is great in my mind since it always leaves you guessing if you want to take that risk and keeps it fresh.\n\nI wish the map was procedural generated to (correct me if I am wrong) or maybe it will be in the future (I hope it will be since at this stage I can see that there is some system still not in place in this early builds)\n\nOverall, I am enjoying the heck out of the game and can easily see it becoming my favorite during my lunch breaks at work.","April 22","true","3.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The developers are clearly 'on their game' with their game; so to say and the game runs and feels great!\n\nThey've really nailed the 'rogue'like' feeling with the random events and combat to the management of precious resources, which can make or break your run.  Both ship combat as well ground combat (Blarg!) work well and really test your meddle.  A player who simply takes the easy road will NOT become victorious and it really takes quite a bit of decision to leave your first officer in a new space or collect the space algae which could overtake the entire system!  It's glorious the  possible decisions and randomness I've found so far and I love it!\n\nI've played it now just under 6h on this  Early Release version and it's getting better every iteration.  I cannot recommend more Massive Damage and their commitment to the project.\n\nGreat job Massive Damage and can't wait to see what the future brings.  Currently riding strong on Day 139 now and fully upgraded ships (Tact & Engi) and working on my Science vessel now!\n\n[Edit 2] I wanted to add this so no one would be mistaken on what I've been told is a 'fanboi' review.  Some of the combat, early on, is repetative.  This is because of not only being EA and they have stated they are working on mixing it up more but as well the story itself works towards this reason.  The main enemies, which people rightfully state get boring to kill, are similar to a locust plague or something that is trying to take over and consume the entire galaxy.  Because of this plotline, of course there are going to be similar battles and until you unlock higher tier ships and powers (you get more as your ships and pilots advance) you do tend to use the most resourceful 'combo' of powers/attacks.  It doesn't mean they always work as I lost a Legendary captain on day 250 on seemingly 'easy' enemies because of the RNG of getting hit, evading, dmg rolls, etc.  I carelessly thought that it was going to be the same combat and it wasn't.  Because of this I lost my highest rank captain.\n\nAgain, this isn't for everyone; nothing ever is so please do not buy this on my recommendation alone.  I backed it from the start and I like what I see and I enjoy playing it.  You may too.\n\n[Edit] Oh boy.. Days pass > harder AI.  Just rescued a named Engineer from a planet and had to fight 3 waves of ever increasing enemies.  Made it out alive by the skin of my pants but also then got randomly attacked by Space Pirates who ended up killing my Legendary Engineer! :(\n\nBeware that you WILL lose ships, you WILL lose pilots and you'll need several fleets to engage and manage threats while gathering resources.  So much fun!\n\nAlso, it must not track time in OFFLINE mode as it shows only 1.9h but I have played more like 6-8 hours already.  A good thing is you can play in OFFLINE mode unlike some others using Steamworks.","April 22","true","1.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The (partially) delivered product has surpassed expectations and we're only 1/3 of the way through it. Can't recommend the game enough. Masterful artwork and catchy soundtrack complement a chaotic, stress-fest of fighting back nasties (and sometimes your neighbors). The game can be difficult at times; sometimes even unfair, which is what has led to it sometimes being described as "rogue-like." Don't let that scare you off though, there is so much depth (and a handy save function for when you finally get a good thing going) to this game that I haven't even had time to explore this third that we've been given.

It's great to see the game being pretty much exactly what they promised. But it's definitely still in beta. There are graphical glitches, minimal tutorials, insufficient tooltips, hotkeys aren't customizeable or even detailed anywhere I could find in the game and the ones I could figure out don't make a lot of sense to me, and game balance needs improvement. But I haven't found any genuine bugs in the mechanics of the game so far and that I'm happy about, it means they've built a solid framework for the game and just need to work out the details.\n\nGetting through the first few story missions felt like climbing Everest...just completing the first step in the story took me more than an hour in my first game. The resources required to research and build the next tier of officer structure to unlock the 3rd officer feels extremely prohibitive, then building him/her a ship to join your fleet is another chore. I started a new game once I knew what to expect and it still took me almost 45minutes to get a 3rd officer and a ship for him, all the while fighting for my life against pirates and trying to respond to as many distress calls as I could to try to hold on to a few resource producing outposts and evacuate all the ones that were too far from the station for me to effectively protect so I could pad my crew on the station and not feel like a total failure when the Chruul eventually killed them. It took me nearly three hours to reach the target of the next stage of the storyline once I had my 3rd officer...sending a fleet of three ships to New Terra ended up feeling like a huge risk because it's so far away from the station and while the fleet is away you're defenseless. By the time they got home I had 2 enemy fleets sieging the station killing my crew in the bombardment.\n\nIt's been fun playing and I'm going to keep at it since i enjoy a challenge.

Currently, the game is in a very, very early stage and doesn't have all that much to it. You basically send your fleet(s) around the galaxy and have them fight either Chruul or Pirates (Albeit im only 4 hours into the game). The game is filled with resource management and has a good load of content and progression.\nOne of my problems with the game is that progression is painstakingly slow, it took me at least an hour just to get an better tactical ship! Another big problem with the game is that is extremely difficult early on.\n\nChruul come out of spires extremely fast, so fast that it's very hard to manage and defend all of the planets that give you vital resources. Sometimes this can even bring the game to a complete halt, keeping you from progressing and ending the game. This isn't at the fault of the player either, it's all because of the spawn rates of the Chruul!\n\nAt the moment, combat becomes repetitive and boring. I found myself annoyed fighting the same pirates and chruul ships over and over again. It has great potential, but just gets repetitive after a while.\n\nThe game really has great potential, and I'll change my review when they balance and change the game. But as of right now, I would refrain from buying the game unless you only want 2-3 hours of fun before it gets repetitive.","April 25","false","3.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","5"

I only gave it a thumbs down because I was literally falling asleep from playing it. I may sound like a heretic since most people gave it a thumbs up. Perhaps it's the early alpha stage, but there is something about this game feels rather boring.\n\nGraphic:\nI love the art style. The presentation of the game is beautiful, and I can tell the developers gave a lot of loves and careful attentions to each pixel. The UI is simple to navigate and easy to the eyes. Job well done.\n\nStory:\nAs the gaming age is constantly evolving, story writers are exploring non-linear storytelling style and there are untouched areas to be discover. Some game does it well, and some does it poorly. How does this game fair? At this alpha stage, it's rather boring. Yes, there are random encounters and events. However, just random event does not always make a good non-linear storytelling. For example in this game: some pirates appeared in a local sector and requires your decision to dispatch a fleet to eradicate them. However, there is no time restriction, so you are to do so whenever you are please. As an audience, there is no sense of urgency. My decision does not matter because I will eventually go fight them; it could be 2 days or 30 days later. These current random events are either fight these enemies or don't fight these enemies. I honestly hope there are further improvements. Give us the options to make a real decision and not a false illusion. Another example: we first encountered some pirates and they straight up declare war against Halcyon 6. The developer completely miss the opportunity to give these pirates a cunning personality trait such as persuasion, trading crews with you which later backstab your base and stealing tech from you, trading for their own profit gain, giving you a false sense of protection against the Cruul race, selling you faulty weaponries that you later discover during a combat and etc. These would broaden the non-linear story. But instead, we are the bad guys, therefore, we must fight. We then met the Cruul race and they straight up declare war against mankind. I can understand we need mortal enemies. But the current events are rather straight forward and boring when my decisions are either fight or don't fight; go there or don't go there. It feels so restricted.\n\nGame play:\nBase building can be fun. There is nothing wrong if this is done well. However, the 3 vs. 3 combat, some people will find this nostalgic and charming. Perhaps some younger audiences who didn't grow up with JRPG will find this refreshing. Very unfortunately, this is nothing new, nor unique, thus I find it outdated for anyone who played a fair amount of JRPG. I honestly think the developers restricted themselves on the current combat system. You probably saw many reviewers with a thumbs up saying the combat is repetitive. They are not joking. Just because we have fleet officers with different traits and status effects from ships, it doesn't always make the game complex, nor engaging.\n\nSince the current story and gameplay both fail my expectancy. Reluctantly, I can't recommend it at this moment. However, it is only alpha, perhaps changes will be make and I may retract my statements.","April 26","false","1.4"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","4"

You can have more than 3 ships (or so I have heard), just not more than 3 in a fleet.\n\nThe enemies outnumber you from the start and it gets worse as the game goes on but yet you still got the same 3 ships flying around spending most of your time balancing between fighting enemies, locating resources, gathering resources and  protecting those resources and your base from enemies. It would be nice if you had more time to build up your resources, research, ships and starbase.\n\n\n\n***EDIT***\n\nEven though I gave this game a thumbs down (after 25 hours of play), I still kept playing.\nNow after 68 hours of game play I finshed Act 1.\n\nAlot of what I said is still true. I was still kind of outnumbered; even when I got my 4th officer. He mostly flew around collecting resources and exploring the starbase. My first 3 officers were mostly busy fighting Chruul. Eventually I was able to get my 5th and 6th officers but they were late in the game and could and spent most of their time exploring the base.\n\nI change my review from "don't recommend", to "neutral" but I'd advise against purchaing the early access.","April 30","false","68.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It's extermely repetitive, none seem to be mentioning that? there are still bugs, they seem to be working actively on them but it is early access and there are some still there.  The achievements and cards don't seem to be working, I've played 8.5 hours and have none of either and I've done well during that time so I should have something if either were working, not huge but it'll matter to some people so it's worth mentioning. That's it, my main gripe is you keep doing the same stuff the whole game.\n\nThe good things that others are mentioning are mostly true, it's cute, the attitudes are cute, humorous, etc. The options for characters skills matter very little other than a few, take heals, take skills that compliment your other officers skills and ta da that's really it for skills that I've seen.\n\nI give it a 6/10.

This game is a really cool blend of several ideas and mechanics that I find to be very enjoyable overall, but the combat had me so bored sometimes I almost quit on multiple occasions. Combat makes up most of what you'll be spending your time on, so it should be the most enjoyable part of the game, but in it's current state it's very repetitive and there's little strategy outside of buying ships and promoting officers that combo well together. Upgrading to a new tier of ships is a little lackluster as well, being more or less a stat upgrade + 1 or 2 more bland deal damage, inflict this, exploit this ability. On top of repeating the same combos with the same ships over and over again, some of the animations are very long and drag out the fairly long process of battle even longer. An option to skip animations or maybe a speed slider would already be a good start for the combat.\n\nI know this is early access and that is exactly why I bring all of this up, I hope this can be addressed and improved because it's the only thing holding this game back from being a favorite. This game has huge potential and I want it to succeed. The art is amazing and the blend of different mechanics in the star base and on the map are cool and interesting. The combat just needs some spice before I can excitedly force everyone I know to play it. I'd also wait on buying it if you're not ready for an unfinished product.","April 25","false","3.6"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

The heart is in the right place. On the plus side, they've pulled off the quirky-humorous character better than I can remember, and there are some great ideas here. It has a lot of cool elements like base building, tactical combat, etc.\n\nThe idea to mix a "lite" game with a beefier strategy title is a great one, but tricky to pull off, and this game suffers as much from the weaknesses of both approaches as it benefits from theirs strengths in this combination. It has too much going on to catch that relaxing/superstreamlined "lite" feeling of FTL or Battlestation Harbinger, etc., and it's too light to really be compelling as a strategy title. I liked the game and was on the fence about returning it as I got closer to the 2 hr refund limit, but I also was afraid I had seen much of what there was to see, and things started feeling pretty repetitive and gameplay varied but somewhat flat.\n\nOne example is combat: It's fairly tactical as attacks inflict states (hull breach, sensors down) which can then be exploited by other attacks. But from what I could see, most states didn't have any character beyond this rock-paper-scissors aspect, so it feels a bit too gamey after awhile. With the only real combat options being choosing attacks/buffs and targets, it gets a bit repetitive fairly quickly.\n\nAgain, it's a solid title, but it didn't work for me.\n","April 24","false","1.5"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

A lot of them.\nRandomisation of bases (instead of materials from asteroid fields always or dark matter from stars always etc) it would be nice if it was random and if it wasnt just go there see what there is. How about sending down a ground team to investigate? How about finding old bases with some materials or bases that are working or legendary crewmen or whatever else.\n\nI would say skip the game for now although by the time it comes out it may be something worth buying.

This game is more like some minimalistic, generic star trek setting version of final fantasy 1. That deep tactical combat they advertise here is just so bland, and for me it boils down to using the same rotation of abilities on every single enemy I come across, because that is my most efficient combo. Some of the enemies can be pretty spongey too, so you'll be running through the same abilities over and over and over and over. The hardest fight in this game is just staying awake.\n\nThe base building is pretty weak, and resembles x-com. The random events are basic, and typically distill down to you finding some random resources, or losing some random resources. The exploration consists of you flying your fleet of 2-3 ships to various points of interest on the map and usually finding ruins (aka nothing), or sometimes a colony that produces one of the game's resources like dark matter or fuel. I would consider all of these bare bones.\n\nNeeds a lot more work. Especially combat.

My only real complaint is the difficulty level, where currently you just get spammed by CHUUL ships early on and you can't really recover.\n\nshortly into the game your just flitting from base to colonies under attack and back to defend base from Aliens...it gets old having to flit from battle to battle, losing through attrition bc you don't even have time to repair your ships. And lets not even get into the chuul spire that spawns ships right next to your station before you have the tech to destroy it...as is this game nearly impossible.\n\nmaybe i could figure it out after hours and hours of trial and error..but i shouldnt' have to. A game is supposed to be fun...i don't recall purchasing dark souls...so until they either lighten up on the chuul blitzkrieg from when you first start or they give you the opportunity to change the difficulty level, at present i just cant' recommend the game.

The combat system is already fairly deep, and the simplicity of the mechanics* allows for significantly more, while the admittedly-derivative base-building system prevents it from overwhelming the player with its depth all at once.\n\n*Attacks will both apply and exploit status effects.  This method makes combos the primary driving force during combat.  However, you control three ships at once, which decreases the inevitability of learning rote combos and, when that does occur, makes them three times as complex, as the process of setting up and knocking down enemies is no longer a simple back-and-forth repetition.\n\nIt's not perfect, though: content is slightly lacking at this point, which is to be expected from an early access game such as this; the progression and, by extension, fleet-building systems are very light; and the game can be quite frustrating.  However, the lost depth is made up through the combat system, which is likely to be a highlight of Massive Damage's entire catalog of games in the future.  I'd recommend it to most anyone I know; at least at a sale price, though it's worth full cost.","April 22","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The team seems dedicated to their vision.","April 26","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Really?\n\nYes, you should buy this game..\n\nI am however a little disappointed. I feel like the dev's need to play a few more hours of FTL to get a better understanding of what really enjoyable game play looks like. For example, why does my Tactical vessel use abilities like "Backstab Maneuver.” Moves and abilities like this just don’t make sense in this type of game. They do a great job on the intro story line. (dev's you could have dropped a one line explanation about why I would ram my space ship into other space ships..) Seriously though when does that tactic ever work?? Explain to the player why. Sell me on the story and it would have been fine. Now every time I use the backstab ability it makes me upset :(\n\nThe game has a lot of really cool unique features. Think FTL takes XCOM (building system) on a date. They watch old reruns of star trek, and the red shirt guy never makes it.\n\nOver all it has a good foundation to really be one of the greats.","April 23","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
