The devs are clearly out of their mind if they plan to charge monthly for something that another software already does better charging only once. Not to mention that if you want to create anything you have a very limited storage, a limited number of saved setups, a limited number of creations and if you want to have more space you have to pay more.\n\nJust stay away from this, TTS is just better in every single way. Just hoping things don't go as planned and the Tabletopia devs change their minds about their business model, only then this might be a viable choice. For now this is just unthinkable.","March 29","false","0.5"," 154 of 230 people (67%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","67","154","230","6","25"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Weather_Wizard/recommended/402560/","Weather_Wizard","Late Wizard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Weather_Wizard/","3183 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhat I liked:\n- Game setups are ready-to-play based on the number of players in a room, you just have to know the rules.\n- Wonderful Steam integration, shows who plays what inside the game, and who can be invited.\n- Awesome interface, very 'social'-ish, makes finding a game and communicating quite pleasant experience.\n- Great game catalog, helpful filters and previews, bookmarks.\n- Room system, lobbies, ability to watch others play.\n- Cross-'platform' play with the browser players.\n- Overall polished, 'adult' look and feel, and optimization.\n- Little things like:\n-- Turn timers and notifications.\n-- The playing hand is always on the bottom side of the screen.\n-- Little icons of the actions on the hand cursors. Really helpful when you see what others are doing right now.\n-- The camera locks at 0-90-180-270 degrees while turning around, just feels really nice.\n-- Camera states (0-9 different positions to switch freely and an overlook).\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n\n- Horrible synchronization. I had to leave the table and return several times because I wasn't getting any messages and no updates on the screen (stuff others did), while all my messages and actions were actually transmitted to the others properly. I had no idea when I was desync'd, no errors, nothing.\n\n- Clunky camera controls. While not exactly bad, the degree of a camera's turn on Z-axis is really narrow, and the transition while zooming in and out is weirding me out.\n\n- The physics. It's kind of there, but I don't feel it while interacting with objects, and it's also weirding me out.\n- Dice rolls. These are just horribly animated and not actually randomized by a physical roll, which is one of the points emulating a table with physics.\n\n- Context menus of the objects are weird and very unintuitive. When you right-click an object, it presents you an action wheel, and the actions available are dictated by an object type, so some objects have, for example, 6 actions and others have 3, so the action wheel is divided by 6 and 3 parts accordingly. The weird thing is, if these two 6-action and 3-action objects share an action, which you want to use, the first one might have it somewhere top-left, while the second might have it at the bottom. The action icons are not helpful at all, because they look really bulky and therefore similar. Because of that, you can't just quickly click through what you want to do, and actually have to look over all of the icons, find the one you need and only then click it. I guess it's easier to show an example: http://i.imgur.com/MEJJrc3.png and http://i.imgur.com/KFy3EN1.png look at the 'Rotate' button. It's really unintuitive when the same element moves and forth between different objects. It's even more weird when the same objects have different actions, like http://i.imgur.com/zQDiHMW.png and http://i.imgur.com/efME3i8.png . I'd rather see the unused actions greyed out instead of having to search where to click.\n\n- Some textures like the game boards, for example, are really low-res, but that's the problem of the people who ported it, I guess, and not the Tabletopia developers.\n\n- Room system. Although I said I liked it, I have to say it needs some rework. Some people create rooms and are clueless that they have to shut them down after they play by clicking 'Abandon', because they leave them open and close the game, leaving a lot of 'ghost' rooms in a room browser. People join these rooms, hang around for a bit hoping to play, but the host is not even online, so they just leave. What I mean to say, they need to make the rooms temporary, for example, if the host is offline for half an hour, the rooms is shut down automatically, or make an option of temporary/permanent room which defaults to temporary, so they're left open only when a host is consciously making it permanent.\n\n- Game options. Where are they really? I'd really like to change some keybinds, camera smoothness, graphics (High-Medium-Low option in an in-session menu doesn't cut it). Not a lot of control over the game.\n\n- 'Back' button, but I guess it's just me being an idiot. After a session at the table, going back to lobby and pressing 'Back', hoping to return to main menu, sends me back to the table. This happened every single time I went from a table to a lobby.\n\nNeutral:\n- Couldn't figure out how to add anyone to the friends list.\n- When I was testing Scythe, I noticed that the small objects like the resources and the workers have textures stretched across their surfaces, despite being simply single colored, which created some color/texture artifacts near the edges (because of the texture compression): http://i.imgur.com/l63RwXo.png http://i.imgur.com/owgLBSu.png Seems to be an issue with Scythe, haven't noticed this in other games. I guess, only standard pieces are colored in-code, and the custom models have to be textured even if they're single colored.\n\nWhat I don't want to discuss:\n- Monetization system. I just don't care.\n- Legal vs illegal rant. My review is only about the game mechanics.\n- Comparison to Tabletop Simulator.\n\nIn conclusion:\nAlthough the 'meta' part of the game feels complete and looks really great, I can't really recommend it because the main part - the 'playing board games' part - is clunky, mainly camera controls, the physics, the context menus, mouse controls, the dice rolls, the lack of control over the game options. Sure, the assets, the objects, the game setup look nice and all, but the main process of using them feels broken to me right now.","March 29","false","1.6"," 72 of 99 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","72","99","0","4"

OR SUBSCRIBE FOR A MONTHLY FEE.\nYes, it's Tabletop Simulator clone. Yes, right now it's slighly behind it in terms of development and content. Now, let me explain you, why I think it's better and why I supported it even before steam version.\n\nWhat is the difference then?\n\nIt's...... THE MONEY!\n\nTabletop Simulator costs 20€ and it gives you access to their workshop with dozens and dozens of, well let's just say it - illegal content - popular commercial games, that were uploaded someone with a scanner and a free afternoon. Now don't get me wrong here, TBS has a lot of original content and also 8 official DLCs, but let's be completely honest here - it would lose a huge part of content, if every workshop game, that was uploaded without permission of its rightful author/publisher, got taken down.\n\nTabletopia has a different approach to this issue. It has subscription based business model, think of it like Spotify with board games - you can play for free with some restrictions or get some more options for a monthly fee (please note, that although prices stated below are directly from devs website, they may change in the future or after release). The 3 types of membership are:\n\nBronze - Free, access to free library of games. Ideal for casual board game player.\nSilver - 5€/month, premium library access. For passionate gamers.\nGold - 10€/month, premium library access and GAMING ROOM - play premiun titles with guests you invite. It's the GM package basicly. For less than 2 fastfood meals a month you can play any game from the premium library with anyone that has internet connection and a browser.\n\nAlso every game in their library is added with permission and support of the original author/publisher. This means, that on top of better quality assets and stuff, part of your money goes to the people tha actually made the game. This unfortunately means, that there are not that much games available right now, because not everyone can just upload things. But the library is slowly and surely growing and new titles are added each week or two.\n\nSo can you see the difference now?\n\ntl;dr\nThose 10€ are for early access. You will be able to play this for free. Or you can subscribe for a monthly fee. Think of it like Spotify with board games.\nTabletopia has better approach to rightful content owners (authors/publishers) and fair business model for players.\nGames night scenario - everybody has to own TBS to play vs. one guy having Gold membership inviting the party to his room.","March 29","true","2.2"," 85 of 148 people (57%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","57","85","148","5","24"

However, if you want to fund something with potential I would recommend that. This is the hardest choice I've come across in my video game lifetime. The ONLY 2 reasons this game can compete against Tabletop simulator is to\nA) fund the developers\nand\nB) have a easier time finding games with strangers. through a system of oranized games.\n\nHowever, this will burn a hole in your wallet, and it might burn a hole in it faster than you play board games and thats not cool. Board games take time and not being able to know how many board games I can play in a month really makes me feel sick buying a monthly purchase. Not only that, the speed of this game may not live up to it too. Regardless if the developers get 70% of the revenue (So I've heard). How do we know (OUR) favorite developers will tag along too? Some developers may still be completely against the digitilization of their products which makes me believe that this game will have severe limitation to games. I have made mods for games in Tabletop simulator and have even gotten permission to put the game on the workshop by lead designers of the game. Game designers love to at least get their game out there because they know that when people will like it a lot they will buy it.\n\nI own all the games I play on TTS and I use it as a tool to test, play around, modify, or rebalance games before and after I buy them with the click of a button. If someone doesn't buy a board game but plays it on TTS. Chance are they weren't ever going to buy it anyways. And if they did then the developers win. If they don't then its not a loss cause. This is always a problem in the digital age especially with things like Intellectual property. I believe this game will only be playable for people with Too much disposable income or people that just got really lucky  were all their favorite developers have latched on to this.","April 8","false","0.3"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","18","27","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brokenclock/recommended/402560/","brokenclock","Broken Clock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brokenclock/","266 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTabletopia is a fantastic product that is worth the subscription.\n\nUnlike TTS, Tabletopia is supported by the publishers and the designers. This means that most games are created by the publishers with the help of people at Tabletopia, which is fantastic because it means every game features the original art assets. Since TTS is community-created, every game features scanned art. This is why the components in Tabletopia look so crisp and infinitely better than TTS.\n\nThankfully, Tabletopia does not feature the wonky physics engine of TTS, so you don’t have to worry about a tiny error ruining the game. The interface is slick and easy to navigate. Shuffling and bag drawing is simple. Rolling, while not as fun without the physics, is still incredibly easy. Each game has pre-defined starting setups to make things simple. The interface is bright and beautiful. Every game looks like its original counterpart. All of this combines to make you feel as though you’re playing the real game at a table surrounded by friends.\n\nI’ve played many Tabletopia games with the designers of the game! This is just an amazing experience. Many people upload their prototypes to the system so you can experience the game WAY before it hits stores.\n\nThe problem most people will have is the payment structure. I understand there are a lot of poor students that play games and they can’t afford 10 dollars a month. If you can afford it, however, it really is the best option. TTS does not provide ANY money to publishers or designers. Tabletopia, on the other hand, contacts each publisher and makes sure it has permission to produce a game. They get original art assets and provide the publisher/designer with a cut of the monthly profits based on the popularity of the game. This is fantastic, since designers are not rich people. I’m a big fan of knowing that some of my money is actually going to the people who are making the games I love and enjoy.\n","March 29","true","2.1"," 31 of 57 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","31","57","4","0"

Everything is drawn better and the colors are much more vibrant.\n\nHowever, Tabletop simulator, has much more Gameplay mechanics.\n\nOne big thing I like that it seems you can do, is bounce between different games.\n\nI hear rumors of subscription models to play some games, while this will drive some away, especially if they have to pay a base price for the software first (UPDATE it seems that base price on steam includes 1 month of gold), If the mechanics are tweeked to be improved and the graphics stay as clean, it might be worth it.\nI looked it up and gold would be around $9.99, and I don't think at about $9.99 a month is worth it, but I might be willing to pay $4.99 a month for silver, thats only $60 a year, to play unlimited games online.\nIf they can work the price down to $4.99 this would be economicly a value worth the subscription.\nI love the fact the community lets you create games, and that if you want can monetize them.\n\nThe biggest thing plauging it so far is the lack of players, Its hard to find people to play with at this time, and that makes it hard to be a game to just keep playing, hopefully the gamer base booms when the subscrtiptions set in, as that will really add lots of replay value if the community is large.\n\nOverall the game is Fun, This will probably turn out great even, I just wish more bigger game companies were on board.\n\nPros:\n+ Lots of Games you've Never Played\n+ Some Classic Games like Checkers, Chess, Cards & Reversi\n+ Chances for Indy game makers to make money\n+ Beautifully Designed Menus & Interface\n\nCons:\n-Not Classic games like Mastermind, Sorry, Life, Scrabble, Monopoly etc or anything else mainstream basically\n- Monthly Cost to have full access\n- Not as much mechanics as Tabletop Simulator\n- Not a lot of people online playing yet\n\n\nThis review is a part of Steamified's Community Reviews program and the credit goes to Steamified for providing the key for review purposes.\nFor similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/.\nYou're also welcome to join in the fun in our Steamified group.\n\n\n","May 31","true","2.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The hosts for games already set up seem to be perpetually afk, and the games that I set up don't get anyone to join regardless of the title.\n\nFurther, the price tag listed for this software is, I suppose, money to pay for the opportunity to create your own game through their board game software and then, through the software, to sell it to people who'd be interested in playing the game online with others.  That part seems well done, but I'm not sure real life board game makers will ever make any real money through this portal or that real life board game fans will accpet paying $10 for an online version of a board game when they could buy the real one for $30 from Amazon and be able to enjoy it with friends/family for the rest of their lives.","May 18","false","10.3"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

Whatever happens then (subscription, or F2P model, etc), it's still up in the air.  You aren't committing to anything now and I don't think anyone knows what the final payment plan is.

But on the whole, Tabletopia looks really good to me and I do recommend checking it out!\n\nWhat I like is:\n- I can play very many board games with very many people. It's a cool concept. I can play with friends who don't have accounts (just send them the link) or I can meet new people from the other side of the globe.\n- The platform has a lot of cool games many of which are not yet in print. New games appear really often. I basically can play new games every day.\n- It will be free after release, and the Early Access is also reasonably priced, IMO: you get full access to all games until Fall (according to info here on Steam) and that for only $10. Later I will see if I want to purchase the account or just continue playing for free.\n- Everything looks super beautiful. Amazing graphics and 3D.\n- The interface is very friendly.\n- It runs on Mac and on PC and soon they will add tablets.\n\nWhat I don't like (and these are rather small things, on the whole, but they bother me):\n- That the game does not count your victory points for you. But I read that the developers will add this feature later on, so that will be fixed.\n- I don't really enjoy all the fiddling with the components, it's harder than analog games. I wish for the game to have two options: for hardcore gamers who want to handle all components themselves and AI-mode for people who don't. The hot keys help, though.\n- The game really eats up a lot of battery.\n\nSo on the whole, a thumb up from me here!","June 4","true","5.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/402560/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNote: This review has been edited to make mention of the retail release subscription model.\n\nFor two years now Tabletop Simulator has held the crown of being the king of Steam board games as it allowed you to play various games in a virtual environment. This was a boon for tabletop fanatics who for various reasons never possessed the opportunity to get one of their favorite games going. Whether it be because they've graduated from college or high school and have lost their social group or they're a professional who is constantly on the road or whatever reason. Now there is a challenger to the Berserk Games crown as Tabletopia Inc. launch their greatly anticipated Tabletopia. And let me tell you this much if sheer weight of numbers has anything to do with who will come up trumps it may just claim a famous victory.\n\nFrom day one of early access players can expect to have access to more than a hundred games from some of the most well known tabletop gaming publishers around the world as seen in the graphic in the Steam Description. When I logged onto the game there was already a list of 202 different board games in totality to play and the developer-publisher expects to add almost countless more to their library.\n\nSomething that I thought was a fantastic touch was how the games are categorized. You can sort games by age requirements with games ranging from as young as three years of age and up, the number of players required to play a game, the time requirements with some games being as short as five minutes ranging all of the way through to many hours and finally but by no means less important is that you can find games that are language independent (meaning that you're not limited to a certain language) or for games that are language dependent you can narrow the list down to English, French, German, Italian, Russian and Spanish. I hope that for our Asian and speakers of other languages that more languages are added soon.\n\nAnother good feature is 'Find & Play.' This feature allows you to see which games other people are waiting to play and how many more people are required before you can play the game. This should theoretically make games quickly accessible if you're not too set on playing a specific game especially for those of you who are solo players and haven't got friends with the program.\n\nBefore you play a new game the game must download the required files for that specific game. For example, Scythe required an extra 30MB download. I have to say that I am a fan of this system. Rather than downloading every single game - including those that you have no intention of ever playing - and increasing the initial download size tenfold you only have the base features of the game downloaded when you first start. This may be annoying to those of you who live on slow Internet speeds but if all of the games are in the roughly the same sized download then these extra downloads wont be given a second thought. The downloads for the games that I have played were relatively quick and simple affairs.\n\n(A late addition to the post): Arguably the most controversial issue regarding the retail release of the game to date is the game's subscription model. I personally do not take any issue with the game running a $10- per month subscription for the premium model. However, I can understand and accept that some people will take issue with this. The main software will be free to play with the retail release and this model will give you access to all of the games without the ability to play with the game's expansion sets. The premium model comes with the ability to play with all expansion sets. Buying into the Early Access version will award you with one month of gold premium subscription when the game is released to retail. Though I have yet to find where the developers state that only premium subscribers will be able to create games this is something that needs to be considered.\n\nThe one thing that needs to be determined is the quality of the player base that the software gets. Although there are games available that can be played by a single player the success of software such as this is more often than not determined by those who play it - the number, their friendliness, the personality of the game. I hope that this software brings out a wide audience towards it full of newbies and helpful experienced players, those who are incredibly skillful and those who are mature enough to play a game responsibly and enjoy it for what it is without tarnishing the experience of other players. For many this will be their first time learning and playing tabletop games so I hope that people understand and appreciate that not only will players be learning individual games but also that they'll be learning the software simultaneously. I urge people not to scare the newbies away.\n\nTabletopia has an opportunity to take over a significant market share of the online tabletop gaming experience. Their development and press staff are  truly dedicated in making their software the very best that it can be and with the type of professional clientele behind them have given themselves every chance to succeed.\n\nFor our epic giveaways and similar reviews head to http://www.steamified.com/\n\nTo join in our fantastic community join our Steam group","March 29","true","1.1"," 50 of 97 people (52%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","52","50","97","4","14"

So now I mostly play with my friends (I send them the link and they can play in browser).\nNo automated matchmaking and ratings. But AFAIK the developers will add them later.\nMostly only English games, which is not my native language. I would like to have games more multilanguage games.\n\nOverall, I like it a lot and recomment to try. And hope that the developers will continue improving this product and making it more enjoyable.","June 6","true","9.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

First of all, the game is going to be paid until it gets out of the early access state, then it will become F2P. As of now, the game is stable, has some pretty interesting features as well as some bugs such as low resolution textures, weird dice rolls and it's also lacking game options. The experience it offers is pretty good and it ensures replayability, it works really good with steam's community features, the board game are well reproduced and it certainly doesn't feel like a cheap game. One thing that makes it stand out of the crowd though is that you can play it with people that don't own the game by providing them with a link that would allow them to join your current game via their browser. I have found several design issues such as representing languages with flags when flags are used to represent a country or a nation, but languages are often spoken across national borders, this thing can clearly confuse or offend players.\n\nPros:\n+ Dedicated dev team and designers\n+ Works really good with steam's community issues\n+ Ability to play whatever you want with people who don't own the game\n+ It offers overall a pretty good experience\n+ Lots of board games to choose from\n\nCons:\n- Several graphical bugs\n- Lacks game options\n- Some issues with the design\n\nVerdict:\n7/10\n","April 30","true","5.2"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

Developement definitely ongoing & in line with what the community asks for. Want to strengthen my recommendation here.\n\n\nStatus as of 03/2016.\n\nGeneral remarks about tabletopia:\nIt does not have rule implementation. And that is a feature. You play the way you`d play with friends around the table. And it is supposed to be that way! Makes it a more open platform with beautiful art rather than a catalogue of programmed rules.\nBy the time of the review, tabletopia does not have its own social functions yet, like player ranking and reputation. So far, it is best for playing with your gang of friends that have moved to all corners of the world.\n\nReview:\nWorks just fine for what it wants to do. The more popular games are well implemented. Designers can feed their own games into tabletopia. Not all of them are perferct. Also, if you look for the perfect physics simulation of game component behaviour, well, play a physical game.\nBut if you have a big screen and want a jolly old time with your friends, the tabletopia app has what you need. I expect it only to improve when the game catalogue growths and an own steam community develops.","March 30","true","17.2"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","0"

I know the model is slated to be subscription based but not sure exactly how that will work yet and in the interim, I will surely get my moneys worth on what it has to offer already.\n\nI am a solo player mainly and this system lets you play everyones "turn" if you wish and it saves where you left off in the gaming room for when you come back (needed for some of the bigger games). I could set up a private game room so I wasn't disturbed and whilst I guess this is maybe not the primary selling point here, something that appeals to me.\n\nI bought and am using this on my laptop whilst away from my home base using a "dongle". I only dropped connection once and it went back in quikcly where I left off.

Tabletopia does indeed look cleaner and prettier with detailed in-game models and a minimalist interface as compared to TTS' rough and chunky user experience.\n\nAnother plus is the massive collection of games ready-to-play from the get go and an easy way of inviting your friends to a game. With more games heading our way through Tabletopia, anybody who can't be bothered organizing game nights with lazy friends can potentially prune out their many excuses for NOT coming over for cards and dice.\n\nChat is minimised at the corner so it doesn't distract from the actual focus of the game.\n\nThe Bad\n[EDIT: Interface plays smoothly now. Only the scrolling up and down pages is jarring]\n\nThe game runs pretty smoothly now. One downside is there only the scrolling up and down pages is jarring. Would be nice for the scrolling to be fixed!\n\nAt the point of typing out this review, when playing in the room there are only 3 options to choose from in the graphics settings menu: High, Medium and Low. Would be glad to have more options available, including key bindings in the future.\n\nConclusion\n[EDIT: Interface plays smoothly now. I now do recommend trying a hand at Tabletopia!]\n\nAs it is currently, the pros of the game outweighs its cons. The game is beautiful to look at and the models featured in the bigger games are exquisite (Do check out Scythe's miniatures!). Early Access will receive a month of Gold subscription once the game launches, so it might be worth opening pursestrings for a month of premium games access.\n\nI will update my review of the game as it approaches its actual release date. This game looks swell, has a lot of potential and so much backing from the industry, so I am quite optimistic about the actual release of the game.","March 29","true","2.5"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","10","22","0","2"

Something you can install and open easily. There is also a web version and future mobile versions.\n\nThere are bugs. That is pretty much expected as this is the initial version that is in early access.\n\nThere are also a few improvements with room to grow. The steam client added room listings, voice chat, friend status and there are more service features planned.\n\nThe $10 should only be for early access during this closed beta phase. Open beta and on, I'm reasonably sure that the client will be free.\n\nTabletopia as a Service\nTabletopia is a subscription based model which sets them apart for better or for worse. There will be free access to games but will require subscribing for expanded access such as expansions or extended setups.\n\nYou do however get access to the entire library of games that are available so you can try any out and explore all the different games out there.\n\nWhile you do not have every game you want to play, the catalog is legit and offically approved by the game makes or uploaded themselves. The money also goes back to the devs on a pretty good split (70%).\n\nCross platorm between standalone clients, web based access, and future mobile clients is nice so you can open it however is easist to you.\n\nMy deal maker feature is that Tabletopia allows you to invite your friends to play with you even if they themselves don't use Tabletopia. No need to convince them to sign up for anything. No need to ask them to buy it themselves. You want to play as a group, give them your room (url) and all they need is to put in a name.\n\nOverall\nI like it for what it is now and what it could expand to in the future.

Paying a monthly fee is a complete no-go for me. I basicly compare playing online through tabletopia with playing around a table with my friends.\n\nI own a lot of games and have spend some thousand € on them so I know boardgames come at a price, but if I buy a normal boardgame I have all the material to pay for and I own it indefinitely. I can pass them on to my children later (and I have some boardgames that once belonged to my father). I can play them with any of my friends without having to pay extra.\n\nWith tabletopia you cant play the boardgames with any of your friends without paying extra, since everyone has at least to buy tabletopia. Now paying 10€ each isn't that much, if all the people I play boardgames more or less regular with would do that then we would be at around 150€. For that price you would get 4-5 boardgames in the real world, so thats a good price because tabletopia lets you play much more than 5 different boardgames. But if you have to pay another 5 to 10 € per month per person that would be between 750 and 1500€ per year. In 5 years you would have spend a amazing budget on this, only to find out that maybe Tabletopia is discontinued and they stop the support. You end up having nothing to pass on to your children or even re-sell.\n\nIn my opinion there are only two fair ways they can get people to spend money. Either they let you purchase the right to play the games indefinitely (and separately for each game) in wich case they still have to keep in mind that every playing person has to pay, so they cant expect more than 1€ per player per game, or they make you pay per game that you want to play, in which case they cant expect more than maybe 0,10€ per game per person.\n\nSo after keeping all of this in mind I can't recommend Tabletopia until they find a fair way to price it.","March 30","false","0.1"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","9","21","0","2"

The 'big hitters' that I saw are;\n\nTerra Mystica\nScythe\nSteampunk Ralley\nViticulture\nVinos\nLewis & Clark\nHostage Negotiator\n\nThen from what I can recall, it gets a bit sketchy! They are really going to have to up this considerably if I'm going to consider subscribing at any level.\n\n2) It runs ok on my fairly modest gaming rig. The start up is a bit slow, but actually in game is smooth\n\n3) Wasnt that many people around, but thats not really a surprise right now. Its a fairly niche title plus early access definitely puts people off.\n\n4) Besides Hostage Negotiator and a little play with Terra Mystica solo, I've not actually played anyone online yet. I dont even know if the turns are async or has to be live. No information easily shows this.\n\n5) The games look ok. Terra Mystica in particular looked very impressive all laid out.\n\n6) The UI will take some getting used to, but has useful functions (like hover over a stack of tokens, roll your mouse wheel to tick up a counter, then click button to take that many of the stack), can also shuffle a deck easily, flip cards etc.\n\nSo overall... hmmm... not convinced right now. Lack of killer titles in the library will make or break it IMHO as the rest of it is kinda there.

In a nutshell, I can discover so much more games with Tabletopia, and that's what I like best. And they're all licensed, so I'm not pirating or stealing in any way!\n\nAlso, I love that I don't have to wait for a game night to play with my friends. We live rather far away and can only arrange game nights once every two weeks. But with Tabletopia, I can create a room, send a link to my friend and jump right into action! No need to arrange anything, drive anywhere, and so on. I can have a game night literally anytime I feel like it.\n\nAlso I like it that I can save the table in case I need to dash and just come back to it later and start from the same place.\n\nWhat else is great, is that the experience is much more lifelike than one might have thought. With 3D and excellent graphics, you almost feel like playing a real game. Much more so than on BGA, for example.\n\nSure, the controls need time getting used to. And that's my main complaint. At first it is rather hard and takes a lot of time. My advice will be to learn the hot keys, it gets considerably easier with them. Sure, it's still no replacement for moving the pieces with your own hands, but, let's be frank, with games like Scythe or Anachrony, I might never get the chance to put my hands on those games, in the first place.\n\nAll in all, I do recommend to give Tabletopia a try!","June 6","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
