We're going to pretend David. knows better and it's actually called David.  Argh!  That period there was to end the sentence not describe the title.   Moving on.  Let's discuss David.\n\nHere's a bit of advice: if you're going to write a review that hinges on you spending two and a half hours to climb to the top of a leaderboard, best make sure the game will update your score and said leaderboard when you quit out manually rather than waiting for a game over.  Now, this statement should tell you three things.  One: this game is engrossing enough to keep playing for two and a half hours.  Two: while David is good fun, it is lacking some technical touches that can be frustrating.  And three: yes, I am petty enough to gloat about temporarily being the best David!  My name's not even David!\n\nSo, David is an interesting little shooter/platformer that invokes the vector graphics of ancient arcade games like Asteroids.  I'm not going to try and sell you on that.  I think you either know if that's a deal breaker, a nostalgia trip, or just a valid aesthetic choice you can live with.  What makes David interesting is its primary mechanic.  The game is frantically paced and the platforming is very loose and floaty.  However, you have the ability to charge up a shot of rainbow colored orbs and while charging the game will slow down, allowing you to get your bearings, aim, and dodge.  You'll often have to choose between spamming the charge to keep time slow or returning to heart attack pace to allow your orbs to return to you for another shot.  It works nicely and after a few tries, you'll no doubt find it simple and elegant.\n\nThe bulk of the game is the "story" mode.  The story being: you are a square (of course you are, you are playing a vector based shooter in the 21st century).  Evil rhomboids are invading, but you've got the rainbow balls to stop them!  This plays out over a handful of levels that are basically boss fights with a dash of puzzle.  Each of these can be quite tricky, though I dove in on hard where getting hit instantly ends your existence as a regular quadrilateral.  I'd actually recommend picking the hard mode right off the bat since it gives this short game a bit more weight and satisfaction.  That said, it's nice the option is there for a more casual experience.  One way or another, the reload time is fairly quick, so if you do die, you won't spend too much time waiting to get back into the action.\n\nDavid also includes an arena mode where you can find an endless number of baddies.  I definitely recommend giving it a try since it adds some fun new mechanics, including a power-up and the ability to upgrade David with more projectiles and some new abilities.  The difficulty curve is a bit peculiar, however, since you upgrade David by spending points from your high score and, though the enemies are endless and do increase in volume for a time, the challenge does reach a plateau.  This creates a situation where getting a high score is more a matter of patience and attrition than skill as the more you win, the better a David you can build, so the more you win.  I guess that takes some of the glow out of being the best David, since even a schmuck like me can claw his way to the top.\n\nIn fact, in this mode, it could be argued the real enemies are your bodily functions (you cannot pause to pee) and boredom once you settle into a routine.  And perhaps your computer's memory.  Despite the extreme minimalist graphics, I had slowdown to almost unplayability once I'd been playing arena for long enough.  I suspect dead enemies weren't being properly recycled.  Of course, all of these issues will only be found by mad men, not anyone just casually playing the game.\n\nUpdate\n\nThis was the part of the review where I complained about things - lots of things because I'm difficult like that.  But I'm difficult for you, the reader who is maybe about to spend money on this pile of numbers in the shape of a game I'm writing about.\n\nThing is, there's a lot less to complain about now.  David's dev has been a real class act, lowering the price to a much more reasonable deal for the content, adding more content for free, and sanding down some of the rough edges.  You can rebind keys and alt + tab works right!  Joy!\n\nThat kind of attention alone makes me want to say emphatically: get this game!  It's earned it.\n\nYes, it's still missing volume sliders, resolution options, and a pause button.  Ah to have a pause button.\n\nSure the levels are short, but my bits still start to itch when I'm about to win, no?\n\nThat and I'm now only the third best David in the world.  Still, I can hardly blame David with a period for that.  That blame is squarely on the other two dudes who had lots of time to misspend.  And by blame I mean congratulations!  Probably.  I don't know, I'm still petty enough to mention this sort of thing in my review.  I'll get back to you.\n\nAnyway, David: I had fun and if it looks like your kind of thing, I'd say it's now a pretty good deal for what's offered.","February 20, 2015","true","11.7"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","89","33","37","12","0"

Pick it up if you've got some money hangin around in your Steam Wallet.\n\nI've never felt more mixed about a game than i have with David. The game has charming graphics, an enjoyable soundtrack, and is a decently challenging game. The issue i have with it is where the challenege comes from which is the controls.\n\nThe controls in this game hold you back so much with the jump being unecessary. With A being jump it adds an uneeded level of difficulty than if it was just a fly up button, constantly I died because either didnt hold A long enough, or I didnt tap it enough.\n\nThe other issue is with the shooting and the slowing of time. You need to click yourself in order to shoot. Which doesnt really sound that bad until you're in a high speed situation (which is often) and you constantly need click back on yourself to slow down time and dodge projectiles as well as shoot your enemies. This causes the game to become unecessarily frustrating when instead you could just click to ready the shot/slow down time.\n\nAside from the issues with the controls the game is quite enjoyable, and fun for $1. But probably not for $5. (I got about 1.5 hours until i finished the levels on the hard difficulty and 40ish kills in the arena)","February 18, 2015","false","1.9"," 48 of 62 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","48","62","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sparklepeep/recommended/346180/","sparklepeep","sparklepeep","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sparklepeep/","421 products in account","I bought this game because it was $1 and it had trading cards. I expected some crappy Thomas Was Alone clone, but what I got was a very well executed platformer / arena shooter hybrid. This may well be the best $1 game I've ever bought (not counting Humble Bundles).\n\nThe basic idea of the game is that you are a square who can move around rather quickly, has infinite jumps, and can shoot orbs of light at pointy geometric enemies who want to murder you. Oh and you can slow down time. Each level is a puzzle, obstacle course, and/or boss battle. For example, there's a level where you have to navigate a maze while a square shoots flashing squares at you and you have to defend yourself while navigate within range of the boss square to take it down.\n\nWhile the platforming parts were kind of meh, the combat is where the game shines. To attack, you click near David (the protagonist square) to charge him up, and then release it to shoot the light orbs around you like a rainbow shotgun blast. The trick is that when you are charging time is slowed down. This means that attacking and defending are tied to the same mechanic and it works amazingly well. Furthermore, the light orbs are actually floating around you and are attracted to you via a gravitational field, and only those near you will be shot when you release your charge. This means that if you move or change directions too fast, your orbs won't catch up and your attack power is diminished. But you can also use this to your advantage: let some of your orbs catch up, fire a shot in one direction, and then immediately fire the rest in another once they catch up.\n\nThe bosses are either in the "charge mindlessly at you" or the "stand still and rain bullets on you" variety. However, the terrain and rules of each stage makes each fight very different. For example, there is a level where the bottom half is covered in a liquid that your orbs cannot go into and there are three solid islands that you can stand on or push aside. There are only 10 stages, and a final boss fight that I haven't unlocked yet. There is some replayability in those stages in that there are two difficulties to them and there's an infinite arena mode. The hard modes (or VERY, using the game's language) are hard, with you only having 1 hit point and the enemies moving faster. However, I found that all my deaths have been fair. I never felt like the game used a cheap trick to kill me, and that is a good thing.\n\nLike other indie minimalist games, this one has a plot. However, it's not important and not very well written. So don't expect clever or deep stories. But do expect awesome fast paced boss fights. Overall, I'm very happy with this game and am very glad that it popped up for me on the front page of Steam.","February 16, 2015","true","1.1"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","22","26","0","0"

You’re placed into varying challenges as the tiny block, David, and must use your slingshot to dismantle the geometric behemoths whose attack patterns are vaguely tied to level names derived from concepts of sin and fear.\n\nUnfortunately David. rather lost me the more discombobulated its design becomes in its attempts at variety and tying itself to a plot that doesn’t exist. I applaud developer Fermenter for creating a game based on things they clearly deeply believe, but they only lay the groundwork for a deeper meaning and then leave it languishing somewhere between an implied connection and so clearly laid out it loses its point. The lack of any subtlety or consistency in tone made it difficult for me to become invested in the game, or even just take it seriously most of the time.\n\nThere’s a similarly muddy situation among David.’s different levels, which can be brilliant but more often hinge on a frustrating gimmick which disrupts the natural flow of the game’s best moments. More issues arrive through David.’s bizarre controls, which have an unwieldy momentum to them that runs counter to the often brutally tight level designs. On the normal difficulty it’s a nuisance, but David. goes a step further and requires you beat every stage with a single sliver of health in order to unlock the final boss, a task I doubt I need to tell you the tediousness of.\n\nThere are genuinely novel ideas within David. like it’s interesting use of a slingshot or the asymmetrical boss fights (ala Shadow of the Colossus), but it can’t seem to see them well enough not to go running in the wrong direction. Completing it left me with an empty feeling I couldn’t quite explain, my only guess being sadness that David.’s worst enemy ended up being itself.\n\nFull disclosure: David. was reviewed using a copy provided by the developer.

If you want to skip the lengthy part of my review and go straight to the pros and cons, you can find them below.\n\nThere isn't much of a story here. You're playing as the cute cube David who is destined to obliterate evil and destroy sin. To be able to do that a mysterious entity (which also narrates the game (intro and outro)) grants David a special power with which he may defeat the evils of the world.\n\nThe game is comprised of several levels you have to beat before going to the final boss, Sin. Every stage features a different kind of enemy/enemies or presents a different kind of challenge through enemy behaviour, environment or David himself.\nThere's always two difficulties for each level - "okay" and "very".\nOkay-difficulty has you pitted against the misshapen geometry monsters with six hitpoints, so you may get hit five times before dying which makes the game a whole lot easier.\nVery-difficulty however strips these hitpoints from you, effectively making you a onehit-target. This makes the game far more challenging. Especially the end boss battle against Sin takes some time before you can defeat it with only one hitpoint.\n\nGameplay wise the game's pretty simplistic but good. You can move up, down, left and right, you can click to charge your power and aim somewhere to slingshot it in that direction. Your power will then come back to you so you may do it again. Charging your power slows time which is essential for beating the whole game on "very". It's a nice game mechanic that I like.\nThe controls are responsive, the game runs well, no bugs, no crashes.\n\nThe music of the game is quite relaxing, even though the game itself can get pretty stressful. Although you might not hear a lot of the music because you're probably busy slowing time so you can plan your next move. That's what happened to me at least.\n\nAnd there's not much to say about the game other than the above. Oh yes. It has hats in it. As a little reward for doing things. And a little secret.\n\nSo, go to the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n\n+ responsive controls, no crashes or performance issues\n+ challenging gameplay\n+ a lot of different challenges\n+ relaxing music\n+ the game's just cute and simplistic\n+ Steam achievements (once you start trying to get them you wanna have 'em all)\n+ hats!\n\nCons:\n\n- it's a very short game (after 2.5 hours or so I unlocked every achievement)\n- if you're bad at skill-based games like this you will indulge in pure rage sometimes\n- nothing more, it's just short\n\nWould I recommend this game? Yes.\nIt's a good 2-3 hours of fun. The price tag is a bit heavy though. Five bucks is a bit much to ask for a game that only lasts for a couple hours. So get it while the special promotion offer lasts or wait for a sale before you buy it unless you're extremely into this kind of game and wanna have it NOW.","February 21, 2015","true","2.7"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","1"

It contextualizes its simple move set with a creative array of well-designed situations that each require a different strategy; as a result, it's consistently fresh in addition to challenging.  The ability that drives the game is a kind of particle slingshot that requires you to click near David, hold the mouse button (which slows time), aim, and release the attack when charged.  Everything comes from this one mechanic, combined with fast, sliding, infinitely jumping movement through WASD.\n\nHow long David lasts you depends upon how good you are, but there is also a separate endless arena mode that pits you against many enemies in a departure from the unique boss setups.  There's even an upgrade system.  It was quite a relief when I earned the achievement in this mode since it can be as infuriating as it is addicting; I was happy to be able to step away with that job completed, although I definitely intend to come back again sometime.\n\nIt's hard to imagine what else could possibly be done with the basic idea at the heart of David, and it's always satisfying to see a mechanic so thoroughly explored.  The game is easily worth its asking price of $5, and I recommend it without reservation.

Within each door lies in wait a boss that utilizes a certain aspect or value of vice, sin, or fear in which the creature's body or its domain are designed around the particular aspect or value. David was to bring each monster to justice, ending their reign of terror. With the avoidance of using the words "retro" and/or "minimalistic", since they have almost become default word choices towards games along the same line as David. treads, I'd like to say that  David. is a fascinating, original concept and deserves to be set aside as such.\n\nThe game has a fairly basic set up, take character, use character, defeat enemy. There are no level ups or power ups or special items, except for use in the Arena Mode. It's one-hundred percent arcade-like beat, or in this case, shoot 'em up. Do not, however, confuse it with a Bullet Hell entry, for that would be intensely far from the truth. David. uses a mechanic, where the player must click on David and then fire in the direction of where his enemies stand, demolishing them in the process. Many enemies can use similar traits or use different styles of movement to confuse and trick the player, making each battle challenging, yet exciting.\n\nThere are some downsides to David. The targeting at times will feel tricky or altogether annoying, especially when dealing with larger, faster, or more numerous foes; and will be even more mind-numbing when the "Very" difficulty setting is engaged. Some bosses are unpredictable, or worse, annoyingly predictable making some fights a game of luck rather than strategy or skill. At times it will feel like you are fighting with David  more than you are fighting the monsters hunting him down. Even with some rough mechanics taken into into consideration, David. is still a fascinating concept with truly amazing designs and textures, a pretty awesome electronic soundtrack, and a decent amount of challenging stages all wrapped up in an excellent little indie title for your Steam library.","March 8, 2015","true","8.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

David contains several little ovals, which he can fling at enemies. He has been tasked with fighting and destroying evil, which he does by destroying 12 (very large) bosses. Presumably David's story is based on the biblical David, as you are a tiny hero taking on humongous foes, and the developer is quite clearly Christian (in addition to fighting sin, Jesus is the first thanked in his acknowledgements).\n\nThe boss fights are fast-paced and frantic. They're also very challenging and often frustrating when playing on the high difficulty (which you have to do, in order to get to the final boss). After playing the first boss, you'd be forgiven for thinking that the game will become repetitive quickly, and while this is true to a certain extent, the bosses in David are actually fairly original and varied. There are an impressive array of novelties that make each boss fight unique and feel fresh. For example, in one of the bonus boss fights, your ellipsoidal ammunition no longer follows you, meaning you have to go to it, and fire it from where it lies. Little variations like this really keep the game fun.\n\nThe downside is that this game is extremely short. Even with the arena mode, I would not expect more than a few hours. Five dollars is not an unreasonable asking price for something so different from the usual fare, but if you're uncertain, you can pick it up on sale.

Not much of a problem when playing on the lower difficulty, but when you have only 1 health point on "Very" that becomes pretty aggravating.\n\nI found the rapid shifts from slow-mo during targetting to high speed normal movement to be disorienting, esp. when trying to jump accurately or avoid being hit. Coupled with an enemy offscreen moving at an unknown speed I was unsure how fast I had to move to avoid dieing. Same issue arises with avoiding enemy parts.\n\nGranted, the game was intended to be difficult, but the difficulty (for me) stems from being punished for successfully attacking my enemies but not properly predicting how they scatter, or getting stuck on a slope and wondering if I can't move faster because I'm going uphill, or if I'm just stuck in slow-mo and my velocity sense is all wonked.\n\nThe minimalistic style IS nice, a few tweaks to the controls could make it both hard and fun.\nClicking and holding to move the target circle to the mouse would be an good change, and would also allow the viewing distance to be extended (which is honestly the biggest improvement I can think of, I can hardly see what I'm fighting most times)\n\nI didn't play very long, but there's a reason for that. I'll probably pick it up again for 2 hours and beat it on Easy, and then put it in my Hidden games section.\n\nEDIT: After playing a bit more, I found the sound to be helpful in telling how fast time was currently going, but the shift is still far too "SUPER FAST >>> Sllllllllloooooooooowwwwwwww-mmmmoooo"\nI guess... buy it on sale?

I am not one of them.  I enjoy simple gaphics games like Thomas was Alone, or games like Super Meat Boy where the mechanics are very simplistic but the gameplay is centered around doing them as perfectly as possible.  I would say that this game is almost some weird ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of the two that should be disowned by both parents.  Except THAT concept sounds incredible, whereas this is...not.\n\nTo start, let me explain the controls.  WASD movement - W is jump, and S seems to make you fall faster.  You have inifinite double jump, which takes a bit to get used to.  You have control of your left and right motion while in the air as well, and the jump height is dependnent on how long you hold down W.  The control scheme feels more suited to a top down game than something that plays more like a platformer.\n\nTo attack, you must click on your character, and then drag the mouse in the direction you wish to fling your...self?  I'm not sure what the projectile is, but it is part of you.  While you're doing this, time for everything in the world slows down.  This means that your feedback on jumping and other movement changes while you are charging an attack.  Usually. Enemy shots appear to not be affected, though, which makes dodging those annoying.  And you will autoshoot if you charge too long.\n\nThere is an option for using a controller, but it's horrible.  The right stick moves the mouse pointer around, and one of the triggers acts like a click and hold.  It is unplayable, which is sad, because a controller scheme using a flick movement on the right stick to attack (maybe even hold Right trigger, flick the stick after it is charged) would be a gigantic improvement over what you're stuck with.\n\nThere appears to be no camera control whatsover, and your character does not stay centered in the screen.   The camera likes to zoom in so far that more often than not, you cannot see your enemy.  This means that not only are you dragging the mouse around, you are sometimes moving in slow-mo and to "reload" you have to get the mouse pointer back to your sprite.  And as you can't see your foe, you end up flailing around randomly and hoping you hit it.\n\nThis is fine if you aren't playing on "Very" difficulty, which should really be named "Hard" like every other game out there would have done.  You see, you jump from being able to take many hits on the normal (easy?) game mode to not being able to take a single hit on the harder mode.  If the camera wasn't zoomed in so far, you could at least work on your defensive skills, but by the time you see your target it is too late anyway.\n\nSo why am I complaining about the harder mode?  Well, because regular mode is boringly easy.  Once I figured out the awkward control scheme, the regular difficulty has very little challenge.  This isn't Super Meat Boy, either, where the challenge is to figure out the perfect run- I attempted the one of the stages on hard repeatedly, and minor differences in my movement created a very different response from the enemy, some of which left me in an undodgable position.\n\nThere is a difficulty progression from level to level, but it seems to be based around adding in more obstacles that you can't see until it is too late than truly making the game harder.","November 4, 2015","false","0.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

David can slide from side to side and can jump repeatedly in mid-air, giving him a levitation ability but with a constant gravity pull. To attack an enemy, you click and hold on David to enter a slow-motion state where David charges his attack. His attack shoots a sphere in the direction you are pointing; this sphere being composed of smaller spheres that orbit David. How big your shot is depends on how many of the small spheres are within a certain boundary around David at the time you release the shot.  After firing, you need to wait for the spheres to come back to orbit around David before shooting again.\n\nThe game has two modes. The main mode has you entering constrained arenas to fight bosses, and each boss has a certain gimmick that makes it unique. You will need to beat each boss twice, once with 7 hit points (easily managed) and 1 hit point (where the real fun is!). All the bosses are accessible at any time, except the final boss which requires that you successfully beat each minor boss at both difficulties.\n\nThere is also an arena mode where enemies keep coming at you while you accumulate points. The points allow you to upgrade David to last longer in the next run.\n\nThe game is definitely worth a purchase.

The game's controls overall are great, except for the slightly wonky jump mechanic that is a bit tough to get the hang of. The game features a little square, David, who fights giant evil geometric bosses. That's pretty much all you do. For the price and gameplay you get, the game is good and has replayability as there are two difficulty modes to choose for each level and unlockables to collect. The game is rewarding once you learn the controls and get better at it, and it is an overall fun game. The biggest downsides would probably be the odd jump mechanic and the shortness of the game, while the biggest asset is the game's character (as in the feel of the game). To be fair, the jump mechanic isn't that bad but takes practice to learn how to use it properly. I definitely recommend this game, especially at the $1.99 price tag.

I hate to be really harsh to something that someone put quite a lot of effort into but I'll do it anyway. This game's biggest issue is the controls need a lot of polishing. It is impossible to make fine adjustments while flying around trying to avoid the bosses because you accelerate slowly. You'll find it difficult to steer your way out of danger even when you can see it coming a mile away. And if getting out of danger involves going up then you're really out of luck. Up is a very difficult direction to go in this game because it doesn't work like the other 3 directions do. Right, left, and down, you can just hold the button and you'll accelerate in that direction. If you press up, it jumps. You are granted infinite jumps, but it goes upwards much slower than any other direction and when you use your weapon to slow down time, it is very hard to figure out how long to hold the button for to get max jump height. It would have just been easier to make up work like the other 3 directions.\nAbout that weapon, its a weird slingshot-like thing. Basically you have a dozen or so little circles bunched together. Then you click and point where you want them to shoot, and then it shoots there. Even though you have so many projectiles though, they dont really hit much. It's hard to shoot down enemy projectiles with this weapon because you'll only hit 1 or 2 things per shot despite having so many particles. Also whenever you use your weapon, which is often, it slows down time. That's ok, but when time is slowed it becomes very difficult to tell how fast you're going. If you hold a movement key while slowed you will rocket in that direction when it speeds back up. Once again, this makes it difficult to navigate away from danger.\nAnother thing that hinders your survival is the camera. I always feel like the camera needs to zoom out more. I mean the main character is not much to look at and I want to see impending danger, especially when it can come at 50 mph. If you won't let us move away from danger well we could at least see it sooner.\nThe controls overall feel very sloppy and in need of improvement. I don't like this because the game offers you 2 difficulties named "normal" and "very". I perfer to call them "way too easy" and "way too hard". On normal you get a life bar with 6 hits (I think, I don't remember the exact number but it's around there). On very you get 1 hit. The problem here is that if you play on normal you will probably beat every boss in 1 or 2 tries. On very it could take a couple dozen tries. Now, I have no problems with a hard game, but it needs to be hard for the right reasons and david does not fit that category. Because of that the game just isn't very fun to play for me.\n\nEven if everything I mentioned above were to be fixed, I honestly still think I would downvote this game. I'm not really sure where the "fun" is in this game. You float around avoiding enemy projectiles while shooting the enemy yourself. There's nothing unique about this game that makes it stand out. It seems like the developer wanted to try to do some things differently and it just didn't come out well. Personally I think this game is a waste of time, but maybe you'll enjoy it more than I did.

If you can get past the period in the title that serves no purpose other than to bother the OCD, this game plays as a sort of Contra with flying powers. Oh, and it's all boss fights. There is one secret to be found (have fun with that, it's rather well hidden) and all of the unlockables are hats and upgrades for the arena. Somehow this game managed to justify shooting rainbow orbs at moving shapes and made it important. Props for that one.\n\nThe gameplay is a little finnicky, but after the first two or three levels I kind of got used to it. The jumping is a little awkward at first, and the slow-time effect every time you fire is a little disorienting. But this would just be another bullet storm game without those two elements (and the polygons) so I'll leave them be.\n\nStory: Sort of, but only as a crazy slow intro that you have to play twice to get the achievement and as part of the credits.\n\nI think if someone were to mix Contra with Shadow of the Colossus, this would be the result. So if you enjoyed those two games, or even liked the concept of them, give this game a shot. The price is dropping down to $1.99 March 16 (Would've been sooner, blame Steam) and I had quite a bit of fun with this game. My only complaints are the time slow in Arena making the game take forever, and that to even fight the final boss you have to fight all the others on the hardest difficulty. But otherwise, I enjoyed it and I'm sure I'll pick it up again some time in the future.","February 28, 2015","true","2.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Here's where it might just be me. I find that, when trying to do this, I struggle to get a bead on that quick-moving cube (read further for irony).\nEDIT: Also, in the Den(?) level, you are constantly harassed by two (")wolves("). It is necessary to shoot as often as you can; a good portion of those shots will be, er, dry-fires - no projectile will be shot. Unsure of the delay between when you shoot and when those projectiles are ready to be fired again, there isn't adequate feedback.\n\nThe camera panning is comparable to that which you would see in "found footage" films, i.e. The Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield. This makes combat that much more difficult; this makes controlling "David." that much more disorientating.\nEDIT: I learned in Flee that if you do not move at all but spam the Mouse-button, sometimes the camera will snap to David., and nothing will happen until you move.\n\nWhen attacking an enemy, time slows down. It seems that the enemies are not affected by this time-slow near as much as you. From what I've seen, you can somewhat exploit the time-slow to prepare yourself for the enemy. You can only charge your sling for so long 'fore it fires on its own.\nAfter dragging (attacking), the time-slow is exacerbated further for you, only for a split second, but long enough for your doom. If your shot connected with the enemy, their bits will respond to being shot by flying outwards, more often than not, directly into you. Too bad you can't really dodge at that point, being slowed even further. One-shot kill for you.\nIf you survived the enemy's, er, backlash, it's incredibly difficult to get the finnicky WASD responding correctly after getting back to real time, to dodge the goliath that is right on top of/under/beside you... because the range of "David."'s sling is pretty pitiful.\n\n\n[[I truly wonder just how different this game is from mobile. I would like to hear one's opinion who has played both. Not just for their take on how effectively the controls and maneuverability was re-worked, but also to get their opinion on how different the perspective is, what with the difference in screen sizes (because that's the only way I can justify that short range and terrible panning camera).]]\n\n\nWhy is the movement so inconsistent? Here's where the re-tooling of the game comes into play. WASD to move, mouse to shoot. W to jump; you'll only go so high 'fore stalling. Hit W again to jump again; the timing must be perfect for you to actually jump again (the movement is such that you fly/glide). If you do not time it perfectly, "David." will not jump (satisfactorily) again. So you might find yourself mashing the button in an attempt to actually get flying (which I, personally, find awkward), which doesn't really work either. Once you get airborne, you better stay (which is more difficult than it should be, 'cause W).\n\n\nDavid is small. David can be fast.\nDavid is hard to control. David is way more slow when you actually need him to be fast.\n\n\nThem's my gripes. I think they're good points - this IS a first-impression, though. Again, maybe it's just me. Wanted to let y'all know what to expect from the start.\nAm aware that it takes practice to get good at a game. I did not write this review in a rage; it is not meant to sound like "Bah, dis 2hard4me, must b prblm wit gaem." Even if I do get better at the game, I will no doubt still find the listed issues... as issues.\n\nParting words:\nIn my 0.3 hrs played, I've played two levels. Both have simply been boss fights. I thought the game had some exploration to it - and it very well might - but I wasn't expecting boss fights consecutively... though, that might be better, as I'm not sure 'f'I could do exploration (assuming there are hazards) with such floaty-yet-heavy-at-times-and-also-unresponsive/generally-finnicky controls.\n\nEDIT: New game came out today, "Aaru's Awakening." I know nothing of it except that the teleporting looks like it controls an awful lot like David.'s sling does. So. Further proof that it could just be me that's the problem, not necessarily David. (regarding that specific qualm).\n\nEDIT 2: Okay, so I'm at the level that had led me to believe there was some sort of exploration (a bit of it is in the trailer); here's the Achievement description:\nFlee on Very.\nSorry about this one. ;)\n(The difficulties are "Ok" and "Very")\nAlso, the developer has posted in the Update Log that in the near future, the price of David. will be dropped from $4.99 to $1.99. Good for consideration in possibly changing my review. Possibly.\nAs of now, I'm sticking with it being Negative because prolonged playing has only proven further the validity of my points - that Achievement description too.\nBut. That has also caused me to reflect further. As soon as you start Flee, the camera flies towards what seems to be the objective. There is a bit of a delay between the time you start moving and when the camera will finally snap back onto you. There are Out-of-Bounds death-zones that you must fly between to get to that "objective," all while being chased by an enemy. That the Achievement apologizes for this level leads me to believe that the developer knows that our ability to control David. is inherently... poor.\nNow, I'm thinking about how hard it would be to overhaul a mobile game without having to re-do EVERYTHING. It could go either way; Calling such games "mobile ports" could justify the (relatively, usually - this is not an attack on David. per se) little work put into the PC version - Usually (what with the price change, once again I'm not really referring to David.), the price of mobile ports is greater on PC than on mobile, so we should expect the port to be better than the original.\n\nAll of my gripes still stand, but perhaps (hopefully I'm not falling into the trap of justifying bad games to myself, trying to see a reason for why things are as they are (baselessly)) the game is NOT meant to have the fluid controls I'm wanting...\n\nEDIT 3: So The only Levels I have left to do are Flee and Sin (which I'm unsure if you can even play before beating all of the other levels). So I tried out the Arena. Unlike every level in the (")Campaign("), while in the Arena, I SERIOUSLY have no idea what is going on.\nIn the main levels, except for one or two, you are pitted against a goliath - each level has a certain gimmick that you must deal with (i.e. the goliath hangs out underwater, your sling can't shoot into it, bait the monster out of the water).\nIn the Arena, you have enemies coming at you from either side. Killing them drops Points. Collect them before they disappear. Sometimes instead of points, they will drop Shields. If enemies fly into the shield while it's up, they get hurt. Survive (this is the mode where you must pretty much constantly exploit the slow-time when you're firing your sling); it seems that when you get points, you get extra health too - t's not always a one-shot kill like in the campaign. You use the points you get to upgrade David.: how many projectiles orbit him, your health and your strength ("Heart" and "Shield") - IDK the difference 'tween these.\nI've been killed randomly several times without seeing any enemy close to me. More than half of the time, I cannot see the HUD because it is white, same as the background.\n\nI do not recommend David. because the game does not seem to make a lot of sense and because the controls are terrible.\ni do recommend David., though, because it is cheap, I like the premise and it is KINDA fun.","February 23, 2015","false","2.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","1"

It's a fun game that gets challenging, and a bit frustrating trying to beat a few of the levels on Very. (LOOKING AT YOU, FLOOD) But all in all, it's a really fun game that is worth a dollar, 3 dollars, or 5, whatever the price may be. The physics are cool although you don't always feel like you're in complete control of David, but that doesn't hurt the game too much. I'd recommend trying to beat every level on Very, seeing that Okay mode is very easy to complete. The arena is a nice bonus, as well as the secret basketball (if that's what you'd call it) room; which is relatively easy to find, just read the achievement description, it gives a huge hint. Overall, the game itself is fun to play through with just the right amount of challenge, the bonuses add some replayability, the hats you get for beating everything are a fun little reward, and the price tag is just right.\n\nBuy it. :)","February 23, 2015","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The controls and mechanics are simple, but the antagonists in the levels are varied and well done.\n\nThe main complaints in the negative reviews are:\n1) "The controls are too floaty." They are floaty, but I didn't have a problem after a few minutes of playing, so I chalk this up to taste.\n2) "You have to click David to shoot, it's difficult/uncomfortable/unintuitive." Only once in my playthrough did I have an issue with clicking on David, and that's on the level in which the camera zooms out the most. I don't see why this is a problem.\n\nAs a preface for my negatives, the game has two difficulties: the easy difficulty has something like 8 lives per level. The hard one has only 1 life, and there are some level differences as well (I think). I played the whole game on the harder without knowing the difference, and many of my complains are due to this. My complaints:\n1) The game spends too much time at the beginning of a level and when you die. Since you could easily die within a few seconds, it's annoying to have the game bring up the game over screen as slowly as it does. Further, upon starting a level (for the first time or restart), the camera spends far too long lingering on the enemy or some objective while the gameplay continues, so you sometimes have to move before the camera is on you or you die.\n2) The slowdown when charging is too strong, and limits your view. When you charge to shoot, it slows the game time, which in turn changes the level of zoom on your character; it can be disconcerting. Unfortunately, the time slowdown is necessary, but zooming in while charging makes it easy to lose track of enemies that you should be able to see as well as have you misjudge momentum.\n\nDespite those annoyances, I kept coming back to it and beat it, spent some time in the arena, some other things. It's not incredibly replayable but well worth the value, especially now that the price has dropped.","March 17, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's still not amazing, but the game works well enough to be a good value. It grew on me a bit, and the promises of more content should improve things, but it's surprisingly short and easy once accustomed to the game.\n\nDavid is a series of boss-rooms, contrary to my expectations. There is no real story, limited tactics, and not much replayability in the bosses. The particle shot system made me expect strategy on kills to gain particles, but nothing happens like that. Click-and-hold to charge, release to fire the particles in range. The only real tactical element is timing so that particles rebound into your range. Jumping is more like floating, and can be repeated infinitely to fly. With gameplay being the core, it could be better and more strategic. The awkward physics system driving everything means that dead enemies can still hit you for damage, and the biggest threats are the accelerating enemies offscreen.\n\nThe game is fairly short, and I have completed everything so far in around 2 hours. A fair amount of that time was adjusting to the controls, learning how to handle the physics and slowmo. I really don't like the comparisons to Shadow of Colossus. That game had personality to the bosses and stunning environments to tell a story. David is decent as a short game, but this is not a classic. David is Mega Man without the adventure areas or upgrades. Beyond price, my remaining criticism is that the game is not unique nor impressive. I purchased on a whim, and it's decent enough for that. It's not a game I'd mention to friends, but I can't really criticize the value anymore. If you are truly interested, the game is a good deal now. 50% off for 1.00USD recommended.","February 19, 2015","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a challenging game that has some very strong points. The premise of David. is simple, you control a small square with the WASD-keys that is orbited by spheres. If you press and hold your mouse over the square, time slows down and you charge up. If you're charged up, you get an audio queue and you will shoot any orbs within the square's range if you either release it, or wait too long. You're subjected to gravity, but you can jump an infinite amount of times.\n\nThe game sounds like fun on paper, but for me it was drowned out by the annoying parts. Although they might seem like small gripes, they really do add on and can grind your gears quickly. So let's play the good, the bad and the ugly to actually see why:\n\nThe good The music. It is very ambient and the boss fight track is pretty catchy. Even after beating the final boss and the main bosses I was not sick of hearing the music\nA nice variety in bosses. Some are hair-pullingly annoying, but they are pretty well thought out. Although on the easy side because of the time slowing mechanic, every boss brought something new to the table.\nSolid mechanics. The game works well. The game will not glitch out (at least, not that I noticed). And the framerate is very smooth not noticing any drops during play, which is necessary during play, because the action is high-paced.\n\nThe bad No graphics options. Ok, I understand that this is a 2D game, but isn't resolution options one of the basic things in a pc game? Some monitors do not like it when you have a smaller picture than the actual monitor's which leads to stretching, letterboxing etc. Some quality settings would also be nice for people on lower-end machines.\nNo rebindable controller buttons. The controller buttons are arbitrary and aren't shown in-game. You're left to scramble around the buttons to search for the charge button (which might just have been bound to every face button) is ONLY bound to RT.\nThe camera. It zooms and pans whenever it wants to. It is usually zoomed way too far in, making attacks from off-screen very frequent and also make you take way too many potshots. Also annoying during the bosses. If you don't move, they will attack you, even if you can't see your square i.e. your hitbox i.e. the thing that mustn't die. The final boss was actually a breath of fresh air, because in that fight the camera is pulled way back. However, it did make clicking and holding on the square way too hard.\n\nThe ugly Controller support.  Instead of making the scheme a simple left-stick move + right-stick aim, Your right stick controls the mouse. Not a mouse in the game, but your actual cursor. Even with auto-centering on, it wouldn't control well. Which is a huge shame, because twin-stick shooters play really well with controls. The menu also is really hard to navigate, because you have to select everything with the mouse... Which is controlled by your right stick.\nMouse and keyboard controls. My god they're bad. You have to click and hold onto your square, while dodging the bosses' attacks. If you pay attention during the tutorial you will actually see a finger being used instead of a mouse. A clear indicator that this was mobile first, pc dead last, made even more damning by the fact that you see a finger used in the tutorial to explain the shooting mechanics. It would have been much better if you could just click and hold anywhere on the screen, especially so during the final boss.\nLength. Have you checked my game time? You can beat the game well within an hour and then there is another set of bosses and an endless mode called the arena. That's very sparse content. I'm aware the game is cheap, but this is really thin, in comparison to other games, even in the same price range\nDifficulty curve. Or more accurately lack thereof. The WOLF, the third boss is a really annoying prick, being vulnerable at very specific times. Another annoying one is FLEE, which is a maze filled with death blocks and ends with a really easy fight. SIN on the other hand is a joke. Your vision is a huge upside and you can easily block his attacks with your shots. The MOAR room  contains more bosses, most of them also fall into the annoying category. Chief mention goes to STRAY where the orbs you fire gets scattered in the room. The only time that you actually really notice that the orbs need to be in your square's range in order to be fired\n\nSummaryA bad port of a mobile game that is bereft of anything that would give a clear indication of it being made for pc, that finger in the tutorial speaks volumes. No controller support to speak of and a really short play time with difficulty all over the place makes me not recommend this game.\n\nRecommended price point\nStill want the game? Wait for it to be on sale. You can then usually pick up the game for around $0.50 which is not too bad for a game that might really disappoint you.","February 15","false","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a very different style of play than anything I've ever seen before and it somehow makes playing as a little square fighting against big geometric shapes exciting and fun.\n\nThe game has you playing as a little square named David, and as this square you have to defeat a whole bunch of big geometric monsters that chase after you, shoot you, and jump on you. You accomplish this with a slingshot like weapon you are given in the intro, you use it by clicking and holding in a circle around David, letting it charge up, then releasing your click while it is aimed at where you desire to shoot and it sends these little oval ball projectiles wherever your mouse was aimed. After you shoot though, you have to make sure to let the projectiles go back into your circle otherwise they will not fire. And during the entire time you are holding your click, the game goes slow motion.\n\nThe game is somewhat aestetically pleasing, depending on your opinion of how geometric shapes look. It also has some nice music to set a certain mood while you are in a level, sort of pumping you up as it like a challenge themed music. Overall I like the music, but It's not like It's a soundtrack or anything, it is just little bits of music for the levels to further set the mood of the challenge.\n\nOverall I like the game in almost all aspects, the only con I give to it is the playstyle. While I love the playstyle, it is also a con for me as the playstyle is basically you keeping the game in slow-motion all the time to stay alive. This is not something that can neccessarily be fixed as It's really hard to stay alive without being in slow-motion 90% of the time. This is the only problem I can think of with this game, everything else is spot on for its price.\n\nI have played the game completely throughout, beating every level on both difficulties and getting all the achievements other than the achievement for reaching 100 in the Arena. From this amount of time I put into this game, I can easily tell you that it is worth it, I got the game for $1 on Steam and it has given me 3.5 hours of fun, and will be giving me more as I continue to try and get to 100 in Arena, and even now that the game is $1.99 on Steam it is still worth it. This game is perfectly priced as It's only $2 and still gives you at the very least an hour of fun on it. As long as the game looks interesting to you and you have a bit of money floating around in your steam wallet, I highly reccommend purchasing this game.\n\nPlus, hats.\n\nThis is my first real review of a game, please tell me what you think of it.

Is a fairly short game, with full completion running anywhere from  an hour to an hour and a half. I picked it up mainly because of its price, (and the fact that my computer could actually run it.) The style is very minimal, while still remaining very vibrant looking and retaning alot of the magic of a simplistic art style. I'll get to pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n-Beating a level on Very mode feels incredibly rewarding\n-The game has a good challenge curve, and is fairly challenging overall\n-The soundtrack is very much as simplistic and pretty sounding as the game is\n-Its crazy cheap! you could buy one half of a five dollar footlong, or you cou could just get this instead\n-It does not get stingy with the achievments. It just hurls them at you one after another\n-Boss design and level design are very rarely repeated.\n\nCons:\n-The game can behave unfairly at times, literally not allowing you to move in time to dodge something\n-Controls feel loose and unresponsive at times (but still function well enough to 100% the game.)\n-Level design feels very choppy and hard to use to fight\n-David's throwing maneuver can work unreliably from time to time\n-Achievments may not register occasionally, but that may not be a problem with the game at all so dont worry too much about this one.\n\nBasically, if you want a game with decent amount of challenge that you could complete over a weekend, buy David.

You are gifted with a weapon that shoots M&Ms upon charging up, and it slows time too giving you bullet-time action to defeat other texture-less objects while navigating texture-less levels.\n\nSome levels offer cool ideas and challenges, and others put you face-2-face against bosses.\nMany levels are really fun.\n\nThere's also an Arena mode, basically a survivor mode, where you keep defeating incoming enemies until you die.\n\nYour awards upon completing certain levels are.............hats!!\n\nAltough i really wanted to like the game. But the sluggish controls and the camera make the game super frustrating and doing levels on "very" difficulty (I don't know why the dev called the difficulties modes as "Okay" and "Very", he could use Easy and Hard".\n\nDavid has an unpredictable movements. When i want him to up, he sometimes don't go up. When i want him to go right/left quickly to evade enemies, he do so extremely slowly i die, and sometimes he go so fast when i just wanted him to strafe a little and evade, ending up dying by another enemy.\n\nThe camera in the final boss battle is fixed on him, so if he got far from you, you will be off-screen, and enemies will you have an easy time killing you.\n\nAlthough a minor issue, but the game hud is off and mis-aligned from the actual resolution. There's a tiny button above the screen that you can't press on it, but if you press on the upper-right corner, it will open. Same for "game over" screen.\n\nThese flaws are even more annoying if you want to get all the achievements.\nIf the developer wanted to tweak this game with smoother controls and optimizing the game for bigger resolutions to fix the hud, I'm sure the game will be perfect for what it is.\n\nAnd uh, game can be beaten in 1.5~2 hours, more if you want to do achievements.\n\nGame isn't expensive, the price is good. but I will leave it for your judgement to buy it on sale or not.\n\n","May 5","false","4.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LonMcGregor/recommended/346180/","LonMcGregor","LonM","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LonMcGregor/","303 products in account","David is not good, as the game claims. David is erratic and at times frustrating. David has potential, though.\n\nThe story is lacking. And much like other minimalist puzzle type games, I feel that rather than tacking on a mysterious "zen-like" story, it is better to have none at all. Still, that isn't my major issue with the game.\n\nFirst, it doesn't save progress. I spent an hour in the game, and upon realising that I had not been given any indication of a save point, I quit and restarted it. Only to find all of the progress lost. Not nice. Maybe there is a manual save option, but I couldn't find it. This needs to be made more obvious, if it exists.\n\nAlso, the controls feel sluggish and erratic. Sometimes pressing w shoots you right up into the air, other times it barely lifts you off the ground. This inconsistency happens regardless of how often you tap w, or how long you hold it for. Same goes for A and D. S is pretty consistent though.\n\nAs for the "click and hold" to charge the launch for the orbs, that mechanic feels more suited to a mobile device than a keyboard and mouse game. And the charge time is too long, in my opinion.\n\nAnother problem is that at the start of each level the camera view seems to hover around the enemy. And if it is moving fast towards you it gives you no time to avoid it. You can fix this by jumping, but even then the camera still has to pan over to you and this feels very sluggish.\n\nThe graphics and sound in this game are good, though. It does have a minimalist feel, and this makes it seem a lot like a modernised variant of the game asteroids. And the main playing mechanic also seems very nice, so if the other issues with the game can be fixed, then I can definitely see potential for the game. Until then, I would not reccomend buying this.","February 16, 2015","false","1.2"," 42 of 83 people (51%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","51","42","83","6","3"

For many games I've played, it's a depressing detriment, and I crave more, but somehow the makers found a way to cram enjoyment and challenge without ever overstaying their welcome. Polished, gorgeous, and simple, and with a buttload of variety.\n\nThe boss rush style set up can be make or break, but David. captures the excitement of high production fights with simple, genuinely fun boss fights that always bring something new to the table you have to adapt to. Going in, I played all the matches on the hardest difficulty, making it a one shot kill for me if I messed up or failed. In my humble opinion this is how the game was meant to be played, but regardless, there is a lot of reward to be had when clearing out a particularly difficult boss.\n\nGameplay wise, you are a square that floats around and can blast the evil triangles away with your giant throbbing balls of light. It takes tact, understanding of the physics and decent aim. That's it. You will die. A lot. Few games do you learn from death so well, so expect a good challenge and a lovely, minimalistic abstract art style. For the miniscule price, David is worth the pennies. It sticks with you well after you finish, even though it doesn't have anything in particular to say.

For many games I've played, it's a depressing detriment, and I crave more, but somehow the makers found a way to cram enjoyment and challenge without ever overstaying their welcome. Polished, gorgeous, and simple, and with a buttload of variety.\n\nThe boss rush style set up can be make or break, but David. captures the excitement of high production fights with simple, genuinely fun boss fights that always bring something new to the table you have to adapt to. Going in, I played all the matches on the hardest difficulty, making it a one shot kill for me if I messed up or failed. In my humble opinion this is how the game was meant to be played, but regardless, there is a lot of reward to be had when clearing out a particularly difficult boss.\n\nGameplay wise, you are a square that floats around and can blast the evil triangles away with your giant throbbing balls of light. It takes tact, understanding of the physics and decent aim. That's it. You will die. A lot. Few games do you learn from death so well, so expect a good challenge and a lovely, minimalistic abstract art style. For the miniscule price, David is worth the pennies. It sticks with you well after you finish, even though it doesn't have anything in particular to say. The music's also wonderful, so if you're looking for a great game that's off the beaten path, look no further.","August 30, 2015","true","1.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Don't you buy it to your pregnant wife - she might give birth to some square-head david.\n\nCons:\nFirst of all the player must learn to constantly masturbate the 'W' button in largo tempo to hover, which is the only way to move and escape foes. He should learn to never quit doing it whatever happens or he will lose height drastically. When he shoot the bullet-time starts, so he have to masturbate 'W' slower, but if he misses a beat in the process he'll have to recatch the rythm to gain height, this needs some time, it makes the character vulnerable and brutally maddens a player. So you might call it a musical game like Audiosurf.\n\nThe physics feels strange, the motion principles aren't obvious and the rules of killing enemies lack precision - sometimes you see a hit but it wont die.\n\nPros:\nMight be a good training for left-right brain hemisphere interaction - your left hand keeps pushing slowly, right hand clicks and drags to shoot.\n\nMight train your nerves to withstand a CIA torture if you are an international terrorist.\n\nUPDATE: Now when I've beaten some lvls I change review to recommended cause it's a great fun despite the difficulty and all!)))\n\n*****Зверски бесящая прыжковая абстрактная головоломка на основе ритмики с псевдофизическим движком, которая призвана угробить ваши нервы.

Он должен выучиться делать это постоянно, что бы ни происходило, иначе начинается резкое снижение. При стрельбе включается замедление времени, соответственно мастурбировать нужно медленнее, но стоит сбиться с ритма, придется его снова ловить, что происходит не сразу, из-за чего герой страдает, а игрок страшно горячится. Так что это можно назвать музыкальной игрой типа Звукоскольжения.\n\nФизика странная, принципы передвижения не вполне очевидны, а правила убийства врагов выполняются нечетко - иногда видишь попадание, а он не умирает.\n\nЗа:\nХороший тренажер для взаимодействия левого и правого полушарий головного мозга - левая рука медленно жмет, а правая щелкает и тянет направление выстрела.\n\nМожно натренировать нервы, чтобы выдержать пытки в застенках КГБ, если ваша деятельность направлена на ослабление России.\n\nДОПОЛНЕНИЕ: Теперь, одолев несколько уровней, я меняю оценку на + потому что очень прикольно все же играть, хоть и тяжко!)))))","July 23, 2015","true","3.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You'll find that doing the game on normal difficulty is a breeze, fun and exiting for one afternoon. However if you want a challenge (And it is a heck of a challege) you can choose the "very" difficulty. Yes it isn't very hard or very difficult. Just very.

Money well spent."\n\nHere is my current comment: "The physics are not the challenge in this game. The physics are the problem, they are what is wrong with this game. After spending more than 10 minutes, I figured there was something wrong with the game. You can't see the enemis: camera angles are wrong.

But if you like mutant muds, this game may be for you.\n\n(For devs):\n\nInstead of having the music a song that is 10 seconds and have it reloop, doesn't make it sound right. I suggest you would make the song longer, and edit it to make it sound like it is not looping, but it is just an endless song.\n\nI Don't get me wrong, this game is amazing and is very inspiring for my future games. (I am a game dev myself) There is something about how the game looks that makes me love it, so in the end for consumers that want to buy this game do the following:\n- Don't leave the level select screen in the backround while doing homework or anything like that, because it will give you a bad headache that won't go away.\n- If you don't like platformers, and like more third dimentional games, this game is not for you.\n\nThats about it, overall I will rate this game a 8/10.

That being said the unique gameplay would be way better if it actually worked. In the game you're supposed to be able to pretty much fly around using jumps (repeatedly pressing the "W" key to jump) however it seems to just have a mind of its own when and when not to jump. I repeatedly find myself randomly plummeting to the bottom of the level where there's usually enemies. Speaking of broken so is the firing method. The creative method of charging and then shooting a volley of multicolor orbs is a fun way to spice up shooting shapes but like jumping it decides to work when it wants. No matter how long I wait between shooting orbs I can't make the shooting work more than half the time.\n\nTL;DR Would be fun if they fixed movement and shooting.","March 9, 2015","false","2.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/literaryvideogames/recommended/346180/","literaryvideogames","Literary Video Games","http://steamcommunity.com/id/literaryvideogames/","23 products in account","(Note: I've played several hours of this game, but had to do so offline.)\n\nDavid. theoretically combines addictive gameplay with artistic vision. Reality, however, dictates otherwise: with a frustrating central mechanic and a bland story, David. needs significant refinement before it reaches the heights the developer intended.\n\nThe brief tutorial introduces players to two problems in this game. The first is the story, which can be summarized as "small square fights evil." The square is named David, but don't expect any more details than that. What evil? Why this particular square? Who knows. I understand that the story is intended to be cute and abstract, but this barebones plot doesn't cut it.\n\nThe second and more important problem lies in the game's main mechanic. Attacking requires that you click on David until several spheres cluster together, at which point you aim at enemies by jerking the mouse in their direction. Although time slows down as you gather the spheres, this surprisingly complex mechanic still suffers from some issues. Because players do not regain control of David until slightly after the move has finished, I experienced many unfair deaths. Yet controlling David was often the least of my problems; instead, I repeatedly died because I did not know where the enemies were. That's right—the screen does not expand to include enemies. I understand the reasoning behind this decision, as zooming out would have made David too small to click with any sort of consistency. As is, however, enemies sometimes flew onto the screen out of nowhere and killed David before I noticed them.\n\nStill, I admit I enjoyed messing around with David's attack. I often stayed in slow-motion throughout entire levels in order to win. Sometimes I would enter slow-motion for some epic Matrix style dodges and then, once I had fired my spheres, escape by sprinting away. This mechanic is more versatile than it might seem in the first hour or so of playing. It's also relatively novel; perhaps that's why it remains so unbalanced.\n\nMy third issue with David. arises in the game's controls. David. is not a traditional platformer, but it borrows enough elements from that genre that it needs to handle well. This is not the case, as David carries momentum like no other. I also don't know why the developers included a jump button—considering players possess an unlimited number of jumps, it would have made much more sense to allow the square to fly.\n\nIf David. were a more casual game, I might forgive the subpar controls. Alas, David. is quite punishing. The game has two difficulty modes, "Okay" and "Very." In the first, I blundered my way through all of the levels with relative ease. As a result, I was less aware of how my character floated across the screen and how his attack often caused me to take damage.\n\nBecause the second difficulty mode only gives the player a single hit point, my concerns about the inferior controls and inherently flawed attack mechanic were suddenly amplified. And it's not as though "Very" is impossible; rather, it's that the majority of my deaths were cheap, many occurring seconds after I spawned. David. is no doubt a tough game to beat, but too much of that toughness comes from poor design. In some cases, beating a level felt more like luck than skill.\n\nDespite the deficiencies in David.'s gameplay, Fermenter Games worked hard to make this game as beautiful as possible. The minimalist art style reminds me of a more colorful Thomas Was Alone, and the aggressive electronic music suits David. I also appreciated how the music slowed down whenever I began to charge my attack.\n\nAs much as I enjoyed the art and music of David., my favorite aspect of the game was the varied levels. Instead of jamming dozens of near identical levels into David., Fermenter Games spent time thinking of many different ways to engage the player. During my time with David., I navigated a maze, fled as I was chased, battled an underwater monster, and more. One of the best levels required that I destroy a thick wall while dodging incoming bullets. Yes, there are only eleven levels, but each introduces new concepts. The fantastic level design doesn't make up for inherently flawed mechanics, but it goes a long way in alleviating the pain.\n\nDavid. has a second mode that works as an arcade shoot-em-up with the mechanics I have already described. Because this mode plays out the same every time, I found myself less engaged by it than by the campaign. Some may be attracted to its score-attack feel; I was not.\n\nWith interesting levels, good music, and beautiful style, David. has potential. To find that potential, however, you'll need to look past the malfunctioning attack mechanic, a nonexistent story, and an inadequate control scheme.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 6.0/10\nThis review was written for Literary Video Games.

It has minimilistic graphics giving it the indie vibe. With a well thought out intro telling you all there is to know, it works well.\n\nA bug I have noticed which may not matter to many, is when exiting, it will turn to a white screen and say "blablabla" is not working. This may only be on my side, but it can be annoying.\n\nSome downsides to this game include:\nThe menu options when you die are useless symbols which you have no way of finding out what they do other than clicking in them (left one = go to hub, right one = retry level). Another quite annoying downside is that, it kind of leaves you in the dust after the tutorial. On certain levels it may be hard to find out how to actually win the level, which is really annoying in some cases. Another downside to this game is that you have to be clicking within an inch IRL to initiate the attack mode, which can be annoying when trying to dodge something and start attack mode. But to top it all of, the game is pretty hard. There is only 2 difficulty types, which both are hard.\n\nNow I could keep this list going for awhile and shame this game, but I'm not going to. This isn't made by some sort of multi-billion dollar game company, and of course it is going to be bad here and there, but David. is a great game to play when bored and is extremely fun.

It has minimilistic graphics giving it the indie vibe. With a well thought out intro telling you all there is to know, it works well.\n\nA bug I have noticed which may not matter to many, is when exiting, it will turn to a white screen and say "blablabla" is not working. This may only be on my side, but it can be annoying.\n\nSome downsides to this game include:\nThe menu options when you die are useless symbols which you have no way of finding out what they do other than clicking in them (left one = go to hub, right one = retry level). Another quite annoying downside is that, it kind of leaves you in the dust after the tutorial. On certain levels it may be hard to find out how to actually win the level, which is really annoying in some cases. Another downside to this game is that you have to be clicking within an inch IRL to initiate the attack mode, which can be annoying when trying to dodge something and start attack mode. But to top it all of, the game is pretty hard. There is only 2 difficulty types, which both are hard.\n\nNow I could keep this list going for awhile and shame this game, but I'm not going to. This isn't made by some sort of multi-billion dollar game company, and of course it is going to be bad here and there, but David. is a great game to play when bored and is extremely fun. The minimilstic feel to it is definitley a fact, controls are simple, design is simple, there is no need to plan anything out or take time to figure out what your going to do, which a lot of the time can be nice.\n\nI would definitley reccomend this game.","February 19, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A few are:\n\n- Infinite double jumping. Tt's double in that the longer you hold the key the higher you go, so spamming jump (as you want to do from the getgo) is largely ineffective.\n- Rubber-banding bullets that are only effective for a few frames. While you're charging them time slows down, allowing you to precicely aim. When you fire the enemies speed up before you do making it tricky to use.\n- Truly unique bosses.\n- After you beat those unique bosses you get a run-of-the-mill but extremely fun arena mode that lets you spend your high score on upgrades. Don't beat your high score? No new toys.\n\nVisually it's geometric, clean, and easily conveys meaning through color (water is dark, you can't go through red walls, etc.) It can get hecktic, and busy, but the time-slow mechanic keeps it from being -too- overwhelming (though, you'll certainly be overwhelmed for a while).\n\nOn the negative side, the controls are slippery. It's difficult even to pass through the doorways in the game, and the physics are unpredictable. The time lag you experence after firing is part of it, but you carry significantly more moment out of the time-slow than the game suggests. Often times I felt as if I was being sucked to one side of the map until I got used to it.\n\nTo me, these flaws add to the challenge in a meaningful and significant way. It allows the game to flow at a breakneck pace, while allowing you to manage that pace on your own, but without giving you full control. A misclick will mean a loss of health if not death which keeps you from getting complacent.\n\nBest of all, it's easy to pick up and play for a few minutes at a time, but it remains engaging for much longer than it's simple mechanics and feel would suggest.\n\nIt's hard to find a better value for the price. Buy this right now.","February 22, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While the controls take some getting used to, testing your mastery of them is quite fun.\n\nI'm not sure that there's enough here to warrant the $5 price tag.

I became frustrated when I lost and Joyful when I finally beat those tough levels.\n\nI don't think David will go and rot in the depths of my collection after I finish him, he will always have a place for me, somewhere where I can just go to waste some time trying to beat some levels again and try to relive some of the enjoyment I first experienced.\n\nThere was only one reason why I bought this game.

The most important thing to keep in mind is that you have to adjust your strategy to the enemy. Then, you can enjoy this addictive game.\n\nThere are two difficulties : "Okay" and "Very", your health is the difference (Full health VS One health, so one shot will kill you). I think going straight the "Very" difficulty is fine, but you can do some levels on "Okay" before to see the enemy and prepare your strategy for "Very".\n\nAt the moment, there is a bug : your progession cannot be saved. So you should complete the game on "Very" in a single run !\n\nIn the end, since the price is only 1,99€ ( and there are Steam cards), if you like this kind of game, I strongly recommend it !","May 1, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On the aptly named "very" difficulty setting, the game doesn't hesitate to crush you, and ask you to try again. Trial, error, and repetition are a big part of David., but finally mastering a boss and destroying them is incredibly satisfying. The variety of the levels and bosses also prevents the game from becoming repetitive. If the baby of Shadow of the Colossus and Thomas Was Alone sounds like something you'd enjoy, then I'd definitely recommend this bite sized indie effort.","February 19, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have one attack, which is well balanced since it is powerful but slow to  activate.

Sometimes jumping in air works, sometimes I fall like a rock especially after shooting. When shooting, sometimes projectiles moves fast and far, sometimes they don't move at all.\n\nEnemies might be outside the screen and then attack super speed.

In some cases even player own character is shortly outside screen.\n\nIn many levels, you don't know first time whatever you should collect or shoot something, causing unnecessary deaths. It feels that whole game requires lots of guessing and luck. Some UI buttons included, as they may be just pixely shapes and you have to click them few times to find out what they do.\n\nSo yeah, sadly I can't say I enjoyed playing this game. Maybe it just requires more practice, right state of mind or just different controller than keyboard and mouse. Game just feels to be missing finishing touch. It's kinda pity because I like the simplicity of basic idea. Graphics (if you can say there is any), music and sounds are okay for game like this.

Sometimes I get stuck between wall and enemy and lose all health at once, I don't know is it supposed to be like that. In some cases even player own character is shortly outside screen.\n\nIn many levels, you don't know first time whatever you should collect or shoot something, causing unnecessary deaths. It feels that whole game requires lots of guessing and luck. Some UI buttons included, as they may be just pixely shapes and you have to click them few times to find out what they do.\n\nSo yeah, sadly I can't say I enjoyed playing this game. Maybe it just requires more practice, right state of mind or just different controller than keyboard and mouse. Game just feels to be missing finishing touch. It's kinda pity because I like the simplicity of basic idea. Graphics (if you can say there is any), music and sounds are okay for game like this. And I like that levels have variation.\n","December 8, 2015","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Controls take some getting used to, at least with keyboard and mouse, but it's a manageable learning curve. Enemies and levels are varied enough in form and tactics to keep the platforming and combat interesting,  and there are enough levels and secrets to make the purchase worth the small price. Add in achievements for perfect runs (i.e. taking no damage), leaderboards for speedrunning, and an endless Arena challenge mode, and there's enough to keep you playing past the first run through.","December 27, 2015","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each of David's very few levels is different in idea. Some will have you combatting an enemy geometrical mass submerged in projectile-defensive water, while others will have you slowing time to utilze moving platforms as a sheild. Completing every level on, "Very," is a difficult but overall worthwhile challenge, and beyond that there's still a few more achievements to attain before the game's fully over. I wish it was longer, but what's there is great.","February 13","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It made me annoyed as hell when I lost, and then when I won, I didn't feel accomplished. The movement is terrible at times, and you have to rapidly spam W or the up arrow key to go up. The bullets move at light speed even though you're in slow motion mode, and the "final boss" (I guess?) is seemingly unbeatable and mostly based on luck. I haven't beaten the boss yet, and it's gotten me really annoyed throughout the game itself. I wouldn't recommend this and even though it was only about $1, it was a waste. Maybe if there are a few fixes with the movement and speed of the bullets at some places, then I'd be fine.","May 12","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
