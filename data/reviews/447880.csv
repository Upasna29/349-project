I'm still not good with it.\n\nSo, I bought this game because of the screenshots provided and it kinda looks promising. But as I played it, the intro music was too loud and also the background music is not soothing to the ears at all. There's no in-game option to disable or decrease the game's volume. Second, the overall game is boring. We have already seen this kind of game and to tell you this Angry Birds has better controls. As I played through the game, somewhere around level 5. I encountered a frustrating glitch or bug in which the bombs just gets stuck at one side when I keep on draggin it to be place. And also, if you plan to update this. Can you just please let us freely put the bomb where we like it? because the snap into a point kind of placing is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off.","March 1","false","0.1"," 41 of 46 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","41","46","4","0"

This time you don't shoot creatures at objects, but instead you shoot objects at creatures! The innovation is real! The game is simple; carefully place bombs in strategic locations so that the blast knocks the creatures off the platform.\n\nMy play time is obviously off; I couldn't put this much time into this. It's fun for around 30 minutes but after that it really loses it's luster. There are some noticeable bugs when it comes to bomb placement... which is essentially the whole game. Also, when you pause the game sometimes your mouse will go erratic and prevent you from continuing. I'm about to give up on this developer since almost all of the games are at best meeeehhhh....\n\nWorth $1-2 like any other phone app. This will be in a free giveaway soon like all of the games from this developer.\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

That being said, it needs refinement more than anything. I can't really recommend it for $2 because at this point you could probably find something online that's free and more entertaining.\n\nOk, here's my issues with the game:\n- The physics don't really make sense. Sometimes pieces feel like they're glued together. It's also hard to get a grasp on the weights of everything. It doesn't feel consistent.\n- I've had levels where I only use one dynamite to win the level when you need to use two to get the diamond. I have to randomly use one extra on nothing just to progress. Seems kind of pointless.\n- You're given more dynamite than you need to get the diamond, but if you beat it doing this.. You're literally accomplishing nothing. You already have access to further levels anyway.\n- The music and sounds are kind of jarring.\n- The platforms on the levels are round looking, with dynamic shaping, yet are actually just normal rectangles with transparent edges, This can make it somewhat frustrating when something looks like it should be tipping off the edge.\n- I've had the beasts actually float on notihng in the level before.\n- Levels often spawn with the crate stacks sliding around. Sometimes if you wait long enough (which can even be less than a minute's time) it will eventually just make the beast slide to its death. Yet you won't be creditted for this and will have to restart.\n- The game feels like it's more about trial and error rather than strategic placement. A lot of the time I found myself slightly shifting my placement until it worked as desired. This was a bit annoying because you'd have to reset the level everytime to do this and would lose track of the exact spot you had placed it previously.\n- The spinner things in the snow levels are really buggy. Sometimes they will fling beasts off the stage like a bullet. Honestly, I don't really have a problem with this one because it was actually pretty hilarious to see.\n\nI can't recommend it for trading cards either at the regular price. I think the trading cards average about five cents each. With nine to collect, it would cost you 45 for all, and you wouldn't have to go through the pain of playing this.\n\nI'm surprised I was actually able to write this much about it, because there's not even that much to the game itself.","May 17","false","2.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The game is actually really easy and the rules are not demanding, you can do things pretty withouth any effort. And fun. Yeah, you won't have a fun time in this game, because it is totally devoid of it.\n\nThis game is absurdly cheap, but, still, it is not worth getting it\n\nThey try a little to be like Angry Birds, I guess, but they fail miserably because it lacks a heavy of a load of things.\nThe characters are also not charismatic at all.\n\nThe music is pretty repetitive, but not really bad. Still, I see no reason to ever recommend this game.","May 3","false","2.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you like Angry birds, but a little eaiser, except with dynamite placement, then you might like this.  The game is easy to control, and there can be more than one way to solve each puzzle.  There are 90 levels (as of this review, with place holder for more coming soon).  Most are easy to beat, but harder to get the diamond rating for using fewer dynamite sticks.  It looks as if it is going to be a cheap, buggy game.  But it turned out to be surprisingly well made & easy to control.  There isn't much frustration here, unless you really want all diamond ratings on every puzzle.  I got most, but there were just a few ones that seemed especially difficult to get diamon rating.  But you can move on after beating it normally.  It is fun for a quick playthrough, thats all.\n\nIt ran great, full screen at 1080p on my 47" TV, with Windows 10.  Mouse controls and menus were easy too.","May 1","true","3.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
