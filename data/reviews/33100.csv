A dozen of guns, hordes of enemies, simplistic, yet dynamic and fast-paced gameplay and lots of gore. What else is needed for a good game about killing aliens? Well, maybe a little more than ten fairly modest levels that can be beaten in just two hours. But considering when and by whom Alien Shooter was made these problems are understandable. This game also has a number of sequels that somewhat help with it's short length, but I would prefer all them compiled in one 'big' game (a re-release, maybe?) than in five different short ones.","April 26, 2014","true","6.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

If you haven't played any of if incartations in the past you probably don't like top-down shooters because else it's very hard to avoid this series.\n\nBack in the days when this first installment came out it represented the pinnacle of Windows top-down shooting action games. Nowadays finally there are actual versions of games like Alien Breed from the Commodore Amiga but nonetheless this game has it's charme throwing endless waves of aliens at you, hunting down secrets in the maze-like-levels or just listening to the very good background music.\n\nIf you want a little distraction from your everyday shooter schedule and already are into this kind of games, you should absolutely give this little gem a try. But I'd recommend to wait 'til it's on discount because for the full price you could even get some installment of the former mentioned Alien Breed Series that's technically and in terms of athmosphere miles above this one here.\n\nIn fact that doesn't harm the pure and timeless no brain shooting action Alien Shooter has to offer.","August 2, 2014","true","4.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I used to play the demo all the time as a 6 year old to 8 year old kid. Oh, the fond memories of playing this game behind my mother's back because she didn't like of all the violence >_>.\n\nWell anyway, I am now an adult, and I have returned to Alien Shooter in order to revisit some of my most fond childhood memories... and thank god that this game is still as good as it was back when I first played it.\n\nThe game's title is pretty straight-forward, and there's not much more to it then that. You're sent into a military complex all by yourself, which has been infested with aliens. Your job is to stop all of the aliens from escaping and going out into the world to wreck havoc, by mass-murdering every single mother-♥♥♥♥ing alien in sight and paint the entire floor and walls with so much blood that the smell would probably be enough to render you unconscious.\n\nYou start out with your dual-wield pistols, but eventually, you'll unlock a multitude of other weaponry to blow up everything in sight, such as shotguns, miniguns, laser assault rifles, plasma miniguns, rocket launchers, magma guns, and a floating orb buddy who murders everything in sight for you so you don't have to. And I have to say, killing aliens with all of these weapons at your fingertips is surprisingly therapeutic and insanely fun.\nThere are also some minor RPG elements in the game, such as the ability to level up 'skills', the ability to choose your gender, and your name.\n\nMy favourite part about this game would have to be it's soundtrack. I remember as a kid, upon loading up the game for the first time and hearing the main menu music, it literally sent chills down my spine, and it still does to this day.\n\nThe only downside to the game I could possibly think of, however, is that the game is very short. I personally finished it in two hours in one sitting, and sadly there is not that much replay value other than survival mode.\n\nOverall, the game was very good for it's time, and without a doubt it still holds up today. It is worth your time if you either need something fresh to play, or if you just want to kill some time. If this game is ever on sale, or you have $5 to burn, it is worth a go.\n\n...or you could just buy Alien Shooter 2.\n","March 19","true","8.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","5","6","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lucasyari/recommended/33100/","lucasyari","Yaridovich","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lucasyari/","2236 products in account","7/10\n\nThere are some old games that don't age well. I'm glad to say that Alien Shooter isn't one of them.\n\nIt's a simple premise that works perfectly - move and shoot all aliens in sight, just as the name implies. There are some upgrades to be purchased and a decent variety of weapons to use. And while the player will have to fight huge hordes of enemies, there's actually a good variety of enemies to fight and they often require different strategies to be dealt with since some weapons will work better against certain enemies than others.\nAnd while it may sound a little repetitive, the game is a lot of fun - and it lasts just enough that it doesn't feel too short while also not feeling like it's stretching for longer than it should.\n\nThere are only two problems that I'd mention about the game. The first is that it can be a little too hard sometimes. Even with the best weapons, there are certain parts of the game on later levels where the player will be forced on a unfair situation - like being stuck on a room with too many enemies and not enough room to maneuver around, which is a huge problem since mobility is a large factor on this game.\n\nThe second is the camera. Because of its angled top-down view, some things (enemies, more than often) will show up behind walls and the player can't see what's behind them because of the camera's angle. The camera is fixed and there's no transparency effect, so that's often an issue.\n\nBut even so, this still doesn't detract from the fun the game provides.","February 18, 2015","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are however some minor differences on account of Zombie Shooter being the later of the two.\n\nIn this game you can't upgrade your weapons, the enemies are actually less innovative than in Zombie Shooter if you can believe that and the graphics are somewhat more dated.\n\nAlien Shooter also suffers heavily from the fact that it uses smaller maps than Zombie Shooter and compensates by introducing infinite enemy spawners which is just a horrible idea.\n\nIn the end, it's like a slightly crappier version of Zombie Shooter, everything is just a little worse and Zombie Shooter wasn't a very good game to begin with. If someone holds a gun to your head, pick Zombie Shooter over Alien Shooter but if you still maintain your free will, don't bother unless you got it through the Indie Gala in which case you can get an hour or so of fun out of it.","November 8, 2012","false","18.0"," 6 of 19 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","6","19","0","1"

You shoot aliens, and lots of them. With the complexity of a well-made flash game, there is really not to this title. You shoot aliens to get cash. You use that cash to buy new weapons and ammo. Sometimes the aliens are yellow, sometimes they are blue, but most of the time they are green. You can choose to set the blood color to red or green, and even password protect so the blood can't be changed back to red. I guess we all have to think of the children.\n\nThere is an isometric top down view to this game. Move around with WASD, and aim with the mouse. Most of your time is spent dancing around to avoid enemies while holding down on the left mouse button to fire. I felt the aim was not always as tight as I'd like it, but at least your character can pull off some pretty fancy footwork. I don't see a lot of options for customization in this game, so you have the choice between 9 or so different weapons, and a flashlight.\n\nThe music can pump you up sometimes, really picking up when you're fighting a large horde. The graphics are very representative of a free flash game, and yet this is not a free flash game.\n\nIf you are in the mood for a mindless shooter, I guess this can be ok if you find it on sale for very cheap. I don't think there is anything here that isn't improved upon in free games.

That is what the gameplay is.\n\nShoot the green aliens, but don't forget to moonwalk backwards\nYou control a character that can shoot and bump into things so things happen. Think of opening doors and flipping switches. But this guy can do more! He can rotate his upper body without moving his lower body. At least in the original, in the revisited he can still do some weird twists but his feet will point more or less into the right direction. In the revisited version however he can moonwalk and move without moving his feet. Floating is perhaps a better word. And often he floats out of the screen and is nowhere to be seen. By you the player that is, the aliens have no problem finding him.\n\nSo you move your character with the keyboard of right mouse button while shooting with your left. I thought Diablo3 was mindless clicking, well this is his master! Aliens rush at you and you just have to point in the right direction to shoot them while walking backwards. Nothing wrong with that, but if the guy only would walk the way you want him to go! You have to constantly correct his direction. Probably he is busy shooting...\n\nYou can blow things up. Only don't stand too close or shoot it accidentally and you are dead. At least in the original, in the revisited version it is somewhat better.\n\nAll the while you can upgrade your armor and stuff you carry. Plenty to be found in those silent buildings.\n\nAnother thing is that the original has 2 fixed graphic resolutions. Oh well, it's older. But the revisited also has these... Bizar. The graphics are somewhat better but that's about it. Highest resolution is 1024 x 768. How old can you get...\n\nIn the end this was one of the worst games I played in my life. A mindless alien top-down shooter should not be so hard to make, at least to get the physics right of you puppet. If even that fails, the only option left is to hit the uninstall button.","December 10, 2013","false","0.3"," 0 of 18 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/solaris32/recommended/33100/","solaris32","solaris32","http://steamcommunity.com/id/solaris32/","2004 products in account","This review originally written on July 2, 2012 on GameFAQs\n\n"A fun and entertaining isometric shooter."\n\nAlien Shooter is a top down isometric shooter. You move with the keyboard and fire with the mouse. What I am reviewing is the Invasion Earth edition which is Alien Shooter plus its 2 expansions, Fight For Life and The Experiment, all in one. I will be reviewing all 3 with the 2 expansions having their own small section at the end.\n\nGRAPHICS: 8/10\nThis game was released in 2003 and by a small company, so the graphics actually aren't bad. They're bright and colorful and not unpleasant to look at. The only problem is that they use the same tileset for the entirety of the game.\n\nSOUND: 9/10\nThe sound is pretty good. The weapons sound right and the monsters make satisfying sounds when they're killed. The music is also real nice and can pump you up when enemies attack.\n\nSTORY: 4/10\nThere actually is a story in this game, but it's hindered by poor grammar, occasional misspellings, and inconsistent writing. At the start and end of the game there are a few static screens briefly describing the story. At the start of each mission there is a little mission briefing that tells you a little bit about the level and the character's thoughts. The first time you play the game you might bother to read it, but then you beat it and realize it doesn't matter. The main problem is the poor grammar which makes it hard for me to read and take seriously in a commercial game. A small nitpick is the inconsistent writing. Sometimes the writing will go in depth into the description of something inconsequential, but doesn't remain consistent with this style. For example it describes two men getting out of a helicopter and how the blades swoosh their hair. Um, ok? There are no descriptions of the persons themselves or anything else like that so why bother describing something so silly? Oh well, the story isn't important, just shooting aliens.\n\nGAMEPLAY: 7/10\nThere are 10 levels in Alien Shooter and your goal in each one is to kill all the aliens, and in some destroy the alien spawners using dynamite. The gameplay is simple and does not change at all. To some it can get repetitive but this is not the first time I played this game and it likely won't be the last. This game is also reasonably challenging on hard. Finally, there is a survival mode which sees how long you can survive using one of the turrets before you die.\n\nIn most levels there are secrets where you can find things like weapons, upgrades, money, and ammo. Usually they're behind a crack in the wall which you must blow up, but sometimes money is hidden behind walls and you can't see it. You can also destroy certain boxes for cash and money, and enemies drop these at random as well.\n\nENEMIES: 6/10\nThere are literally only 4 enemy types in the entire game. The colors are palette swapped to indicate tougher versions. Later in the game 2 of the enemy types start wearing armor which makes them tougher and allows them to shoot. The enemies, while interesting, aren't original. The small guys are basically Shriekers from Tremors 2, and the taller ones are pretty much the aliens from Aliens. It's still fun to shoot them though!\n\nWEAPONS: 7/10\nThere are 9 different weapons with each one getting stronger than the last, and this is my problem. I would've liked the different weapons to have more utility and be useful in certain situations, but for the most part they aren't. Sure rockets and the plasma cannon are good for hordes, but once you get the magma gun there's no reason to use anything else except to save ammo. Some more variety and uniqueness would've been nice.\n\nUPGRADE SHOP: 7/10\nAt the start of each level you can use money earned previously to buy new weapons and ammo, as well as upgrades for your character. You can also buy armor, lives, and a few other things. Don't be too eager to buy new weapons and upgrades because you will find some of them in the levels. There are 3 levels of upgrades for your character. The upgrades are HP increase, strength which lets you carry more ammo, speed increase, and accuracy which increases your damage and accuracy. It's not bad how it is now, but it could be better and more complex.\n\nLENGTH AND REPLAYABILITY\nBeating the game on hard is about 2-3 hours depending on your skill and knowledge of the game. There are 3 difficulty levels so you can play on normal first to get the hang of the game then replay on hard for a challenge. To me the replayability is high because over the years I've beaten this game several times.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 7/10\nThere's just something about this game that makes it so much fun to play. I've tried playing other games like this such as the Alien Breed trilogy (no relation), but there's something about them that seems off. Maybe it's because in this game there are a hundred aliens swarming at you at once and you mow them all down. This game is very arcadey and I enjoy it for that. There is a demo so give this game a try. If you aren't real into the demo know the game doesn't change or introduce anything new except bigger crowds of stronger enemies.\n\nFIGHT FOR LIFE (campaign 2): 6/10\nThis expansion introduces 5 new levels to play. Everything is exactly the same as Alien Shooter but the level layout is of course different. It uses the same tileset and all that. Because there are only 5 levels the difficulty ramps up fast, therefore this expansion is more challenging than the base game. I give it a 6 because it doesn't introduce anything new at all. The “story” is continued but I already discussed the irrelevance of it.\n\nTHE EXPERIMENT (campaign 3): 7/10\nThis too has 5 new levels, and although it still uses the same tileset, there are 2 new enemy types. There are also a few new rockin' music tracks to listen to. And finally there is a boss monster at the end of the last level (the first boss in the series), and he's hard! This expansion is really hard as a whole as well. You will be tight on money and ammo up until around the end of the last level. My thoughts on the story are the same of what I said for the previous expansion.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nAs I said at the beginning I got the Invasion Earth physical copy which is all 3 of these games. You should be able to find it for pretty cheap. Alternatively you can buy the collection digitally on certain sites. Do not buy from the developer's site as it is grossly overpriced.\n\nI overall really like these games and have enjoyed them for years. There are a lot of things they can do better which are addressed in future games but you can't blame these for that too much. A series has to start somewhere and this isn't some AAA developer. If you are into arcade shooters I think you will enjoy these.","October 25, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Use awesome weapons! Buy awesome gear. That's the game in a nutshell.\nThis game may look old but that adds to the overall charm of the game, because of the sprites it uses, it really pulls off the feel of an arcade game. This is the type of game I'd throw countless amount of money into just to complete at the arcade if it were there when I was a kid. I remember playing the demo of this many years ago and I've been hooked ever since.\nIt works perfectly on all operating systems that I've tried, including Windows 7 64bit.\nThe only downside to this game is it's age unfortunately, because of it's age, it has lower resolutions to play at and even worse, I can't find a way to make the game windowed in order to compensate for the low resolution it plays at in fullscreen. So it's one thing to keep in mind when getting this game.\nSo all in all, I'd very much recommend this game to everyone. I've loved the whole Shooter series by Sigma so much that I've made videos of each and every one of them. If you don't fancy paying full price for the game, wait until a sale, they are usually at a pretty awesome price so grab it when you can.","November 28, 2013","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I remember playing the demo for this thing so long ago...such a classic.\n\n\nSo, the story in Alien Shooter is basically nonexistent. You're a special ops person sent by the military to neutralize an army of aliens that got themselves here in a manner similar to the Resonance Cascade in Half Life. Your character fights their way through hundereds and hundreds of the beasties, until you finally bomb the main teleporters they are coming from, and you win. Or do you?\n\n\nThe gameplay is some of the most mindless trite ive ever seen. Just hold the left mouse button and dodge incoming fire. It's tedious at first, sure, but once you get a flamethrower that can kill about forty monsters at a time, then it starts getting fun. Inbetween the ten missions, you can buy more weapons and equipment with money you pick up from the field. Yeah, money, just laying around the facility. Then again, what use is money to dead scientists? Even with all the upgrades and BFGs you get, the game still is challenging, with the last level being one of the most tricky levels ive seen in a game.\n\n\nThe graphics...eh. It looks like a modern flash game. Then again, it was made in 2003, with not that big a budget it seems...the graphics are okay. Just sprites, but they get the job done.\n\n\nIn the end, I give Alien Shooter, a 3/10. It's a fun way to kill about an hour, maybe an hour and a half, but seeing how it comes with Alien Shooter 2, Zombie Shooter, and Alien Shooter Revisited, I think that adds up to about six hours of play, and therefore enjoyment.","March 11, 2014","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sigma Team are some of the best devs I've ever seen when it comes to twinstick shooters and overall replay value in said gametype, this game alone ended up sucking up at least 100 hours of my time off of steam years ago, maybe even before steam was a thing.\n\n\nIts a solid 8/10 - Could use some polish, but overall its amazing. Also, its remake. Alien Shooter - Revisted. Its a rather good remake, but it seems to not work with windows 8.1, which is odd, but since I got both of these, Alien Shooter 2 Reloaded, and Zombie Shooter in a pack for like 7$ total, it wasn't a big deal to me.","May 25","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
