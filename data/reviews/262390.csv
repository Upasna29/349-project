Flashy levels and fast paced gameplay hits you right away as soon as you leave the tutorial, and immediately, you begin to die. You will die a lot in Cloudbuilt, but it takes the Hotline Miami aproach of giving you absolutely no downtime in between lives, a wise decision but one that is ultimitely undone when the game forces you to either restart the level, disregarding any checkpoints you've passed so far. Oh yes, you have lives. Want to know how many lives you currently have? Too bad. While you do have at least 15 or 20, you go through them so quickly, especially when you are first learning the ropes, that getting hit with that menu out of nowhere with those two equally confidence sapping messages can leave you wanting to put the game down for awhile.\n\nEventually however, you begin to train yourself to fire at mines while wall running, timing the wave cannons, and keeping an eye on the ground for crawlers through any foilage that might be obscurring them. You learn that if there aren't any lateral platforms to jump to, find the nearest vertical wall, because its more than likely you've reached a tower-like segment. That inital building of skill is a wonderful feeling rare in an environment of casualization like the modern Videogame industry.\n\nThen the midgame begins and you realize the game you're playing has changed.\n\nTracks with clear paths and obsticles give way to tight corridors filled to the brim with mines, moving laser gates, undodgable sniper turrets, homing, shielded laser cannons that will follow you around, and other enemies that make sure you will take damage on your first run throughs, if you can get past them at all. And boy, do they do damage. You have no invincibility period between hits, so your life can be drained in under a second if you hit the right obsticles. And you will because, while the game up until then has valued a fast pace with a look-while-you-leap mentality, obsticles begin to be placed right around corners, on the walls of verticle wall-jumping sections where visibility, manuverability, and aiming is limited, all of this with that invisible life counter ticking away. You quickly begin to relearn the core tenants of what got you this far, at least until you've memorized most of the enemy placements, but thats the problem: Throwing yourself against this brick wall until you learn all of its nooks and crannies sucks any tension, real skill building, and fun out of the whole experience, especially when that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ menu forces its way onto the screen.\n\nIts not that Cloudbuilt is a bad game. It just feels extremely unfocused very quickly. Take the jetpack for example: Its your main way of navagating terrain and obsticles, but its charge is limited, requiring you to be on a solid, horizontal surface to charge. This would be fine, except there's no real way to know how much you'll need for the obsticle ahead, so you might use half your bar traversing a wallrunning segment, only to need more than half to climb vertically to continue. This leads to moments where you're standing completely still after a failed verticle climb, waiting for your jetpack to recharge, surely taking damage if any enemies  are around.\n\nAnd speaking of damage, your gun is next to useless. That's usually not a problem because a skilled player can manuver around enemies and their bullets with relative ease, but sometimes the game will force you along a linear path filled with enemies and your gun, which can't even take out most dangerous enemies like the wave canon with a charged shot -if you have enough time to charge it at all, is simply not up to the task of defending you. You might suggest rapid firing the weakest shot ala Megaman, except your gun also has ammunition that must recharge after five shots, as much as it takes to kill the first enemy introduced. God help you if there are two of them. Shooting at targets while moving and dodging obsticles is hard enough, but when the reward for successfully doing so is minimal, it shifts focus to attacking the most dangerous enemy in the area first, which would be fine, but again, before long the level designs become such that you cant see what's coming, leading to more reliance on memory.\n\nIt all ends up feeling like its pulling in two different directions. On the one hand, you have the need to traverse the level, kill enemies, beat your best time, and look cool doing so, but on the other you have this whole resource management aspect that, frankly, takes more from the game then adds to it. Balancing these two might be possible if you could see what's ahead and plan your moves accordingly, but again and finally, you can't unless you've played the levels enough to have memorized a good deal of them, and I just don't find that fun.\n\nBut you might! Its definitely worth a try, but don't spend your money unless you're absolutely sure.","April 3, 2014","false","3.3"," 367 of 472 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","367","472","0","5"

My full thoughts can be found in the video above, but I would have no hesitation in recommending this game to anyone!\n\n"Cloudbuilt is a third person platformer which revolves around speed running, in which you have to navigate each level in the quickest time possible, but what makes it intriguing is the fact that there is multiple routes for each level giving you different options on how to complete it."","March 2, 2014","true","6.5"," 213 of 297 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","213","297","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/waystonevex/recommended/262390/","waystonevex","Vex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/waystonevex/","404 products in account","This is a game clearly made by a team of people that love precision platforming games--that much is obvious, and I will always applaud any team that makes a game out of love. Unfortunately, in trying to make a unique contribution to the genre, they've added a lot of needless complication and frustration that serve only to make the game inaccessible to new players and frustrating for all the wrong reasons. The overall premise is great, and the visual style is very fresh, but being that this is a precision platformer, the devil's always in the details.\n\nFirst off, while the controls themselves are serviceable, and I feel like I could learn them just fine given the practice, the "rules" for how I interact with the world feel a little loose. Hands down the number one cause of failure I experienced was accidentally performing wall climbs when I meant to perform wall runs, and vice-versa. This interaction is controlled entirely by the angle your mouse is at as you approach it--point mostly straight-on to run up the wall and at an angle to run along it. Unfortunately, being a little too far one way or the other can mean you do the entirely wrong thing, wasting a substantial amount of boost bar at best or dying at worst. This was particularly frustrating when almost every wall in the game is blatantly placed for either climbing or running but not both--I knew what I wanted to do, the game knew what it wanted me to do, but the difference of a few degrees wrecked everything. Again, I know these aren't problems a pro would ever deal with, but as a scrub I'd appreciate some fudge room--maybe let walls that I'm "supposed" to run across fudge the angle a bit so I only run across them unless I come at them really straight. I know I'm a scrub, I won't ever get an anywhere near "good" time on a level without busting my ♥♥♥, but I'd rather fail because I made a bad decision or reacted poorly, rather than because the controls are merciless.\n\nSpeaking of merciless, I'm having a hard time seeing how it helps the game more than it hurts to have a limited boost bar. I mean, I can only assume it's limited because so many other games with similar mechanics have limited boost bars, but did the team ever stop to ask whether it was really necessary for THIS game? Any wall that's longer than one bar's-worth of boost has a full-boost-refill powerup halfway across it anyway, and I can still only jump once more in the air regardless of how much boost I have, so what does it hurt? The only thing that would be lost is limiting my ability to run straight up walls, but that's already taken care of in the level design--there aren't any walls that I could "cheat" by having unlimited boost, and if there were, putting a limit on specifically running up walls seems like a better solution. At the end of the day, the only thing the limited boost bar does is send rookies and experimenters plummeting to their deaths when they run out of meter mid-jump because they were a little inefficient--would it be so bad to let them finish the level anyway and just give them a D, rather than let them make ZERO progress?\n\nThe inclusion of enemies and shooting mechanics was an interesting one, but there were a number of details to it that were just baffling. First, I still have zero understanding of when enemies shield and when they don't. The fact that they seem to put up a shield when I KILL them rather than when I'm fighting them makes zero sense, as does the rules for when they revive. Is it on a timer? Is it when I get more than a certain distance away? I even encountered an enemy that chases me constantly with a shield up that never goes down until I get hit by it--that simply felt like a glitch, because I couldn't figure out any other way to deal with that enemy, which was a jarring break in the flow of the game. Perhaps the most needlessly frustrating enemies were the invincible missile-launchers that constantly fire persistent but destructible homing missiles. Why, of all enemies, would THIS be the one that I cannot destroy--the one enemy that I don't have the option of outmaneuvering and escaping? The enemy that, uniquely, can attack me from behind if I try to outrun it? In a game all about speed and agility, having an enemy that would EVER force me to stop, turn around, and shoot down an incoming missile seems like a mismatch. Really, the enemies are mostly fine, there were a few that made me question how much thought went into their design.\n\nPerhaps the biggest frustration: why are there limited retries? I understand that If I were actually good at this game, I wouldn't need any retries at all, but I'm not, so I'm perfectly happy just trying to finish the level AT ALL and collect my D-rating. They were smart to include both static and custom checkpoints, AND a one-button instantaneous reset (which is great, and I think it should be standard to the genre) but a limited retry system on top of that serves no purpose but to frustrate the players that need retries the most. And then, paradoxically, the reward you get for getting high ratings on levels is... more retries! Does it make much sense that I only get more retries by proving I DON'T need them?\n\nLastly--and this is a minor quibble--while I found the little story wrapper that they came up with compelling, the monologues between levels had a little TOO much navel-gazing for my tastes. I always appreciate having a bit of narrative to chew on, but they might have been better served by going for something a little more understated.\n\nUltimately, I do respect this game for the love that went into making it, but because of its unusually unforgiving systems and somewhat scatterbrained design, I can't recommend it to anyone but diehard precision-platforming fans.","June 22, 2014","false","1.5"," 192 of 268 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","192","268","0","5"

Most people will liken it to either Mirror's Edge or a Sonic game, which are both appropriate, but for some reason this game to me feels exactly like a 3D Megaman X game should.  The atmosphere, soundtrack, and moveset all work well (for the most part) and make a very compelling product.\n\nOrdinarily, I strongly prefer using a gamepad to play action games like this.  However, at the time of this review, Cloudbuilt doesn't have full controller support.  The team says they're working on it, but honestly I think it may be for the better that it doesn't support gamepads yet.  The level design is heavily dependent on the user's ability to control the camera quickly and precisely while jumping, and I could see a bad gamepad interface design making the already brutal difficulty level of the game even worse.  Better that they take their time to make the feature perfect.\n\nSpeaking of the level design, as I say above, the levels are extremely difficult.  This is definitely a speedrunner's game, with the goal of each stage being to get from the start of the level to the end as fast as possible.  However, the levels provide many ways around obstacles, and clever players should be able to find still more ways to get through.  In the fairly rare instances where there is only one path forward, the game unfortunately makes that path unnecessarily punishing with enemy/obstacle placement that usually means instant death if you make any mistake.\n\nThe game also makes some weird design choices.  You have a limited number of lives for doing stages (if you run out you have to restart the stage from the beginning instead of checkpoint), which is unusual in modern games of this ilk.  But what's weirder to me is that you increase this limit by completing stages with good rankings.  Basically, the way to get more lives is to not need them.  Enemies take a lot of effort to kill in this game (some are indestructible, and others have shields), but can often be disabled fairly easily once you know the trick.  The point here seems to encourage the user to find other ways past the enemies, but when the game throws several of them at you it can be very difficult to figure out how to proceed, especially after a checkpoint where losing a life may mean having to redo the first part of the stage.","March 22, 2014","true","13.2"," 47 of 58 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","47","58","0","0"

That being said, I’m completely in love with Cloudbuilt. This game is gorgeous, has fantastic level design and the soundtrack is one of my absolute favorites. On the surface, it may be a niche game for speedrunners, but there’s more to it – if you’re up for the challenge.\n\nCloudbuilt gives you all the tools you need from the start, and promptly kicks you out the door letting you figure out how you’re going to use them. It has a steep learning curve you will certainly smash into face first pretty early on – it can be frustrating, but is still manageable. There are countless paths to take, there’s no time limit, and you don’t need to do anything more than to complete a level to progress. After completing a level for the first time, various game modes are also unlocked that make some fun, or in some cases more challenging, alterations to the gameplay. I think they also encourage players to learn more of the mechanics, like conserving energy (rather than recording your time, it tracks your energy consumption – as someone who enjoys puzzles, this is probably my favorite mode), and finding other routes or ways to deal with enemies. Or, if you’d rather just zoom through the level with nearly unlimited energy, there’s a mode for that too. A story develops along each branch that seems to be pretty hit or miss with most people, but I thought it was a really great way to tie everything together.\n\nOutside the game, there’s a level editor, and small, but absolutely fantastic community. A number of players (including many of the top players and some of the developers) still frequent the forums and subreddit who are more than happy to chat about the game and provide tips, tricks, or even just some encouragement.\n\nThis game is fast paced, but has elements that may appeal to those with an interest in puzzles and exploring as well. I’d recommend it to anyone looking for a 3D action platformer who’s ready to test their mettle.\n","November 28, 2015","true","246.0"," 27 of 27 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","27","27","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/262390/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Attempting to learn Cloudbuilt is like scaling the face of a cliff with your bare hands. It offers no assistance, no guidance, and relentlessly beats you down to where the game can begin to feel almost hostile. There’s so much going on within a given level moving so fast and incomprehensibly, that getting your bearings can seem an impossible task in a game designed for a higher class of player. But Cloudbuilt’s most apparent problem is also one that’s almost entirely frontloaded, and once I made it over that wall and could peer over the whole of the game, Cloudbuilt evolved into one of the most endlessly satisfying and expanding games I’ve played in a very long time.\n\nThe controls that felt initially clunky began to showcase their ingenuity, inputs feeling natural and smooth as I chained moves together in a blur of animation. I stopped having to even consider which buttons I’d press and when, merging with my character to where her actions became an extension of myself. That’s not to say I no longer slip up, but those mistakes are now fully my own carelessness rather than the fumbling of button presses. And when I do land that perfect run, the feeling is incredible.\n\nCloudbuilt gives you such a control over your character that the act of pulling an insane jump or sequence of wall runs is that much more of a personal accomplishment. I was never coddled or helped along, which caused the first few hours to be a gauntlet of painful ineptitude, but once I grew past that point every success was entirely the result of my own skills versus the game giving me a helping hand. It’s a distinction that makes even just a basic series of jumps gratifying, each movement feeling intensely connected to my own input. Cloudbuilt is addictive not because of a daily grind or manipulative elements of its design, but purely how amazing it feels to do well at it. I’m not sure I could name another game that has given me such an intoxicating sense of satisfaction, calling me back even after I’ve played through every level because I just can’t get enough.\n\nA lot of that is definitely owed to the wondrously and intentionally exploitable level designs. Though there have been games designed around freerunning before, Cloudbuilt is the first I’ve played that embodies its focus on experimentation and versatility. Levels are designed for the express purpose of speedrunning with a speedrunner’s mindset. Branching paths extend in every direction, directly incorporating the sort of impossible shortcuts and unorthodox approach to levels speedrunning is built upon. I wanted to replay levels because I knew there was always some way through I hadn’t tried; some faster run yet to be discovered, providing with it a glimpse at how enjoyable speedrunning can be without requiring I break the game or even be very good at it.\n\nEverything in Cloudbuilt has such a sense of purpose, of perfect connectedness and intelligence. Your moveset and the levels you use it within compliment and expand upon each other. Small aesthetical touches like the colors of objects and enemies lend a great amount of readability to level designs, converging for the point of ensuring you’re forced to slow down as little as possible. The only thing Cloudbuilt does poorly is teaching you how to read a level and use the tools it gives you. It’s a challenging game to begin with, and requiring players largely figure it out on their own means many will likely give up early on before they arrive at the point of clarity several hours in.\n\nThat moment of comprehension never does arrive for the narrative unfortunately, regardless of how long you spend analysing it. Its method of delivery, that being narration after completing a level, is bland and exists in a space that almost begs to be skipped over, written in a style that’s verbose and crudely philosophical. There are themes worth discussing here, like the military’s abuse of its soldiers and the moral implications of experimenting on an comatose patient even if for the purpose of saving them, but they’re overwhelmed by wordy introspection that always seems to circle around and arrive at no conclusion. Perhaps it’s accurate for a character effectively trapped within their own head, but it’s no less difficult to digest and seemingly unconcerned with whether you pay any attention to it or not as it rambles on.\n\nCloudbuilt is one of the most remarkable games I’ve played in years. It’s also one of the most difficult to appreciate without committing yourself to a great deal of hardships. I wouldn’t be the least surprised if they proved too much for some players, but they’re troubles that exist all but entirely within the first few hours of play, standing as a barrier to an otherwise astoundingly intelligent and enjoyable game. I’ve yet to have a session of Cloudbuilt where I didn’t come away having discovered a new layer to its design or be even more interested in coming back again. Arriving at that point was unquestionably brutal, but having gotten to the other side of Cloudbuilt hurdle of comprehensibility, I’m extremely glad I stuck around to see it.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","March 31, 2015","true","11.1"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","26","28","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cucumbericepepsi/recommended/262390/","cucumbericepepsi","telos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cucumbericepepsi/","669 products in account","Let me preface this review by saying I don't think Cloudbuilt is a bad game. Unfortunately Valve only allows "Recommended" or "Not Recommended" on their review ratings. Admittedly it's better than when they only allowed thumbs up at least. But unfortunately on games I have mixed feelings on I cannot recommend them to my friends or otherwise.\n\nAnyway, Cloudbuilt is an extremely niche game clearly built for an audience and one audience alone; speedrunners. While that focus helped make it carve out a unique character to its gameplay, its sole emphasis on that has harmed it overall for other players of the game. A lot of the levels feel like they absolutely require memorization in order to do fluidly. The controls are kind of poor as well; with more attention they would have been much, much better. Again, despite the paragraphs below complaining about flaws, I don't feel that this is a bad game. When you're not dealing with issues the game is fast-paced, challenging and extremely fun, playing much like you see in the trailer.\n\nSince the controls are my main problem with the game I'll go over these first. The controls do work, but they FEEL clunky. At least part of this is the length of the game to learning curve ratio. The game is only about 2 hours long to the end, and you can beat most of the side missions in 3 hours. Much of that time the player will likely getting used to little nuances with the controls that are not immediately obvious from the tutorial though, like figuring out that you can air control like in a 2004 game where back instantly stops you. Mixed in is some legitimate clunk too. An example: One of the gifs on the community page right now is the triple slide section from one of the more difficult levels. There is a similar section on another level that ends with you hitting a vertical wall, boosting up the top, wallrunning along the side, then up and around again all the way to the exit. The player only gets a limited amount of boost to do maneuvers like that so losing as little momentum and using the minimal amount of energy is the key to success. Unfortunately the input from the jump off the last slide to the wall is extremely unforgiving. Why? There is no slack at all in the controls. If you hit the boost button even a split second before you've made firm contact with the wall, you will instead boost into it, which will result in you smacking into it, flipping around, then sliding off to your death. In the end what you have to do is rely on visual confirmation that you're in the correct pose before you can boost up which is inefficient and waste momentum/energy. This is really the number one issue with the controls. They already have a pretty decent learning curve in proportion to the length of the game, but this one mostly likely everyone will struggle with on and on because it feels very unnatural and unconventional compared to most games.  It's funny because the game has 4 or 5 checkboxes under gameplay options for changing the behavior of how wallruns work, but none to deal with this issue. The fact that those options they put in are even needed should be a red flag right there that wallruns should either be fixed or redesigned.\n\nThe other big problem with this game is level design. Memorization is required in several places, period. You are not getting past certain parts on your first try. Stuff like running through a bunch of explosions only to find a force field you need to charge shot, going through a long wallrunning section only to find a force field in your face are quite common later on.  The number of times I did a wallclimb only to be smacked by an obstacle was rather enormous. Reflexes can't deal with these things and a lot of the times you have to already know what you're going to do before you do it. There's also a particular chaser enemy that has a force field and will blow up in your face, usually knocking you to your death. Just to give you more time pressure when you already don't know where to go, of course. Things like this are okay on paper but when it comes to playing through a level the first time it is incredibly obnoxious and frustrating. Part of the issue is the pink forcefield things can at times be extremely difficult to see in the air.\n\nOn the subject of enemies, I'm not really sure they really add much value to the game at all. In my opinion a lot of the fun vanished as more and more enemies were added to the levels. Only the new/bad players will be affected by the homing missile guys, the regular turrets are worthless, the melee shocker guys on the paths and the wide shooting turrets are the only real threats. Those two have a point in being in the others notsomuch. Eventually the stages start to get chock full of them and they get a bit tedious to avoid. And you have to avoid them because you have a lifebar, which is another thing that puzzles me. You have a lifebar and limited lives. You'd think the main purpose of the enemies would be just to knock you off but apparently not. And lives... fail enough and restart the level... I'd generally only get stuck on one spot on most levels so this just makes it if you get stuck too long there you have to redo the whole thing. I don't see why there are lives other than the simply fact that video games have lives and thus this game needs them too. I mean, Super Meat Boy didn't have lives...\n\nEven with these issues the game generally works and is overall quite a fun experience if you're good enough to play it. I'm not usually a terrible fan of celshading but the game does it well enough and the music fits. Again though, it's clearly targeted at speedrunning and speedrunning alone; it took about two hours for a pleb like me to beat the game and a bunch of the side stages if that's all you're interested in. But in the process of beating it I got maybe one B and the rest were Cs or Ds. If you're the kind of person that likes to get S ranks on everything, this game is probably for you. Of course it ain't easy; said Cs were also around rank 500 on the scoreboard for many of my runs. Game is interesting, but it just needed better execution. Looks like the developers aren't going to be making any sweeping changes at this point, so I'm hoping if they make a sequel it addresses the issues I had with the game.","March 1, 2015","false","5.4"," 62 of 94 people (66%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","66","62","94","6","14"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/262390/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Cloudbuilt is a mix of platforming and free running by way of running along sides of walls and big jumps and moves. Fast paced when you get real good. Though the player will know that they are in for some major challenge with this game when the tutorial is even tough to get through without screwing up a move. Don’t read that as a negative, because after all don’t many gamers want a game to last and give them some challenge?\nIf you’re looking for some challenge then you are coming to the right place. Cloudbuilt offers a strange world many levels high above the clouds where a missed move will send the players character plummeting into oblivion.With a pleasing cell shaded style of art the game is easy on the eyes.\nJumping right into the game settings, there is not too much you can play with but there are a few things that are very useful for this game. There is a field of view setting so you can see more of the world, when it comes to the free flowing, sometimes fast paced action while you’re running , jumping and trying your hardest not to fall, the field of view is your friend.\nThere is mouse sensitivity, and you can even tweak it so you can make the X and Y just the way you want them.  You can even invert the different X and Y axis if you are one of those players that must do that for the controls to make sense for you.  There are other control and controller options available as well. Along with this there is of course the standard graphics setting and draw distances, so depending on your system you can crank up the resolution and really have some wonderfully eye catching graphics.\nThe story is simple and straight forward. The main character is in hospital in a coma. She has found a way to move past her body and project herself into other places in a mental mind energy version of herself. One can venture to say the levels are a metaphor for her broken body and mind, and some part of her is laboring to bring herself and her body back from this coma.\nThe gameplay as noted can be very challenging, in fact if you’re a gamer that gets easily frustrated due to having to try several times to get past certain obstacles, you may not want to step into these virtual shoes. On the other hand if you just love that feeling of accomplishment of getting past particularly difficult jump and run sequences, then you are going to love Cloudbuilt.\nThe character you control is very nimble so timing and getting a feel for just how fast you’re on screen self reacts to your presses and mouse moves is a must for success. Because there are times when you have to be extremely precise in the moves to advance. Some of the dastardly created obstacles and sequences seem to be darn impossible if not for our on screen character abilities and a special power suit that enhances her already impressive moves.\nThe power suit does have limited energy so knowing or deciding on just when to use this valuable resource is up to you as the player and there are plenty of places that the suit saves you from having to start the area over again.\nBelieve me you do not want to have to start over again. This is one of those games that the checkpoints are very far apart.So when you fail and have to start over at a check point, well you have a lot of the game to go through again. On the flip side, you should get very good at it from all the practice you will be getting. Cloudbuilt offers some interesting platforming, giving us a simple old school presentation to push the story along.\nCloudbuilt succeeds remarkably in proving that how a game feels and what you do within it can tell stories all on their own. The monologues contextualise the gameplay, and knowing that Demi is pushing through her own recovery maps cleanly onto the difficult jumps, complicated wall-runs and well-placed shots. Cloudbuilt is a game in which you'll die a lot, and that's not an accident. Demi's progress is slow and painful. Yours will be too, but that in itself carries meaning. Sometimes the quiet, narrow victories are the most meaningful.","July 13, 2014","true","7.5"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","24","30","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chronomasterk/recommended/262390/","chronomasterk","chrono","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chronomasterk/","689 products in account","Despite the rocky launch and some questionable design decisions, Cloudbuilt is a fun and visceral 3D platformer with the right mix of challenging, thoughtful, and perhaps just a little bit too much unforgiving.\n\nCloudbuilt is primarily focused on the path from point A to B. You have many special abilities common to speedrunning platformers that you'd expect: a dash, double jump, wallrunning, all limited by a central boost bar that only replenishes when you're flat on the ground. The controls are very tight and responsive, and sometimes this results in touchy controls that burn precious boost in unskilled hands. In addition, there are the regular cadre of hazards like indestructible mines and projectile spewing enemies blocking your forward motion. There are many paths through a stage, many ways to avoid hazards, many things to see and find. Cloudbuilt certainly hits the mark on the core platforming experience.\n\nMy major gripe against the game sits with the enemies, however. Thankfully less annoying in behavior and strength than before, oftentimes their existence thwarts your main method of dealing with the threat: your gun. Most enemies will survive rapid fire from your woefully limited clip, requiring you to charge your fire beforehand. Why the gun doesn't automatically charge during any downtime escapes me, because there's no penalty to charging a shot, and no reason to resort to weaker bullets. Your best strategy is, at all times, to just dig your finger into the mouse button whenever you're not firing, which is a really weird mechanic to be sure. On the enemies themselves, many of them have a repair shield mechanic that goes up if you didn't outright kill them on the first few shots, it's not immediately clear that this shield deactivates the enemy, and some of these can be eternal threats through the rest of the stage if you let them heal back up. Having enemies that can shoot you from clear across the map is distracting in this kind of game, but thankfully only a scattering of levels are prone to this kind of abuse.\n\nThe environmental design is fairly nice. You have a good mix of organic, ruins-like areas, more mirror-like utopian areas and oppressive areas full of wire and colored lights. It would have been nice to have a few levels with an actual solid ground, though this would have gone against the namesake. Sometimes the path to the end of the level is far out of sight, but the maps are designed well enough to spur you in the right direction. The stencil shading does accent the terrain pretty well and highlights the ground edges, but doesn't look as good on the main character's model. The sound is just functional, and nothing spectacular. The music tracks are catchy, for the most part. The story isn't my cup of tea, and isn't as well woven as it could have been.\n\nI'd recommend the game to anyone looking for a challenging platformer. For anyone who would be just on the edge of the skill range necessary to play this game, but is willing to brave it, be sure to play through all the first levels. Though it may have changed from my experience, the different paths on the map vary in difficulty and game concepts presented. At least one path is oriented more towards a pure platforming experience, with few to no enemies, and is the recommended path to take at first.","October 28, 2014","true","6.2"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","3"

It sounds simple, but this where the game gets interesting:\nUnlike many platformers, there are no fix routes how you want to finish the level. It's all up to you how you navigate through the obstacles and enemies in order to get to the end.\nThe tools that help you, are your rocket boosters (jump/wallrunning etc.), and laser gun.\n\nCloudbuilt requires plenty of practise, but with time and patience, every level can be beaten, and it feels really good to see your way through to the finish-line after countless attempts. :)\n\nPROS:\n- Fluid and very responsive controls. (Except for the tutorial.)\n- Hard levels, but they never feel "too cheap or lame", and completing a level feels extremely satisfying.\n- Plenty of room for experimenting, till you find YOUR best route to finish a stage.\n- Amazing soundtrack.\n\nCONS:\n- The tutorial could be a turn-off for many people.

You are going to fail -- ALOT.  You are going to give it all you got into getting the best possible score, and when you think you couldn't have done the level better than you just did, you will rewarded with a measly C-Rank. I went for a long time thinking the highest rank in the game was an A-Rank and was rewarded only to the gods of the boost: Oh, how naive I once was.  The clunky controls are described simply by the fact that, yes, you have to boost AFTER you touch the wall or you're going to boost into the wall instead. To the people who complain over the fact that you have to press buttons at the right times or it's not going to work the way you intended, all I have to say is: Git gud.\n\nReally, don't overlook the game simply because someone got frustrated by the un-forgivingness of the game. This is truly a gem of a game you'll be hurting for missing out on.  It has amazing scenery and graphics that even had my high-performance PC hiccup at one point. It requires high levels of precision and proper use of your limited boost and firepower all at the same time as jumping precisely from wall to wall at just the right angle as well. It's a very difficult game, harder than Dark Souls, which gets such high levels of praise for being just that. I put this game off for so long because of all the poor reviews I saw for it even though it looked good and I'm sad I had. After finally giving this game a chance I found an unforgettable experience that I come back to time and time again and will always remember as the best and most difficult free-pathed speed-running game I've ever played in my life!\n\nTo address another complaint I read; Is this game for everybody? No. But why are you trying to criticize a game for not being for everybody if it clearly advertises itself as a high-precision speed-run game?\n\nOne of my favorite games, may even consider ranking it one of my Top-Ten of all time! 5/5","April 13, 2015","true","2.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","11","13","3","2"

All of the promotional videos, trailers, and descriptions focused heavily on the fact that you have a set of basic controls---jump, dash, boost, fire weapon---and that all of these controls always work and always behave consistently. It's a bizarre selling point, at least to players of a certain age, because this is like advertising that your game is made of a series of levels.\n\nIt's only upon a bit of reflection that I realize that the last real 3D platformer I played where input *wasn't* wildly contextual was Super Mario 64, published nearly 20 years ago. Unlike Super Mario 64, it runs at Sonic the Hedgehog speeds and has focused map goals. Instead of a big world for each level and multiple goals hidden within it, you instead have a race to the finish line in a map that admits many paths through. And like Super Mario 64, high-level speedrun play looks like someone breaking the game in half, rather than someone perfectly executing a difficult routine. Even at my much more modest levels of play, I would struggle with a difficult climb or battle and then find that I could boost directly to the roof or wallrun outside of the building entirely and proceed without fighting my opponents.\n\nIt's been the 2D platformers that are about mastering a set of core mechanics and applying them to the level design with mayhem in mind. Cloudbuilt is the first 3D platformer I've seen that truly rises to that challenge and meets it.

You need to run up walls, make all kinds of insane jumps, and otherwise assert your dominance over gravity while avoiding/destroying a multitude of enemy drones, laser turrets, and other hostiles. Each stage opens by slowly scrolling over the length of the map, giving you a nice view of all the ridiculous obstacles that are lined up to crush your soul. If you listen really closely, you can almost hear the game smack-talking you.\n\nFortunately, once you get into it, the game isn’t quite as ludicrously impossible as it looks. You run, you jump, you boost, and you shoot, that’s all there is to it and the controls handle about as smoothly as one could hope given the angles and acrobatics involved. The initial tutorial level somehow makes it all seem reasonably sane and manageable before turning you loose on an increasingly difficult series of challenges. After putting in nine hours I’ve cleared several stages with solid D grades, and I even managed a couple of Cs and Bs, all despite the game constantly reminding me just how badly I suck.\n\nAll that crazy running, jumping, boosting, and shooting actually plays pretty well and it makes for a fun game. The subtly cross-hatched pastel graphics are well suited to the surreal course architecture and the sound/music also helps set the scene. There’s a bit of a story with a bit of voice acting, just enough to give the game some context without getting it bogged down in disruptions or distractions.\n\nNeat game.

Don't believe for a second that this is just a Mirror's Edge clone. The story and scenery take a backseat to minimalist level design and breakneck speed. All you get are a few dozen floating platforms, usually filled to the brim with enemies, that you need to figure out how to traverse as quickly and safely as possible. It may look like it's very linear but if you look close enough, you can almost always find a better way to get to the next checkpoint. Although a lot of people have complained about the controls, I think this is due to user error more so than buggy movement. Initially I though it was a bit wonky, but after my second hour of play I had definitely improved and realized I was mashing the dash key. Cloudbuilt is certainly hard. I almost always get a D on level completion, but I still finish! If you have low self-esteem maybe try an easier game, but you definitely don't have to be a speed runner to get through the levels and have a good time doing so.","August 24, 2014","true","3.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It does have a high difficulty curve definitely showing in the later levels, but that doesn't stop me from loving this game at all. Thank you, developers. This game is an absolute treat for me.\n\nUpdate: Since beating this game, I can say I still love it. I believe everyone has a right to hate the redepolyment stage, though. Another cool thing is after having beat it, I am way better at the game. Every stage just feels easier now. That's a great feeling. The developers really know how to train your reflexes.\n\nAs far as the story goes. I like how you can branch off to any level path you want to get tad bits of her different emotions and thoughts.

It has high-speed freerunning, mixed with a boost-pack for double-jumping and high-speed boost, an amazing art style,  as well as simplistic combat. Everything about this game just shouts "Play me for a great time!", except one thing, the difficulty. I think it's okay for games to be hard, but in this game, there's no easy mode. Some people may consider that a plus, but for me, it's the only thing that detracts from it. I'm not great at shooters, making this game hellish just to complete some of these levels. In my opinion, there needs to be a no-enemies mode, or at least one for reduced difficulty via combat, to really allow you to have that fun and free experience. Speaking of free, this game allows so much freedom while playing, it's insane. I've only seen two spots where there's only one way to go through a part of a level, and it's just one small section, so it takes away nothing. The art style in this game fits perfectly, and the character model is actually really awesome. Another thing is management of your boost, as it depletes when you do things, like climb up a tall wall, double jump, or thrust forward. This adds to the difficulty, but unlike the hard combat, it works. This causes you to actually think and plan out your movement. It doesn't feel like it's the game's fault you lost ever, (except for those extremely aggravating enemies). Now, I like that the fighting part of the game is simplistic, as it doesn't take away from the feeling of fast-pace action. Another thing to note is the music. I probably haven't heard all the tracks, but the ones I have heard, sound great, and actually fit. Before I played the game I thought "I'll just mute the game music, and play my own in the background", as I so often do with games, but I found that the music in the game was so good, I didn't have to. Overall, I think that this game does everything better than any other game, except the difficulty. I'm not saying there can't be a hard mode, but I'm just saying there should be an easy mode and/or a no-enemy mode.","March 23, 2014","true","4.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Easy to learn that your controls consist of only a few buttons, really hard to master the glitchy game trying to recognize which type of movement you're trying to do. Wallrunning feels awkward and stiff, when trying to jump from wall to wall I feel like I'm a 1000 pound hippo and the goal of the first few maps are lost on me...\n\nThere seems only 1 way to really enjoy playing this game and that is by ignoring EVERYTHING and just focusing on reaching the end of a level.

The controls can be very frustrating, which are a little tough to learn are actually quite good until the game starts throwing it's real challenges at you, at which point you will wonder why your character went up, over or around instead of where they were supposed to go.  Also whoever decided to make certain enemies invincible is really not doing this game any favors.\n\nI'd grade this one about a C-, there is a ton of potential there and if you NEED a challenge this is the game for you, but not for me and not for a good majority of people (just look at the universal completion rates of the achievements if you doubt me).","August 10, 2014","false","2.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

It's fast pace and huge, mid air jumps high above clouds are something most other third person action-adventure games won't deliver. However, there might be reason why such things have been long ignored. Franctic pace requires good controls and very carefully designed levels. Things, that Cloudbuilt cannot deliver.\n\nControls would be tolerable, if it wasn't for sensitivity settings affecting to both analog sticks at the same time. Keyboard and mouse is better option, but i have hard time with WASD controls. Needless to mention how screwed up camera is. This is first time i must admit that it's good to have Field of View -slider hanging around. But levels still require you to constantly turn around like maniac, and camera controls are not up to the task. There is button that lets you turn around instantly, but it only works when running up the wall.\n\nThe game is supposed to be speedrunnable, but such thing is only accessible to best of the players. Trial and error -situations requires pure luck from players, unless they have precision that playing Cloudbuilt requires. Level can have ankwardly placed insta-kill hazards rigth before checkpoint, and enemies are nothing else but annoying extra level of challenge game doesn't really need. I apreciate numerous alternate paths, and there is some genuinely good platforming to be found, but overly-complicated, generic and confusing level layouts are still weakest point of the game.\n\nI do like cel-chaded visuals, but everything looks same everywhere. There is no landmarks helping you to memorize levels. The soundtrack is good, though, and "story", which really is more of a monologue explaining what is going on, is actually pretty interesting. But all those good things won't rescue Cloudbuilt from the fact, that i found the empty practice level most fun of them all.","January 24, 2015","false","3.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","7"

In a good way.\n\nNow for the longer review because I always need to explain my points.\n\nPros:\nGreat control of movements\nBeautiful graphics and amazing to look at\nGets addicting after a while\nYou only get better the more you play and get comfortable with it\nCons:\nDifficulty difference between levels is too much\nStory might be hard to follow for some\nNearly impossible to get new skins, unless accidentally\nPrice is pretty steep for anyone not knowing what it is, it may not attract people who may really like it\nI've watched this game for a while now, saving money to get it. "A speedrunner's dream". I adored this quote, and I was drawn in. The developers saying that whatever path we can find, we can use, no matter intended into the game or not. This blew my mind and I fell in love. I still love this game! I will continue to play it!\n\nThe difficulty is what is a downer for me right now. "Going from level 3 to level 4" for example would be like "switching between normal difficulty to legendary between missions" in Halo, or "turning up the difficulty from normal to expert" in Guitar Hero. It's insane, and there are new enemies that you have to learn how to fight and how to counter on the spot, and I believe I've run into some which cannot be killed and you just have to figure out how to run past it.\n\nIf there's any way to either nerf the difficulty progression, or maybe find some sort of guide to help me deal with the high difficulty progression, that would make this game much more addicting to play, and less frustrating.\n\nOverall, 9.5/10!

The levels are designed very well, giving multiple paths to take making each run feel as if you are in control and that your decisions are actually meaningful.\n\nThe story is a bit strange but well told. It's about a female who after fighting in a war, a mission went wrong, and she ended up being critically injured. The game is based within her subconcious (or mind) while she is recovering / being operated on which seems to be a number of "combat trials".  This is all told through short pauses of dialogue between each stage with no cutscene or animation, so it's more like the character telling you their thoughts.\n\nThe voice actor, and the way the story is presented reminds me a lot of how many Animes give females a often male role (like being in the military), and mix their story with a lot of emotion to bring out their mental state of mind. It makes the player feel a bit more sympathy for her then if it had been a male, and allows the player to connect with what she is going through.\n\nNegatives -\n-Many of the levels feel very similar to one another since the same basic assets are used for each stage.\n-"Combat" seems like a afterthought, and I feel like it's much more rewarding to just bypass the enemies then shoot them.\n-The graphic style is cel-shaded (like Borderlands), and although many people praise cel-shading as being "artistically beautiful" I find that it makes the textures / colors very "flat" or basic. Comic-Book / Cartoon look.\n-Difficulty curve - the game does get very difficult quickly which may pose as a threat to casual players.","June 29, 2014","true","2.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Cloudbuilt is not an easy game, but the sense of mastery you develop as you play is phenomenal. You will be challenged and taken aback at some points, and I mean that in the best way possible. The most memorable parts of the game are being presented with seemingly impossible odds, only to persevere through the use of critical thinking and fast reflexes. It's not often that I'd describe a game as cathartic, but Cloudbuilt definitely fits that description.\n\nThe story is unintrusive and cleverly woven into the gameplay - and I daresay the game as a whole. The narrative deals with the concept of building oneself through the protagonist's monologues about overcoming adversity. Levels serve as an abstract metaphor for the healing process as she comes to terms with her past, and prepares for the future. The gameplay is already evocative, but the fragments of story put everything into context and add to the experience.\n\nCloudbuilt is for anyone that enjoys 3D platforming and using their head. There is a large degree of creativity in how you choose to complete the game, and a focus on speedrunning for those who get really into it.","December 24, 2014","true","5.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are multiple routes laid out plain and nicely for you, and others you can cobble together using the double-jump and boost. The controls are consistent, albeit occasionally frustrating. A common complaint is the confusion of Demi's movement between horizontal wall-running and vertical wall-climbing, which I've found to be 100% controllable by the mouse. The combat is just varied enough to keep you interested in a firefight, bouncing off walls and double-jumping away from bullets and seeker-bombs. (And the latest DLC Defiance adds a whole new layer to combat in the Assault mode) It's almost guaranteed that the first time you pass a level you will use the stationary and portable checkpoints well and explore the lower half of your life cap, but the learning curve works with you in a way that allows you to keep progressing instead of being hung up on a single level. There are five branches to work off of if one level is getting you down. (Which, the enemies in some levels can get laptop-throwingly frustrating). The voice acting is one of my favorite parts-- between Demi's short exclamations when she runs out of energy and the actual voice logs between levels, the voice actor shows great talent. The story is pretty out there (though arguably insubstantial), with Demi's logs from the different branches reflecting her different interpretations. There are several game modes for each level, my favorite being "Pathfinder" where you have to find the route that uses the least amount of jetpack energy while taking all the time you need. The free DLC "Through the Fog" adds 5 more levels, with no enemies and about a billion different ways to go about a few of them. Exploration is greatly encouraged, especially when trying to optimize a speed-running route. The leaderboards will keep you striving to shave off just a few seconds more from your personal best until before you know it, you've got an S-rank.\nOverall, this is a beautifully designed game with well-polished mechanics and an aesthetic that stays with you. Fully worth $20. And if it's on sale, what are you waiting for??","December 3, 2014","true","54.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm a big fan of bright simple colors and textures and that is exactly what stands out the most in this game visual wise. I am a writer who writes poems, prose poetry, narratives, short stories, everything and I know a good story when I read/hear one. I have only played one and a half short levels of this game and so far I know the main plot of the story. The story is so unexpected and so incredibly simple and creates a reason why you are doing all this platforming and shooting and running crazily through these levels. Even If you are not good at it, it still feels good because there is that story driven reason to keep going. The voice actress is incredible. The only 'bad' thing I have found in the short time I have played is the controls can be a little figity at some points, but that is like a grain of sand compared to the desert of great things this game has.

The clever level design, tight controls and electronic/orchestral hybrid music are all excellent/enjoyable and make for a pleasantly challenging but fair game with a high skill ceiling. I wouldn`t call it an easy game but the fact that there`s usually multiple checkpoints scattered around each level and multiple ways to complete a level means that you can largely set your objectives according to your skill level as you gradually get better and discover the intricacies of the complex mechanics and each map`s layout/diverging paths. There is over 40 official levels and nearly all have multiple modes in which they can be completed (time trial, time trial with infinite energy, reach the end using the least energy possible) and there`s also community levels and a level editor with steam workshop integration. Improving your rank on the leaderboards and getting an A or S rank in each mode of a level will keep you busy for a long time if chasing highscores, character skins and achievements is your thing (I`m guessing minimum 20h-30h at this time if you just want to get an A rank once on everything). If this sounds like your cup of tea I would definitely recommend picking up Cloudbuilt for its engaging gameplay but if you`re looking more for a story or a game you can lazily cruise through you should probably look elsewhere.\n\n\nAdditional thoughts:\n\nWhen I purchased this game I was concerned that the performance as well as the jet pack and shooting mechanics would be finicky or difficult with my set up (I play on a multimedia laptop with a gtx 850m and a wireless mouse).  However, for the most part I`ve been extremely pleased, even impressed, with the performance on my laptop (I believe I`m getting 60fps on high) and the shooting+Jet pack controls feel consistent and usable even on a cramped laptop keyboard. The shooting at times breaks the speedrunning flow of the game but as I`ve gotten better I`ve found that you can often get by those sections by skipping the enemies and turrets. Also, the story, presented in short bits of monologue after completing a level, is not that well presented. It`s unfortunate because I like where the story was going but I just didn`t feel it was develloped properly or communicated well. However, all the story after the intro is skippable (thanks devs) so it doesn`t detract from the game but it doesn`t add much either. My only real complaint with the game is the checkpoint system since, as far as I know, I can`t disable checkpoints when going for a no-deaths run and when I die in a level and want to reset from 0 it doesn`t actually restart the level, it only restarts from the first checkpoint and removes one of my lives, adding a penalty to my score and making me need to "restart the level" using "l" each time I die before the second checkpoint or finishing the level. Overall, it`s a minor issue but it`s a small quality of life thing that I would like to see addressed in Coilworks` next game (also a replay system would be nice if you read this Gafgar or other devs).\n\nIf you read this far you should probably just buy it. It`s an excellent game, great value if you enjoy games like Super Meat Boy and Dustforce and I was not dissapointed with my purchase.","May 28","true","14.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The art.... I wanted to just pause and appreciate it. Damn tight controls so far just like the good 'ol days. I do hope for some controller support but that my not be a good idea I'm not sure. I use a ball mouse and that seems to be the ticket for the quick looking around this game needs. A thumb sticks may not be the best but I'd like to try.

One of the best ways to describe it would be a puzzle platformer - while the platforming is fast paced parkour, the puzzle comes from figuring out the best ways to get through a level. While it seems like the two are at odds with each other, it never feels like a problem that the game has, if anything increasing the enjoyment you get out of the game as you work out a path from beginning to end.\nThe movement is speedy and fluid, the level design non-linear and the combat, while marginally frustrating on the first run of a level, becomes based on twitch reaction once you start speed-running levels. The story is trash from what I've played, but that doesn't matter when you get a huge amount of satisfaction from finally nailing a level you've been praciticing.\n\nIf you enjoyed Mirror's Edge, the parkour in Titanfall or like the idea of a game that's built around fast paced parkour and quick reactions, then it's well worth picking Cloudbuilt up.","January 3, 2015","true","6.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","6"

The evocative mysterious theme music of the intro segment is just inspired. Some of the musical themes come back in different ways in later levels, it's all very well done. The music really enhances the open feel of this game and even if you get to the end of a level somehow the music makes you want to go back, curious to explore alternate (even speedier?!) paths, it's funny how the tunes help keep you calm despite the zillion mistakes when you're first trying to go very fast.\nYou can find the complete soundtrack at Jacob Lincke's page here:\n\nhttp://jacoblincke.bandcamp.com/album/cloudbuilt-complete-original-soundtrack\n\nThe levels initially seem to be the platforming-challenge variety (rather than exploration/adventure that the intro seemed to be leading to), but never mind... This game brings a whole new meaning to platforming, if I can even land on the platforms, that is... Even initially, it'll totally open your mind to what a 3D game can be. Then there's trying to go fast!\n\nThe "wallrunning" concept is a bit like what "Distance" is for cars, except with a jetpack and limited fuel. The occasional sounds of desperation from your incredibly brave triple-pigtailed little jetpack-toting pixie-girl make you very careful not to goof up. I'm not sure, but it sounds like some of my wild mouse-aiming attempts are making her nauseous, errp!\n\nLuckily, there's a practice area, which is really useful to understand the controls, as well as to find "undocumented" ways of jumping further. It takes a lot of practice to be able to do anything repeatably (the controls are somewhat "modal" and "context sensitive", sorry it's hard to explain, you've just got to try it). There may be some bugs remaining, e.g. when restarting a level or from a checkpoint, the game seems to ignore the first Jump command, but doesn't ignore other commands. You can try it: hit the spacebar just after restarting the level or from a checkpoint, and you'll notice that the first spacebar press is ignored.\n\nWhen running this game in nVidia Surround (it does work, and surprisingly well too), accessing the menus and levels using the keyboard doesn't seem to be implemented properly (yet, Dec 2014) but if you hook up an xbox controller then you can workaround this slight trouble by selecting the level you want to play using the xbox controller, then going back to using the keyboard to actually play the level.\n\nI tried using an xbox controller to play the game, and although it does work OK and is quite comfortable, I found that aiming using the right controller stick was just too confusing for me, so I went back to using the mouse and keyboard.\n\nOverall, this game has huge potential, and totally deserves more folks giving it a try. Get it in the Steam sale!\n\nI wish the exploration theme from the intro segment had been elaborated on a bit more, so as to lead in to a few simpler tutorial levels perhaps. It could have helped the game feel a little more "complete". The current somewhat-jarring transition to the "levels menu" (represented by Demi's bed) and "story menu" (represented by the computer terminal) seems a bit abrupt (these are the only options after entering the room). Admittedly, this game seems to be all about hardcore platforming (which is what we all love anyway) but it'd still be good to give newcomers less of a steep learning curve, perhaps in the Mirror's Edge way (where you can learn from another character demonstrating the more complicated moves), or some other approach? I guess if a level editor and steam workshop support is added, this kind of thing might be implemented by the community later on.\n\nThe developers of this game seem very responsive, and are even curious to learn more about their own game and how people are playing it, which is really fun and interesting.\n\nI noticed when re-trying the initial level over and over again (trying to do it quicker, as it looks a lot more fun when you're going like a bat out of hell) that sometimes if I goofup too many times it wouldn't let me continue the level (the prompt asked me if I wanted to "try another level?", but none of the other levels were available yet because I was just trying to redo a segment of the current level to make sense of the controls). I wasn't sure at first if that was intended, but apparently it is (also see Gafgar's explanation in the comments, thanks!). There's a limit to the number of retries, then you have to restart the level from the beginning. I suppose the intent is to make sure you really learn the level thoroughly, which is fine for folks with the platforming mindset but might be unexpectedly harsh for other gamers who are just curious. Apparently you're not generally supposed to use levels that way and should only use the practice area. But perhaps the game could make an exception for the first level (when the tutorial flag in the options is still enabled), as it seemed a bit intrusive to force the player to go right back to the very beginning of the level after too many retries, just when they're getting the hang of the controls.\n\nBut overall, this is a game I'll keep coming back to, at least as long as there are keys on my keyboard that still work...","December 28, 2014","true","18.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I will say though, that the game is mostly fair. If I fail, I know it's because I suck, not because it throws something at me that I couldn't possibly have seen coming.\n\nI have to say though, the satisfaction of finally completing a level is pretty damn good (although for me, just getting to the end is an achievement on most levels). So while it's difficult and frustrating for me, I still keep coming back, because apart from the difficulty, the game feels fantastic. Stylishly zooming my way through a ton of obstacles that destroyed me before, gives a huge feeling of satisfaction, and it's one I want to experience over and over again.\n\nTo sum it up, it feels great, looks great, has an amazing soundtrack (even if you don't want that game, you HAVE to check out the soundtrack) and controls fairly well (when you're not spamming the buttons in panic like I normally do).\n\nOverall, I don't regret getting it, and would recommend giving it a go if this seems like your thing.","July 7, 2014","true","15.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I really love the shader look and the level design in general. It looks very simple with blocks, walls and thin ground, but there was no need for more.\n\nMusic:\nWhen I first listened to the music, I was like "okay, that's nice", but at some point when I played a really difficult level I couldnt get the music out of my head. It reminded me of what I learned before, that I CAN beat this level.\n\nGameplay:\nI was slowly dragged into the world of Cloudbuilt. I actually could relax playing this game while dieing hundred of times due to my own stupid mistakes (and it was never because of poor level design or bad controls, my last fps was Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 1, yes 1, that's like 5 years ago). To be fair, if I think there is a slight chance to beat a level, I will try it!! <3 It felt fantastic after hours of playing the game.\n\nOtherGamemodes:\nI even sneaked into the other game modes, discouvered some levels, but I dont feel the need to complete everything there to get 100%.\n\nStory:\nYeah, I really didnt pay attention to the story. It felt 2 depressive/boring and I didnt want to read 4192 lines of dialogue. It was actually annoying ^^. Im playing a fast game, it was a nice contrast, but I played this game for its difficulty, not to hear a story ;P, even though the developer tried to say me something :D.\n\nPeople complaining about stuff, my reaction:\n"No infinite boost, I cant discover the map, game is bad" -> You dont need to discover the whole map to beat a level, thus you dont have to waste even more time on completing the level + There's actually a gamemode where you have infinite boost.\n"Controls are bad, my character isnt doing what I want" -> I rarely play first-person-games with a mouse and had no problems at all, if I wanted to go up a wall, I used my mouse to look up and if I wanted to go down... well guess what I did <3. Never had troubles here.\n"Music is annoying" -> Well, I guess you cant hit every players music taste, even though I never listen to this kind of music, after playing the game several hours, I felt it was really fitting the scenery.\n\ntldr; If you dont pay attention to stories and like fast games with some challenges, you should definitely get it! <3","November 25, 2014","true","17.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Lemur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nalgasdlemur/","949 products in account","I'm glad this game exists, and I enjoy the idea of playing it and even had fun with the early levels, but I ran into a wall trying to make any progress later on. The movement and speed feel good, and finding high risk/reward paths through levels vs. slow and clumsy routes that do ultimately get you to the end but take several times longer is satisfying.\n\nHaving a finite number of lives before you have to start over from the beginning is aggravating, especially because the only way to increase the number of lives you start each level with is by getting a higher rank on the levels you've beaten, and if you're good enough to get an A or S rank on one level, you're probably good enough to not need that many extra lives on the next. I would be much more willing to spend as much time and as many lives starting over from whichever checkpoint(s) and accept that my time (including the penalty per death) is complete garbage if it would make it less painful to learn the later parts of the levels without having to put up with the early parts repeatedly.\n\nI also found the levels with no enemies and only platforming skill-based challenges to be more interesting/satisfying. The enemies are not necessarily a huge problem in a level you already know, but trying to find a path through 3D space when you're being assaulted by infinitely-respawning, nearly-indestructible robo-nonsense is kind of a load of crap, especially when you spawn right next to them. It makes trying to find alternate routes through levels frustrating, compared to the enemy-less levels where you can stop for a second or two to look around and see what might be possible.\n\nThose gripes aside, and my own incompetence at the game (my reflexes aren't what they used to be), it's rewarding when everything comes together and you really nail something you kept screwing up. It's hard, especially later in the game, and you will screw up a lot, but when you get a feel for it you can do some truly crazy things, and it all flows from one high speed move to the next.\n\nAlso, the launch trailer (the one they used on Steam) is junk and doesn't give as good a sense of what the game is really like as the original three-minute gameplay trailer did. Go look that one up instead.","November 10, 2014","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I doubt I will play anything better this year, or perhaps even in years to come.\n\nFirst and foremost, this game grants the player absolute control over the character. The movement is fast and responsive, and the more you learn about the game, the better you can maneuver, to the point where you can do things you never would have thought possible at first. This sense of control is absolutely wonderful because I can apply both my reflexes and timing as well as my puzzle-solving skills to the level in front of me. The level design features branching paths that allow you to tackle the level many different ways, and give the player a sense of exploration. Will you go the easier and slower path, take more difficult shortcut, or will you look for the perfect jump to create your OWN shortcut? The game also allows you to place your own checkpoints, and unlike They Bleed Pixels, they actually mean it, meaning that you get to tackle the level before you on your own terms without compromising the difficulty.\n\nThe gameplay features some of the best movement mechanics I've ever employed in a videogame. Walljumping, boosting, sliding, shooting, and occasionally soaring my way to the finish feels exciting and fast. Finishing a complicated set of walljumps, or streaking past a group of enemies and eliminating them all without taking damage or even stopping is just so deliciously satisfying. This is a game that manages to feel cinematic not through cutscenes, quick-time events, or other gameplay interrupters, but through gameplay itself. Moving around makes you feel so stylish and powerful, and it's a genuine feeling because you must EARN it by being skilled.\n\nThe aesthetics are tremendously enjoyable. The music combines orchestra, electronic, and 16-bit styles to produce a sort of Megaman vibe which injects a superb sense of energy into the gameplay. The art style uses cross-hatching to create a very unique look, and it’s bursting with color and pleasing to the eye. The levels are suspended above gorgeous sunsets, starry nights, and stormclouds. The main character is reflective without taking it too far and becoming wishy-washy or weak, and while I was initially unsure exactly how to rate the voice acting, I came to really enjoy the small exclamations that the character would make during gameplay. That frustrated "Come on!" when she runs out of gas and starts to fall will always be memorable to me because it reflects exactly how I feel when this happens. This means that the designers successfully created empathy for the character through *gameplay*, which is a little piece of genius in and of itself.\n\nThis game is difficult, so much so that I fear a lot of reviewers actually disliked the game. But the difficulty is, in my opinion perfect, because of the gameplay's very real depth. This game slowly teaches you how to play it: a classic mark of masterful game design. It has a skill curve that arcs gracefully and makes you feel elated and rewarded for finally achieving the improvement that the later levels require of you. I would add that this game assumes that you are relatively good at videogames, so you may find it frustrating if you aren't up to the task. I've read complaints about controls and difficulty spikes, to which I would answer that if you feel the controls are imprecise, you probably haven't spent enough time with the game. It operates consistently, but certain mechanics need to be figured out through experimentation and are not revealed to you by the tutorial, such as understanding  when your character will attempt to run up a wall upon making contact with it and when she won't. With regards to difficulty spikes, everyone has their own meter, but at the end of the day, Cloubuilt gives you a system with which to earn more lives and give yourself more tries before the game over, meaning you can work your way up to the harder levels both mechanically and by naturally becoming more proficient at the game for your time spent playing it. It even gives you alternate gamemodes to go explore when you're tired of getting your butt kicked by the endgame levels.\n\nThe first path I went down turned out to be the most difficult, but I was able to throw myself at it tirelessly until I finally prevailed because I was emotionally invested in the scenario. The game provides you with a simple but well-written story in the form of the comatose reflections of the main character, which vary in their emotional trajectory, be they triumphant or traumatized, depending on which path you progress down. The levels are presented as figments created by the main character’s brain, and so conquering them became parallel to conquering the turmoil within. I was able to persevere and conquer Redeployment (the final level of one of the paths) because the game provided me with this goal of eliminating the doubt within the character's mind, which worked doubly well with the inherent rewarding nature of the gameplay itself. The best part is that I was able to later come back and S-rank the level due to how much I had learned. Though it was incredibly difficult, I have nothing but happy memories of my struggle and eventual success.\n\nIn a perfect world, every game would be designed according this philosophy. Cloudbuilt compliments the intelligence of the player by granting full control over where you go, how you get there, and exactly how many boosts and wallruns you want to use on the way; and also by rewarding you handsomely for your hard work. This control is different in context to, say, RPGs that let you make moral choices. This is a type of control where I feel that the range and depth of my gameplay options is both extensive and satisfying. The only issue I have is that I want more! I want to explore an entire world using these movement mechanics. I want to see what the world looks like beneath the clouds. I want to see the great war that the main character alludes to. I want a fifty-hour campaign with crazy boss fights and weapon upgrades! And most of all I want everyone in the world to play this videogame and enjoy it the way I have, understanding that *this* is what videogames are supposed to be like. 10 out of 10. Doesn’t get much better than this.","August 6, 2014","true","120.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Stylishly zooming my way through a ton of obstacles that destroyed me before, gives a huge feeling of satisfaction, and it's one I want to experience over and over again.\n\nTo sum it up, it feels great, looks great, has an amazing soundtrack (even if you don't want that game, you HAVE to check out the soundtrack) and controls fairly well (when you're not spamming the buttons in panic like I normally do).\n\nOverall, I don't regret getting it, and would recommend giving it a go if this seems like your thing.","July 7, 2014","true","15.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The evocative mysterious theme music of the intro segment is just inspired. Some of the musical themes come back in different ways in later levels, it's all very well done. The music really enhances the open feel of this game and even if you get to the end of a level somehow the music makes you want to go back, curious to explore alternate (even speedier?!) paths, it's funny how the tunes help keep you calm despite the zillion mistakes when you're first trying to go very fast.\nYou can find the complete soundtrack at Jacob Lincke's page here:\n\nhttp://jacoblincke.bandcamp.com/album/cloudbuilt-complete-original-soundtrack\n\nThe levels initially seem to be the platforming-challenge variety (rather than exploration/adventure that the intro seemed to be leading to), but never mind... This game brings a whole new meaning to platforming, if I can even land on the platforms, that is... Even initially, it'll totally open your mind to what a 3D game can be. Then there's trying to go fast!\n\nThe "wallrunning" concept is a bit like what "Distance" is for cars, except with a jetpack and limited fuel. The occasional sounds of desperation from your incredibly brave triple-pigtailed little jetpack-toting pixie-girl make you very careful not to goof up. I'm not sure, but it sounds like some of my wild mouse-aiming attempts are making her nauseous, errp!\n\nLuckily, there's a practice area, which is really useful to understand the controls, as well as to find "undocumented" ways of jumping further. It takes a lot of practice to be able to do anything repeatably (the controls are somewhat "modal" and "context sensitive", sorry it's hard to explain, you've just got to try it). There may be some bugs remaining, e.g. when restarting a level or from a checkpoint, the game seems to ignore the first Jump command, but doesn't ignore other commands. You can try it: hit the spacebar just after restarting the level or from a checkpoint, and you'll notice that the first spacebar press is ignored.\n\nWhen running this game in nVidia Surround (it does work, and surprisingly well too), accessing the menus and levels using the keyboard doesn't seem to be implemented properly (yet, Dec 2014) but if you hook up an xbox controller then you can workaround this slight trouble by selecting the level you want to play using the xbox controller, then going back to using the keyboard to actually play the level.\n\nI tried using an xbox controller to play the game, and although it does work OK and is quite comfortable, I found that aiming using the right controller stick was just too confusing for me, so I went back to using the mouse and keyboard.\n\nOverall, this game has huge potential, and totally deserves more folks giving it a try. Get it in the Steam sale!\n\nI wish the exploration theme from the intro segment had been elaborated on a bit more, so as to lead in to a few simpler tutorial levels perhaps. It could have helped the game feel a little more "complete". The current somewhat-jarring transition to the "levels menu" (represented by Demi's bed) and "story menu" (represented by the computer terminal) seems a bit abrupt (these are the only options after entering the room). Admittedly, this game seems to be all about hardcore platforming (which is what we all love anyway) but it'd still be good to give newcomers less of a steep learning curve, perhaps in the Mirror's Edge way (where you can learn from another character demonstrating the more complicated moves), or some other approach? I guess if a level editor and steam workshop support is added, this kind of thing might be implemented by the community later on.\n\nThe developers of this game seem very responsive, and are even curious to learn more about their own game and how people are playing it, which is really fun and interesting.\n\nI noticed when re-trying the initial level over and over again (trying to do it quicker, as it looks a lot more fun when you're going like a bat out of hell) that sometimes if I goofup too many times it wouldn't let me continue the level (the prompt asked me if I wanted to "try another level?", but none of the other levels were available yet because I was just trying to redo a segment of the current level to make sense of the controls). I wasn't sure at first if that was intended, but apparently it is (also see Gafgar's explanation in the comments, thanks!). There's a limit to the number of retries, then you have to restart the level from the beginning. I suppose the intent is to make sure you really learn the level thoroughly, which is fine for folks with the platforming mindset but might be unexpectedly harsh for other gamers who are just curious. Apparently you're not generally supposed to use levels that way and should only use the practice area. But perhaps the game could make an exception for the first level (when the tutorial flag in the options is still enabled), as it seemed a bit intrusive to force the player to go right back to the very beginning of the level after too many retries, just when they're getting the hang of the controls.\n\nBut overall, this is a game I'll keep coming back to, at least as long as there are keys on my keyboard that still work...","December 28, 2014","true","18.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I like it better when I'm dared to make a thing "at all" rather than "better", I would have liked it more if the level design was pushing the player harder on their fuel. The turrets everywhere spice up the thing quite well, but the most memorable parts were still those that needed me to work out how not to fall without the boost, because I wouldn't have enough fuel to make it halfway to the other side.\nFortunately there's the "pathfinder" mode, that challenges not to use the boosters.

It is a 3D 3rd-person platformer with an emphasis on creative speedrunning.\n\nDuring first gameplay hours it might feel pretty rough because of how precise the controls are, having been designed for keyboard and mouse, but given enough time it will improve your 3D platforming skills in a way a lot of games don't.\n\nYou have different routes which to take to your goal, not many of them obvious, so exploration is rewarded. There are skill and techniques to learn and master beyond the basic controls. The first time you go through a level, you will do it slowly, methodically and will trip up here and there, perhaps just barely making it to the goal on your last life. Give a few hours of playing other levels, and when you come back, you will dash through the previously tough content like nobody's business. There is a nice high skill ceiling.\n\nAll the content takes around 10 hours perhaps to beat, but if you plan on only playing levels once, you will have a horrible time because many of the later levels are extremely nasty to players who haven't mastered basic skills and strategies to overcome obstacles. You will rip out your hair if you take on the last levels of a story branch too early.\n\nThese levels are meant to be played over and over again, and the things you learn during it will transfer to the rest of the game. You will say "Damn, I'm getting good at this" at some point, dashing through the air like nobody's business.\n\nThe game is gorgeous, it has an amazing soundtrack, and well worth your money if you're willing to learn its systems.

The game is very tough and relies on a trial and error type system ala hot line miami. However it forces you to restart regardless of any checkpoints after you run out of lives. I ♥♥♥♥ing hate this and it made me quit the game.\n\n2nd would be the limitations set by the boost bar. Its damn near impossible to tell if you have enough boost to pull off a jump or something you are trying to do and everything is tied into the same bar. Jumping, sprinting and boosting up walls are all limited to one boost bar. I dont think the game would have been "cheated" even if boosts where unlimited and you could only jump twice.\n\n3rd would be the dumb idea to add a shooting mechanic and enimies. I cant tell you how many times ♥♥♥♥ing rockets and mines ruined my game. It was a stupid idea and the game should have been focused on platforming not shooting.\n\nOther minor gripes are the level design, while visually apealing, left me often confused and wondering where the hell to go. Sometimes I felt like I was going in circles or backtracking. Also the story is uneeded and frankly boring. Between levels the game spouts vauge exposition at you that can easily be skiped without missing anything.\n\nThe soundtrack is very good and I do recommend buying that. In fact its easily worth more than the game is in my eyes. There is a new track for each stage and I loved all the ones I heard. Good job on that guys.\n\nThe platforming is very good and it feels amazing to pull off crazy moves when the game lets you.

The game is very tough and relies on a trial and error type system ala hot line miami. However it forces you to restart regardless of any checkpoints after you run out of lives. I ♥♥♥♥ing hate this and it made me quit the game.\n\n2nd would be the limitations set by the boost bar. Its damn near impossible to tell if you have enough boost to pull off a jump or something you are trying to do and everything is tied into the same bar. Jumping, sprinting and boosting up walls are all limited to one boost bar. I dont think the game would have been "cheated" even if boosts where unlimited and you could only jump twice.\n\n3rd would be the dumb idea to add a shooting mechanic and enimies. I cant tell you how many times ♥♥♥♥ing rockets and mines ruined my game. It was a stupid idea and the game should have been focused on platforming not shooting.\n\nOther minor gripes are the level design, while visually apealing, left me often confused and wondering where the hell to go. Sometimes I felt like I was going in circles or backtracking. Also the story is uneeded and frankly boring. Between levels the game spouts vauge exposition at you that can easily be skiped without missing anything.\n\nThe soundtrack is very good and I do recommend buying that. In fact its easily worth more than the game is in my eyes. There is a new track for each stage and I loved all the ones I heard. Good job on that guys.\n\nThe platforming is very good and it feels amazing to pull off crazy moves when the game lets you. Its just a shame the limits that were placed on the game along with the one button for everything control scheme ruined a potentially great game.","February 28, 2015","false","1.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","3"

Cloudbuilt is more like Mirror's Edge in that you have full controll over your characters movements, that means that you can do what you want, but it also mens you MUST DO all the work yourself, every jump, every turn, every shot and every dash is under your controll and yours alone.\nIt might be overwhelming at first, but you'll get the hand of it eventually and it'll feel awesome, that' why I don't say it as a bad thing at all. Plus, the ability to set the checkpoint locations yourself instead of having to go through the entire level again is awesome in this case because it let's you re-do things exactly from the part you missed.\n\nTo me, this game is the closest to what I imagine a 3D version of the Megaman X series could look like, because X7 was terrible, and X8 was barely acceptable. :P\n\nIf you like a speedy, highly dinamic game, with an intresting art-style that' not realistic but also not entirely cartoonish, and don't mind a bit of trial and error gameplay, this is the game for you.","June 29, 2014","true","2.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Hard. I haven't finished it fully yet myself. However, despite the frustration (and RSI), the game still had me coming back no matter how many times I died - which was a lot. The reason is probably the speed of respawn (two seconds at max - no Dark Souls loading screens here!) and the short levels, which can often be completed within 60 seconds, with the exception of some of the later levels.\n\nThe courses you run through are extremely well-designed and the multiple routes through each stage lend a lot to the feeling of freedom that the game exudes for me.\nI've heard a lot of people complain about cheap enemies and poor gunplay, but I disagree on that front. Every time I died, I felt that it was fair and reasonable and I feel that the gunplay is made much better if incorporated into the free-running that is the focus of the game - don't just stand still and shoot at enemies, it's the least fun way of dealing with them.\nThe game also has probably my favourite "lives" system in any game that I've played (although I still think that it would be better without one). Instead of gaining and losing lives and the value being constant across levels, you instead increase your life-cap by completing levels as quickly as possible and finding the life pickups in each level. The cap applies to every level, so you will always have the same number of lives at the start of each level - preventing you from losing six lives in one level and only having three during the next.\n\nMost people will probably completely disregard the story and just play for the fantastic level design and brilliant free-running jetpack mechanics, but I rather like it - it does a nice job of contextualising  the gameplay and the monologues that deliver it are pretty well voice-acted, if somewhat over-written.\n\nSpeaking of sound design, the soundtrack for this game is absolutely stellar. Jacob Linke, I salute you for your efforts.\n\nThe art style is pretty nice, too, even if three pigtails are probably too many. It just seems impractical.\n\nOverall: A well-playing, great-sounding and extremely fast-paced 3D platformer. While not for everyone - especially not those who hate dying over and over - but those who love a fair challenge, extreme speed and enjoy games like Super Meat Boy and N+ will find this game very enjoyable.","May 29, 2015","true","15.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

After you're beaten the storyline you can go for other storyline routes and eventually you can try to compete at the global leaderboards at various gamemodes ( that are available right away. I would recommend playing all the stages first).\n\nThis game has controller support so if you swing that way you can try to pass stages using controller. I tried, and actually managed to beat a single storyroute with controller. Then I tried the stantard controls with mouse + keyboard and instantly got better at the game. It is just that much better feeling. Maybe I'm just not fit to play with a controller. But I still recommend the keyboard for this game.\n\n+ The difficulty level is kicking in quite fast. Even the first level isn't that easy aven after couple of tries. Last levels require almost hours of retrying to get through. ( Redeployment, anyone? )\n\n+ OST is really kickass and fitting to the athmosphere.\n\n+ Graphics style is different, kind of a cartoonish. Reminds me of the Borderlands. Strong, black outlines. I can't really mark this as + or as - because it's so heavily debendant on what you like. I like it so in that sense it could be +.\n\n- The difficulty of this game can make some players to give up and quit. Or rage and break something. Also not a game i would buy to my 10y/o brother. He would probably do both of those.\n\n- The steam achievements are stupid hard. S rank on all maps on all modes?

The game's creators had a very specific vision in mind for this game and realized it incredibly well.\n\nThis is a beautiful game. It's challenging as hell and frequently unforgiving, but absolutely worth playing.","March 29, 2014","true","1.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It only took about 4 hours, but I can tell I'll be back for more. However, I’ll probably only play the opening 3/4ths of the levels in this game, because the entire last 4th of the game is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mess.\n\nLet's go over some of the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n-looks great and runs excellently\n-great electronic soundtrack that really adds to the ambience, great sound design and Demi (the MC) has good voice acting\n-gameplay is a hell of a lot of fun\n-level designs for the most part are a blast\n-concept is neat\n-Demi controls great, the sense of speed is perfect\n-satisfying gameplay that encourages replayability\nCons:\n-the gun\n-the enemies\n-later levels\n\n*Story:\nThe story, all in all, is actually pretty cool. You basically play as a military veteran of an unspecified country after a bomb has severely wounded her and her squad- you control her in her coma dreams as she grapples with her unfortunate situation. While the writing can be extremely ham-fisted at times, Demi has good enough voice acting that it's at least tolerable. That being said, what's most interesting are the multiple paths- as you progress through the game it splits off into different interpretations of Demi's injuries, resulting in 4 very distinct endings about how she has coped with the accident, which I found very cool. This story, while unnecessary, is a neat idea.\n\n*Gameplay:\nHere’s what you wanna buy this game for. Demi controls well, moves quick, and shoots guns fast. The moment to moment gameplay in Cloudbuilt is simply exhilarating, jumping and dashing through the variety of terrain. The jetpack, a refueling boost maneuver greatly increases tension in the game. It never quite feels like you have enough to make things safely, but you usually do, which provides excellent tension and incentivizes learning your momentum and your remaining gas. The level design incentivizes this blend of speed and percision, and it feels very rewarding to even *beat* a level. It feels really damn good to play Cloudbuilt, and I’ll definitely be coming back to mess around with Demi's kit.\n\n* Design:\nAnd here's where the game, frankly, ♥♥♥♥s it all up. Level designs from the initial 3/4ths of the game are great and challenging, encouraging fast, on the fly movement with split second reactions and timing due to a very prominent design choice of multiple branching paths through the level. Levels are designed well for these parts, filled with hazards and enemies to kill in large but fair numbers, allowing the player to skillfully dodge weapon fire. However, as the game progresses the open and branching levels become small and cramped, filled with annoying enemies with too much health and too much accuracy. The game goes from challenging but fair to infuriatingly and unnaturally hard, jamming the great pacing of the game to a halt as you have to learn patterns and memorize levels. However, to add to frustration, you have a life system, something of a cardinal sin in hard platformers, which, instead of adding tension instead adds further irritation. These last levels are boring and time consuming, and you'll soon be wishing for the open walls and platforms of the previous levels. Also, ♥♥♥♥ the enemies in this game man. They are incredibly irritating and add nothing to the challenge of the game properly, instead just introducing a terribly implemented shooting system with pathetically weak bullets and poor auto-aim, against powerful enemies with razor-sharp aim. At top speed you need the reaction time of freaking Neo from the Matrix to hit some of these things, and most take multiple hits, put up a shield, then heal to full health. Oh, did I mention your gun has limited ammo? Yeah, it has 5 shots then needs a reload. Moving, boosting and shooting at the same time is like trying to rub your head and pat your tummy at the same time. Its ridonkulous. This game would be so much better without combat, as it simply drags it down. Some of the mazelike level design can also let a player get lost, and without Mirrors Edge's great "LOOK WHERE YOU NEED TO GO" key, getting lost is easy as hell. It's hard to criticize a game for being difficult, as that was the intended nature of the game. But when something becomes difficult and changes what made earlier levels fun, then it becomes a big problem.\n\n*Presentation:\nOverall, the game looks and runs DAMN good. The crosshatch-shading art-style looks great and you can clearly define everything in the environment. The shading and lighting need special interest as they in particular look excellent. The games soundtrack is an energetic electronic piece, really keeping up the tempo during tough times. The game also runs great- I ran the game at max settings with a decent rig and it ran like butter, aside from some moments during the last level of one path (Redeployment) causing some slowdown from all the ♥♥♥♥ on screen.\n\nOverall:\nDespite the last levels sucking, Cloudbuilt is a hell of a lot of fun.  Despite the widest portion of this review complaining  about the toughness of the last few levels, they're not mandatory and are unconsequential. In the end, MOST of Cloudbuilt is great fun.

Though preview video states “Actual in-game graphics!” it fails to mention the footage is NOT ACTUAL GAMEPLAY. Do you enjoy repeatedly falling to untimely death? or being hatefully frustrated by games which you can’t stop playing? Players who enjoy exclaiming things like: "But I PRESSED the button!" after their umpteenth attempt definitely ought try Cloudbuilt. I can't in good conscience recommend Cloudbuilt to people I want to remain friends with, unless I know they are slightly masochistic in this regard (though there’s nothing wrong with that).\n\nThis is NOT an easy game! Cloudbuilt suffers badly from extremely clunky UI metaphors which increase the difficulty far past enjoyable levels. It wants your love, so much! But, it WILL hurt you to show Cloudbuilt the affection it deserves. The game grades your performance every level like an angry, disturbed schoolmistress. If you take the time to “find your way” you will be graded D minus. Presumably, Cloudbuilt’s developers will find their way to inform those with more control over your life than you of your poor standing on the leaderboards.\n\nClearly, since other players on YouTube are always and without fail (or the magic of video editing) able to make Cloudbuilt’s character run and jump like a jetpack-equipped lemur on speed--this is all to do with my terrible talents. Since nobody enjoys considering themselves a bad player, reading over the particular complaints in negative reviews before purchasing may have produced different results (Faidh: “frustrating to the bone because of glitchy controls” --why yes, that right there, what Faidh said!).\n\nWanting to enjoy playing Cloudbuilt is one of the few things lately capable of making me mutter "I hate you with every fiber of my being" before immediately resuming my task. Completely trapped and helpless like a rodent in a skinner box. Pushing “Restart Level” over and over until I’d burned through all the buyer’s satisfaction I’d gleaned from purchasing. Then the joy was gone, like a thief in the night, after mugging me for a single twenty. On the surface this game screams "Enjoy me! I have everything!” Slides, jumps, jetpack boosts, robot monsters, trip mines, pewpewpew, laser barriers, death gaps, leaps of faith, even strawberry jam health as well as an actual health bar. But player desire to zoom around having fun with all this is held very firmly in check by the desire to remain un-splattered over all parts of each level which don't involve staying alive.\n\nThe level overview maps in the global map/level selection menu bear extremely little resemblance to maps players spawn into. Often in the selection menu only the parts deemed relevant in these partial visual depictions levels is displayed. These are usually the shining high points of each levels’ design. When players run these well-cut jewels of the craft, the intent is to inspire a God-like feeling, as if player’s feet are shod with the glorious golden boots of Mercury the messenger himself. To get this feeling, players must first attempt, reattempt, then re-re-attempt unflinchingly difficult sections of each level. Many iterations through this attempt-reattempt sequence is necessary to be all you can be. However, who I am now doesn’t believe this kind of repetition is a credible aspect of enjoyable gaming. Competent players who’ve already fought in repetition trenches may be woefully unprepared to offer Cloudbuilt as much time as proficiency demands.\n\nHigh hopes for groundbreaking work in this genre are outweighed by roots hearkening back to Sonic The Hedgehog. To be so immediately dashed following a tutorial is a very hard down to earth landing for "a speedrunner's dream".  Character is made of glue, you're jumping, now sticking! Don't struggle or you'll... fall! To your death, exactly like that! Often times jumping onto a platform to ascend to, will ultimately finish UNDERNEATH said platform, then falling to untimely death. Perhaps you're just bad at this? Better schedule some practice time, then time for crying in the corner. Because this elementary frustration has backup!\n\nThe cell-shaded art and promise of Cloudbuilt reminds me somewhat of Jetset Radio Future, an enjoyable puzzle platforming game for the original XBox. The reduced graphics processing requirements of this low bandwidth texturing style keeps framerates exceptionally high. This is important, because it’s always a more positive to witness inevitable falls towards death at a fluid 100FPS. Developers often express that players’ subsequent admissions of defeat and screams of “Why?” are more poetic if their eyes have first feasted upon a sumptuous eye-candy feast rather than subsisted on low-bandwidth gruel. Some say their tears of despair taste all the sweeter for it, too.\n\nAlways-grab persistent sticky walls are essentially a deal-breaker, because this choice of gecko-metaphor is just not from my usual gaming ecology. Seemingly every time the character gets started with some speed, the stickiness kicks in. The belief inspired by the trailer is that players would be allowed to RUN, not just stop-start little sprints around tiny areas infested with enemies and mines, is yet to be realised. The enemies and traps aren't challenging in that they will prevent you from reaching your objective in a timely manner. They are challenging in that they will straight-up kill you. Often right out of the gate. Often until pure frustration causes a rage-quit error. It's not that they're individually particularly hard to negotiate ways around or kill, it’s there are just too many of them to breeze on by. Unless you can already collect all the rings in “Tails & Knuckles’ Unnecessary Adventure”, presumably.\n\nThe camera doesn't follow very well. This, and the controls working at least adequately well is largely critical to overall player enjoyment of puzzle platforming. Often times the camera will clip imprecisely through objects and ‘flick’ back to position, by which time players are falling to their deaths. By default, the camera does not readily offer a full view of the entire character, or much area around the character. For a third-person game this is regrettable. Of course, maxing the FOV (to 150degrees) results in extreme fishbowl effect, with not enough extra visibility to warrant the distortion. Maybe the experience would be improved with a control pad? Unfortunately this is Insufficiently supported. Using the in-game menu to bind actions to pad buttons does nothing, although pad analog sticks work for movement and freelook.\n\nOf plots, there is barely the vaguest hint. To spoil it completely, player character lies abed in hospital, the end result of wartime military cybernetics. In comatose dreams, players re-live the war environments which brought about this situation. Players can either skip or listen to voice acting of flash-back scripts after each level. Or call up each voice track on a terminal in the convalescence room, or... not. Players can choose to ignore the fertilising manure lovingly spread over the game's exposed roots like a gardeners afterthought. What started out with such promise of a possible story in the tutorial, smells the same either way and the beautiful flowers will bring the bees who will pollinate.\n\nSo far, Cloudbuilt’s best element is the unique score for each level. So at least while repeating the same run over and over, players can listen to astonishingly stirring music composed for the purpose! I understand why Cloudbuilt’s soundtrack is sold separately, though I’m currently too distressed by my experience of the game to pay for it also.","April 11, 2014","false","2.4"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","9"

I've come to the conclusion that with all the best of intentions, this game is terrible.\n\nHere's what this game gets completely wrong:\n\n1. Friction\n\nWhat Do I mean by Friction? How your character moves accross the game world. The character's normal movement is disturbingly fast, and it barely feels like the character has any real weight to her. Like she's gliding along like a drunk figureskater. She moves far too fast, especially when the platforms and foot-holds are rather small.\n\n2. Enemies and Hazards\n\nThere are turrets that can't be killed unless you unload two rounds of ammo into them, floor bots that can't even be stopped, homing missiles that will follow you all around a room. Couple this with difficult movement and narrow areas, and you're bound to get hit. When you get hit, especially in mid-air, you'll be catapulted off the level. This is also terrible when dealing with wall running.\n\nAll of these things and more likely will attack you from off screen or ambush you around the corner, and you'll barely notice them because of the way the game was designed.\n\n3. The boost\n\nThere was a level that I could never complete because of how poorly implemented the boost system was. Several instances of this game make me think "wow no one playtested these levels, only let the devs use some kind of automated tool to determine if a jump could be possibly made or something." Tall walls with boost re-fills laid about them are actually pointless, why not have infinite boost but only one air jump? This ended up having me miss a long ramp jump several times when in many instances I likely shouldn't have.\n\n4. Precision Controls\n\nThis once again goes back to friction. Some things can be solved with adjusting the mouse sensitivity. Also, this game is really meant to be 'played' with a keyboard and mouse. I've tried with game-pads. Avoid them. They function, but with the kind of tricks being asked of players at any point in the story, it's just not worth the headaches. Also, there's severe instances of dealing with how your character moves. Wall running doesn't work unless your mouse/view is aimed at certain angles, then you have to hold the jump button to keep your momentum, and boost to extend or run higher up or along a wall. You'll be flailing your mouse view constantly to make complex jumps that will often miss because so many actions are tied to one button. You'll end up jumping off of walls at the wrong time, the wrong angle, all while under fire from enemies you either can't see, or couldn't deal with in the first place.\n\n5. The Art Style\n\nWhile the Art Style is very nice to look at, that's all it's good for. Looking at. The cross-hatched shadows create an obnoxious amount of visual noise, and ultimately barely covers up the fact that the game has a near mono-tone pallete with bare-minimal contrast. This makes noticing enemies, many of which are either difficult or hard to kill in the first place, compound to the frustration. It's good to look at in still frame or for beauty shots, but anywhere else is just terrible.\n\n6. Audio\n\nI can't stand the voice actress, she's monotone, loud, and drones on and on when I just want to go fast. When I want to just skip everything you have to say and just read it in text, I feel something's wrong.\n\n---\n\nI cannot in all honesty recommend this game to anyone for any reason. This game isn't even worth it on sale.","June 29, 2014","false","2.1"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

Your character skips and snaps all over the place, with none of the smoothness of Assassin's Creed or the flow of Mirror's Edge.

This comparison is merely casual, however, as Coilworks have completely missed the mark on anything past the conceptual level. See, Cloudbuilt's protagonist lacks the well-tuned finesse that both Faith and Kelly have: she slips all about, lacking any feeling of weight in her movement and if it weren't for the auto ledge grab, even basic platforming would be hell. Wall-jumping and running also lack intuitiveness; sometimes the problem is simply tacking onto a wall, other times it's getting off of them! Oh, and the 180 degree turn? Doesn't work at all, at least on gamepad. Speaking of the gamepad, why on Earth does the d-pad not function in the menus? You may say it's nitpicking, but there's just no excuse for neglecting something that should be obvious in the year 2014.\n\nAnd good lord, I didn't even mention the enemy spawns and other obstacles scattered throughout each stage, many of which seemingly cannot be eliminated (why even have a gun in the first place, then?) and often kill in one hit. Given the control issues I've mentioned previously, trying to avoid much of what the game throws at you ultimately comes down to luck of the draw, creating a sense of artificial difficulty that ruins Cloudbuilt's otherwise solid level design which I can't even stop to admire for two seconds without getting blown off the screen by a mine or some other asinine object that could barely be seen in the first place.\n\nNow, to be fair, I'm sure that if played long enough, it's possible one might find themselves adapting around the plethora of issues present here, but personally? I don't have the patience for that sort of thing anymore, especially when there are other similar games to Cloudbuilt that don't suffer from any of these problems whatsoever.","May 25, 2014","false","2.3"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

I had played a game similar to this called deadcore and enjoyed it. Unfortunately this game makes a lot of different control and design choices that just end up making it worse. First off, there's no story, just a few random cryptic lines betwen each level you don't care about. The levels all look pretty similar, just floating stone blocks covered in weeds. The level design is also poor, as half the time you have no idea where to go, because everything looks the same and the levels aren't layed out filtering you one way or another, theyre just a bunch of floating blocks and walls.\n\nThe biggest problem is the actual platforming. First off, this game isn't like deadcore in many ways. You don't learn new abilities or anything, as levels get harder. This game has added constraints that just make it more frustrating and repeititve, and add nothing to the experience. The rocket boost, which wears out way too quickly, as you jump or dash. This means if you make a single mistake or mis-press, you die. If you don't angle it perfectly to collect the refills on long runs, you die. Many times I would double jump to get somwhere, then not have enough left to dash. Taking away my ability to think on my feet because I didn't set up for the perfect amount of boost is dumb. It takes away any adaptability. Also you will constantly think boosting while wall-running sends you forward, but it just sends you up or down. And if you run out you cant move on the wall, which is dumb.\n\nThen there's the controls. They are super finnicky. I would press jump and my guy would jsut sit there in the air and fall and die. Other times he woul;d jump off the wall instead of up it. Other times the jumps seemed to go barely anywhere at all. So many times I would do the same thing 5 times in a row, and it would work 2 times and not work 3. I usually didn't feel it was my fault. Then there's the checkpoints. There are barely any, and you can place some, but you barely get any to place and never know when you'll see one. And if you die, which is every time you make any mistake, you have to restart the level. Also there are limited lives, the dumbest thing I have ever seen in a game like this. This game you will die all the time, because you're floating in space, and any tiny mistake means your death. You will die dozens of times. But yet you only get like 8-10 lives per level before restarting the entire level.\n\nIt just all seems stupid to me. How inconsistent the controls are, the way boost doesn't recharge during jumps and you have to do everything or you run out too quickly and die. The poor checkpoint system, and the use of lives. All of it undermines how the game should be played. Go get deadcore instead of this dud.","October 25, 2015","false","8.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","8"

Use quick wits and quicker reflexes to carve your own path through the mysterious ruins of Cloudbuilt, floating high above the ground. Manipulate the laws of physics to avoid fatal hazards, dodge hostile robots and reach not just the end of each level, but the top of the global leaderboards too. Cloudbuilt is a third person hardcore parkour game created by Coilworks and published by Rising Star Games. Keep in mind while playing that this is Coilworks's first game, but that's far from being a bad thing. It is available on Steam for $19.99.\nCloudbuilt is fascinating in all the right places. Cloudbuilt demonstrates that there is still hope in beginning developers, which is hard to say, though it deserves every credit of success it recieves. It recreates how fun the parkour game genre used to be, and does well in that sense.\nThe gameplay of Cloudbuilt is quick and very unforgiving. Take one route and you may end up dead or falling through the infinite sky. Although it is very unforgiving, you cannot help but enjoy it. You will get frustrated at one point or another, but you decide to continue and try to beat the level.\nThe graphics of Cloudbuilt are definitely surprising. I have never seen this type of style in a game, so it was interesting to see how this worked. Its hard to describe exactly what the graphics are like, but you can see the pictures in the review and it may give you an idea of what they are like. They do work well with the game, although they could do with some work as I did feel very weird in some of the situtations/missions in the game because of the art.\nThe replayability is definitely there. The game is set up so you want to go back and get better at the levels you either couldn't do or where you just want to better your time at. There are tons of levels to explore and multiple ways to get to your destination. This provides for multiple ways to finish the level; therefore, making players use quick decision making to better their time.\nAs this is a parkour based game, it is often compared to EA's parkour success; Mirror's Edge. Now, Cloudbuilt and Mirror's Edge are two totally different games and I wanted to address that. Cloudbuilt is a third-person parkour shooter. Mirror's Edge is a first-person parkour game. Yeah, there are some guns in Mirror's Edge but Cloudbuilt is definitely the one who has the gun part built into it to be used. Either way, they're both great games and although they are compared to each other a lot, they're two different games.\n8/10\n","June 17, 2014","true","2.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The makers SHOULD have made the controles more user friendly and an over all experience feels more instinctive rather than finding the sweet spot and memorizing. Not to mention, the camera angles make it feel like leaps of faith that fail rather than a clear but difficult path. Let me put it bluntly: It's Sonic06 in the sky.

The video for it looked interesting so I bought the bundle and I decided to try this game out. I usually don't play games that I haven't heard about but chosing to buy and play this game was a great idea. It's probably one of the best 3D platformer games I've played. It has awesome parkour which doesn't only use the common wall-running and jumping but it also combines it with a jet-booster-pack thing and a bit of shooting. Other than the gameplay, it also has a great art style and some good music. The levels themselves are usually mostly non-linear so there are multiple ways of reaching the exit and it's up to you to pick the easiest or the fastest way. It also has Steam Workshop intergration which allows you to easily play player-made levels if you finish the game.","August 29, 2015","true","7.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The sense of speed is there, the sense of busy, baroque levels with a sense of flow and direction while still offering paths upon paths is there. But it just doesn't work.\n\nThe controls just aren't precise enough. Getting the protagonist to do a wall run or a wall climb solidly is a crapshoot. It's possible that if you were one with the game you might be able to pull these off consistently, but you CANNOT look me in the eye and tell me they feel right, they feel natural, that the sense of speed and flow in this game isn't hampered by the fiddly nature of these moves.\n\nIf you aren't great at this sort of thing, you may as well not even step up. Simply completing the levels is easy enough and you cannot and will not feel accomplished doing so. The amount of ways in which you will fail to be speedy will be obvious even to the novice (Take note, this is actually praise of the game system. It practically BEGS you to play it correctly. How often have you played a game and missed something that should have been obvious in its systems? You ask the playerbase, and when they answer, it's with a sneer, as though it was the most obvious thing in the world to them and yet it was opaque to you. That cannot happen in Cloudbuilt. The game sings to you of possibilities, of what you should be doing instead of what you are.). If you do take the time to learn, you will be up against a system that is simply woefully unsatisfying to conquer.\n\nI understand that the developers are up against a wall with this; maybe it's nearly impossible to make a speedy game in this vein with these sorts of moves that captures the feeling of speed appropriately. They tried, but I simply cannot say they succeeded. Another approach might be called for.\n\nAlso what's with that plot? I must commend the voice actress for delivering that dreadful dialogue with a straight face. I can, again, understand that in a game with this look and feel, you have to go "deep" to provide some sort of plot, but holy cow, the prose is just painful to listen to.\n\nSomeone more learned than me might be able to make a comment about the potential path bloat of the levels, that there are so many routes and so many red herrings that just don't actually save you time despite them being more difficult to follow than simply hopping along the straight route but I could not overcome the unsatisfying parts of the mechanics to attempt mastery and that is why I cannot recommend it. You cannot enjoy playing this without mastering it, and yet the game fights your attempts to exercise mastery over it with fiddlyness and frustration rather than intricacy and craft.\n\nOh and the gun may as well not be there. I've shot more brutally satisfying spitballs. Blasting mines? Cool. Works wonders. Anything else?

Everything else takes stupidly large numbers of shots to kill or just maintains a permanent shield.\n\nLike all good precision platformers there is no delay between death and getting back in the game. You can even place additional checkpoints by hand. That's exactly what you need for this kind of game! And the checkpoint system seems like a great crutch for newcomers!\n\nBut you have a very limited number of lives, somewhat bizarrely granted by finishing with low times, and the time penalty for death is so severe that if you want a remotely good time you will just restart from the beginning every time. As for checkpoints, they take so long to place that even if you find a safe spot for one, you just won't bother.\n\nLike all good free-running games you have a lot of freedom of movement.\n\nBut you have no impression of it. At all. Your character is nearly weightless, she floats around like she has maybe heard of gravity and momentum, but she's not really into those things. Meaning you will feel like you're controlling a balloon sliding around a puddle of oil. There's absolutely no feeling of weight to your movements, killing most of the satisfaction that might otherwise have been there. Not to mention making a precision platforming experience about as precise as sewing with boxing gloves on.\n\nFurthermore huge chunks of gameplay are determined by where you have the camera pointing. Which means you will, no matter how steady your hands, find yourself dying in a confusing mess of tumbling camera over and over again. Generally the controls are just awful. You automatically grab ledges, but have no stickiness to standing on the platform. You can turn quickly when wallrunning, but not on foot despite enemies that chase you through the level thus requiring you to stop and turn around.\n\nIn summation ths feels like a very interesting, if deeply flawed, precision platformer whose designers abruptly decided to hike the difficulty by adding features that make no sense and serve only to frustrate the player. It is caught between introducing difficulty in getting the best possible time and in finishing the level at all. The result is a mess, plain and simple.\n\nIf you like free-running games. If you like challenging games. If you like games with satisfying gameplay.\n\nAvoid this one.\n\nIt's restictive, punishing without any sense of learning and will generally lead you to wrestle with the controls and the camera to try and do something you know damn well you want to do.\n\nI bought it something like 80% off and I still feel like I was ripped off. I feel deeply sorry for anyone who paid full price for this garbage.","June 29, 2014","false","7.7"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

I really, really did. The concept was great, the art was fantastic, the music brilliant, and hey, I'm a math major/philosophy minor, so I'm totally down with all the introspection between levels. But the gameplay itself was a big, hairy scary ugly wad of fail.\n\n+Forget turrets, mines, and pit falls, your biggest enemy, and one that will haunt you from minute one until you rage quit, is the camera. If you ever played Ninja Gaiden on Xbox  (or NG Sigma on the PS3), it's that level of terrible. Always where you don't want it, and it follows you way, way too closely for a third person runner. It would have been better to take the full on first person approach than this "three steps behind" business. It doesn't really change contextually either, so if you have to bounce from one wall to another vertically, and the one wall is behind you... yeah, uh... good luck with that because once you're on the first wall you can't even *see* the second, even once you turn.\n\n+The controls are a nightmare: Way too touchy, overly complex, and not intuitive enough. Wall running is a sketchy business because your direction of run depends entirely on your angle of approach, and being off one way or the other, even by just a few degrees can bone you. Also, the boost mechanic just feels totally off to me. (Tap boost to keep running straight on a wall? Are you kidding me?!) Even basic jumping feels wongy, it's really difficult to guage distance and landings, and while I get the physics of skidding to a stop, landing on a concrete surface should not feel like landing on *ice.* Especially if I'm *not* coming in hot with my jet pack burning.\n\n+The *flow* is awful, which is a sin for a runner like this. I'm forever finding myself standing still, just trying to understand the layout well enough to pick a route, and *if* my attempt is successful, I have to stop again, catch my breath, and reevaluate the landscape... lather rinse repeat. I suppose, if you had a map memorized, this would be a non-issue. But for a new player, it completely destroys the immersion a game like this is supposed to provide.\n\n+Speaking of new players or players with less skill.... Look elsewhere, guys, because this is nothing but a frustration fest. This game has a completely and utterly POINTLESS "lives" mechanic. You screw up, you loose a life. You screw up too many times on a level, sucks to be you. You now lose all your progress on said level, and have to restart it from scratch. This is NOT a good way to teach people how to play. Constant do-overs are stressful and breed resentment. A lot could be forgiven if this one thing died in a fire. Even a "free play"  or "practice" mode for each level would be a huge help, but getting rid of it entirely would be best.\n\n\nIn closing, I'm glad I got this during the Steam Summer Sale, because I would have been heartsick if I'd paid full price for it. I was hoping for a really amazing free running experience, but this just isn't it. What a pity. Oh well...

You're going to rage quit. You won't even be angry. It will just be a 'screw this' reaction and you'll just jump into another game.\n\nThe story feels goofy and 'European'. Serious piano music will play in the hospital room that acts as your level hub, and then upbeat electronic music plays in the levels. It's all pointless. Why are there so many sad tones when the gameplay is fast and energetic? It's silly.\n\nGraphics are okay. It's *seriously* busy cel shaded standard fare and the general design doesn't have any real personality. There is nothing that makes you go "wow" if you have already played Jet Grind Radio or any other game that did cel shading right.

This type of stylization is great, it was what made games like Borderlands and Tell Tales The Walking Dead the way they are. Sadly enough it seems the dev team for this game put all there time into the enviroment, because as soon as you are put in the game you are hit with a sense of poor gameplay. In the "Tutorial" level you play as some form of ghost wondering around a destroyed building in the sky. To start off as soon as I made the first jump my character model started spazing out left to right. I also understand that when making a parkour game that you can't let every little detail have a hitbox, and I am fine with that. But when I do a simple wall jump and the character model clips halfway through the wall, we have a problem. Putting that aside after the first level you are throw into some form of hospital room where everybodies favorite form of storyline is draw out in front of you, exposition!(That was sarcasm If you couldn't tell) Now, putting all of that aside, I started the next level. I was shocked to see that I was going to be useing a gun. When a game is hyped to be a "Fast paced" Platforming parkour game you can't have a gun like this in it. I understand there should be deadly traps, but in a fast paced game like this you should try and avoid them. Not stop to aim and shoot them.

It's still not the main focus but there are several levels where the only really tricky spots were because of combat-related stuff. The game also has a lot of "screw you haha" moments that you'll likely die to because you can't tell what's coming, and the difficulty curve is whacked as all heck because of the non-linear progression. If you spiral out instead of charging down one branch it's probably a lot better though.\n\nMy biggest issue though was with the controls, because for the life of me I can never quite seem to get the game to work properly, which causes loads of problems on the harder stages. A lot of things occur that don't quite seem like my fault, like jumps being in a weird direction not even close to where I was aiming, boosting up walls sometimes failing to activate, and the bloody ledge grabbing. So much ledge grabbing. Demi is addicted to grabbing ledges and it's awful. I don't know, the game can be decent fun when you get the hang of the controls but it takes an eternity to do so because of how relatively clunky they tend to be. I also had a lot of issues with the gun, the homing of the shots almost seems to work against you when you fire at things on the wall you're running on; I can aim directly at or slightly past an enemy and have the bullet still hit the wall before the enemy, which is counter-intuitive to say the least.\n\nI don't really enjoy this game and I have no drive to improve myself (I've managed an A-rank only a handful of times, and have no clue how to even come close to an S-rank... there's nothing in the game driving me to be better). There are people who love this game though and I can see why. The visuals and music are both excellent, as well. The story's kind of just... there, but not intrusive and not even mandatory to follow (no cutscenes!)\n\nBut yeah, this is a weird review for me to write, I guess.\n\nEDIT: After thinking it over for a while, no, I can't honestly recommend this game, at all. In fact it's kind of horrible on just about every level except style. I'm really disappointed in this one, honestly, but there's too many small flaws that add up into a massively flawed game, it just always puts me in a sour mood every time I try to play it. I'd really just say avoid it, unfortunately. There's still some fun stuff here but not enough and even the fun stuff is marred by the poor controls.","September 29, 2014","false","18.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

However, the developers included lives and finite checkpoints so that, until you absolutely master a level, you won't be able to progress.\n\nThis game plays great both as a speedrunner and a platformer, but the devs don't want you playing it like a platformer and punish you for taking more than 2 seconds to think about what to do next - the homing, unkillable bombs where the only way to avoid instant death is to keep moving spring to mind.\n\nOverall its a good game flawed by the inclusion of some clunky and unwanted game mechanics like lives, their being there only to further put off anyone other than the most hardcore from this game (this coming from someone that plays a lot of Dustforce, a similarly styled speedrun focused game in 2D).","October 12, 2014","false","1.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The enemies that really get in your way requiring more than five hits to kill is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid.  Only shoot the purple things that stick to the walls.  Which also leads to the selective aiming, selective ledge grabbing... selective everything.  The game literally has a built-in aim assist.  I guess to help quicken the pace of the game.  It can help or REALLY hurt you.  You go to aim for one enemy and the game MIGHT think you're trying to shoot an enemy further off in the distance or shoot an enemy NEXT to the enemy you're trying to shoot at to get through a pixel perfect jump/wall run.  The MC also tends to either grab ledges or completely ignore them and fall off.  Pending on what mood she's in.  Aggravating.  So if you wanna memorize certain "stops" for your little pixel perfect autistic speed run Youtube videos, be prepped for long hours of re-recording.  Again another great concept harmed by 2 levels for the NORMAL players, and then hits you with a brick wall of insane pixel perfect jumps and memorization, you might as well just watch Youtube videos.\n\nIf you actually have a job, get it on a $2 sale.

It is a strange take on a bullet hell game, and most certainly NOT free-running/platforming or anything of that sort. This game is about dodging obstacles and freerunning and parkour and stuff are not just secondary or even tertiary, they are simply used to diversify the position of the obstacles you need to dodge. As oppose to other obstacle dodging games like Audiosurf, where you are dodging on one level all the time, you will be dodging in mid air, on the walls while wallrunning, edges, ground.\n\nThat's all there's to it. If you like Bullethell games and if you wanted an audiosurf that was not based on rythm and where you had more interesting things that colourd blocks to dodge, Cloudbuilt is up your alley. I never liked bullet hell games. I prefer to either run or fight. Doing both at the same time is annoying and results in either part being individually worse. Granted, Cloudbuilt at the core design makes no compromises on the dodging side of things, having a ton of various obstacles from robots to hominh missiles to different types of mines and lazers. But that's just yet another reason why it is not a free running game.\n\nIf you are like me, who like platforming and parkour games like Mirror's Edge, like Alice: Madness Returns or even enjoy parkour in ♥♥♥ Creed or the likes, this game is NOT for you and the part on it's Store page that says "free running" is blatantly false. There's NO *free* running in this game at all. Just none (aside from the first 3-4 intro levels). Your eyes will be on the next set of mines and lazers, not your path/angle of jump to save your momentum and speed.\n\nNot a bad game, but based on the false impressions that it gives you on the store page, I will rate it down. If you are gonna make a obstacle course/bullet hell game, do not market it as a friggin free running game and get people confused. I thoroughly regret my purchase, I thought I was buying a free running game.\n\n[Note: I have beaten the first ~10 levels before I uninstalled the game. The last 3-4 ones took about 20-50 tries each depending on whether I used custom checkpoints or not, but ultimately could be beaten very quickly. It will take you about 15 minutes per level the first time around. Once you remember the level and it's obstacles by heart, it takes about a minute beat it from start to finish. There are a lot of them in the game however.]","July 7, 2014","false","1.5"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Timed missions/levels in games are just aggravating and annoying and should be outlawed. Maybe I will write to congress on that. The controls are very loosey goosey but at any rate, they are not bad controls, just not great. They are good enough that I can still get to the end of a level without too much trouble.\n\nThe graphics and art direction are outstanding. Very good use of cell shading. The music and sound are good too.\n\nThe whole idea is very cool and unique. You do not see many super fast speed parkour games like this. It isn't always fast which is a good thing. Sometimes you have to slow down a bit to shoot something and kill it or change direction or whatever. And like I said this game's biggest asset is that it DOES NOT give you a time limit. Timed levels in games suck balls.\n\nCool game 8/10","October 24, 2014","true","1.7"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

I was going along fine, enjoying the challenge, and then I hit a level I just couldn't beat.  I tried for hours to find a way, but there was no way to avoid an extended wallrunning sequence with so many obstacles that one misstep led to death.  I beat my head against the wall until I couldn't take it anymore and now I'm just not interested in playing.  I thought that creating a strategy to get through the level as fast as possible would have more focus than simply memorizing obstacles and the muscle twitches to avoid them.  I'm really disappointed because I really like games that emphasize agility and speed.  This one doesn't to the degree I was hoping for.\n\nIf you like mindless muscle memory games, go for it.

However, I also favour simplicity, accessibility and the addiction of trying to improve times without having to play the game 24/7. Unlike more pick-up-and-play runners like T.E.C. 3001, Cloudbuilt requires you to commit many many hours just to get a satisfactory performance on a level. And by satisfactory, I mean a gold medal. The game starts off with a pointless story where you're stuck in a room. Instead of having the level select screen from the game's main menu, you have to go into the room, press E on the bed in the room and you can play. It's utterly pointless! Once you get in the game, you have some rather intuitive game mechanics - a meter which can be used for double jumps and boosting (either on ground or in mid-air), the ability to wallrun, the ability to hold onto a wall to time your jumps and of course, the ability to climb. What makes Cloudbuilt more challenging is that the obstacles you encounter are actual enemies - some are turrets which you can shoot, others are balls of electricity etc. and avoiding death is a challenge on its own. More so than any other game in its genre, Cloudbuilt emphasizes verticality and finding shortcuts. The level design is very abstract - it's essentially just concrete blocks placed in mid-air which you must traverse whilst avoiding the enemies and falling off. The game is extremely fast-paced too, and luckily, restarting a level is a hotkey and is immediate without loading or "3...2..1...GO!", which is very much necessary otherwise it would be downright unplayable. Unlike T.E.C. 3001, the levels are anything but linear, and trying to work out where you're meant to go is far more difficult than it should be - thus leading to frustration. And unlike Mirror's Edge, you can't simply stop and explore the level to work out which paths are optimal, because the game gives you a limited number of lives unless you restart, and in most cases it's impossible because the moment you stop to think about how to do the level, the enemies kill you. The game makes almost no attempt to assist you in finding better routes. This would be fine if the entire game wasn't a test of how well you know the level. no matter how much you've mastered the mechanics of the game, putting them into practice is seldom rewarding or satisfying - it often feels rushed and more awkward than awesome. Overall, Cloudbuilt is a game with too much depth for its own good. What makes games in this genre attractive is the ability to instantly pick the game up and getting hooked on shaving off milliseconds from your time. In Cloudbuilt, you will most likely be shaving off minutes until you spend countless hours learning the levels and getting to grips with the game mechanics just to get to the exciting part. If you're a hardcore speedrunning freak and want a real challenge which will keep you occupied for hundreds of hours, Cloudbuilt might just be for you. If you're after a fun, casual experience which you can dip in and out of, you will be sorely disappointed.","October 7, 2014","false","3.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Mainly by freerunning, dodging lasers, bombs, different bombs, turrets, different turrets, missiles, mines and purple electricity.  The parkour works well enough, though the game does have a specific feel that you'll need to get acquainted with before you can start playing with anything resembling proficiency.  Sometimes moves do fail to register as you want them to, but it's not overly frustrating.\n\nWhat is, is some of the levels.  Running along a wall, dodging moving lasers that will knock you off (killing you), followed by bombs that will blow up (killing you), only to get to the end of an area and be greeted by a barrage of lasers or missiles, which...well, you get the idea.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sail1/recommended/262390/","sail1","Coriks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sail1/","274 products in account","Cloudbuilt is one of those games you will either love or hate in very major extremes.  Unfortunately, it is one of those games that certainly takes quite a bit of effort to love starting off.  To put it simply, Cloudbuilt is hard.  Cloudbuilt does not want you to succeed.  Cloudbuilt wants you to listen to the soundtrack (luckily it is fantastic and never gets old) over and over again while you harness your deep seated hatred of the game design to push past a difficult area.  Enemies are difficult to fight and sometimes invincible, certain climbing segments are brutal and require extreme precision to execute (here's looking at you, Redeployment), and when difficult platforming combines with entirely unfair enemy odds the game will push your patience.  Your first run through of levels will consist of you dying over and over while looking at completion times that are well beyond your capabilities.  Running out of lives will force you to reset a level entirely, which adds insult to injury.  There are multiple branches to go through, but each branch is only a quarter of the story, so you'll have to face your demons sooner or later.\n\nSo how can I recommend Cloudbuilt?  It is frustating and evil, but also wonderful and addicting.  Once you push through and beat the game the first time you finally can start to appreciate everything wonderful about it.  Once you have the skills you need to start attacking times and making progress you can appreciate all your techniques and how much better you've gotten.  You may die 500 times getting up the wall in Redeployment your first time, but your second time is so much kinder.  The sense of speed you can get in this game is unparalleled.  Shaving seconds off a forty second course over the span of hours to get the next rank up is both rage inducing and incredibly fulfilling.  Even when you're losing the game goes fast so it is easy to go "just another round" again and again endlessly.  Looking online at videos you'll either be left with a sense of helplessness against your competition or inspired to learn more about advanced mechanics that are just so difficult to nail (I hate you charge pistol jump shenanigans), but seeing what IS possible is certainly awe inducing.  Level design is also astonishingly good (aside from cheap enemies!).  There are multiple branches to get where you need to go, the shortcuts make Rainbow Road look like a joke, and the fact the levels are so large and branching, but you always know which way to head needs to be commended.\n\nThe game is simply addicting, if you're not one to rage quit before you get the skills needed to play it.  It is not apologetic in what it is or what it offers.  You will play a decent selection of levels hundreds of times in quick succession and either have a stroke or enjoy it.  Graphically it has a stunning art style, i've mentioned the music is superb, and I think it was developed by a team of maybe six guys.  It is a fantastic effort that deserves to be supported.  These guys have done what Sega has been trying to do for years.  All I'm looking for now is a Mega Man game in the vein of if Cloudbuilt and Vanquish had a baby.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badham/recommended/262390/","badham","Wonder Blue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badham/","416 products in account","This game is brilliant. This game will make you play it until your soul has been ripped into two and your fingers have fallen off, but you will love every single second of it. It gives you basic free-running mechanics, run up walls, run along walls, jump, grab onto ledges and eases you in with a very simple tutorial level. 5 minutes later you'll be playing the proper game with no hand holding at all, with a boost (recharging fuel/pick up fuel) to run really fast, jump multiple times and enable you to spend unreal amounts of time running up or along walls. It feels amazing. It's the super speed free-running game you've always wanted but could never find.\n\nI used the Gamepad controls and they were perfectly optimised, they felt very intuitive, might take a while to get used to jumping with the left bumper but I had already played a game where I manually set the left bumper as jump (it's the best way to let you use the right analogue (camera/aim) simultaneously with jumping). Shots home on to close targets, so you don't have to spend time to be very accurate, you just have to aim close to what you want to shoot - thus not destroying the fast pace.\n\nThe level design is what makes the game stand out from the rest, not only are the levels very beautifully crafted and unique, they also have a ton of options as to how you can traverse them, meaning that you can play the levels your way and if you want to play the levels again, you could explore different routes and try to find faster ways to finish the level - giving extremely high replay value and a fresh feeling everytime you replay a level. All routes feel perfectly balanced, trickier platforming sections are faster than the more accessible ones, but all parts of the levels gradually get harder as the game progresses. The level select allows you to choose which levels to go to and there are multiple branching paths with different endings to the storyline, each with its own distinct feel and philosophy. The levels will challenge even the greatest of gamers and by the end of each branch your dexterity and quick thinking ability will have been pushed to their very limit.\n\nI would write a bit about the art style of this game, but you can check the videos and pictures and see for yourself, it's amazing. Get this game if you like challenging platforming games, you won't regret it.","July 9, 2014","true","14.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDigitalGamer/recommended/262390/","TheDigitalGamer","TheDigitalGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDigitalGamer/","54 products in account","CloudBuilt is an intense, reflex taxing platformer that pushes the player to think and react with lightning speed. Pushing your reflexes to the limit this game requires skill, logic and a handful of bravery.\n\n\nFirst experienced by myself at EGX Rezzed, Cloudbuilt instantly stood out amongst it's peers. It is fresh and clean with a unique look, hardly something you would expect from an Indie Dev Team. At first glance you may make the mistake of thinking it is all flash with no substance, however as you delve deeper you soon find the real appeal of the title.\n\n\nThe aim of the game is simple: reach the end by overcoming the obstacles that lie in your path. Sounds easy enough right? Wrong. There is no one clear path to take to complete a level, players must rely on their keen observations to carve a path out of the wasteland in the sky and put their bravery to the test. You have a variety of techniques at your disposal to help you reach your goal, such as wall running and double jumping, each of which depletes your energy bar at the bottom of the screen. The energy bar itself fills up steadily over time or as an alternative you can collect the yellow orbs that are dotted around the level which give you instant replenishment giving you immediate access to your abilities.\n\n\nThe fact that you get penalised for death with a time penalty is also an excellent addition. Rather than the level ending you return to the previous checkpoint with the timer back to what it was when you hit it. A three second penalty per death is added to your final time when you have completed the run, so it's worth bearing in mind that fast is good, but clean is equally as important.\n\n\nIt can at times be overwhelming with the constant feeling of being on the edge, having to strategically place every jump, every boost, every wall run, but then again, that's also a major part of the appeal. Playing through those levels over and over again mastering the tricky sections trying to shave those narrow seconds off your time can become incredibly addictive. Before you know it one quick game can turn into many in the hunt to improve your standing.\n\n\nAlthough it is a difficult game to achieve perfection, the casual gamer in you can just take pride and a sense of achievement from merely completing the levels, some of which are not as easy as they first appear!  The game handles well and responds to every whim which is integral to a title such as this. A death by game mechanics is a rarity, usually blame falls at the feet of the player.\n\n\nNone of the sound effects and soundtracks were out of place in this extreme environment, really giving the player that feeling of being involved in something out of this world. The pace of the music was very fitting building a lot of momentum that really spurs the player on in the hostile habitat.\n\n\nI did unfortunately experience a few issues whilst playing the game, one of which being the music at some stages did seem to completely lose control of itself and become white noise of nonsense pulsing away in the background. I experienced very few issues mechanically as most of my issues were caused by player inaptitude which I soon overcome with a little practice and dedication.\n\n\nOverall Cloudbuilt is a very exciting and nerve racking game all rolled into one. It offers excellent replayability with the speed running aspect to its levels, however it does not alienate casual gamers. Retailing currently at £14.00 on steam the price can appear to be rather steep, however playtime alone that can be gained from the title more than warrants the price tag.\n\n\n7.5/10\n","July 29, 2014","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first it's tricky just to move around thanks to the game's particularly fine controls.  Then, it's a struggle to navigate each level without getting a face full of bullets and mines.  Then, when you've conquered every map there is, the game quietly encourages you to start doing it faster.\n\nNo, faster than that.\n\nNo.  FASTER.\n\nIf you accept that this is really what the game is designed for, then eventually you'll naturally be watching out for little (or big) shortcuts, carefully managing your jetpack's tiny meter to keep it from shorting out at the worst possible moments, and jamming the reset button constantly in an effort to master your route section-by-section.

This is one of those games; A fun albeit short parkour with a jetpack game. Pile of levels unlock after boosting around like crazy getting to the next checkpoint. The game always has 2 paths to take in any given sector so it doesn't feel as much of a linear experience as I was expecting. Many of the enemies will completely derail your paths and throw you off edges or you won't have enough fuel to get past the part where you died 20 times. But more levels you complete the more lives you get, so if a level is a struggle you can move onto another level to get more lives, as well as a portable checkpoint which can give you an additional 5 lives, so you're rarely going to be kicked back to the level selector. Storyline was unexpectedly solid; the writing felt a bit too much like I was reading an essay due to the expansive vocabulary of the protagonist, and each path you take leads to a different ending, so it has a fair bit of replayability. At 3 hours I'd done most of each area but only finished 1 possible ending.\nMy only suggestion to the game would be to add a level editor and workshop support, as the game needs more levels.

You could say this is a sort of parkour/plataformer.\nThe best I can describe it is as Mirror's edge mixed with the classic Sonic games and a touch of Megaman X.

Gameplay. focus on that.\n\nPeople can do some insane fast times on each track, mostly because of a jumping technique that I think the developers didn't consider the players would use, but that fits perfectly for the game. The game is completely skill dependant, and you will need to do the same track a lot of times to find the best route, tricks and ways to beat enemies the fastest.\n\nI will not lie, you probably will rage quit quite often on certain tracks, the final stage is impossible for me and I decided to give up (then I watched on youtube some insane guy breezing through the stage in 30 seconds x.x ), but give it a try, is great for its price and is very unique.","March 8, 2015","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It infuriates me in the wrong ways, but I do come back to it, so that says something. It's currently sitting on a 6/10 scale for me.\n\nI think the idea has promise, but there are a couple of issues. First among them is the controls. Speed runs back in the day were at the same time easier and more satisfying since you only had to handle a few buttons and deal with 2 dimensions, so controls were tight and precise. Cloudbuilt handels this fairly well in 3 dimensions after some practice, but there are still some things that just refuse to work. Or controls that are too twitchy and you fly off a cliff for nearly no reason.\n\nAnother issue is there seems to be inconsistent distance from boost off ramps. One level I can't even get over an obstacle I know I've passed once before with a boost off a ramp and then a double boost jump, but it refuses to be executed. I also wonder, like others, why there is a limit on jetpacks. It makes some sense, conserve your fuel, improve your time. But it KILLS the flow of gameplay. If you want to limit how much you have for mid-air boosting or something, that's fine. But for wall runs and such, it seems unnecessary.\n\nThen there's the fact that controller support is stated, something I think could possibly alleviate some of the control issues, but it refuses to recognize my controller even though other games do. So while I find it somewhat entertaining, I'm not sure this game has the control chops to really make it work.","June 28, 2014","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zwanglos/recommended/262390/","zwanglos","zwanglos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zwanglos/","274 products in account","Okay, I originally rated this a bit lower but have changed my opinion since then so am doing a re-write.\n\nCloudbuilt weaves an incredibly dull narrative into a game about speedrunning through literally fanciful obstacle courses in the sky. I don't think I'm in danger of spoilers here by saying that the main character is recovering from some battlefield trauma, and all the events/levels of the game take place in her mind. (That is the entirety of the story, right there. Whoopee.)\n\nBreakdown:\nStory - 1/10 - The storytellers have apparently not heard the writers' maxim of 'show, don't tell' and decided upon dolling out the narrative to you in between each level. That is, none of the story progresses or is shown to you via events in the actual game. In between each level, the disembodied, ghost-like narrator stares at her own body recovering in a hospital bed as she tells you, at length, about how she feels concerning her being turned into a cyborg or whatever. This eminently skip-worthy narrative is about as disappointing as biting into an ice cream cone to only then discover that someone has managed to create cardboard-flavor ice cream, and you're eating it. I honestly might have preferred there to be no story in the game at all, as reflective silence would have been an improvement to the lackluster voice acting that was the narrative. Let's be honest, though - you're not buying this game for the story anyway.\n\nGraphics - 8/10 - I'm always a fan of cel-shaded graphics and this game delivers well on those. I rate it a bit lower because some levels actually suffer from framerate loss because of an overabundance of rain or fog or whatever, but this is very minor. There were some minor graphical glitches here and there as well (e.g. in one of the ending cutscenes, it was raining so hard outside the building that it was also raining INSIDE the building.)\n\nGameplay - 7/10 - Although I found some of the explanations on controls to be a bit confusing in the tutorial, once you learn the ropes of all the cyborg-parkour schenanagans that your character can get up to, bouncing off the walls becomes a joyous little affair as you dance through the levels as fast as you can. I rate this lower because of the various obstacles that you come to face in the levels, though. A turret here or there, okay... some mines I need to shoot down, no problem... laser sniper turrets that never miss? Homing drones that hunt you down from across the map, no matter how far you run? Turrets that shoot more of said drones? Now we're getting a bit ridiculous.\n\nLevel design - 6/10 - Quite a few of the maps are really fun to play, and are just challenging enough to get through that you think to yourself, "yeah, I want to go back to that level and see if I can get that A-rank!" However, on a lot of the later levels the developers kind of go off the deep end and lose all control of the fun/difficulty balance. I had one situation where I jumped into a small corridor that had 4 turrets, two spider-drones, a homing drone and a bunch of mines littered everywhere, and then once I manage to (somehow) get through all that crap and catapult myself up a wall, there's a never-miss sniper turret hiding in one of my blind spots. Urgh. Now mind you, these kinds of levels are all beatable, of course, but while I was playing them I wasn't thinking 'yay, this level is fun!' but more along the lines of 'I really want this awful level to be over so I can go to the next and never play this one again. I hate you, game. I hate you so much.' Such levels are about as enjoyable as walking on asphalt with your bare feet on a hot summer day. In light of this, achievements such as 'Get an S-Rank on every level, in every mode' (upwards of 5 modes per level) require a severe degree of masochism (and unrealistic amounts of free time).\n\nMusic - 8/10 - The downtempo songs are kind of bland, but I love the music that plays during the levels, and was delighted to find out that they are contained in the installation as Ogg Vorbis files, so now I've happily added them to my phone's playlist.\n\nSound 5/10 - Game sounds are just fine, I'm rating lower for the lackluster voice acting of the boring narrative.\n\nSadly, the game lacks a level editor; Cloudbuilt is the sort of game that would shine with user-generated content, especially with how frustrating the late-game campaign content can get. But that apparently isn't a thing. Would be nice if they included it later on.\n\nOverall 7/10 - Visual/Aural presentation is good; game is fun to pick up and play but some of the levels suck the fun out of it. Still, many of the levels are fun enough that you'll want to try to set decent records and do your best.","July 27, 2014","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The jetpack added some fun but also made some of the freerunning "puzzles" almost too forgiving, and adding in a gun would have been fine if it had only been used to break static obstacles, but adding in enemies was enough to put me off.\n\nIt's still a great game, but it turned out to be not what I was hoping for when I bought it (I probably should've read some reviews or watched some videos, but I was at work and it was a flash sale, so oh well).","July 27, 2014","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDigitalGamer/recommended/262390/","TheDigitalGamer","TheDigitalGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDigitalGamer/","54 products in account","CloudBuilt is an intense, reflex taxing platformer that pushes the player to think and react with lightning speed. Pushing your reflexes to the limit this game requires skill, logic and a handful of bravery.\n\n\nFirst experienced by myself at EGX Rezzed, Cloudbuilt instantly stood out amongst it's peers. It is fresh and clean with a unique look, hardly something you would expect from an Indie Dev Team. At first glance you may make the mistake of thinking it is all flash with no substance, however as you delve deeper you soon find the real appeal of the title.\n\n\nThe aim of the game is simple: reach the end by overcoming the obstacles that lie in your path. Sounds easy enough right? Wrong. There is no one clear path to take to complete a level, players must rely on their keen observations to carve a path out of the wasteland in the sky and put their bravery to the test. You have a variety of techniques at your disposal to help you reach your goal, such as wall running and double jumping, each of which depletes your energy bar at the bottom of the screen. The energy bar itself fills up steadily over time or as an alternative you can collect the yellow orbs that are dotted around the level which give you instant replenishment giving you immediate access to your abilities.\n\n\nThe fact that you get penalised for death with a time penalty is also an excellent addition. Rather than the level ending you return to the previous checkpoint with the timer back to what it was when you hit it. A three second penalty per death is added to your final time when you have completed the run, so it's worth bearing in mind that fast is good, but clean is equally as important.\n\n\nIt can at times be overwhelming with the constant feeling of being on the edge, having to strategically place every jump, every boost, every wall run, but then again, that's also a major part of the appeal. Playing through those levels over and over again mastering the tricky sections trying to shave those narrow seconds off your time can become incredibly addictive. Before you know it one quick game can turn into many in the hunt to improve your standing.\n\n\nAlthough it is a difficult game to achieve perfection, the casual gamer in you can just take pride and a sense of achievement from merely completing the levels, some of which are not as easy as they first appear!  The game handles well and responds to every whim which is integral to a title such as this. A death by game mechanics is a rarity, usually blame falls at the feet of the player.\n\n\nNone of the sound effects and soundtracks were out of place in this extreme environment, really giving the player that feeling of being involved in something out of this world. The pace of the music was very fitting building a lot of momentum that really spurs the player on in the hostile habitat.\n\n\nI did unfortunately experience a few issues whilst playing the game, one of which being the music at some stages did seem to completely lose control of itself and become white noise of nonsense pulsing away in the background. I experienced very few issues mechanically as most of my issues were caused by player inaptitude which I soon overcome with a little practice and dedication.\n\n\nOverall Cloudbuilt is a very exciting and nerve racking game all rolled into one. It offers excellent replayability with the speed running aspect to its levels, however it does not alienate casual gamers. Retailing currently at £14.00 on steam the price can appear to be rather steep, however playtime alone that can be gained from the title more than warrants the price tag.\n\n\n7.5/10\n","July 29, 2014","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is really ♥♥♥♥in fun, really ♥♥♥♥in addictive, and really ♥♥♥♥ing hard. This game will kick pretty much everybodies ♥♥♥ when you first start, which is probably why they give you so many god damned lives for each level. It's a speedrunning precision platformer. It takes a while to get used to but when you do, expect to keep throwing yourself at levels until you finally beat them, and then play them again until you can start speedrunning them. It takes incredible reflexes and a quick mind to figure out the best possible path through the insane and interesting levels.\n\nFirst, use a keyboard and mouse. I tried using a gamepad, expecting it to be better suited, but this game requires the accuracy of a mouse.\n\nSecond, you're expected to die over and over as you force your way through a level. Don't get frustrated when you die and be happy when you pass a level with a C ranking. B rankings on your first completion are rare but amazing. The A and the S ranks will require you to work for them.\n\nThird, take your time with each level. Don't try and speedrun it on your first playthrough of each level. Take your time and explore and as you get better you will begin picking up time on your plays.\n\nGood luck and have fun.\n\nI will add this. The last few levels on each path do everything I absolutely hate in game design. I find them flawed and artificialy difficult in a way that requires throwing yourself at a brick wall until you figure out the exact way that works down to a science. The common idea for well designed difficult games is tough but fair, where is this is simply a pain in the ♥♥♥ to do. It requires muscle memory and route memorization and explotation rather than ease with mechanics, exceptional reflexes and skill. This is where it becomes clear that this game's audience is very specific. I find the level design of the last few levels almost game breakingly bad. I beat them but with a bitter taste in my mouth from the experience. Of course after beating them finally, the levels are rather ♥♥♥♥ easy, because you already went through hell to play them over and over. I do still recommend this game, however I find the ending levels to be regretful and beyond disappointing. Ultimately, I disagree with the ending design philosophy and ended up hating the experience, which is a shame because I love the majority of the game.","July 1, 2014","true","21.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most course it expects you to finish in about 30 seconds. To say the least I have come no where close to this. I also find this a shame because some of the course and bonuses are fun to get. I feel like it was designed to be run like Sonic but I prefer to play it more like Mega Man. Still it is fun. If you are a perfectionist completionist this game will be hell though.

Honestly, I didn't think this game could do what it tried. Ok, Dustforce is perfect, but it's 2D. Mirror's Edge works fine, it's 3D but it's not nearly as fast. I really didn't believe a game about running through a level full of obstacles at a high speed while wallrunning, flying and shooting enemies would work. But it works.\n\nYou have a wide range of tools at your disposal. You can double jump, run on walls, stick to walls for a brief moment to aim your next jump, you can shoot, and surely enough you can boost. Boosting is very important, by the way. No wall is too tall if you add some boost to your running. Of course boosting drains energy, and I imagine that the key to the best runs is perfectly timing your boosts.\n\nWhat I really want to stress is that while you can do a lot, and it might seem like a huge set of moves is not that good for a fast game because it's easy to get lost in controls, everything works perfectly fine in this game. The character sticks to walls when you want her to, you won't miss a platform because the game allows you to control your falls, levels don't get lost in style and you can see exactly what you need to be doing next (at least from what I've seen so far).\n\nI have to give it to the devs, they pulled off perfectly what's most important for this type of game: gameplay and controls.\n\nI don't think this game will top Dustforce for me, but damn does it get near.","June 27, 2014","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game takes place in a futuristic environment filled with rebotic hostiles and floating platforms which the players need to overcome throughout the game.\n\nThe game itself has a pretty simple concept where the player needs to get from point A to point B, however the path the player chooses completely depends on them which reduces the thought of a very linear game which it couldve been. Some paths may have many enemies where players need to either destroy or dodge attacks whereas other paths may be filled with traps which require extreme reflexive skills with th contols.\n\nFrom playing this game I have to conclude that this had been one of, if not the best game I have played this year. I absolutely loved every part of this game ranging from trying to past an extremely difficult level (2hrs was the longest) and feeling the satisfaction of completing it to observing the beautifully designed maps. I also have to add that the graphics is pretty well done with a style similar to borderlands, however i do feel that some parts have been 'over done' where too many layers of filters have been added which bought in little drops in framerates but it was fine.\n\nThe gameplay is great where players need to control Demi's movements to complete each level with many features to assist them. These include wall running, wall hanging as well as having a jetpack was various abilities for use. A gun is also provided for players to kill enemies if wanted which opens the door to even more play styles.\n\nTo conclude I strongly recommend this game to people who love platformers, free running or extremely challenging games and I must say that this game is very worth the money you pay if you like these games.","July 21, 2014","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You are gonnna do every thing from jumping wall running flying and destroying bots to get to the end. There are a lot of levels but surprisingly very few of them felt the same. The core gameplay is just funn\n\ncons: The graphics are pretty bad in this game, i get that they were going for a unique art style but it's not good. The story is almost non existant and very shallow, it's just there to be there. The game is kinda short, it only took me around 8 hours to complete with all the side missions\nNote: There are extra gamemodes for every level that i didn't complete, and there are extra skins that i didn't go for\n\nSummary: This game is fun but not THAT fun and it's pretty short. I would recommend it but I don't think it's worth $20, maybe $15 or below. I got the game for $5 so im okay with that","September 25, 2014","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"

Honestly, I didn't think this game could do what it tried. Ok, Dustforce is perfect, but it's 2D. Mirror's Edge works fine, it's 3D but it's not nearly as fast. I really didn't believe a game about running through a level full of obstacles at a high speed while wallrunning, flying and shooting enemies would work. But it works.\n\nYou have a wide range of tools at your disposal. You can double jump, run on walls, stick to walls for a brief moment to aim your next jump, you can shoot, and surely enough you can boost. Boosting is very important, by the way. No wall is too tall if you add some boost to your running. Of course boosting drains energy, and I imagine that the key to the best runs is perfectly timing your boosts.\n\nWhat I really want to stress is that while you can do a lot, and it might seem like a huge set of moves is not that good for a fast game because it's easy to get lost in controls, everything works perfectly fine in this game. The character sticks to walls when you want her to, you won't miss a platform because the game allows you to control your falls, levels don't get lost in style and you can see exactly what you need to be doing next (at least from what I've seen so far).\n\nI have to give it to the devs, they pulled off perfectly what's most important for this type of game: gameplay and controls.\n\nI don't think this game will top Dustforce for me, but damn does it get near.","June 27, 2014","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDigitalGamer/recommended/262390/","TheDigitalGamer","TheDigitalGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDigitalGamer/","54 products in account","CloudBuilt is an intense, reflex taxing platformer that pushes the player to think and react with lightning speed. Pushing your reflexes to the limit this game requires skill, logic and a handful of bravery.\n\n\nFirst experienced by myself at EGX Rezzed, Cloudbuilt instantly stood out amongst it's peers. It is fresh and clean with a unique look, hardly something you would expect from an Indie Dev Team. At first glance you may make the mistake of thinking it is all flash with no substance, however as you delve deeper you soon find the real appeal of the title.\n\n\nThe aim of the game is simple: reach the end by overcoming the obstacles that lie in your path. Sounds easy enough right? Wrong. There is no one clear path to take to complete a level, players must rely on their keen observations to carve a path out of the wasteland in the sky and put their bravery to the test. You have a variety of techniques at your disposal to help you reach your goal, such as wall running and double jumping, each of which depletes your energy bar at the bottom of the screen. The energy bar itself fills up steadily over time or as an alternative you can collect the yellow orbs that are dotted around the level which give you instant replenishment giving you immediate access to your abilities.\n\n\nThe fact that you get penalised for death with a time penalty is also an excellent addition. Rather than the level ending you return to the previous checkpoint with the timer back to what it was when you hit it. A three second penalty per death is added to your final time when you have completed the run, so it's worth bearing in mind that fast is good, but clean is equally as important.\n\n\nIt can at times be overwhelming with the constant feeling of being on the edge, having to strategically place every jump, every boost, every wall run, but then again, that's also a major part of the appeal. Playing through those levels over and over again mastering the tricky sections trying to shave those narrow seconds off your time can become incredibly addictive. Before you know it one quick game can turn into many in the hunt to improve your standing.\n\n\nAlthough it is a difficult game to achieve perfection, the casual gamer in you can just take pride and a sense of achievement from merely completing the levels, some of which are not as easy as they first appear!  The game handles well and responds to every whim which is integral to a title such as this. A death by game mechanics is a rarity, usually blame falls at the feet of the player.\n\n\nNone of the sound effects and soundtracks were out of place in this extreme environment, really giving the player that feeling of being involved in something out of this world. The pace of the music was very fitting building a lot of momentum that really spurs the player on in the hostile habitat.\n\n\nI did unfortunately experience a few issues whilst playing the game, one of which being the music at some stages did seem to completely lose control of itself and become white noise of nonsense pulsing away in the background. I experienced very few issues mechanically as most of my issues were caused by player inaptitude which I soon overcome with a little practice and dedication.\n\n\nOverall Cloudbuilt is a very exciting and nerve racking game all rolled into one. It offers excellent replayability with the speed running aspect to its levels, however it does not alienate casual gamers. Retailing currently at £14.00 on steam the price can appear to be rather steep, however playtime alone that can be gained from the title more than warrants the price tag.\n\n\n7.5/10\n","July 29, 2014","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sail1/recommended/262390/","sail1","Coriks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sail1/","274 products in account","Cloudbuilt is one of those games you will either love or hate in very major extremes.  Unfortunately, it is one of those games that certainly takes quite a bit of effort to love starting off.  To put it simply, Cloudbuilt is hard.  Cloudbuilt does not want you to succeed.  Cloudbuilt wants you to listen to the soundtrack (luckily it is fantastic and never gets old) over and over again while you harness your deep seated hatred of the game design to push past a difficult area.  Enemies are difficult to fight and sometimes invincible, certain climbing segments are brutal and require extreme precision to execute (here's looking at you, Redeployment), and when difficult platforming combines with entirely unfair enemy odds the game will push your patience.  Your first run through of levels will consist of you dying over and over while looking at completion times that are well beyond your capabilities.  Running out of lives will force you to reset a level entirely, which adds insult to injury.  There are multiple branches to go through, but each branch is only a quarter of the story, so you'll have to face your demons sooner or later.\n\nSo how can I recommend Cloudbuilt?  It is frustating and evil, but also wonderful and addicting.  Once you push through and beat the game the first time you finally can start to appreciate everything wonderful about it.  Once you have the skills you need to start attacking times and making progress you can appreciate all your techniques and how much better you've gotten.  You may die 500 times getting up the wall in Redeployment your first time, but your second time is so much kinder.  The sense of speed you can get in this game is unparalleled.  Shaving seconds off a forty second course over the span of hours to get the next rank up is both rage inducing and incredibly fulfilling.  Even when you're losing the game goes fast so it is easy to go "just another round" again and again endlessly.  Looking online at videos you'll either be left with a sense of helplessness against your competition or inspired to learn more about advanced mechanics that are just so difficult to nail (I hate you charge pistol jump shenanigans), but seeing what IS possible is certainly awe inducing.  Level design is also astonishingly good (aside from cheap enemies!).  There are multiple branches to get where you need to go, the shortcuts make Rainbow Road look like a joke, and the fact the levels are so large and branching, but you always know which way to head needs to be commended.\n\nThe game is simply addicting, if you're not one to rage quit before you get the skills needed to play it.  It is not apologetic in what it is or what it offers.  You will play a decent selection of levels hundreds of times in quick succession and either have a stroke or enjoy it.  Graphically it has a stunning art style, i've mentioned the music is superb, and I think it was developed by a team of maybe six guys.  It is a fantastic effort that deserves to be supported.  These guys have done what Sega has been trying to do for years.  All I'm looking for now is a Mega Man game in the vein of if Cloudbuilt and Vanquish had a baby.  A man can dream.","July 9, 2014","true","28.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badham/recommended/262390/","badham","Wonder Blue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badham/","416 products in account","This game is brilliant. This game will make you play it until your soul has been ripped into two and your fingers have fallen off, but you will love every single second of it. It gives you basic free-running mechanics, run up walls, run along walls, jump, grab onto ledges and eases you in with a very simple tutorial level. 5 minutes later you'll be playing the proper game with no hand holding at all, with a boost (recharging fuel/pick up fuel) to run really fast, jump multiple times and enable you to spend unreal amounts of time running up or along walls. It feels amazing. It's the super speed free-running game you've always wanted but could never find.\n\nI used the Gamepad controls and they were perfectly optimised, they felt very intuitive, might take a while to get used to jumping with the left bumper but I had already played a game where I manually set the left bumper as jump (it's the best way to let you use the right analogue (camera/aim) simultaneously with jumping). Shots home on to close targets, so you don't have to spend time to be very accurate, you just have to aim close to what you want to shoot - thus not destroying the fast pace.\n\nThe level design is what makes the game stand out from the rest, not only are the levels very beautifully crafted and unique, they also have a ton of options as to how you can traverse them, meaning that you can play the levels your way and if you want to play the levels again, you could explore different routes and try to find faster ways to finish the level - giving extremely high replay value and a fresh feeling everytime you replay a level. All routes feel perfectly balanced, trickier platforming sections are faster than the more accessible ones, but all parts of the levels gradually get harder as the game progresses. The level select allows you to choose which levels to go to and there are multiple branching paths with different endings to the storyline, each with its own distinct feel and philosophy. The levels will challenge even the greatest of gamers and by the end of each branch your dexterity and quick thinking ability will have been pushed to their very limit.\n\nI would write a bit about the art style of this game, but you can check the videos and pictures and see for yourself, it's amazing. Get this game if you like challenging platforming games, you won't regret it.","July 9, 2014","true","14.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is the one for you. On the outset, the controls seem twitchy, and the levels are confusing, but trust me, when you figure it out, it all works perfectly. The moves that didn't make sense soon start to feel natural, and while the levels don't have a set path, you realize that ANY road can lead to where you want to go, since most lead in the same direction anyway. Don't like consecutive wall runs at 90 degree angles? That's fine, just make a left, and try the vertical wall run instead. Levels can usually be beaten in under a minute, and each level has 5 different modes, such as Infinite Boost, Pacifism Runs, Waypoints, and 1-Hit Kill. The plot is mediocre so far, but the voice acting isn't bad even to my standards, and it has a decent script.\n\n","June 30, 2014","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are good, they paint that dream-like world quite well with an anime-esque spin. The story was surprisingly in-depth despite not really being the focus of the game, I still found myself becoming fond of the well-voiced Demi and her thoughts on her situation. The gameplay itself is tight and responsive, as you'd expect/require it to be considering how punishing this game is to tiny mistakes.\n\nWhen I first started playing I didn't think I'd be able to achieve what I intended, as in games similar to this I always set my goal for the best ranks on each level. Everytime I failed it was frustrating, and I only had myself to blame as the game requires pin-point precision and the ability to think incredibly quickly while under pressure. I kept trying though, and I got better. Before I knew it I was performing manoeuvres I didn't think were possible at first - getting crazy air and speed with different techniques that I picked up along the way - as the game doesn't explain how everything works.\n\nCloudbuilt will beat you down repeatedly until you adapt to it's steep learning curve, but once you do the reward is great in satisfaction and all that self-loathing you had for yourself during your failures will be rectified :P. I recommend this game to anyone with a taste for speed, punishment and the patience to become better at something. 10/10, would hate self again.","September 19, 2015","true","92.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am saying though it is a great game for anyone's collection, especially if it is on sale for a reasonable or extra reasonable price like when I bought it.\n\nGreat artistic value and music in my opinion as well as themes that I enjoy, such as sci fi technology and abilites in a  futuristic world setting without the "story" getting too convoluted.  It may seem weird to some people, but for me, sometimes less is more in a story sense.  What I mean by this is you are given information about various situations without all of the burdensom luggage or character development or even story development itself, so you are left to fill in the holes in your mind and really just make it be whatever you want it to be.  I understand this probably doesn't work for some people, but to me it really gives room to let a game become your own rather you being force fed who a character is, how they think, what they are, what they do, etc.  It's almost like when you're a kid and you have your G.I. Joe's or whatever. you decide if they are good or bad, how they think, their back story etc and it can be quite fun if you are in that mode where you still have some imagination left.\n\nI realize this review may not make a lot of sense and really didn't break down the mechanics of the game, the pros and cons, and many other factors but in reality for me, a game can be more than those things and that's what cloud built is for me.\n\ntl dr cloudbuilt really is a nice game about speeding through a science fiction world in the sky with a cyborg girl and her jetpack / jet boots while avoiding malicious drones, mines, and various other obstacles.  it's like ninja warrior except you're in a coma and the course is in your mind... and im not sure if there is a prize because it gets hard and i got stuck but yeah...buy this game\n\nwhen it's on sale","August 16, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To mention a few of the flaws, I could say something about the funky control scheme or the fact that the menu doesn't seem to want to interact with my mouse at all, even though it states in-game that a mouse and keyboard are recommended.  I had to use my Xbox 360 controller to play this game.  I also had problems with the game minimizing for no reason, showing the desktop whenever I clicked on the right side edge of the level selection screen.  If you can avoid using the mouse, you should be OK with this game, but otherwise, you may be in for a rough ride.\n\nOkay, so the flaws aside, this is a beautiful and exciting game filled with fast-paced platform-jumping and relentlessly difficult enemy/obstacle placement. The game features a plethora of agile movement options, including dashing, wall-running, ledge-climbing, and mid-air jet-jumping (double jump).  It also allows for some third-person shooter mechanics, but the focus is primarily on the platforming.  Think Shadow The Hedgehog without the lame character and with more difficulty.","February 10","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

The way that you choose levels has many different 'branches' or choices about what level you want to play next. Each of these branches leads to an alternate ending in the story. This is an excellent way to integrate the 4 different alternate endings in a game focused around levels.\n\nThe gameplay itself is really solid and fluid, allowing you to consistently move forward while on your toes due to the range of trap and enemy types. Oh yes, this game isnt a simple parkour game that you jump aorund in, there are actual enemies! (who'd a thunk?)\n\nSo, to sum up:\n\nPros:\n- Great immersive story that gets you attached to the main character.\n- SOLID gameplay that allows replayability and even a level editor for people to share their creations!\n- Unique enough to stand out from a lot of other games, including Mirror's Edge.\n- The main character is appropriately dressed, unlike many female protanogists.\n- Cell shading finally done right.\n\nCons:\n- If playing the story simply for the story, you'll only get around 4 hours worth of game. However, there are many non-story focused levels that will add a considerable number of hours to this. (not including player-made levels on the workshop)\n- Controls can SOMETIMES be a tiny bit unresponsive, causing you to jump into a chasm.\n- You will fall/die, a lot.","January 4","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So many that now a-days many gaming activities, whilst still fun, seem a bit bland.\nI remember the days when I would retire to bed, some three hours after I should have done, because I needed just one more turn to complete the Great Pyramids, and then in bed I would dream about defeating Sarevok, or have nightmares about my tank being killed by a spearman.\nGaming has been a wonderful mistress, but I feared that the days of being so immersed that I dreamt of games were long since passed.\n\nBut last night I had a dream.\n\nI dreamed I was playing what seemed to be a simple platform game. Levels suspended in the ether with the simple task of making it to the exit. There were patrolling robots, force shields and laser turrets, standard gaming fare, which you could disable with a quick blast of your hand gun. The controls, initially a bit twitchy, but with a bit of practice would see you wall sliding and leaping bottomless chasms with ease, gliding around the level like a gazelle on speed.\nHowever the levels themselves were only the introduction, the real fun began once you had completed the level, once you knew how to "do it" as it were, for at this point the clock is unlocked and the world opens up.\nWhat was once a simple platform game, becomes the ultimate parkour simulator, with times being stored on a central server for the world to observe.\n\nThe level of satisfaction as your level time drops from ten minutes to five, to three as you fine tune your sprints, dodge the lasers, discover the superleap that will shave a fraction of a second off your level time is something that I havn't experienced in a long time. The frustration at when you miss a jump to plumet to your death, coupled with the elation at executing the perfect wall slide is only matched by the amazement you will feel that your two minute level time is still a minute and a half slower than the top of the leaderboard.\nI have no freaking idea how they are doing it! But I was damn well determined to find out.\n\nIts cell shaded art style seemed the perfect choice for the atmosphere the game was going for, and whislt it seemed to have some bobbins story involving you in a coma whilst your astral projection took part in the game proper.\nOf course I immediately thought that I was reminiscing of Mirrors Edge, but this would have been like comparing Wipe-out to Gran Turismo.\n\nBut Discalceaterabbit, you all cry out in unison, surely you are describing indie game "Cloudbuilt" by Coilworks,  You must have played that and not had a dream at all!\n\nPfft, don't be ridiculous.\nA video game with a non objectified female protagonist?\nThey don't exist.\nGamers hate women.\nEveryone knows that.","August 5, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's you vs gravity. Exhilarating with every step you take. See parkour like you've never seen it before. Super satisfying as you navigate through the levels. Definitely a game worth keeping.","May 8","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is not a casual Megaman-esque experience. That said, it builds and improves even on the formulas of parkour and the shooting aspect is left as an afterthought.\n\nThe game starts you off in a very basic level, which isn't too crazy, but it also is not easy either. You have to scan your environment for the right path at first on the tutorial level. However, once the tutorial level is finished you will find out this is a multipath game where you have more than one way to finish things. You are going to be forced to scan your environment for platforms and alternate ways of overcoming a section of the level.\n\nThe AI in this game in so far as the few enemies you encounter is pretty easy. However, the entire game is not built for being a shooter. The parkour obstacles more than make up for the lack of an AI.\n\nThe controls are very good. In fact I have to say this is one of the best controller experiences I have had in videogames by far, and that is saying something. The fluidity of the graphics is also a plus, it manages to come out very strong in that department.\n\nThe music can keep you interested in this game for days if you are the kind of person who buys a game for its soundtrack. Definitely a good electronica mix going on in the game levels which keep your mind active.\n\nThe story are basically figments of data that are thrown at you after every mission, and it retells the experiences of a girl who apparently survived a massacre from an enemy robot/soldier. Not too fleshed out, but with these games you're not exactly expecting a story, you are expecting action, and in Cloudbuilt you have more than enough action.\n\nAll in all a good addition to any library that wants to get Megaman-esque experiences. It is not an action shooter, but it is a beautifully rendered game with a decent story nevertheless, with an interesting take on the parkour formula.","June 5","true","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
