"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/366250/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","Metal Slug is a rarity. This is one of those once-in-a-forever franchises that'll never be duplicated, perfectly cloned, or perhaps even improved upon. To accurately explain just how unique this series is, I have to start with Nazca Corporation. As you might already know, Nazca developed the first four* Metal Slug games. Before they started work on the Neo Geo, they were originally a part of Irem.\n\nA number of Irem titles have a unique style of pixel-graphics. Aside from making for highly-detailed sprites, backgrounds, and effects, this technique allows for a lot of manipulation. So when you see a wall crumble, a ship explode, or an enemy get torn to ribbons, you can actually see the pixels pull away from each other. It's difficult to describe, but it looks incredible in motion and lends a lot of flavor to the action. Some examples that immediately come to mind are R-Type 2, Undercover Cops, and Geo Storm aka Gun Force 2.\n\nMetal Slug is a showcase for Nazca's pixel-wizardry. Not only does each stage look incredible, but the game goes above and beyond in terms of personality. Every character in the game is loaded with animations and creativity, most notably the enemy soldier. This is the most common foe in the series, and Nazca put more effort into making these adversaries more memorable than entire games. These games also perfectly blend humor and violence, At no point does the tone ever shift to a point where the player starts feeling uncomfortable. Although, the designers do know when to play around with emotions, such as when a destroyed enemy helicopter drops a letter. Sure it's just bonus points to you, but for that soldier, it was probably a letter from a loved-one. It was still sealed, so maybe he was going to read it after the battle.\n\nAll of this would be irrelevant if the actual games weren't any good. Needless to say, this isn't the case. Metal Slug is a master-class in Run & Gun game-design. The controls are loose enough so that you can freely rush through enemy territory, but they're also subdued and accurate for when you need to prioritize survival over everything. Like most other shooters, the heroes of MS die in one hit. Being able to shift between situations of wildly varying intensity is massively important. Nazca accomplishes this goal via one running speed, mid-air controllable jumps, grenades, and the ability to shoot in multiple directions. In these games (aside from later post-Nazca entries) there aren't any special moves like slides, dodge-rolls, or parries. You have to read every moment, consider every possibility, and make the movements that keep you out of danger.\n\nThe phrase "doing a lot with very little" is one I just love to throw around, and it definitely applies to Metal Slug 1. This is a short game, and it doesn't have the enemy and stage variety of its sequels. However, this game has enough presence of mind to play with ideas, employ the same foes in different fashion, and create moments that remain exciting even on replays. The tight mechanices and game-design allow you plenty of room to focus on improving. Every time you die, you'll know exactly how it happened, and you can quickly mull over where it all went wrong, in the brief seconds before your next life appears on-screen.\n\nMetal Slug also establishes a lot of the rules of the series. Not only do the heroes die in a single hit, but there aren't any extra lives. In fact, since all POWs are lost upon death, you pretty much have to adopt a "1-life" mindset if you're playing for score. In arcade games, we tend to look at lives as resources. I know when I reach the final boss of a 2D shooter, I do an inventory of all of the lives & bombs in-stock. I know what I can afford to expend, in order to guarantee that clear. This approach simply doesn't work for Metal Slug. These three lives represent three chances, you have to protect them...well..like they're your own. Obviously that's extremely difficult due to the armies you have to contend with, but over-time you work everything out.\n\nHonestly though, even if you approach this series with the mindset of "I don't want to worry about 1CCs, 1LCs, or any of that other stuff" you can still have a lot of fun. The moment-to-moment combat is just so visceral it's a reward in itself when heavy-machinegun fire chews through half a dozen soldiers, or a shotgun blast rends a tank into nothingness. Simply playing these games, without a specific goal in mind, is just flat-out glorious entertainment.\n\nWhile it's easy to say that the sequels are better, there's a level of simplicity and charm that absolutely fits Metal Slug 1. Feel free to revisit it whenever you have the opportunity. Oh but just one thing, while I have all the praise in the world for these games, I don't have anything nice to say about Dotemu.\n\n*I count Metal Slug X as a separate entry.","December 24, 2015","true","8.6"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","31","34","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rgk/recommended/366250/","rgk","rgk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rgk/","357 products in account","The first Metal Slug, initially released in 1996 is the game that set the bar for run'n'gun games. It had everything to succeed, gorgeous 2D graphics and animation, accessible controls, smooth and packed action, various enemy types and well crafted level design to make use of the enemy types and renew the gameplay. It was an instant classic, seducing the heart of players mainly in the Arcades since not so many people owned a Neo Geo, and Metal Slug was so popular that you would find Arcade machines of it almost everywhere. The possibility to play in 2 player cooperation also contributed to the fun and appeal of the game.\n\nMetal Slug set the blueprints for the formula that would be perfected in Metal Slug X (a revamped version of Metal Slug 2), and brought to an entirely new level in Metal Slug 3. In comparison to those, the first Metal Slug is easier, much shorter, less epic, offers far less variety in enemy types and backgrounds, so for someone with limited buying power I would recommend the aforementioned games instead. And for everyone that already has the two others, Metal Slug 1 is indeed worthy to sit in the collection as it is a great game in itself. If Metal Slug X and 3 were not out yet, I would say that Metal Slug 1 is essential!\n\nThe port and content are very similar to the previous Metal Slug games from DotEMU, meaning that the player can choose the amount of starting credit (including unlimited), choose whether to play through the whole campaign or start from a specific mission, has leaderboards for all difficulty settings, and most importantly allows for local and online coop. All kinds of controllers are recognized, which is nice considering that many games are so lazy they only recognize the XBox type controllers. The previous Metal Slug ports had slight sound issues that could pop up, I have not encountered any problem in this version yet but some people did. Also, not sure if it is because of the port or being the first game in the series and still perfunctory, but there are some occasional slight input issues: when trying to perform multiple actions at the same time, like throw a grenade and shoot, one of the actions just seems to be ignored unlike in the other Metal Slug games.\n\nI personally use the HQ4X filter described in this guide, it was written for Metal Slug X but since the engine and file organization are similar, everything works just fine.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com//sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=321706061\n\nSo overall I recommend this game to those that already have the most important Metal Slug games (2 and X) and want more content to their Metal Slug collection. Otherwise, wait for the inevitable price drop.\nIn any case, do not miss out on the Metal Slug series as it is gorgeous and fun, and surprisingly robust to the test of time, unlike many old games that now feel dated or clunky.\n\nWhat next would I want from the Metal Slug series? Metal Slug 6 is the next in line with epic story and original new content. This is the one I want to see most. Then Metal Slug XX (a revamped Metal Slug 7). However Metal Slug 5 and to a lesser extent Metal Slug 4 could come next as they were also released on Neo Geo and their port would probably be easier. In any case, more content is better as this whole series is fun to play.","June 28, 2015","true","16.1"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","24","26","0","0"

If you've played one Metal Slug, you've played them all and they're all worth playing several times. This is the one that started them all and its a thirty minute joy ride for one or two players simultaneous. The Steam version has online multiplayer, but unless you bring along a friend, there's no one playing.\n\nIf there is a plot to the game, I'd say an evil dictator has conquered a land and you alone must liberate it, slaughtering hundreds of soldiers along the way. There's blood, guts, gore as you shoot enemies dead, in half or even light them on fire. Oh but its more than just troops you'll be wrecking, its a slew of vehicles like tanks, helicopters, bulldozers, metal walls, planes and various other metal monstrosities.\n\nThe game play is a bit sluggish, but that's the price you pay for such great animation. You can fire in four directions and crouch when shooting, but who needs that when you can just shoot enemies dead. To fire downward, you'll need to jump and this is the formula for some of the bosses, leap and fire down. If an enemy is next to you, then you'll knife them. Its a nice little detail. Other than your primary gun, you've got a limited supply of grenades. Metal Slug is a game about endurance, how long can you shoot for, because there's no auto fire outside of specific weapons.\n\nAlong the way, you'll rescue blonde cave men prisoners-of-war that will reward you with items worth points, extra ammunition and more importantly, weapons. There are a few weapons, but they all have a lot of impact. Flamethrowers will char soldiers. Shotguns will rip them in half. A heavy machine gun has a lot of firepower. Rockets will somewhat seek out enemies.\n\nAt least once per level, you'll get your own Metal Slug tank that diversifies the action. In this tank you have two turrets, one replaces your bomb and can only fire to the right. The other is a standard gun that swivels depending how long you hold the direction. Its unique and can take a lot of punishment. When the tank is about to explode it warns you to jump out or you'll die.\n\nOh but even if a tank doesn't get you, the enemy bullets will. They come in from all directions and while the first level is easy enough, the challenge ramps up accordingly. Soldiers will parachute in, jump in from water, run in to knife you.\n\nThis version of Metal Slug brings a modernization of achievements, video options and controls for keyboard or the 360 controller. I have a feeling that this is emulation rather than a true PC port, because the game will slow down just like the real Neo Geo version when appropriate.\n\nWhile the game is tough, freeplay makes it forgiving and if you're looking for a challenge, there are four levels of difficulty. For anyone looking to have their name in fame, you'll find an online leader board.\n\nSo if you've played one Metal Slug, you've played them all, what makes this one different? This one is a straight up army action game before the series went too far over the top fighting snowmen, turning into zombies spitting blood and being frozen into a snowman. It also has one protagonist even if they all seem to play the same.\n\nOther than that, there's just different level design. Later Metal Slugs let you chose different paths while this one puts you on a straight path headed for the boss. You'll trudge through city streets and see people running for their lives. Packs of dogs will run by. You'll crush parked cars in your tank. One level has you climbing an ice mountain. A building will collapse on you and you'll crawl out. Another level has you battling next to a cliff with tanks rolling over the edge to try and crush you.\n\nI've mentioned the amazing animation, but the graphics in general are stellar. They have their own style that makes the game stand out from others in the genre. Its a blend of quirky, cartoon and realism. Its such a good style that the other Metal Slug games kept the graphics. The music and sound effects also do a lot to add to an already incredible game.\n\nWhile there are better Metal Slugs out there, even the worst of the series is still far better than most games out there. Its worth playing for the first time or the one hundredth.","January 9","true","0.7"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","19","20","2","0"

The game works almost perfectly.

There is also a online mode where you can play alongside your friends.\n\nThe game however has one slight issue and that is the game runs quite poorly. I noticed quite a few stutters while playing.

When I was a kid I played few times with it because obviously the Difficulty level was cranked up (or maybe I just wasn't any good at all with it... XD). And years later there was an old friend of mine with the classic Neo-geo emulator full of Metal Slug releases, and he was a huge fan always playing with them. I rarely played with him as I wasn't still any good. Now I own it on Steam and I can kick some @$$... Except I'm still not that good XD. I'm trying right now to Complete it on Easy without any continue, to no avail until now.\nAnyways This is one of the most classic scrolling shooter. How can I describe it? It's a complete mayhem: one man alone (or 2 if you play with a friend) against an entire army of soldiers, helicopters, tanks and planes.\nYou just go ahead spamming the fire key, throwing here and there a couple of grenades, getting some special weapon hidden around or once you free the POWs, maybe hopping inside a usable tank you could stumble upon. End of the gameplay. Sounds lame, but it's not. This is what you call simple but effective because it's fun and even more if you consider you can Coop with a friend on the same machine or on LAN.\nOf course this is not the latest eye candy engine, it's plain 2d but it looks nice, cartoonish, it's full of references and if you consider it's a game originally published in 1996 you can see some nice animations.\n\n+++Pros+++ GAMEPLAY. A scrolling Shooter with very simple mechanics, various weapons, final bosses, minor bosses and so on. Very Simple and very fun. Replayability is guaranteed if you like challenges because they've added achievements which will require hours of gameplay to collect.\nCOOP. Clearly this game is way more fun with the help of a friend and you can play both on the same computer and online. Smart move.---Cons--- PORT ISSUES. This isn't the best porting ever. I've had plenty issues like Screen Resolution Bugs which caused me problems if I try to set my native 1080p, as it just crops visualizing just the upper left corner of the screen, so I had to play in 720p... Which is not that bad issue as it's not like I'm going to miss high res textures or stuff like that. Another issue came out when I tried to play Coop With my friend both on my PC, I couldn't edit keys for gamepad, and it automatically recognize it as P1 not allowing to choose which input plays which P, forcing me to bind my keys as P2... Which I have to bind back as P1 when I have to play on my own. Not to mention the performance issues, lots of player (if not all of them) noticed there are huge FPS drops in overcrowded situations... Which is ridiculous considering the game and the "engine".\nDURATION. This is a short cabin game so I knew I shouldn't expect anything exceptional, yet I still complain about its lenght as 6 missions are few to me. Even though it's a right lenght considering this is a quick game designed for quick rushes. Luckily I bought this with the Metal Slug Bundle, so I still have a way to go on B-)","January 7","true","12.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

I had reservations before I purchased this game, since I can just keep playing all of Metal Slug games for free, and now I have regret for my purchase. If you emulate this on MAME you have way more configuration options, and it will run better.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/366250/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1599 products in account","Mission Start! Metal Slug is the original arcade run and gun classic that spawned an entire 10+ game franchise. Originally released in 1996, this game has seen a multitude of reincarnations over the years; from NeoGeo, to Sega Saturn, then to Playstation, then the Wii, and now finally to Steam. If you're not familiar with the style and format of Metal Slug, I highly suggest that you check out my Metal Slug X review, which outlines what sets this series apart from other arcade/run and gun titles.\n\nAs opposed to later installments in the series, Metal Slug is quite limited in the fact that you only have two characters to choose from; fan favorites Marco and Tarma. It is the year 20XX A.D., and General Morden is ready to take control of the world; luckily for the world, you are there to stop him and his Rebel faux-Nazi Forces from taking over. You will do this by slaughtering hundreds of armed forces, and saving dozens of P.O.W.s from them, over the course of 6 missions. The game is indeed short, probably the shortest of the entire series, and it clocks in at a little over an hour. As I said in my Metal Slug X review, it's very important to remember that these titles were coin-grabs back in the arcade days, and even though the original Metal Slug is the easiest of the lot, players at the time were spending hours and dozens of dollars to eventually beat the game. The lack of longevity in this day can easily be forgiven, so long as we remember the past reasons why the game was so short.\n\nA large "gripe" that I've noticed in both Steam reviews and the forums is the "slow down" that this title "suffers". As with the Mega Man Legacy Collection, the slow downs are intentional, and it only happens when there are a large quantity of explosions and enemies simultaneously on the screen. This effect was left in to bring out that true retro feeling, and if you have an in-game FPS counter, you can easily tell that the framerate never drops below 60. When Metal Slug first launched on Steam, it had a fair share of issues that included stuttering and the screen going white, but these issues have since been fixed and the game runs just fine now.\n\nThe Steam incarnation of Metal Slug features the original Arcade Mode, where the missions must be completed in one sitting, and Mission Mode, which is essentially a mission select option. There are also leaderboards for your highscore viewing pleasure, and online co-op; though, unfortunately, there is not a local co-op option. While the latter problem may be a turn off for some people, the truth of the matter is that Metal Slug can run on a toaster, so just plug one in and play with your pal online.\n\nNo matter which way you turn it, Metal Slug is one of the ultimate arcade classics of the 90's, and it shouldn't be passed up here on Steam. Hopefully, with the right amount of support, SNK and DotEmu will decide to unleash the remainder of the series on this platform; although judging by the amount of reviews and forum activity, the games are getting recognition from their already loyal cult following, rather than attracting new recruits. Nevertheless, if you're interested in a short, but fun and intense arcade shooter, Metal Slug is your game of choice. Save P.O.W.s, kill Rebel Forces and aliens, beat huge bosses, die a thousand deaths, enjoy the lavishly detailed screens, drool over the entrancing soundtrack, grab your weapon of choice, and enjoy yourself to the bitter end. Mission All Over!\n\nRating: 4.5/5.0 - Excellent, highly worth playing.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","March 23","true","1.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I just don't recommend any of them.\n\n✓ Good ol' button smashing arcade goodness\n✓ Decent replayability value\n✓ It's Metal Slug! RUN AND GUN, DIE AND REPEAT\n\n✗ 30 minutes long (I'm not joking, look at my playtime and achievements)\n✗ You can only play as Marco\n✗ Missions are average at best (detailed below)\n✗ The final boss is incredibly disappointing\n✗ Noticeable choppiness during intense action, despite the game being constantly at 60fps\n\nPersonal thoughtsThis is the first game in the series so no wonder it falls short in many aspects, but honestly, why didn't DotEmu port this first and then the others? If you play MS3, MSX and then MS1, you'll miss a lot of stuff and the game will feel bland and boring.\n\nNot only there's a single character (Marco), this Metal Slug easily has the shortest and easiest campaign so far (despite playing in Hard). There is no air combat, submarine combat or air combat, just the typical "tank" in pretty much every mission. The enemies are all the same (soldiers) throughout the entire game and there are no novelties (there are zombies in MGSX) or anything noteworthy... it's just run and gun, die over and over again, get to the final boss and next level.\n\nI mean, that's the formula for every Metal Slug ever, but everything just feels so average in this one. So far it's the most boring one, and just like I say in every one of my Metal Slug reviews: don't buy it unless you played it as a kid or the disappointment will be even bigger.","August 15, 2015","false","16.3"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

Don't know if it's the same as others, but in my end, the game has problems with slowdowns, the FPS is not optimized well and the music audio is borked as hell. If I compare this to other 2D games in my library, my computer can run incredibly well games like Dust: An Elysian Tail or Rogue Legacy, and if I compare this to the port of Metal Slug X, it's quite the downgrade, because even with some slowdown issues, it had no problem with the FPS and had the audio intact as far as I could tell. Considering this port came a year after the ports of X and 3, there's simply no excuse for this lazy hack job and even then, this is a game that's been out for about 20 years, and because it already had past ports, there shouldn't be that much problem putting a PC version. I will not be surprised this was ported just so fans eat the game up regardless of quality.\n\nUnless you have money to burn (and even then, this can be bought cheap on sale), I can't recommend this port on good will. If you want to experience the original game, buy the Metal Slug Anthology, get the Wii's Virtual Console re-release or even outright emulate if you don't have problem with that.","May 13","false","2.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/darctini/recommended/366250/","darctini","darctini","http://steamcommunity.com/id/darctini/","95 products in account","Metal Slug (Japanese: メタルスラッグ Hepburn: Metaru Suraggu?) is a series primarily of run and gun video games created by SNK. Spin-off games include a third-person shooter and a tower defense game. Originally created for Neo-Geo arcade machines and game consoles, the original games have also been ported to other consoles, with several later games created for various other platforms. The games focus on the Peregrine Falcon Squad, a small group of soldiers who fight against a rebel army, aliens and various other forces intent on world domination.\nThe gameplay of the series is characteristic of run and gun games: large numbers of enemies and a player character with extremely powerful weapons. In most run and guns, contact with an enemy leads to annihilation.[citation needed] In this series, however, contact results in the opportunity to perform a melee attack and the opportunity for the enemy to perform a melee attack of his own, if he has one. The player's melee attack is also much stronger than most shots. This leads to the players ability to run in and use melee attacks to take down a number of enemies, and the ability to quickly defeat enemies that can take plenty of damage, such as the mummies in Metal Slug 2.\n\nThe player starts with only a simple handgun; as the game progresses, the player may pick up new weapons. The player can only use one weapon at a time. When a new weapon is found, it replaces the previous one. Similarly, when ammunition runs out, the player reverts to using the handgun, which has unlimited ammunition. A new system was implemented with Metal Slug 6 allowing players to carry and switch between the handgun and two other weapons.\n\nThe SV-001 (SV being an abbreviation for "Super Vehicle") or 'Metal Slug' is the main vehicle of the Metal Slug franchise. It is a small, cartoonish silver-gray tank. The tank is armed with one cannon and twin vulcan cannons. The vehicle can jump and crouch. Crouching opens a hatch on the top of the tank through which grenades can be thrown. The grenades are independent of the cannon's ammunition system. The vehicle can run over infantry and perform a suicide attack, with the driver jumping clear and the tank ramming into and exploding upon the target. The vehicle can take three direct hits before it is destroyed. The enemy chaser variant has a shield that must be destroyed before the vehicle can be destroyed. It is propelled by caterpillar treads. Over time, these specifications changed into any vehicle armed with a vulcan cannon and a cannon variant suited to the role of the vehicle, and propelled suitably for that vehicle's environment. In Metal Slug 6 (and the home version of Metal Slug X, 3, 4, 5), the playable character Tarma can lock the vulcan cannons into one position and fire continuously.\n\nMetal Slug games typically have 6 levels. The exceptions are Metal Slug 3 and Metal Slug 5 which have 5 and Metal Slug 7 which has 7. In several of the arcade and console versions, the game would have the blood censored, showing white blood instead of red. However, there is a code to disable this censor.\n\n","January 11","true","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

Now you can! Destroy enviornments and crawl around in an adorable tank in this SNK classic. Featuring some of the best backgrounds in the series, and fun platforming to match, Metal Slug is the first of four releases by Nazca that make Metal Slug one of the best video game trilogies out there.\n\nUnfortunately the features outside of the game don't fare as well. Once again SNKPlaymore has chosen to ship Metal Slug to PC with DotEmu, which worked great for 3, questionably for X, and fared much worse with 1. Frame drops during mission intros and endings, plenty of places ingame where lots of things onscreen at once cause slowdown.\n\nProblems extend into the game's menu. Keeping the original intro is great, and having game art on the menus is better. However, there still is no gallery mode following the absence of one in X despite 3 having one. The Nazca games have wonderful art direction, and many people would love to further appreciate the art of the series by having access to an ingame gallery.\n\nIt's not Metal Slug 3, and it certainly isn't worth the same price as 3, but Metal Slug is worth a buy if you want a piece of 2D gaming history.","September 21, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One of the things I always enjoyed about the games was the fact it really pushed what we can do in terms of pixelated graphics. The Metal slug series in itself has some of the most outstanding pixel art I've seen thus far. The gameplay is quick and difficult, taking time to master and remember where the secrets, enemies, powerup's, etc... are located and how to deal with them. Overall a fun experience for any gamer.","January 2","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No dump settings, pop controller in, start game, readjust Controls (if necessary) and on goes the party. People complaining about horrific Controller Support shouldn't buy bad Gamepads ;)\n\nTotal: Good game, above-average port, bought it on sale for about 7€ for the MS1-3-Bundle, good Controller Support = having fun with it and do not regret spending those few bucks on it :)\n\nSo: If you like retro-Contra-Style Shoot'em'ups -> Get this one if you didn't have it","February 6","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
