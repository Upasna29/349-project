As you explore the environments you can discover multiple paths that can lead you to hidden secrets and content. I was honestly paranoid and scared from the very start even when nothing had attacked me yet. Eventually you will come up against enemies that will chase you down Amnesia style and you must avoid them. This game is currently in early access so it's not a complete game and I did come across glitches and annoying level design flaws but that will be fixed during early access I'm sure. I really recommend trying Montas out for yourself if you enjoy horror games.\n\nHere is my video preview of Montas: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpY5Y-rvDfo","March 24, 2014","true","1.8"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","20","28","0","0"

Especially when you set the game to top notch settings. If you have Oculus Rift, terrifying terrific.\n-Great ambience. Sometimes the music and the sounds get me instead. Imagine going down a corridor and constantly hearing "Someone's here. Leave." whispered to your ears. Get a good pair of headphones!\n-Very immersive. There's a whole town waiting to be explored. I haven't mentioned the sewer system, have I?\n-Scary. Yes, scary. About the game's horror-o-meter, besides only a few cheap scares, there are elevators, hallways, and illuminating corners. Plus, as I mentioned the sound effect is enough to bring you a good horrifying experience. There are enemies, too. The cool thing is that there's little time for you to react when seeing enemies, and they usually appear out of nowhere. Test your guts, and your mind.\nCONS\n-The game is still in the testing phase. That gives it bugs like frame drops. Frame drops are significantly reduced as of update #7.\n-Light effects are not as good. Sometimes, as you go around corners, the lights go out. This is more of a minor annoyance, really.\n-Enemies are not too smart. Just run like hell away from them and you'll be fine. I really expected something more challenging.\n-The character moves at a snail pace.\n-It's pretty difficult to move things around.\n-Inventory system is still incomplete.\n-Some market-sold computers might not be able to handle the graphics. I test the game on Intel HD Graphics 4000 and Intel Core i7 2.00GHz processor, which runs smoothly but gets choppy in certain highly-detailed and illuminated areas.\n\nOverall: 8.5 out of 10.

The city is very much open with plenty of dark corners and secrets, you can go wherever you want, if you are not too afraid to go there...\nThe atmosphere is amazingly creepy, most of the time you have no idea of what's going on and what's real and what's not and if you are dreaming or awake and that makes you fear the game and trust nothing in the game.\nLighting is great, sound is also good, there are a few glitches some frame rate drops, some animations also need polishing but this is still a beta.\n\nHave in mind that this is not the final product but if you are an horror fan you should at least try it.","March 24, 2014","true","1.3"," 32 of 53 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","32","53","0","0"

The movement is extremely slow, from normal speed walking to what seems to be sprinting, or what I would call, "running knee deep in mud."  It gets to the point where you become so frustrated because you are being controlled by the game's slow movement speed and animations.  You feel confined and you cannot go at your own pace.  I feel as though the developer was not confident enough in their design to allow the player to move at their own pace.  I find this to be a major drawback.  After several minutes in "slow-mo," I started to feel nauseated and frustrated at the same time.\n\nThe platforming, due to the slow movement speed, can be a frustrating task.  I fell a few times due to the clunky, slow movement speed of walk and run.  Mind you, I have played more than my fair share of platformers since the 90s.  I am not claiming to be an expert at platforming, but character movement speed and fluidity is important if you want to platform properly.\n\nAnother glaring flaw in Montas are the visuals, which is splattered with blur effects and post processing effects that only add more to a distorted image.  It is difficult to enjoy the scenery when every pixel is smeared with post processing effects that ruins the game's visual fidelity.\n\nOverall, I do not feel like Montas is worth playing due to these setbacks.  By the time you proceed to the "scary" and "horror" elements in your dark journey, you find yourself pulled away from the atmosphere that is nothing more than a void.  To further add fuel to the fire, the opening sequence did not draw me in, nor did it introduce me to anything I would be interested in playing.  The terrible pacing that feels like you are being mind controlled by the developers in a horrid dream, hampers any sense of imagination and player choice.\n\nMontas feels like a game without proper direction and it is poorly executed.  And I do not mean to rub salt on the wound, but it is no wonder why Montas was in a PC bundle deal a few months ago that went for as low as $1 for entry donation.  The developers do not even have confidence in their own product.  I would not recommend it to any of my friends.\n\nRating:  5 out of 10","August 4, 2014","false","1.2"," 25 of 41 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","25","41","0","0"

You have no idea what you're doing, you follow your instinct. Normally, this would be a bad thing, however the way they give you all the choises of where you can go, it makes you feel free from the story and that you can do whatever you want. When you finally get to a place where you were supposed to get to, you're like......wow, too bad i didn't explore more, OH WAIT i can always just go back and check the things out that i missed! :D. This game requires you to spend time in it, and to explore every single corner of the game. Also, not to mention that this game will give you a heart attack without using the ultimate power of pop ups. The sound in the game is enough to make you want to press escape and instantly just want to click that exit game button as soon as possible. The effects can really just start taking over and you just feel in danger and like you should run 4 ur lyf. There was literaly where i was pushed to a point where i just pressed Alt+F4 because of a scary noise that kept going louder and louder.\n\nSome Fun/Funny Times I Had:\nAlright....soooooo..without giving any spoilers here, i got out of some sewers and i decided HEY LET'S PICK UP A TRASH-CAN AND PUSH IT AGAINST THE MONSTERS FACE THE WHOLE TIME TO DODGE IT :D, without expecting it to work ofcourse, i tried it and it worked, so it kept walking into the trashcan, and i was like AH! D: and held the trashcan up a bit higher, then he was stuck underneath the trashcan and i slammed the trashcan down, and poof, i murdered a monster (and by that i pushed him to glitch completely into the ground). My reaction: O.O ...... wut did i just do....\n\nI would give this game a 8/10 for being fun and enforcing exploration, not to mention keeping it's horror gamestyle. I can't give it a 10/10 considering it's still in beta, however the score might go up once the game is fully released.

Pros:  Great ambience, and suspense.  Cons:  Playability is tedious, I feel corraled and guided in ditections.  Exploration leads to mostly dead ends.  Not enough backstory, or point to the game.  Not enough items or interactions with items.\n\nAdvice would be to put some form of crosshairs to aid in interactions with items, put more items, more backstory, don't seal areas off leaving only one path.  Having played from the begining several times and having had a good amount of game expereinece, I find the initial challenge frustrating afte the frist elevator ride down so odd and difficult that I suspect their is no sollution other than to die.  The second challenge once you get ouf of the white room again seems the only way to progress is again to die.\n\nAll in all I'm dissapointed in the game because I think you have something here, but find it mostly tedious and the time I spent playing up to this point,   was time wasted.  Perhaps it's just not my type of game.\n\nI think any person who was in a situation like that would find any kind of a weapon for defense, and if I wanted answers out of those locked offices I'd break those windows and get into them.  I'd read the crumpled papers on the floor and in trash, move pictures to find anything behind them, and certainly a light switch lol in an office area.\n\nI hope the game improves becuase like I said you've got something there, but it's very time consuming and frustrating.","May 11, 2014","false","12.7"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","12","21","0","0"

Will Update On Final Release:\n\nMontas is a horror game for the person who doesnt want to ever feel safe. The world can change around you just because you aren't looking at it; although not in huge manners, more like smaller, creepier ways. Many times I've walked down a hallway, only to turn around an find that some horrifying mannerism of an enemy has formed behind me. With no attack function (which only adds to the horror of the game, just like Outlast) i have to flee, hoping that the elevator I called has arrived and that the doors will close in time for me to escape.\n\nMontas is a great game to keep you on for toes and scared to look around doors and corners. However, it does have many flaws, because it is an early access game at this point.\n\nFlaws include the inability to change the key mapping (making it impossible for laptop users to play if they don't have a mouse), intermittent issues with the player falling through the floors or being catapulted across the map, objects becoming stuck or broken; many of these are the usual issues an EA game could suffer from.\n\nThe developers were silent for several month but recently uploaded a new patch and have been active in the discussions where players have been reporting said flaws and bugs. I hope that in the future, these bugs will be fixed and I am very excited for the final product (if i'll be able to finish it without crying from fear)\n\nIf you can cope with the flaws of the current status and you are a fan of horror games, such as Outlast, Slender etc. then I urge you to support the game developer and give Montas a try :)","November 29, 2014","true","2.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

You know a game has good atmosphere when ten minutes in a flying manhole cover causes you to scream and flinch, along with whomever is watching over your shoulder. The minor bugs in no way impeded gameplay, might have just eased the tension a bit. Some say don't buy since it isn't finished but I say do so.

The game itself is still in early access and very raw because there's only two developers working on it at the moment. But even with that, I would say it is a success.\n\nThe game immersed me and was very fun to play and the art is very creepy / good. The subtle scares, the tension all leading up to a conclusion really did make this game stand out among all those jumpscare-throwing games.\n\nKeep in mind when purchasing, the game is far from finished and might look very different later on.","March 24, 2014","true","1.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Because if not, a $9.99 price tag is kind of unacceptable. Hopefully they'll add more content, areas, length, etc. during Early Access. I loved the atmosphere, the creepy/subtle scares, and sound design, I'll give it that. It has to be one of the most unique horror games I've ever jumped into. The ending though, made the least of sense. Montas is still worth checking out though, even in the state that it's in.

The style and the feel were right up my alley. But the devs have thoroughly disappointed me. Even excited players who still want the game get no response from the devs on the forums. Their last 'news' post on the game was from last year. The last update on their Facebook page was from a couple weeks ago, and it was about a local music show. Their last update about *the game* was 3 months ago. It appeared to be basic character animations that weren't even actually implemented in the game yet. A lot of them sucked.\n\nI was somebody who was really excited about this game when it first went into Early Access. I told other people about it and got a friend of mine to play because it seemed like such a cool title, that was different from most of the other horror games out there. But it's been ♥♥♥♥ing abandoned - and they attempt, ever so slightly, to make it look like it's not, by making vague posts with NO real information. Middle of last year, they said that they were making TONS of progress, that everything was going swimmingly - and what did their video update from 3 months ago have to show? Crap character models running and falling down on flat untextured surfaces. Another crap character model sitting down in a way that looks fake as all hell. Oh, and COINS falling. COINS! Coins which take all of 5 minutes to make. THIS is what they have to show after two years! Not even a ten second pre-rendered cut-scene with a character or two doing something IN the game. Just a few individual models running like morons to Benny Hill music.\n\nDon't buy this ♥♥♥♥ unless they get their act together and finish the ♥♥♥♥ing game. Otherwise, you're probably getting ripped off like the rest of us who have bought it.","February 9","false","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In Montas, you play as Joseph Walker, an alcoholic accountant who suffers from anxiety and depression. Joseph also suffers from unsettling hallucinations and is haunted by nightmares of things that never happened. The game is set in the city of Montas, and you move throughout the city as you play. Montas is currently in development, and so still has some issues with level design, AI and game breaking bugs. The game delivers a very captivating atmosphere with well chosen unsettling ambient music. The volume of the music and other sound effects help to deliver the unsettling, horror atmosphere, with booming distant sounds and faint whispers all present. Although at one point the audio does not fit the atmosphere of horror, this however, was due to poor level design. The room has a goal that is not easy to find causing you to wander around with a man whispering in your ear “Come Joseph”, this becomes much more homoerotic instead of frightening. Also, the movement in Montas feels extremely limiting. The walking pace is distractingly slow causing you to feel as though you are dragging a boulder at all time.  Running does relieve this slightly, but running and walking seem to swap at random with no explanation. Trying to open doors is also confusing, requiring you to hold right click and then drag the door with your whole body. This confusion is further increased when trying to identify actual doors from painted walls , making you click and drag on every door hoping it might open. This click and drag system does however work strangely well when interacting with other items in the world, such as boxes and tables. It gives the items a satisfying feeling of weight, making you drag furniture across a room rather than throw it. At certain points world items can fall through the floor and beyond reach, thankfully these items were not needed to continue playing the game. It is likely that these issues would be fixed upon full release due to Montas being an early access game\n\nMontas appears to be a game about the mind. Walking through a city like a nightmare, never really explaining itself but always seeming to make sense in the moment but never in hindsight. This interpretation gives an explanation for the limited walking speed and the lack of strength of the player. The meaning behind the game may change with further updates, but currently appears to be a representation of a nightmare. All in all, Montas has potential. Currently it uses classic video game tropes proficiently emphasising on intrusive audio and dim lighting. It gives a very interesting and somewhat disorienting feeling with the path it encourages you to take, making it feel almost dream like as a whole. The game provides great scares, but just has a few kinks here and there to iron out, but all will come in time.","March 28","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
