You'll probably die a few times, but not a slaughterfest.\n-Good progress of enemies getting tougher, more numerous, and more diverse and dangerous as you get Truths.\n-Excellent storyline, so many twists and turns!  Unlike other choice based games, all of your choices actually matter.\n-Humor, it's a hurricane of puns, cultural references, fantasy references, sci fi references, etc.\n-Very fun to play, I played through it in a day, because I couldn't set it down for long.\n-Replayability is very high, there are many, many different endings, and even after you've gotten the true(best) one, you can still go back and find out what happens in all the others.\n\nCons:\n\n-Length.  It's not short by any means, especially with the replayability, but you only really have to play through 5 times (The first 4 to collect secret "truths").\n-Enemies just can't keep up with you, they more or less scale with your character's capabilities, but combine your burgeoning skill with it, and if you're like me, you'll end the game wishing there was an endless attack mode with enemies getting more and more aggressive/numerous  just for giggles, training, and pure ridiculouslness of what you can get up to.\n-This is going to be a butt to play without a controller, aiming in precise directions (gl with arrow keys) is pretty necessary for precision.  A joystick would probably work great though.\n-A couple of minor button failures where I would just stand in place pressing the same button and nothing happening.  Pressing any other button would instantly unstick me though, and it might very well have been due to my controller/drivers instead of the game.\n\nVerdict:  It's a very good game.  Get it, you won't be disappointed.  It's not a super expensive game, and it delivers exactly what it promises in a very slick, polished and fun way.  Oh and the combat system is epic.  There's just no other way to put it.  Play it for the combat system alone.","April 17","true","5.8"," 37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","37","41","0","4"

Pretty innovative the different branches with different endings.\nA good attempt about Swords, Gems, Levelling up swords etc. Sadly all of this is totally pointless, if not with the purpose of killing faster the mobs. There are only 5 kind of Mobs and no bosses, and the different doors are hiding just shortcuts or other (useless) treasures,\n\nPlaying through different scenarios is fun at the beginning, but it becomes quickly boring, especially after you unlocked all the 4 Truths. There is no real gameplay challenge, and if you die you respawn just in front of where you died.\n\nThat's fine since the strong point of the game is story-focused, but the levels are too long to play them over and over again.\nA "rewind" function to the previous choice would have been better instead of starting the story from scratch every time.\n\nI don't know, I don't feel satisfied from this gaming experience, even if I can't say is a bad game - if you are ok with "grinding" levels to unlock all endings and seek to the true ending, then it could worth your time/money.\nIf you want a good story AND good gameplay together, better look elsewhere.\n\n\n","April 18","false","5.9"," 71 of 110 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","71","110","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azralynn/recommended/439190/","Azralynn","Azralynn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azralynn/","472 products in account","Stories: The Path of Destinies is essentially a choose your own adventure game, but with a heavy focus on the narrative story and fluid combat system. It was almost as if you were experiencing Groundhog Day until you get it right.\n\nCheck out my Quick Review here: https://youtu.be/P1_4EzUFHE8\nBased on the choices you make, different stories take place. Most of the choices will inevitably lead to death in one way or another, but the narrative does a good job at making you think that this time, you might be on the right path to destiny. The stories you experience will give you clues or ‘truths’ that help you make the appropriate decisions to succeed.\n\nThe narrative reminded me a little bit of Bastion, but I liked the narrative better in Path of Destinies than I did in Bastion. In Path of Destines, the narrator reacts to what you’re doing and makes snide remarks, references to other games, and other cheesy puns. I didn’t think they were spammy or overdone, and I found them humorous at times, and I got a kick out of some of the comments. However, some people might not enjoy the snide remarks or appreciate them.\n\nThe combat reminded me of a super simple and dumbed down Batman Arkham style combat. Your successful attacks and counters add up on your combo streak, but there wasn’t any cool finishing moves to activate as combo steak gets higher. If you wanted to add some variation to the combat, you could also dash around, throw, and grapple hook enemies.\n\nThere were 4 swords that could be crafted with unique activated abilities. Using the abilities costs energy, but I usually just saved my energy in case I needed to heal. These swords also unlock special doors for hidden chests that contain gems you can equip. As you defeat enemies, you also gain xp, and level up to unlock skill points. Between obtaining new skill points, and gems, the combat gets even easier. Still, I really enjoyed the combat, even though it wasn’t very difficult.\n\nPros:music and sound effects were great and well suited\nvery strong, and well done narrative persistent throughout the whole game\nchoose your own adventure format results in multiple stories that can potentially take place based on the choices you make\nthe graphics were done very well in all parts of the world that you visit\nyou're free to explore and find chests to craft and upgrade your weapons\ncombat was very fluid and fast paced, jumping back and forth from one enemy to another\nyou can skip some of the dialog (after making your decision, and at the end of each chapter)\nCons:lacks control customization (the game is optimized for controllers)\ncombat was very forgiving, almost too forgiving - you didn’t have to time your counters or attacks properly, and they were all done with the same button press\nthere was a lot of revisiting places you’ve already been to, and they were mostly the same with some very minor changes, if any\nyou can't skip the dialog that starts off each chapter before you make your decision, and it gets very tedious and repetitive hearing what your choices are (again) when you try to go back to discover the stories you haven't completed yet\nAt first, I really liked the choose your own adventure format, but after discovering about 6 truths, and finishing the proper story line, I found it got much too repetitive. I really wanted to go back and play the rest of the story paths, but before you make each decision, you have to sit through the opening dialog, and you can’t skip it. I got really bored of listening to the same first few chapters, just to make a separate choice going into the later chapters. I would liked to have been able to just skip entire chapters that I already experienced all the decisions for, especially since I already beat the game.\n\nEach playthrough took 45-60 minutes, and I really did like the game a lot for the first 6-7 hours I played. I continued to play for a couple hours after that, and I probably would have kept playing to discover all the truths, but not being able to skip all the things I had already fully experienced was much too tedious to sit through over and over again. It was still a decent purchase though, and I don’t regret it.","April 13","true","8.7"," 31 of 44 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","31","44","3","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/recommended/439190/","Brian_Colfxire","Brian C. (The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","Coming after Moon Hunters with ambitious narrative ideas, I feel like a broken record for saying I admire this game as a failed experiment. Only I don't know what they were trying to accomplish.\n\nUpon first-impressions, the gamelay is Bastion with an Arkham style combat system, and yet the system is more shallow. The game boasts of its choice system in shaping future events--which is mostly true--however, the gameplay doesn't offer enough variation to keep you playing. And even when its novel concept shines, there are mistakes made that make the reward of the "good" ending feel cheap.\n\nThe best thing I can say is the game is functional and satisfying (for a while). Aside from the optomization issues on higher-end settings and some bugs that may impede your overall enjoyment, nothing about the gameplay is broken or bad. It's such a shame that it probably won't keep you playing to complete the whole journey.\n\nThe Most Non-Roguelite Roguelite That Ever Was (It's Not Really One)\nThe strangest complaint I have is that the game feels like it's in the wrong genre.\n\nThe trailer and description of STPD is one of learning from your mistakes in Reynold's quest to be a hero--and live to tell the tale. With roughly 45 mins to an hour and a half of a playthrough, the game is structured in a bite-sized format. The game encourages huge replaybability with 20+ hours of content. And the accumulation of your previous actions and newfound abilities will influence later playthroughs--storywise and gameplay.\n\nMaybe I am alone but this game seems perfect to be a rouge-lite. It wouldn't have to be brutally hard, maybe a casual-friendly one that emphasizes replaying for the narrative, but the game's structure would better suit that type of genre. And this is said by someone who detests rogue-lites.\n\nThe reason why I mention this idea is because some of the better qualities of roguelites would be to STPD's benefit. Specfically, procedurally generated environments as well as a diverse progression system, which are the two biggest problems with the gameplay. STPD simply gets way too samey way too fast.\n\nIn total, there are seven environments that use the same level-layout across all playthroughs. Every playthrough involves tackling five of these areas in some player-driven order, which starts off with three choices that all lead to the final area of the game (which is always the same). Unlocking new swords can shape your paths through these levels, but only for small detours for loot. When you get all four swords, these environments offer nothing new for exploration.\n\nSpeaking of unlocking new weapons, it won't take you that long to get your full arsenal maxed up. It took me under four hours without grinding (including the Gems), and afterwards you'll avoid finding chests because Gems/Resources are all randomly given to you, not in specific locations. Like the environments, progression reaches a point of becoming a blur.  Only the skill-tree will offer you something to look forward to get, but it requires grinding.\n\nUnfortunately, because of how the game is structured, you are expected to complete all 25 storylines with one character that carries over all your progression. There are no additional weapon types nor any difficulty modifiers to vary up either the gameplay or the difficulty. The result is that combat makes an otherwise novel approach to storytelling in games a chore to play.\n\nBa-Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba-Bastion!\nAgain, like with Moon Hunters, I find it hard to say a whole lot about the combat system because it's too simplified to stay interesting for what is a lengthy game (20+ hours). Unlike MH, STPD's combat is actually a good combat system.\n\nFighting boils down to being able to use your sword, grapple-hook and magical attack. You have a total of four swords which can either give you back health, boost your attack speed or do frost or fire damage. The grappling hook can be used to pull enemies in close, stun them or yank shields away. The sword can also do a parry manuever like Metal Gear Rising where you press the attack button in the direction of an oncoming attack, and the button can also be used to grab and throw enemies. Lastly, you have a dash manuever that can stun enemies.\n\nSkill-points can be used that can provide additional benefits like being able to dash through shields or to do damage with counter-attacks or grabs. They offer enough of a visual change to your fighting that they are more than stat-changes, and with the excellent fighting animation they are a good incenitive to keep playing.\n\nHowever, and what is the main problem, I have essentially listed the entire combat system there. For whatever reason the developers did not use all the buttons on a standard controller (no shoulder buttons or the left trigger). Not that I ever felt inequipped as I felt too powerful from the beginning to the end, even when I died. Death may even benefit you as you return with 50% health and energy.\n\nIt also doesn't help that for a simple fighting system there are only four mook varieties (one is only a stealthy enemy type) along with a super-form for them. Had the game kept adding additional enemy types like the first two runs, the replayabilty could have been tolerated with harder obstacles to make each playthrough more interesting.\n\nInstead of fleshing out the combat system, however, the rest of the game's attention was focused on the narrative. Something I think is moderately a success of an idea.\n\nA Tale of the Odds of Getting 6s 25 Times in a Row\nAs mentioned beforehand, this game's first impression is definitely one of Super Giant's style both of Bastion's art direction as well as narrator-voiced storytelling. I personally am happy to see other developers try their hands at the style, and STPD does the job adequately enough. If you can tolerate its sense of humor and expository writing.\n\nSTPD, like with Larian Studios, shares the same tongue-in-cheek writing quality that does its job to entertain you as you play as well as disarm you when things become grave. The trope-heavy, "so bad it's good" comedy is definitely not everyone's taste. However, it's hard to remember most lines as they are forgettable but I rarely ever heard a repeated phrase except at specific sections of the level.\n\nThe gist of STPD's storytelling idea is that you have to discover four hidden truths about related characters/items that will help Reynold figure out how he survives his adventure. Twenty-four out of the twenty-five stories are all "fail states", which isn't a spoiler as the trailer tells you this information.\n\nThankfully, you are not required to unlock them all. As soon as you have unlocked all four truths, you can then access the "Hero's Ending. It uses the information you learned to weave a story, pressumably of Reynold's invention, to make your own destiny. Had the game not explicty told you the solution the idea could've been something groundbreaking.\n\nWhat confuses me is that each time the narrator butts in there is an icon that shows something relevant to a past truth. The game doesn't let you piece together the connections yourself. Instead, the correct series of choices are forced upon you. (Sometimes a choice can even result in a game-over that forces you to replace the previous level.)\n\nI'm not sure why this was chosen but it ruins what could've been a reward to explore every scenario to solve the narrative like a puzzle from character studies and/or context clues. (Or at least more than four truths.)\n\nYou can't even make the correct series of options without finding all four truths first, so the "real ending" feels like a gimmick of an idea than an acheivable goal.\n\nThe Fault Lies Not in the Stars...But whoever gave Reynold the doomsday device.\n\nIf that's too cryptic: I had fun in spite of the obvious flaws of its far-reaching goals (and I may have challenged the odds.)","April 12","true","8.2"," 39 of 62 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","39","62","2","10"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yamalight/recommended/439190/","yamalight","yamalight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yamalight/","1769 products in account","Stories is quite different from most of the games out there.\nIt takes familiar elements and mixes them up into something refreshingly new (in my personal opinion).\n\nFirst of all, you have an amazing Bastion-like narrator with tons of really cool lines. I did hear a couple of repeated lines over my playtime but most was new every time. Oh, and by amazing I really do mean amazing - he voiced all game and it sounds insanely good.\nThen there's action combat very similar to a (somewhat simplified) version of Arkham combat. It starts very easy, but the longer you play, the tougher it gets to kill all the enemies.\nAnd, of course, there's an RPG-like progression - you got skills you can acquire, you got the gear you can upgrade. New gear will unlock new paths you can take in old levels.\nFinally, there's choose your own adventure style storytelling. Essentially you are tasked with picking the "winning" story. It won't be easy, though, since you won't get all the paths from the start - you'll have to fail a couple of times to figure out new ways to change the story.\n\nOne of the great things about Stories is the way levels are designed. There are not that many of them (5 or so?), but every time you'll go through one, your objective will be different. That'll mean you'll need to take a different path. And the cool thing is - there's no such thing as wrong path here. Almost all of them lead to your goal but through a slightly different area.\n\nSpeaking of downsides - I haven't actually found that many. I had zero game breaking bugs, but I did encounter two minor ones.\nFirst was getting stuck after dodge animation - dodging again fixed it. Second was falling through one of the elevators - I got teleported back to it instantly. Those'll probably get ironed out really quick.\n\nRepeating the same story might sound boring, but the thing is - you will get a slightly different story every time. It'll be different enough to keep you interested in figuring out what do you need to do to get a happy end. The only question is basically - do you like good stories?\n\nWatch more in-depth overview in the video:\nhttps://youtu.be/dAxpL3s9hvM","April 16","true","5.5"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","19","26","0","0"

Usually in many hilarious and unintended ways. Welcome to the book of Destinies. Where most of the time regardless of the route you take, things are going to end badly for you and your dear foxy hero. However, with each failure, you will learn, and the book of Destinies will rewind the timeline, allowing Reynardo to keep the knowledge he gains, precious as it is, to carry forth into the next attempt. Knowledge and hindsight are powerful things, and this book teaches that if you have the gift of hindsight, *use it*.\n\nA slightly different take on the Arkham system, combined with a -really- strong narrative thread makes for a spellbinding experience.\nThe game can be broken down into two beats. Narrative choices, where you'll uncover choices, all of which are mutually exclusive, so by travelling down one path, you'll close off another, and eventually lead you towards a specific destiny. The other part of the game is exploration of the map and combat, which is in part isometric exploration and part Arkham system combat, with a few twists. You have use of various elements like a dash that makes you all but ethereal in nature, allowing you to blink from place to place, and a grappling hook which you can use to pull shields away from particularly difficult ravens.\n\nOn top of this you have gems that you can socket which can heavily influence your playstyle, the socket system is fairly simple, but the choices are meaningful, in the same sense as the sword system which has a simple two level upgrade system for each sword, but each sword is meaningful too, serving both as a vital part of the combat arsenal AND as a key to unlock new areas to explore and uncover more loot.\n\nA complex tale of cats, foxes, rabits and frogs...\nThe story is masterful in its' delivery, rewriting itself as you complete each playthrough. As you learn more with each decision you make, the narrator, who is a masterful voice actor, will change the lines he reads, providing new insight and new information based on what Reynardo finds out. This in turn will shape future playthroughs, always ensuring that you're looking to see where the next ending might take you, and keeps the game feeling fresh and interesting. It's a very curious change from a lot of games where you tend to fall down pre-determined routes. Here you're exploring lots of different routes, and eventually through gradual discovery, you'll find the correct one.\n\nSpecial credit goes to the voice of the Narrator and the music, both of which deliver brilliant performances and I would -highly- recommend you take the time to listen to the music in game. It's well worth stopping for a moment to take in the atmosphere.\n\nClosing thoughts...\nSpearhead Games have delivered an absolutely excellent piece of narrative, and one that for all the complexities, lends itself well to the repeated, short, looping playthroughs that it offers, with each playthrough you learn more, and gain new information, with each loop, new elements come clear. Eventually, the path of Destinies will show Reynardo the way to victory...\n\n... or at least you'll have a lot of fun dying!\n\nVerdict : Essential","April 22","true","10.1"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DariusRaider/recommended/439190/","DariusRaider","DariusOne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DariusRaider/","1156 products in account","So far rather loving it. Firstly I´m playing with K&M and it´s serviceable though very clearly Stories has been built around the controller. The bulk of the game from combat to characters, visuals, music ect are as advertised in the trailers and screenshots so all around very enjoyable and well made. In particular the visuals/writing/characters are very storybook-ish and I´d say very charming. It has its issues but I´m hooked to this style so it´s great IMO.\n\nLength-wise(which was my biggest hesitation going in) Stories seems to pass with flying colors. This is a game built around multiple "playthroughs" with your upgrades intact, new areas unlocking and new truths about the world and characters being revealed depending on the choices you make. I have just gotten through my first playthrough(took about an hour) but the choices made very clearly change everything from story progression to levels visited. And as said upgrades stack. This cycle is also a part of the story with a definitive end in sight, and I see this game very much staying fresh up to that end and beyond(since the end clearly doesn´t require going through anywhere near every possible scenario).\n\nSo yeah it looks like Stories does the "choices matter" thing actually correctly, though it is very much built around those multiple playthroughs as well.  Can highly recommend as long as you don´t get a rash from a storybookish style.\n\nEDIT: After 8 hours, 9 playthroughs and having "finished" the game(still plenty of scenarios to go through) my thoughts remain largely the same, except I have been running into a bunch of technical difficulties. Most importantly my final pathbugged out pretty bad both times I tried it. I´ve also had my movement speed set to either way lower or way faster than intended about 4-5 times total now for one level after a combat sequence. Plus some more general performance issues.\n\nStill a worthy game especially if you roleplay a bit and try to make short 2-3 playthrough stories work out instead of just hammering through the variety of options. But the technical stuff does add up even though I usually don´t care much about it.\n\nEDITEDIT: also I appreciate the "godmode" given after completion, but It´s not optional and it really should be given how badly it ends up clashing with the stories.","April 12","true","17.7"," 24 of 37 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","24","37","0","1"

No commentary quicklook, first impressions below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5yIOvKdhg&list=PLslfvIJAupswgvkWvUw9kgCKlm-GxwgvH&index=1\nStories is an action rpg game that's definitely more focused on the story, hence the name! With the narrated gameplay it played somewhat like a blend of bastion and torchlight, just don't expect to be out grinding mobs for epic loot drops. Playthroughs last around 30-60min, each containing 5 levels that once completed offer alternate paths or choices. Consider it a choose your own adventure of sorts. Initially it may feel a little 'rinse repeat' though once you collect enough materials to forge weapons, can then open gates that were not accessible in earlier runs. Enemies scale along with the player level but I felt the game was a little was on the easy side once you master the combo/parry systems.\n\nNo problems with performance, though in-game graphic options are completely lacking, offering low/medium/high without custom toggles for anything. Stories is using the unreal4 engine so you should be able to tweak further via ini files if need be and it should still perform well on lower spec systems, just something to keep in mind. Also worth mentioning is the fact you can't remap controls. Gamepad and keyboard both had reasonable layouts but it may be a problem for some people. Soundwork is fantastic and as for the games narrator, wanted to smack him over the head at times but he did fit well with the game. Devs cover the logistics of how he works on the following forum post. http://steamcommunity.com/app/439190/discussions/0/371918937268113138/#c371918937276450483\n\nIt's been hard for me not to turn another page of the story since I've started playing, completed 4 of 30 odd so far. Would have liked to some new paths open up but I suspect they might if I play a little further (will update once I find out!) Recommended for those who don't mind a more casual focused rpg adventure. Just please keep in mind you may be disappointed if expecting a real challenge or hack n slash experience as mentioned earlier.

I love the way the game progresses, learning from your mistakes after another, learning about the lore of the world and the characters around you,  until you finally find the one path that'll get you your happy ending - which took me about five and a half hours to get to, still, many story branches (you can maybe think of them as timelines) left unplayed\n\nThe humor was refreshing, the narrator was really really good, and the overall world was just neat. I'd love to see a sequel/prequel or just another game that takes place in this world perhaps.\n\nThe bad: I have only mild complaints. I had a singular isolated incident in which my character got stuck and I had to return to the main menu and then continue back from the last checkpoint. I lost about 3 minutes of time perhaps. I wouldn't mind having some more enemy variety. Other than that, I'm suspicious that some steam achievements might not have popped that should have. (I looked through the achievements after completing the main ending and it seemed like I should've met some of the requirements for achievements I never got)\n\nIve seen other reviews say that the game is badly optimized and runs poorly or takes long to load. My experience wasn't bad at all. I ran it on the highest settings as well. I do have a pretty solid computer though, my specs inculde an SSD, an i7 and a GTX 770. No graphical issues at all. It does take a moment to load when going between scenes, but never longer than 5-10 seconds. I read a review that said they gave up on the game because the loading the game for the first time took too long. All I can say in response is that they're cheating themselves out of a very fun and fulfilling game.","April 12","true","6.6"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","14","23","0","0"

It's kind of an ambiguous title until you get into the game.  It's a choose your own adventure style action rpg that brings us back to the nostalgia of classic tales on PC and Playstation 4. Hacking and slashing our way through to the very end.  Fighting, Making Bad Choices, Dying, and Repeating.  It's like Edge of Tomorrow, but with a fox instead of Tom Cruise.  So is this game any good?  Let's find out.  Also this game was provided by the publisher for review.\n\nStory\nIn Stories you play as Reynardo, a fox who is caught in the middle of a rebellion.  The game is a series of choices.  What's interesting about all these different choices is that they aren't predictable.  The setup makes you think with your emotions.  Do you choose to help your friend or save the rebels?  You think you know the right answer, but the consequences are sometimes completely different.\n\nThere's very few cutscenes in the game and the ones that are there come much later in the story.  Instead, the narrative is told by pages from a book with images described by the narrator.  It's kind of a creative way of avoiding cutscenes, but the voice acting is really good and the situations that Reynardo finds himself in are interesting.  You have to use your imagination which is something that we completely forget about in the age of digital games.\n\nThere's also a few interesting motifs in the game.  You play as a fox who is often known in stories for being a sly creature, but you'll notice that the negative consequences make you seem the opposite of a sly decision maker.  There's also heavy moral themes.  Betrayal, trust, leadership, heroism.  You'll have to play it yourself if you want to know how these themes are revealed.\n\nThere's also elements of fiction because you are an anthropormohic fox who is trained in sword fu.  What the hell is sword fu?  But it's handled with eloquence and the writers didn't create a caricature as you would expect.  The story and the characters are mature enough to be taken seriously.\n\nGameplay\nOn first impression stories can be bland.  You get into your first fight and immediately think “Batman Arkham Combat”.  Because it does have the unreal engine blow for blow counter and back to more pummeling type of gameplay.  Then you run around from point A to point B in a linear fashion.\n\nThe game is a slow starter, but after you pass the first few stories things get interesting.  Combat gains more depth through the upgrade system.  You get access to four different swords of fire, void, ice, and the basic hero sword.  Each one has a special powerup.  Then you get a few combo abilities, stamina boost, and other cool stuff.  They clearly took a page out of Shadow of Mordor which is a game that really perfected this type of combat with a new level of complexity.  In most games combat gets easier as powerups get more plentiful, however in stories it gets much tougher because the enemies scale faster than your upgrades which is a good thing because it gives you a progressive challenge.\n\nHowever, enemy types are mostly the same throughout the game and there are no boss battles, so it becomes pretty routine going from fight to fight.\n\nEach quote unquote story is like a level of the game and it gives you information on how to reach the final resolution.  There's fourth “truths” that help you reach the conclusion.  At the end of each section you are presented with a split of choices and the game tags the paths that you haven't crossed yet to guide you along the way.  The idea is that you keep repeating the story, making different educated choices based on what you learned from your last play through.\n\nThe middle of the game is probably the most interesting part because you get a sense of discovery.  Exploring new areas that open up thanks to your new swords and choosing new paths based on information.  This is where things get interesting.  You also start to learn that health is not plentiful.  You don't get a health refill after each fight or even after each section.  You need to conserve your health and energy otherwise you'll just run out.  You also start to open up those colorful doors and get a sense of loot hunting as you pick up these gems that give you different perks.  The RPG aspects start to reveal themselves.  Ironically the game crushes the loot aspect in some ways by providing you with vases to break that rarely have anything in them.  Maybe 20% of the time you can get some health pickups, but it kind of feels like a waste of time destroying property.\n\nThe story mode can be completed in about maybe 6 hours, but there are remaining scenarios to discover if you want to be a completionist.  Most of your character upgrades will be filled out by the time you get to the end.\n\n\nGraphics\nStories has a really warm color tone that suits it's atmosphere.  Everything about the game strikes you as friendly, but fierce.  It's not a kiddie game, nor are the graphics cartoony, yet it's still approachable for gamers of all ages.\n\nThe game has a really attractive art style and this shines through more than any effects or textures.  Because the effects and textures are good, but not really a standout feature.\n\nOne issue with the graphics is that the special effects are used sparingly, but when they are used it's so bright it's blinding.  Even with the basic hero sword, every swing is so white and so bright that you can't actually focus on the hits.  You have to look around to your periphery rather than focus on who you are actually fighting.\n\nAnd further more, an action rpg shouldn't be afraid to bring the camera in more often.  You don't exactly need cinematic dramatic cutscenes, but I'd like to get a closer detail in the graphics.  Sort of like how XCOM shows you the finishing blow or the introduction of a new enemy.  Many action RPGs are guilty not using enough close ups.  And running on Unreal Engine 4 there should be some level of fidelity so there's no excuse not to.\n\nThe game has nothing but low, medium, and high settings on the PC so there aren't many options for detail, anti aliasing, or vsync.  The game runs well, albeit locked at 60fps, so it's not too much of an issue, but those of us with powerful PCs always want to squeeze more visuals out of the game.\n\nSound\nThe highlight of the sound design and the overall game is really the narration.  This game wouldn't work without our humble narrator.  It puts you in the world of a classic tale.  The narrator sort of reads you the choices and consequences of your actions with enough emotion to light your imagination.  The narrator also has some charming one liners throughout your adventure.\n\nThe score is filled with orchestral music that's epic when you're fighting.  But it's soothing during the exposition of the story.  Right from the moment you enter the title screen, you know you are in for a journey.\n\nThese two aspects of the sound really come together to help give the game a good feel.  It's arguably the strongest part of the game overall.\n\nStories has a lot of likable and charming elements.  But it takes a little bit of time to build up to it.  The first hour or two has very linear gameplay, boring combat, and it's a little overwhelming to find out how the stories or repeating the narrative works.  But once the game clicks, it all makes sense and begins to become a lot more fun.  I wish they could have brought more of that into the introduction by ramping up the upgrades faster.\n\nThe endgame kind of has you chasing after the concluding story to find out the real resolution of our main protagonist.  In other words, pacing could be better.  It doesn't kill the game by any means, but it's something that may stop an ADD player from getting started.\nStories is an interesting game.  It's old school in some ways and makes you remember that a game's narrative can be told in more than one way.","April 12","true","12.9"," 25 of 45 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","25","45","2","0"

Light RPG elements and unlocking new powers and weapons, though there are not really too many, make it varied enough to not bore. But overall the combat it not very deep, nor is it really balanced.

The story itself is filled with your usual hero tropes, but screws with them in enough ways to be entertaining and charming, and the combat (when it's not giving me unlimited health or some weird thing, from a bug I'd guess) was fun enough to carry me through the experience the 8 or 9 times I needed to get the ideal ending. There's some interface fixes absent that would have made things much smoother, like mapping the sword select to each direction on the dpad for immediate access to your weapon of choice, and leaving the cycling method of sword selection to bumpers. I'm not so fond of when buttons go unused when they could streamline the gameplay, but here's hoping that's something Spearhead will add later. There are also some things I'd love to be able to skip (the "Game changer" paragraph that repeats each time you want to do a new playthrough is unskippable, for example).\n\nI'm actually happy with my time with this game, despite the above complaints. It's goofy and fun, looks nice, and sometimes plays nice too! The upgrade system gave interesting bonuses that had me looking forward to new encounters, and I have to say my favorite part of this game was watching how Reynardo's paths fall apart each time. If the game had a greater enemy variety and more levels to cycle through, I'd probably adore it. As it is, I only greatly enjoyed it, which is awesome because I love greatly enjoying things. Here's hoping Spearhead's next endeavor is more polished, but still unabashedly gleeful.\n\nWait did I forget the art? The art's ♥♥♥♥ing awesome; I love it. And the narrator?

Would love to see more content as it was a blast to play.\n- Little diversity of loot. Gets stale after you've unlocked all weapons, which brings me to my next con.\n- Little amount of gear variety. Now, I know the point of the game is that you have the specific amount of swords which also works as keys, but if you could atleast upgrade your swords and get some more value out of them, maybe customize them a bit more, that would be great.\n- The story can seem a bit cut short at some points.\n- Your enemies are almost always inferior to you. At some point in the game, you'll just be a wrecking ball and crush all your opponents. It feels like your enemies just stop scaling with you, which makes the game a bit too easy.\n- Not too difficult (yes, it's both good AND bad).\n\nShould you buy this game?\nYeah, definitely. Even though it's kinda short, it's a really satisfying game, and the replay-value is great. The combat feels smooth and rewarding, and feels very skill-based, if you're fast enough and time your opponent's attacks you'll be able to not be hit once. The only thing I wasn't that happy with, though, was that the death system is so unpunishing.

It's got the crazy combo's and hack and slash goodness, but also adds more technical things like counters and grapple attacks.\n\nThe commentary is cute and can be quite humorous at times, like all the comments about smashing barrels or swinging your sword around in the air aimlessly. You can tell they put a lot of thought into the narrative of the game.\n\nI like the spin on the splitting story arch, though it can be frustrating watching poor Reynardo fail over and over again despite your best efforts.\n\nAll I can say is this game is super fun, but don't expect to start it and not get bad endings, you pretty much have to get screwed over to figure out what to do, and that's part of the game as crazy as it sounds, but it works.\n\nOnly real complaint I've got is occasionally I will get a glitch where I get stuck in the floor when i dash into breakables. It's only happened twice, but the first time I was nearly done with a stage and ended up having to restart the whole thing.","April 26","true","1.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

No bosses, few puzzles, however many different paths. Whether you choose power over friendship, love over conquest, or simply being good or bad, the game offers a vast majority of endings. To be honest it isn't some crazy open world experience, and it actually has it's fair share of bugs. However, I believe that this game is definitely for someone who wants to take break from the normal CS:GO, TF2, DotA 2, or whatever else you play to a pulp, to immerse oneself into something... new. This game is highly recomended. Before I forget, this game is a nightmare to run in general.

Turns out nice design is only the beginning of the story.\n\nFirst of all, of course, what drew me into this game: It's design. It is not groundbreaking by any means, but it is very well executed. You can see that the developers had put a lot of effort to try and make this game pop out, and it does! The story book like illustrations in the cutscenes go perfectly hand in hand with the stories narrative.\n\nAbout the narrator: It is actually amazing how much depth can one narrator bring to so many different characters and situations, it's like listening to a very well crafted audio book! Not to mention the countless of funny comments and references the narrator throws at you. But as everything it too can get too overdone at times, but I dont really mind that.\n\nThe story is good, but what's interesting about it is the AMOUNT of endings you get. There are plenty, and all of them depend on every single action you make. This makes exploration a necessary part of the game. Sure sometimes it may get grindy and repetitive a bit but if you are like me, you will definitely want to explore and find out as much as you possibly can, if not for the sake of completing the game 100% but for the sake of finding out what kind of interesting ending you may come across next. Sometimes the game even throws curve balls at you that made me just sit there for a minute and then bursting out laughing and calling out the narrator a cheeky git.\n\nAs for the combat, this was my first ever hack and slash type game. For me, even if I played with a keyboard the combat seemed to border somewhere between repetitive and oddly satisfying. Sometimes I'd go through a hoard of enemies with the feeling of "I am tired of this" and the next time I'd feel like it is the most satisfying thing in the world. So while not the most amazing part of the game, it is definitely well done.\n\n\nAs an overall game, I can definitely recommend it. A bit of polish here and there and it will be a truely wonderful experience. 8/10","April 18","true","13.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eric_kei/recommended/439190/","eric_kei","Eric_Kei [SVSA]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eric_kei/","354 products in account","Product received for free\n\nStories is an action-adventure game with a nicely sarcastic narrator, unique characters, a fast-paced combat system, and enough ways to get through the game to keep you coming back for more. The game is set up as if you are reading an adventure story about a swashbuckling fox name Reynardo – specifically, your own story.\n\nIf you play your cards right, you will also learn a number of significant "Truths" along the way, and these stay with you in future playthroughs – the narration, dialogue, and possible decisions you are offered will vary based on your character's memory of what has gone before. For example, if you learn that a special item you collected in one run has a rather nasty downside, the narration will remind you to be more careful with it in the future, and you will even get extra bits of narration reminding you of the consequences of using it. In the end, you must unlock four different "Truths" in order to unlock the path to the final, true ending; thus, the game is beatable in under six hours, though experiencing all of the potential storylines can easily take you upwards of thirty hours.\n\nSome stories might end up with you coming ever so close to your goal, only to take an arrow to the knee. Some mean the end of the world. Some find you all alone and mortally wounded as a dozen enemies slowly crowd in around you...and then the story begins again, until you get it right. There are even a small number of mid-mission choices that will result in an instant death, but these simply kick you back a bit in the level so that you can change your mind the next time.\n\nMovement and attacking are controlled with the mouse; your character will always look towards the cursor, even without a button held. Get used to parrying an incoming attacks – You'll want to get this down ASAP, as you won't live long without this and the occasional dash. The movement method takes a little getting used to, but it quickly becomes second nature. Later upgrades will grant you abilities such as slowing down time when you parry at just the right time, or follow-up a melee strike just as your first hit strikes the target.\n\nCombat is fast-paced, with an emphasis on getting high combo numbers, and timing is very important. Fortunately, the game facilitates moving from one foe to another – just click on your new target and your character will zip over to them (the current enemy doesn't have to be dead yet). If there are no enemies on screen, click in the direction where you think they are hiding, and he'll haul tail over to them anyway. Clicking a downed enemy will result in a coup de grace, via a leaping stab, for an instant kill. All fights are handled in small, clearly-defined areas, with EXP awarded for kills, combo chains, style/variety, and whether you escaped unharmed once the current batch of enemies are all dead.\n\n\nGraphics are of the Cel-shaded variety, minus the thick black lines sometimes associated with the technique. Camera view is often rather zoomed out when not in combat, but it pulls in closer when you are going toe-to-toe with a hulking black raven. It's not as fancy or as flashy as a Triple-A game (but it still looks quite nice for the price), but the visuals suit the method of storytelling, and the adventure mode graphics mesh up with the stylized look of the still images in the framing storybook quite well. Plenty of places where you can see paths that you missed on the current run, as the entire playable world is made up of small, floating islands. As you are riding a floating platform up to a new ledge, you may see paths unexplored, doors and chests unopened, and more, fading out into the distance far below.\n\n----\n\nFull Review published at http://www.dlh.net/en/reviews/2122/stories-the-path-of-destinies--pc-.html","May 10","true","7.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I get a dozen games a week, some of which people will never hear of and for good reason.\nVideo Review here\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkMWE8AnDhA\n\nThe minute I sat down I got hooked pretty instantly. It's an action-rpg which isn't always my thing. But it did have Arkham,Hand of Fate combat style which I love. The narration is top down so of the best I've seen from a game in quite some time.\n\nThough the graphical options aren't as advanced as some games the graphics themselves are quite good. It's a very pretty game. And the soundtrack is quite well done too.\nI'll try not to spoil anything but you will find yourself doing some of the same parts of the storie over again but in different ways going to area's you couldn't unlock before but it never feels the same or grindy in anyway.\n\nThe combat itself much like Arkham Batman series once mastered is fun but once you master the counter technique you will pretty much find yourself invincible but not in a bad way. You'll relish getting that combo counter up and watching the kills fly by. Do wish the combat would scale up a bit in difficulty sometimes though.\n\nYou'll get yourself a min. of 20+hours if you play through to True and other endings and for the price I'd highly encourage a buy. Though be warned, if you don't play with a controller I might skip it because it wasn't really designed for a mouse/keyboard and it highly reccomends controller at the start screen you are going to find yourself in a bad time.\n\nFinal Score 9.5/10 "Would abuse the Iblis stone again!"","April 18","true","7.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

If Steam allowed for a "meh" rating, this sits solidly in that territory.\n\nThe art style is amazing, the writing and the narration voice acting is great, and the overall concept is innovative.  I've only run into one consistent bug during my playthroughs but it's not game breaking.\n\nIt plays like a zero calorie version of Bastion, but where things fall flat lies in the actual execution of the game itself.\n\nThe whole premise of the game is "keep trying and dying through multiple runs until you get a good ending." There's twenty-something possible combinations of endings and while you can finally get a good ending after about five hours of play, things get a bit dull after the third hour or so because you keep playing through the same six boards fighting the same seven enemy types over and over and over and over and--\n\nYou get the point.\n\nUpgrading your swords to unlock different gates on the boards only open up minor side branches that lead to chests for more loot drops so you can upgrade your swords further and get minor stat buffs.  If these blocked off portions actually led to different branches of the plot, it would spice things up and help with replayability.\n\ntl;dr  If you consider $15 a fair price to pay for about three hours of solid entertainment and another two or more hours of repetitive drudgery, go ahead and purchase.","April 21","false","5.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I will reccomend the game to anyone who really likes Isometric Arkham Style Hack and Slash and/or Interactive Short stories. If you're not sure however and hope this product to strike a happy balance between these parts, then you're going to fall down the middle and come out dissapointed.\n\nAs a top-down "Arkham" style hack and slash, where you weave in and out of combat by dashing, or you counter telegraphed attacks with timing, the game is pretty fun if you're not sick of that combat system yet. Fights are remarkably tight, fast paced and flashy, with the art style and animation really putting up a great show. However, there's fewer enemy types than you'd like to expect and actually, that part of the game is rather short. There aren't that many maps.\n\nThe other, far more intriguing part, is indeed the storytelling and the way in which the game sets you up. There's a pretty short storyline to be followed, but oh lordy does it branch. Basically, you get about 4 x 3 or 2 different choices, which makes for about 24 completely different endings, supported by their own artwork, voice acting and cutscenes. However, that's not all, as these seperate branches, in fact weave in on each other. You see, many of these endings are bad and you'll end up failing. Thanks to the powers that be however, both you and your hero get smarter. Got a bad end because you learn that the McGuffin you're after is actually something that's going to screw you over? Well, now you know. Your hero knows too as part of his development as a character and the both of you can now use that information to change destiny in the next playthrough. Rivetting! Same goes for if you can trust certain characters, or certain objects. Maybe you even play them against each other now that you know their true nature.\nIf you're into games that give you a several choices and you love investing hours into seeing them played out by a dynamic cast of characters in such radically different ways that your input truly matter, then BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW, because it was made for you.\n\n\nOn the strengths of both of these seperate parts, I am willing to reccomend this game for 15 bucks. Especially for the storytelling part if you're into stuff like that.\n\nNow for the bad news: Both these parts combined into a single game, actually make for a very unhappy marriage between the two that kinda leaves a bad taste in your mouth. If you desperatly want this game to come together neatly for you to be content, instead of knowing you can draw your satisfaction from just a single one of these parts, then I wouldn't reccomend it. The game fails here.\n\n\nThe Hack and Slash part, is far shorter than the storyline part. Every new playthrough might have a brand new storyline, but you will end up traversing the EXACT same levels, fighting the exact same enemies as you browse through the stories several times over. This gets grating REALLY quickly and the hack and slash part almost actively starts impairing your ability to enjoy the story. Mercifully, the levels are very short and increasing familiarity with them allows you to zip through them within a handful of minutes, but it's still no less of an annoyance.\nIt's such a pity too, since the landscapes really do look gorgeous. The final level has a breathtaking atmosphere to it. As it should, because while the levels ahead of it might vary a little according to the choices you've made, you'll always end up in the same last level and it has just about started wearing thin with me after seeing it 30 times.\n\n\nIn conclusion:\n\nThis game is like chocolate. And I mean a mountain of chocolate.\n\nMake absolutely sure you love Isometric Arkham style Hack & Slash and Interactive Short Stories, because you're going to get a lot of it. If you're into chocolate however and you have the stomach to eat a mountain of the stuff, than this is going to be your dreamgame and you'll get exactly what you paid for.\n\nIf you're not sure however and you think "I'll just take a nibble, because it sounds like a really interesting combination of two systems." then don't expect to come out happy. The game is going to sit on you and force feed you the chocolate until you're gonna hurl, and you're not coming out of the closet until you finished the pile.","April 23","true","41.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you enjoyed that game, or other story-focused ARPGs, you'll probably enjoy Stories.\n\nThis is a game that begs for a more fleshed-out sequel, though. After a while, you wind up repeating a lot of plot points to get to a particular moment, and that gets old eventually. Ultimately, I wanted to feel like the story book was a place where I could get lost and trapped, instead of a relatively simple path to a handful of outcomes that diverge mostly in details.\n\nOverall, I totally recommend this. The developer is supporting it well, and offering consistent patches. The gameplay is smooth, the environments nice, the writing is solid...and it's fun. I just hope that in the future the developer can expand on the systems they created here, and offer a deeper experience.","April 20","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's basically a "Choose your own adventure" game just like you'd get in those books.\n\nEach choice changes the direction of the storyline leading you to whatever end you fall on. The way it plays out is pretty short. You can play through the story in about a hour, but there are 24  endings. After you get to the end of the story, the story resets to the beginning and you try again until you get the Hero's ending.\n\nGoing through the different storylines unlocks new information about the characters and events in the story to help you determine the right course of action. And each time you play you have the chance to unlock more choices for the path you follow.\n\nThe storylines are fun and it's interesting to see the various endings the game has to offer, but that's really where the game peaks. the combat at first is fun and challenging, but after playing through the story 2-3 times you get the hang of it and by this time you've leveled enough to where you're kind of a god. Each playthough's exp you earn carries over to the next attempt so leveling up becomes quick if you start enjoying the hunt for the different endings.\n\nHowever, the gameplay starts lacking after that. You get 4 different types of swords in the game. Each holding a different element(Wind, Water, Fire, and then the normal one), but aside from the "Freezes enemy" magic power the sword comes with there's not real elemental challenge. Enemies react the same with all the different weapon types and there no real need for strategy with the elements. I found myself only using the main sword(because it heals me) and crafting the others just to open the locked doors that only those swords open.\n\nThis makes the game repetitive after a few playthroughs. I got about 4 stories finished, but I would have stopped at 3 if I curious about what the real ending was.\n\nAnother thing, and this is just a peeve of mine, I really wish games would stop telling me everything. When I go into the skills menu, I wanna see locked skills with no descriptions. I enjoy that surprise of finding out what skills are next. This game tells you everything though, and it ruins some of the mystery for me. Skills, gems, swords, upgrades, even which choices unlock what stuff is all spelled out for you. All you need to do is hide it.\n\nThis leads me to a suggestion for the Devs. Take out the hand holding icons that tell me what choices unlock truths. Let people figure it out, it makes the adventure fun. It also needs an added screen that shows the branches of choices you've seen already to help figure out new paths to take for people who want to unlock all the endings. And let people skip the descriptions of the choices if I've seen them already. It takes so long to wait for it when I already know what they are.\n\nAll in all this is a fun game with some really cool story ideas in it. If you see this game 20% off and want a game with a fun story then grab it, but you might be disappointed when you play through it a few times to find it's lost its luster already.","April 20","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a bit of fourth wall-breaking humor a la Stanley Parable, a lot of interesting characters and an engrossing world. Basically, every half hour into the game, you "beat" it, reaching a new ending- and gaining more information about the world and characters that you can use next time you play the game. If somebody combined Redwall with the Legend of Zelda with Groundhog Day, it'd be Stories: The Path of Destinies.\n\nWhile playing through the same levels can get a little repetitive, they're also relatively short- and you don't go through the same levels every time- you have to take new paths to gain new knowledge.\n\nOn the whole, it's a great game that I can recommend if you're looking for something with a fun story that calls on you to actually solve it. I do with that there was a bit more to do in between combat and decision making as the platforming's a touch dull, but beyond that? It's awesome.\n\nYou can read my full review here if you'd like to find out more.[blackmannrobin.com]","April 19","true","12.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game they've made on this however is a slightly mixed bag. Let me explain.\n\nThe good\n- The story\nNaturally with a name like 'Stories', the narrative is the main focus of the game. The delivery of it feels well paced, quick enough for multiple runs in one session and most importantly of all (in my opinon) gives relatability and investment in each of the main and sub-main characters. Solid 8/10 for this, only deducting points due to the lack of exposition regarding certain characters or glossed over details.\n- The characters\nAs mentioned above, I really liked the characters of this game. The main protagonist is definetly not what you would call intelligent. He's a swordsman without equal but thats about where it ends. Yet despite this I really enjoyed playing as Reynold, the character totes a certain charm to him that is really shown well by the narrator's voice. Likewise the other characters are crafted with what I believe is quite good depth for a game such as this.\n- Information gain\nWith all the multiple branching paths of the game, each time you complete a run you come away from it with more information about the world Reynold is fighting for, the characters that populate it and most importantly, a better idea of what choices you should make to proceed into the future. There are no exclusively "right" paths, with one choice you are sure will land you success ending in failure whilst a more bizzare path might open up options for a glimpse of something more, then end once more in dissapointment. Yet despite this I always felt like I was making progress in the narrative, slowly making my way into working out what exactly is going on and how to - like all good heroes, save the world!\n\nThe bad\n-The combat\nThis game is sadly not a game where the combat shines. A similar formula to the Arkham knight games, Reynold jumps around the screen hitting enemies with timing based attacks and countering by pressing the same button when a little exclamation mark appears above the bad guy's head. However with only 5 enemy types, a strange loot system that seems to rely more on respawning chests between runs rather than actual exploration, only 4 swords that have no real differing stats apart from their magic effect, the fighting in this game feels shallow and a filler for the real meat of the game - its story. This is incredibly dissapointing as with such potential in its presentation and obvious care layered onto its narrative, the improvement of combat through more varied unit types, possible weapon types and maybe more of a difficulty curve towards the end of the game would have made this a far more robust and gratifying experience.\n\n\nThe Verdict\n-"Hey, that's pretty good!" - Some cancer patient 2015\n\nNo but tacky jokes aside, I really enjoyed this game. Not for its arkham knight wannabe combat, nor its passable sound direction (which I didnt mention because it was honestly neither good nor bad) but for its characters, clever way of investing you in the story and universe and because the whereas most games let the main character suceed no matter their situation, Stories: Path of Destinies understand that sometimes one person can only do so much on their own, and that going back to see where you went wrong is the only way to success.","April 20","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, I feel that the gameplay is fluid and interesting enough to get you through the things you need to see and do before you're able to really complete the story (and get a good ending, that is).\n\nI see a lot of room for improvement, but I liked the game overall (the writing and the narrator gave it a big boost).

The excellent and fluid combat dynamics are extremely reminscent of the Batman Arkham series, and lend a visceral satisfaction and a high skill ceiling to the action. The art style is consistent and appealing, and the animations in particular are gratifyingly varied and smooth. The story is compelling and initially extremely enigmatic. By integrating the branching choices into both the game structure and the theme, Stories masterfully avoids the pitfalls of other choice-driven narratives that leave you making independent playthroughs or awkwardly reloading to explore alternate paths.\n\nThe different levels felt a little sparse at first, but the clever iterations of new pathways, unlocked via the use of new sword types as keys; the gradual scaling of the mobs across playthroughs; and even the variation in view angle of the scene when an area is revisited kept it feeling fresh. The lack of constant looting and mobs in the levels actually helped later in the game, when the motivation of the player changes from geographical exploration to narrative exploration. The narrator really steals the show, voicing all the characters superbly, and taking the tone from darkly serious to absurd and humorous at various times.\n\nOne complaint is that after your first similar outcome, the game starts guiding you to pathways of choices that are not only unique, but which will drive you very quickly towards the "ideal" endgame plot. While this is an excellent feature that will avoid frustration for many, I dearly wish it had been optional. I am sure I will not be alone among players in wishing that I had deduced the correct pathway for myself, rather than being hand-held to it. Up to that point, forcing myself to deviate from my "natural" choices, which I followed on my first play-through, had been a rewardingly evocative experience. The almost literal arrows pointing me to the endgame solution undermined this considerably.\n\nOverall, a unique concept combined with solid gameplay which will last the average gamer 10-12 hours, with up to 20 hours for the completionist seeking to see every branch of the story.","April 26","true","8.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Each playthrough lasts about 30 minutes to an hour, visiting the same handful of locations each time. Getting to the best ending takes about 5 hours, and getting all the endings would probably take about 20+ hours.\n\nThe hack-and-slash and RPG gameplay elements are simple, which with any other game would probably be a mark against it. However, with Stories, I'm really interested in finding out what happens next rather than getting bogged down in combat. So being able to quickly max everything out and blow through combat easily is actually a plus. Once you get the best ending, you're pretty much able to walk through the levels without too much distraction.\n\nI'm really enjoying Stories a lot, but for its narrative, characters, and art style more than its gameplay. If you like games like Dyscourse or The Stanley Parable, then I think you'll enjoy it. If you're looking for something like Bastion or Hyper Light Drifter, then you're going to be disappointed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh, and its cast is entirely talking animal people, so bonus points from me for that! >^_^<","April 17","true","19.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I just finished watching the end credits after about 5 hours of gameplay. I consider that an acceptable amount of time in game for the price that the devs are asking here... and I still have more things I can go do and see which should add on a few more hours as well. I've enjoyed my time playing this game and do have a few things I think could have been improved on, but thanks to the great writing, narration, gameplay, and overall experience the few things I take issue with feel kind of minor.\nThe main thing I feel that some people will have a problem with is the amount of re-visiting of old levels. You'll often find yourself experiencing an area that you've already been through. You may be on a different path through the level, and the reasons for being there might change; but the different levels become very familiar. Later visits will have you being able to unlock new areas, these often give nice bonuses but do not fundamentally change the story or experience. That said when you finally unlock a void door that you walked buy ages ago to see the other side… nice feeling. I also lost a bit of the previously mentioned nice feeling when I realized I could farm these areas for the bonuses they provide.\nThis game is very much designed for console players and it plays significantly better with controllers. There are a few cases where the game showed me the wrong controller prompts for particular buttons (I use an Xbox controller and would in some rare cases see PlayStation button prompts). These instances were rare and only happened in the menu system for me though so not too big a deal and something they can likely fix.\nGameplay wise this is game uses a counter system much like many third person action games these days. Happily you can’t just get away with hitting the counter/attack button a million times a second. Early unlocks reward better timed play, and counters require you to give a direction to counter. It’s a simple system, but at the very least it’s not like more recent examples from other games where spamming a button allowed you to win.\nDifficulty wise I felt like I didn’t have much of a challenge. The game is definitely on the easy side. It is still a ton of fun, and I don’t regret my play time, however a hard mode or new game plus would make me happy. The lack of difficulty comes from a few things: enemies die fairly quickly and there aren’t very many of them in most groups, I found the AI a bit overly predictable, and often even if you do die the punishment is a respawn right before the encounter with 50% health. Things get even easier in late game when you can get a skill that lets you one shot most enemies. Again as I said, I still enjoyed the hell out of this and will be playing more but most players aren’t going to have a problem.\nMy last issue is that the game builds up the emperor or other characters at times as major enemies, then handles them in cut scenes. There’s no boss fights for a game that feels like it should have them. I believe that when it comes to a game I’d much rather do something than see or be told about something my character is supposed to have done. They player does get some agency in things though through making choices at the end of several cut scenes that direct you through the story, which helps some. But it does leave all the enemies just feeling very standard.\nAll in all I do look forward to playing more, and plan to finish the other paths I didn’t bother with initially.  I’m also planning on keeping an eye on the devs for whatever their next project is as this game was great fun and gave me a lot of what I’m looking for even if there were a few things I see as space for improvement.\n","April 16","true","5.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Reynardo, ex-pirate and unintentional hero, suddenly becomes the last line of the defense against the mad Emperor and his countless ravens. Can he come up with a plan that won’t blow up in his face, for a change?\n\nIn Stories, each choice you make takes Reynardo into a unique narrative.

I loved the first couple of hours with it. The combat was fun, I enjoyed the art style and the characters and the humour was pretty sweet (if a bit heavy on reference humour). Not everyone will enjoy the narrator's style, but I could dig it.\n\nBy the second or third run-through I'd seen basically everything the game had to offer and the charm began to wear a bit thin. There's only a handful of levels and only four basic enemy types. Past the first tier of unlocks, most of the skill tree is "same thing but more damage", and the sword upgrades are similarly limited.\n\nI still have a crap-ton of stories to unlock, but with no reason to explore it's basically endless speedrunning through the slim number of levels so I can make my next choice. I enjoyed this game and I like the choices gimmick, but I wish there was more depth to the gameplay. It's a pretty fun game, but with more variety it could've been a fantastic one.","April 16","true","12.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's very balanced, but though not too easy to defeat your enemies.\nThe system is very simple and thus easy to understand.

It's quick and fast paced gameplay with excellent story telling.\n\nNow the things that will do their best to tick you off when you play this game.\n\n1. Every single time you play you'll find a new bug that will hinder or break gameplay.\n2. There are no boss fights in this game, just sections (including the ultimate ending for the game) where you'll be forced to fight 4 or 5 times the normal amount of goons in order to complete a chapter.\n3. If you accidently hit B when attempting to respawn at the latest checkpoint there is NO confirmation prompt.  You will be forced to replay the chapter.

I could not play anything else when I got it. The story is fantastic, it has a lot of branching paths and even going back through, hearing the same branch again, didn't get old. The narrator was and is fantastic. I felt like I was listening to my grandfather read me a book back when I was a little kid, doing all the voices himself and sucking you further into the story.\n\nThe combat is another high mark of this game. It is so fluid, I didn't even really have to think to myself which button I needed to press, I just knew ahead of time what I needed to do, where I needed to be, and which weapon I needed to do it with. The art style is amazing, not much else I can say there.\n\nThis is one game I don't believe you will ever regret buying. I never will regret it. I will always treasure the time I spent on this game.

An interesting art style lends an air of a children’s novel while the narration lends a humorous atmosphere that keeps the mood light and fresh. The game states clearly that it is optimized for a game controller and I would agree with it. A controller is much easier and more responsive than attempting to use a mouse and keyboard. With multiple weapons granting multiple abilities and upgrades, they help customize your play style to a certain extent.\n\nI also have to give extra credit where it’s due in the humorous aspects of the game. The narration is well voice acted and the line delivery is fantastic. Never over the top or too goofy, the developers kept the pacing and struck just the right tone with the game and made every aspect of the game a joy. You even get an achievement for spinning around in circles.. as many people tend to do in these types of games while fiddling with the controller. It was a nice touch that let me know that the devs understand gamers and their habits well enough to be able to make well placed jokes about common gamer foibles.. such as a penchant for destroying every inanimate object possible in order to garner extra loot, spinning around in a circle, or being extra thorough in level clearing. They included light-hearted banter and good natured ribbing for all of these activities and more."\n\nSee my full Review here:\nhttps://youtu.be/tZtcpX1GEYY\n","April 17","true","3.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Each playthrough lasts about 30 minutes to an hour, visiting the same handful of locations each time. Getting to the best ending takes about 5 hours, and getting all the endings would probably take about 20+ hours.\n\nThe hack-and-slash and RPG gameplay elements are simple, which with any other game would probably be a mark against it. However, with Stories, I'm really interested in finding out what happens next rather than getting bogged down in combat. So being able to quickly max everything out and blow through combat easily is actually a plus. Once you get the best ending, you're pretty much able to walk through the levels without too much distraction.\n\nI'm really enjoying Stories a lot, but for its narrative, characters, and art style more than its gameplay. If you like games like Dyscourse or The Stanley Parable, then I think you'll enjoy it. If you're looking for something like Bastion or Hyper Light Drifter, then you're going to be disappointed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh, and its cast is entirely talking animal people, so bonus points from me for that! >^_^<","April 17","true","19.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game has amazing replay value BUT skipping through beginning narrations that you've heard a million times before would be much appreciated as I have sat through that beginning too many times. Also, most of the time on this game is logged from long loading screens and narration you've heard before. Also, I was really disappointed that there weren't any boss fights, like I was looking forward to getting to take on the emperor or something instead of being told what happened. The enemies get really repetetive as well.\n\nSpoilers***\n\nAfter I completed the game I got both the lightened iblis stone that had absorbed the power of the core and the weapon. I dunno if I'm suppossed to have these or what but what I've come to honestly hate is the floating weapon that targets randomly and cancels my combo. It takes away from the gameplay for me and makes it less fun. Seriously there needs to be an option to remove that thing.\n\nAnother thing, the friggen optimization makes the framerate on my computer go bonkers. I literally had to take the quality down. This also impedes on fights and is super annoying.\n\nAlso, what's up with only being able to upgrade my swords twice? Did you guys just decide that you didn't feel like giving it a better look or ability? There's also the bottleneck effect with leveling. It was a pain just to reach level 24 and by the end of all the playthroughs I'll have reached like 30+, which is dumb considering you literally mow through the basic mobs. Also, the gems just stop at 3? The upgrade value for equipment was seriously skewed and I expected more.\n\nWell those are all my complaints.\n\nThe game has a ton of replay value and the feel is pretty nice but after about 12 hours you're asking yourself why you are putting yourself through cut scenes that literally waste about 20 minutes of each playthrough. The music is nice and gives it a nice fantasy feel and the skills are interesting. Leveling after level 20 is a pain but you probably won't play for that long unless you're really bored. Still, I like the game and it kinda rubs off on ya. Is it worth it while its on sale? Yeah, sure.

You fail. Then you try again, branching choose your own adventure style, til you find the 'True Ending' save the empire, get the girl, et al.\n\nBasic gameplay works well, you wander through levels fighting enemies, there are multiple paths through most levels unlocked by different swords you can craft, but more on that later.\n\nCombat is fun and fluid though with certain upgrades (Shieldripper gem I'm looking at you) becomes too simple. When you come to enemies on your path you get locked in arena style until you defeat them, after defeating them you're given a score (and associated xp) based on style and whether you got hit or not. The combat is rythmic attack-attack-counter-attack-throw-etc. The timing is not so exacting to make it impossible though getting perfect rounds with great style or more is appropriately difficult.\n\nSkill Tree: As you gain xp you gain levels and skill points to spend on a wide array of useful upgrades, relatively standard but the upgrades seem well thought out and work quite well.\n\nCrafting: This is the place where I feel the most potential was missed. There are four swords and several gems to be crafted , found and upgraded. Early in the game I found the desire to upgrade driving my exploration within each level unfortunately before I finished my third 'story' (it takes a minimum of five to get the 'True Ending') I had found and upgraded everything possible. A more in depth crafting system would have significantly driven up replay value.\n\nNarration: This one will probably depend on the person. I found it to be generally humorous, though the inability to skip certain cutscenes (especially the n-th time youve seen it) is a real flaw.\n\nPuzzles: There in name only, the puzzles are so simple that they shouldn't really count as puzzles.\n\nUnderused concepts:\nThe hookshot, used for navigation. I would have loved to see some challenge maps or sections of the real game where you're not just hooking between stationary platforms.\nThe floating eyeballs, again they're interesting but when you run into them it's too easy to get by. Challenge maps or just more difficult encounters would be grand.\nCrafting as discussed above.\n\nIn short this game would benefit greatly from some reasons to keep playing after finding the 'True Ending.' Specifically challenge maps and a deeper crafting system, and making the overall game more difficult","April 17","true","8.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

If this game seems interesting to you, buy it. Im a couple hours in and will outline my basis for saying this,\n\n-The repeatable story is absolutely immense for the cost of this game. In example, when I bought Windwaker for the Gamecube I thought playing the game 3 times would be rewarding; and for that I was disappointed. This game however, doesnt seem to matter how many times I play through the same content, an eventual different end content really makes a difference.\n-Combat System Evolution:  Sure, I grasped the system early on and felt it was easy. However, the evolution through leveling is insane. The game grows with you, what other games for the price will do that.\n-Story: Really well developed; the single narrator with all the comedic quirks absolutely sells the story for me and im a really picky gamer. The purpose of this game is to learn the alternatives to choice, and that is absolutely beautiful.\n-Art: Really? I had to make this part of my review? If you dont see a beautiful game and from what I have put towars the game already, and you aren't ready to try this game, you should be ashamed.

The art style chosen does the game proud and makes for a very enjoyable play session. I do highly recommend the game, it's priced very well and I'd call it a "Hidden Gem" of 2016 for sure. Price is perfect for the game as the developers earned every dime for this job well done. This is a very unique way of telling a 'story' in a game, and I hope they release more stories with this exact technique; can easily become the next 'Final Fantasy' og series that is always an instant-buy for me.\n\nThe manner in which you build your character and swords is simple and rewarding. It's a 'mostly' stress-free play experience with plenty of chuckles along the way. The combat is engaging and well done; however I'd ask the Developers do a better job at highlighting when monsters are about to attack. The "Grey" !-mark can get drowned out in certain environments that are also grey in color scheme. You can watch a recording of one of my Streaming Sessions over at www.YouTube.com/StrikesVA under videos. (I don't like to post the entire game so people don't only watch it, instead of buying it. Sorry!)\n\nMy only 'Con' is that the re-telling of the stories does start to get rather dulling. Once you get the 'gist' of what's going on... I feel that more change is needed, in some manner... to keep things interesting. They attempted to add just 'more monsters' to fight.. but that seems to have generally hit a cap, and I'm only at about 6 stories of (guessing) about 20 to do. The more I 'drone on' to try and complete all the potential stories.. the less 'thrilled' I am about playing the game further. I also wish that Gems and Sword Upgrades would continue on... I've already found them all (it seems) and unlocked all the Swords, and I've still got over half of the Stories to complete.\n\nUpdate: Playing in 1-2 hour sessions certainly seems to help me, personally. As every time I come back and pick it up and I'm more engaged with the story and the re-telling. I think the above statement was just because I was on a 4+ hour straight kick with the game.","April 14","true","8.2"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

That's the best way to describe Stories: The Path of Destinies. And from a storytelling perspective: the game really works. The narrator is able to deliver accessible writing to all ages with good referential humor that works for adults, yet still is nice for kids to follow along with. The narrator is the start here, as he reacts to your gameplay (here's a hint: go in circles really fast for a fun easter egg) and yet delivers good solid writing through the different story arcs, with a wide arrange of great endings from depressing to down right hilarious. But the storytelling has to carry the gameplay, which while functional, becomes a button masher quickly, in particular with an overly spammable counter move that can get you through the game entirely. It needed more variety in the long haul, and the difficulty is the major factor here as it may work for those looking for simple gameplay, but there's no difficulty levels or any sort of complications. But regardless, it's the story that will bring you to Stories, as Fairy Tale lovers will feel at home here, and trying to find all the endings will bring a sense of joy, yet fun along with it. You may just rush through the fights while doing it.\n\nLists:\nPositives:\nCYOA story telling is great. And that's helped by:\nGreat narrator and voice acting work. The narrator never hits the level of Bastion's narrator, it comes in a nice second.\nThink Fairy Tale like writing. Accessible to a wide audience, as young kids will enjoy it, while older people will appreciate some of the subtle humor.\nVery suited for the controller. Speed of Reynardo is appropriately, you're able to control the hook enough in order to make your way through the environment.\nGood SIMPLE character building. These characters are supposed to be straight forward (fairy tale like), but it's clear what their personality traits are, etc.\nLife-like physics engine. Something about shooting apart a glacier actually was fun to do over and over again.\nReasonable alternate paths and led to some good exploration. It would get old eventually due to there not being THAT many combinations in the end, but it was good none the less.\nLike the wide array of endings. From depressing to really hilarious. The monk ending is hilarious.\nNice use of popular references in gaming and media. Not forced in, but naturally fits into the writing.\nNegatives:\nCounter system needs to be tweaked. Way too easy to spam it over and over again. Needed some\nAction gameplay does get repetitive. Could have used a little bit more enemy variety in order to change up the combat. There's some, but it needed more.\nSkill trees are useful, but still has problems with easy difficulty. It just makes it even easier. Which it doesn't need.\nEnvironment can be rough around the edges, in particular with platforms and clipping.\nMouse and Keyboard controls could be better. Moving with the right mouse button (holding it) just didn't really make sense, and needed bindable keys.\nMusic isn't the greatest.","April 12","true","6.1"," 18 of 35 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","18","35","2","1"

If I had to apply a mathematical formula...\n\n"Style" of Dust (anthromorph world) + Bastion + Shadows of Destiny + Shadows of Mordor = Stories.\n\nExplanation:\nDust - Effectively an anthro world. Different anthros have appropriate personalities. Foxes are sly, perceptive, hares are mad, etc. This also means that there is a bit of the "simple, sickly sweet" aspect of that world as well. It's fine for me, but it might bother some people. In general, the game is very much like an anime, particularly when fighting the eye monsters.\n\nBastion: The Narrator describes what you're doing. On one playthrough, I didn't hear a single repeated phrase. I can't say the same for the rest of the game. Also, it's in the isometric fixed camera perspective. Also also, you keep character progression on each playthrough, including items.\n\nShadows of Destiny: For those of you who don't remember, Shadows of Destiny was a game about choices, and time travel. This isn't quite it, but in SoD, the main character uses knowledge of the future to affect the past and alter his future. Not quite the same thing here, but similar enough to the point where you can draw parallels between the two mechanics. Choices you make in the story are recorded and have obvious effects. It's very "Choose Your Own Adventure-y".\n\nShadows of Mordor - The game's combat mechanics are pretty similar to Shadows of Mordor, in terms of how a normal fight goes. Hitting things at the right time will increase combo count and damage; there's counters that stop enemies in their tracks, there's dodging, etc. One thing that this game does have that Shadows doesn't is a Hookshot. :D Hearing the character go "Get over here!" is pretty great.\n\nRegarding the Narrator - The narration is a pretty large part of this game, so it feels fair to give a heads up about the Narrator. The guy is no Logan Cunningham, but he doesn't suck, either. In all honesty, the Narrator's voice occasionally reminds me of David Tennant or the Stanley Parable narrator, but that could just be the English talking. In any case, one of the things that I find interesting is that the Narrator tells the story "through" the characters. Basically, it's as if the Narrator is reading a storybook. Surprise. Meaning, he changes his voice depending on the character that's speaking. This works for some characters, but not for others. Of course, it could simply be said that it's as though he's a normal guy who's reading a book, so he might not get the voices exactly right every time.\n\nAlso, the Narrator does a pretty good job of actually voice acting. That is, he's not over the top, and he's not underwhelming, or hamming it up too much.\n\nPros:\nVery interesting story mechanic / choices. - Ability to go back after playing through and making new choices is awesome.\nCombat is decent. Sometimes it feels like it lacks impact, but at other times, it feels right on. Very cool mechanics - grab, throws, combos, style rewards.\nLovely world / aesthetic. Believeable characters, entertaining conversations, courtesy of the Narrator.\nMultiple endings. Super cool.\n\nCons:\nGraphical performance issues on mid-high end systems with High settings. Certain wind / particle effects / draw distance were causing me to drop frames.\nLong-ish loading screens. Unsure if it has to do with graphics, but on starting the game for the first time, I believe I had to wait about a minute before the beginning of the game played after I hit "New Game." I didn't see much of a wait for anything after that, though.\n\nIn any case, it's a bit of a flawed gem. I'd recommend it if story-based adventuring is your deal, if you enjoy Choose Your Own Adventure books, liked the world / style of Dust or liked the game Brave Fencer Musashi.","April 12","true","1.3"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

The multiple stories pretty seemlessly flow together and the ending telling you what you did to get it and a summary of that story is great.   The game also looks beautiful with its art design.  I love the narration and voice overs and while the combat system is a bit tricky for me its managable and likely wont be a problem for others. Its really nice to be able to do each story in a short sitting and that the choices are so meaningful to each story.\n\nI think the only cons I have are the inital loading time after you hit new or continue game takes  a bit long as far as load times is concerned.  Also that you can't have multiple save files so for a content creator like me you cant have one personal game and one youtube/stream game without moving saves around manually.\n\nIt does recommend using a controller but I have an xbox 360 controller specifically for my pc since some games like this just run and play better using a controller so thats no problem for me but might be a con to someone else.\n\nOverall thought: if your looking for a fun action rpg but dont want it to be as dark as say diablo style games then this is a must buy.I wanted to try it from the moment I first saw it since i think the genre is fun but most of the ones that are well known and popular atm are just too dark in nature for my tastes(diablo,path of exile, witcher series,dragons dogma,dark souls series, ect..).\n\nThis game is a very nice break from that and Its fun to play and will keep you wanting to come back for more.\n9.5/10","April 14","true","3.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

What about in-depth, branching story lines with multiple endings? Or endearing, relatable characters that really seem to grow on you? Well then, you're in luck, because this game is for you!\n\nThe game is structured in such a way that you play through five chapters, each containing a variation of exploration and combat encounters, and then receiving an ending. Once you've viewed the ending, you have two choices. You can say, "well, that was short and hardly worth the money," or you can do what the game intends and...play through it again.\n\nYep. You heard me. You play through another five chapters and that's it. Game Over. Now, this sounds boring and rather pointless, yeah? Here's the thing. At the end of every chapter, you get to make a choice. The choice you pick determins how the story branches. Save a character? Kill a character? Use an artifact? Every single choice leads you to a different path, and with each playthrough, more revelations are made regarding the story, and slowly things start to piece together. After several playthroughs, you can unlock the "true ending." That is, if you've made the right choices. And don't worry, the game will tell you upon a new playthrough which choices you've picked before. There seem to be over 20 different endings to the game, with each being unique.\n\nThe characters themselves are a hoot. You really get a sense of developement through the game as the game's narrator reads aloud all the dialog, like an audio book. Speaking of the dialog, I personally really enjoyed it. Random quips and whatnot from the narrator really add flair to the game.\n\nThe one downside is the actual gameplay. I'm sure some will find it repetive, boring, and tiresome. Mash X until things die. No, really. You do get some skills and abilities that spice things up, but in the end it's "walk into an encounter, kill enemies." Still, as you progress through the game and go through multiple play throughs, the combat does get a bit challenging. Despite the repetiveness, I really enjoyed the combat and found every encounter was fun. Oh, and speaking of abilities and skills, your level/skills DO carry over from every playthrough, so you're not starting from scratch every time. Also, there are some areas early on that are inaccessable unless you have a certain key item, which you can only get later in the game. It mixes up the levels just enough to keep you coming back for more.\n\nIn the end, Stories: TPoD is one of the better games I've played as of late, and I would highly suggest it. It's well worth the price tag.","April 12","true","11.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You keep what you learn and find on each playthrough, and even when you repeat the same map, you usually have a lot of new paths and changes to the plot based on what you've already learned.  For example, when you learn to use your grappling hook, you can use it to leap to new platforms, and you can craft several different colorful swords that double as keys, letting you into new places.  Sometimes the same map is completely changed by what you learn about the story on earlier playthroughs.\n\nThe arcade-game part is pretty simple, with some easy puzzles and neat combo moves.  Even though it warns you at the start that you need a twin-stick gamepad, I played it just fine with the mouse.  The combat is partly depending on your RPG stats and what swords you make, but mostly it's about timing and good gameplay.  You can win almost any fight without a scratch if you play well, but it's also easy to get massacred if you play poorly.  Combat moves include picking things up and throwing them, grappling hooks, zipping forward, blocking, and attacking, among other options.  It's fast-paced but being clever pays off:  you are a fox, after all.\n\nThere are some bugs, including random slowdowns and places where you get stuck in the landscape.  I found that swinging the sword helped me get out of those, because you step when you slice.  Likewise, I kept getting major slowdowns when a big dragon-head door opened, but shooting the grappling hook seemed to unfreeze the screen.  Despite that, I am having a wonderful time and I already feel I've gotten $15 of pleasure out of it after 5 hours of playing.  Yes it's pretty short, but for me at least it was an experience worth having.  It deserves to be discovered by a wider audience.","April 13","true","8.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The progression in a bit wonky, there are a few bugs (I haven't seen anything major, though others apparently have), some abilities are better than others, and getting the true ending doesn't take terribly long.  Despite its flaws, however, it's a solid game.  The combat is relatively simple, but there's always something to do, and enemy groups seem to scale to your growing abilities pretty well.

The combat and the way the story is told are both quite similar.\nThe first thing you'll notice is the beautiful art style. Levels constantly vary the environment, with highly saturated and beautiful worlds. It really is a joy to explore. The character designs are also very cool to look at.\n\nThe story is told by a narrator, who will comment on everything your character Reynardo does. Even small things like swinging your sword wildly in the air. All of the characters are also voiced by the narrator, which gives the entire game a very cozy feeling of a grand adventure in a bed-time story.\n\nAfter almost every single level, you will be given a choice where you can branch the story into completely unique places. The choices will even have you play an entirely new level, which is great for adding replay value to the game. I love that not all of the choices are black and white, in the sense that it isn't as simple as "Good or Bad". Things can have unforeseen consequences, while others can have surprisingly good outcomes.\n\nThe combat can be quite diverse. You can slash your sword and use spells depending on the weapon you have. Grappling hooks can pull your enemies towards you, and you may grab and throw enemies at others or off of cliffs. Countering, slow-motion and dodging all play roles in the combat as well.\n\nThe game rewards you for exploring through hidden chests and materials that you may use to create new weapons. It's all very satisfying.\n\nOverall, I'm really in love with the game's world. Although the dialogue isn't the best it could be, for the most part it's quite charming, funny and nice to listen to. The world looks beautiful, and the characters are likable. The combat is also very satisfying and easy to use!

I read up a bit about the game and liked the idea of it, reminded me of infamous, one of my personal top five favourite games. Choice your path sort of deals; will you be good or evil? After playing through the game and completing my first path, I thought to myself, "Holy crap, this game has a shi t-ton of replay value" If I wanted too, I could re-pick my previous choices and just change the last one if I wanted too and get a completely different ending or maybe even more levels to explore. Each level has multiple paths, each one requires different abilities or weapons to proceed. So, not only does this game allow the discovery of new levels but new paths in the same levels you've already "beaten". I say beaten in quotations because as I said, each level having different routes to take allows you to beat the level in different ways. Not to mention every play-though throws in something new to the mix from the looks of it, opening up more choices and more levels to choice and explore! Sadly, with each indie game comes problems and bugs. Clipping is an issue in this game but can be over looked due to the fact that you only notice it when in-game cut-scenes are playing. Not to mention clipping is a pretty hard bug to fix when you've got flowing capes and cloths. Another issue is the fact that the game doesn't run very well on high settings even with a beefy PC. I wish there was a way to set specific settings high - low - off. I don't mind running the game on medium, the only problem is you get a blur overlay which can be straining on one’s eyes. Surely there must be another way. I also notice less foliage and stuff like that when turning down the settings from high so the blur overlay should be an option rather then forced if not on high settings. Going back to the game itself, as I was completing my first path, I was awarded an achievement as/before the cut-scene was being played out? It spoiled what was going to happen, granted it was just in the next few seconds but it does still take away from the story telling aspect. Maybe award the player the achievement when you return to the menu so this does not happen? It was a real shame but it was overlooked as soon as I saw how many paths there were.\nOverall, this is a pretty good game but I need to play more of it before I can speak anymore for this game or recommend buying it. This review can be changed as I progress with the game.","May 2","true","1.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I really dislike that I have to play all the way through every level for every choice to get all the endings. It would be nice to be able to skip through levels for paths I've already gone down and only play through the level after a new choice. There's just not enough to do to make all the running around and mashing through enemies worth it. I've also found a few bugs without trying to, the most annoying of which was that my swords suddenly began cycling through the list uncontrollably during the final battle, which led to my death twice.\n\nAs for the story, I enjoyed it up until the "true path" where everything the story had tought me was flipped on its head. Up until the true path, I was taught that letting anyone go off and do their own thing would lead to catastrophe, so I tried to confront Lepino. Which was the wrong choice. And I had to replay the whole level which, mercifully, was short without all the previous side-tracking I'd done. Second, I was taught that Zenobia, despite her affection for Renardo, would always betray him anyway no matter how friendly she acted toward him, so it seemed like showing her the secret base was a stupid choice. Again, I made the wrong choice, died, and had to replay the whole level. It wouldn't have been so frustrating if it had just put me back at the beginning of the cutscene or even the beginning of the previous battle. But no, it sent me all the way back to the beginning of the level. Now I'm so frustrated that I wouldn't have the motivation to find all the endings even if I could skip previously-played levels.\n\nA few good points, though: the narrator was great and commented on my actions only rarely, which was the optimal amount; the art in the book is cool to look at; the new "very low" quality setting lets my sub-par computer run the game at a consistent frame rate without making everything look like colorful blobs; and the lore of the world is interesting to explore.

The idea of playing through separate stories with completely different branching paths sounds cool until you realize that some of them (Or, at least the ones I've played, and I played quite a few!) are just repeating the same levels (especially the last one) in the same way, just with a different narration. The voiceovers are honestly just a poor man's attempt at Bastions, not bad, but they lack the sexy voice and wit that made it especially enjoyable in Bastion. The combat is comparable to Batman's counter fest but to it's credit it does get more fun when they introduce more enemies and abilities the further you get, but once again it's nothing like Bastion in terms of enemy variety and expansive weaponry and it seems you're only sticking with one weapon (a sword) that has different effects the whole way. I've been told that there was supposed to be some kind of special mechanic about the music dynamically changing as the story went on, but I've never noticed because the music itself was not particularly memorable. The artwork was honestly pretty gorgeous at times although it did slow down in some situations, but I take what I can get with a GTX 750 ti. Still, the only graphical presets you get are: Low, Medium, and High. Very limited.\n\nTake what I'm saying with a grain of salt though as I've only put in three hours so far, and I'm thankful that Valve accepted my refund request. If you think you can stomach redoing the same brown battleship level in almost the same exact way for the fourth time, then this game might be up your alley.

And this game, while absolutely beautiful, should not tax my computer that much.\n\nThere are other cons of course, combat is a little too simplistic, the story can railroad you a little to get the "Four Truths", and there are no where near enough interesting enemies that I have seen yet.\n\nBut the positives of the game would far outweigh any cons of the gameplay that I could think of...if only I could play the game without framerate issues.\n\nI will state that if Spearhead fixes the framerate issues, and some random map glitches where the character falls through the ground, this game would be absolutely a thumbs up from me. But right now, I can't play it without getting incredibly frustrated by the tech issues.","April 13","false","1.1"," 15 of 34 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","15","34","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zespri/recommended/439190/","zespri","andrewsav","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zespri/","521 products in account","This is a rather frustrating game. Here are my gripes:\n\n- Not an RPG, a visual novel. Narrator is blaberring non-stop, there is no way to skip and instead of playing you are listening. For a visual novel - good - for an RPG - bad.\n\n- There are scrolls in the world with a wall-o-text. So feeding you generous helpings of story aurally is not enough, you are also supposed to spend another 5 minutes reading a god damn scroll. Well at least you can skip *that*.\n\n- The loading screens are black. I'm not kidding you. You do not know that it's an area end, and suddenly your screen turns black. Out of nowhere. Did my PC just hang? No, that's a loading screen. It just happens to be tastfully pitch-black, no embelishments, no boring tips, no nonsense!\n\n- The game is "optimized for controller" but it loses controller all the time. I mean I can move the mouse with steam controller, I can get to steam menu, by pressing the steam button while in game, so obviously controller itself works, and steam can talk to it, it's just the game itself suddenly stops reacting on controller button presses and stick movements. Not a kind of optimization I like.\n\n- You cannot alt-tab from the game. The initial loading screen was taking too long and I made a mistake of alt-tabbing. That locked my machine well and good and I had to reboot. Switched to windowed mode for the next attempt to avoid that\n\n- By the way, in the window mode they lock your cursor to the window, so although you are in windowed mode you cannot move your cursor out of the game window! Even if you want to click that little cross in top-right coner to shut it down. May be that's what they meant by "controller optimized"?\n\n- There are altars and "crafting stations" in the game. At altars you improve your skills when you gain a level and at "crafting stations" you improve your weapon when you collected enough "ore". This makes sense. What does not, is that as you move forward, the areas behind you get closed off by something looking like an energy field. God knows why. Probably because developers did not want to deal with the possible bugs causing by player back tracking, so they just desided to close it off for a heck of it. This feels unrealistic, but on the top of it it's also annoying. Say you are one ore short to upgrade your weapon, while next to a "Crafting station". You go around the corner and find the missing ore. Now you want to go back to the crafting station, but no you can't it's now closed off. Wait for the next one.\n\n- Finally, there are check points right before a battle. If you happen to be low health on the checkpoint, you are screwed. You get your ♥♥♥ handed to you, but your only save is to right before the battle with your miniscule health. You can't win and you can't do anything, because you cannot go back and heal. So game over, start from the beginning.\n\nI think I'm done.\n\n***Update***: so I finished the game today, took me 9 hours in total. This is how it went.\n- Playthrough 1 - Discoveted 1st truth\n- Playthrough 2 - Discovered 2nd truth\n- Playерough 3 - Discovered 3rd truth\n- Playthrough 4 - Unloced key plate  icon that guides you to the final truth\n- Playthrough 5 - Discovered 4th, final truth\n- Playthrough 6 - Finished the game, a golden key icon indicated the correct story choice\n\nSome of the gripes above lessened as I played the game but some are not.\n\nThe most annoying is still that you cannot go back and you do not alway know when you are goint to be blocked off. For an OCD person wanting to explore every possible path, this is supper annoying.\n\nWhat turned out to be a lesser problem is health. If you end up a fight with amount of health less than a half of a total health you are topped up to half of you health for free. Did not realize it was the case when wrote the above.\n\n*Some* narrative are skippable. But it does not help a lot because most are not.\n\nBlack loading screens you get used to after a while. They are not long anyway.\n\nController disconnection plagues this game (working fine with other game so this is not a controller problem it's a game problem).\n\nIt's not possible to view your stats, or weapon stats, or skill descriptions, or weapon abilities if you are not at altar and/or crafting station. Was that really that difficult to add a button that shows them when you want to look at them?\n\nIf you have a program such as instant messanger that pop ups messaged on top of a full screen game, that locks the game. Quit everything that can do that before you play.\n\nAnd window mode for some reason only activate after the game is loaded, that is the game always start at full screen and then if you chosen windows mode resizes itself in a window. I find this pretty lame.\n\nThere are very few enimy types:\n- normal melee\n- sheild\n- fire mage\n- support mage\n\nThat's it. You also have eyes but they are trivial, and they never participate in battles with other enimy types, you simply pick them up one by one from behind or from the sides.\n\nThis game done right might have a lot of potential, unfortunately I cannot recommend it the way it turned out.","April 15","false","10.7"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","0"

This game is extremely bad in its optimization. Granted that I don't have a super rig to play this game, I am still able to run games with obvious higher graphics demand and CPU demand with higher framerates (Dying Light, Napoleon Total War, Skyrim).\n\nThat is pretty much the only reason why I'm not recommending this game because for all you know, your computer may run into the same problems as I did and it would be some ~$14 down the drain. Because the performance seems to vary across player to player and is undependent on their hardware specifications, buying this game is like investing in risky venture (not really).\n\nIf it works, great!

There was no option about V-sync or anything to do with graphics settings, thats my 1st problem with the game.\n\nBut the main problem I have with the game is how it runs. For me this game cant stay at a constent framerate. Like when I'm running around it goes from 30 to 25 to 15. yet when I'm in a crafting menu it goes up to 60 yet if I go to the main menu it back at 30.\n\nI have no idea why this happens and to me it makes no sence why it should be happerning on a high end laptop. and ajusting the setting really dosnt help and turning off full screen makes it worst.\n\nThe final thing I want to mention is how long the loading times are for me. I was waiting for a good 5minutes for the game to eventualy load. Personaly I thought it was loading the world so that I would'nt have to worry about it loading around me but due to the bad framerate I dont think that was the case.\n\nover all I think this game is good and I really want to play more of it, but due to how badly its running I cant see me playing this game on the move.\n\nby the look of this game it looks like it was made for 60FPS which makes it a real big shame that it just cant be played at anything else.","April 14","false","0.3"," 7 of 22 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","7","22","0","1"

If you like putting things together to craft a few swords and do some simple skill tree and socket gems stuff, this is for you.\n\nYou'll mainly be killing ravens and running along. Enjoy. Not for me, I lasted about ten minutes.","June 5","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
