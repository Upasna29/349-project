I'd been through basic and advanced training, but nothing prepares you for the fear of your first time in the arena. I was stumbling around in the wilderness looking for supplies, but then a message came through. My partner, who's existence I had completely forgotten, sent me a message.\n\n"We should meet up." he says.\n\nI was filled with a new sense of hope. Suddenly I felt less alone in the madness. I explain to my partner that it's my first time and he tells me he'll take care of me.\n\n"We can win this." he says.\n\n"My name is Kyle." he says.\n\nI told him I was Daniel and he tells me to wait where I am. So I stick around in the area waiting for my buddy. As I was exploring my spawn I found the entrance to a sewer, I was worried to enter alone, but the thought of surprising my partner with some cool loot on his arrival gave me courage. Looking down the surprisingly pristine tunnel I see a crate and a man stood over it. Immediately I panic, knowing I couldn't fight the man I ran back out of the sewer to find Kyle waiting for me.\n\n"There's someone in there." I say.\n\n"Let's get them then." he says as he drops a spear for me.\n\nWe storm into the tunnel only to find an empty crate and the man long gone. We follow the tunnels for some time and come out atop a cliff looking over a bridge that sat above the forests below. I spot two men running across the bridge, one man completely naked save for a waist cloth, the other dressed in jeans, a blue shirt and a tan cowboy hat. I had no idea at that time just how dangerous the man in the cowboy hat was.\n\n"We can't catch up to them." Kyle says, aiming a bow down at the other contestants.\n\n"It's fine, we need to find better weapons anyway." I say, trying to sound experienced and clever.\n\nWe travel for sometime, eventually crossing the bridge where we had spotted the man in the cowboy hat. That's when we heard it. The first death announcement, one player had murdered another with a spear. We froze for a few seconds before continuing on our hunt for supplies. Eventually we came across a building close to the centre of the arena.\n\n"Looks untouched." Kyle says.\n\nBefore I can say anything he charges forward into the building. I follow, wary of traps, but excited to finally kit up. We raid the place, I grabbed some pepper spray and Kyle got a knife and a new bow, he handed me his old one. Suddenly a message pops up.\n\n"I hear someone." Kyle says.\n\n"I'm gonna check the roof. Stay here and guard the doors." he says, leaving me alone downstairs.\n\nTime ticks by and I grow more and more nervous. Then all of a sudden ♥♥♥♥ hit the fan.\n\n"They're coming in!" Kyle shouts.\n\nThen the door to the building swings open and two men charge in, the man in the cowboy hat and his naked friend. I panic and fire a few arrows at the men, but only a few shots connect. I quickly retreat upstairs to the roof. Kyle stands ready with his knife and I pull out my spear.\n\nAfter just a few seconds the men were charging up the stairs. The naked man pushes me back onto the open roof and we begin to brawl. He swung at me over and over with his fists, beating me to a pulp. I fought back as best I could, but my technique was pathetic and he beat me within an inch of my life, but just as things looked their darkest I see my opponent collapse in a pool of blood, cut to pieces by Kyle.\n\nIt wasn't over yet though. The man in the cowboy hat charged Kyle and the two enter a fierce brawl, I try to support Kyle, but I hold back for fear of friendly fire. Time seemed to move slower then, the fight went on for what felt like a good five minutes. Kyle fought bravely, but a chop to the head from the opponent's ice axe killed him. Wounded the man in the cowboy hat moved to retreat, I manage to spear him through the gut while he runs, but it didn't finish him.\n\nThen one last message.\n\n"Sorry. Good game." Kyle says.\n\nI was lost, without Kyle I was sure I couldn't win, but I swore vengeance on the man in the cowboy hat. I took time to heal my wounds and then made for the centre of the arena. Along the way I open up a supply crate and claim a wrench as my new weapon. When I arrive at the centre I find a massive brawl taking place between four men, I dive in, ready to die in a blaze of glory.\n\nI swing my wrench into the head of a man with a machete and he dies on the spot. I grab up his machete and charge toward a naked man holding a blowgun, five quick cuts and he drops to the ground. Two down, two to go. I see one of the other two men drop after taking a hit from the last enemy's bow. I charge forward and with a heavy swing I knock the bow from his hands, then two powerful blows and he's on the ground.\n\nBarely injured and full of adrenaline I stood amongst the corpses. I was going to win this, for Kyle.\n\nWhen I looked up to the scoreboard I saw that I was among the last three alive. I knew the man in the cowboy hat was one of the three, I was sure of it. I waited in the centre, hoping my prey would come to me, and indeed it did.\n\nAn arrow whizzed past my head and I looked up to the centre platform. There he was, the man in the cowboy hat. I ran as fast as I could, charging towards him. Two arrows puncture my chest, but I shrug them off, I had to kill this man. With a swift slash I knock the bow from his hands, then I hack down with my machete, one, two, three, and he was dead. I had finally achieved vengeance for Kyle.\n\nNow I just had one target left.\n\nBang.\n\nA single shot rang out from the forest by the centre and I fell to my death.\n\nBooted to the main menu I was presented the reward for my service.\n\nA pink baseball cap. It looks ridiculous, but I wear it in every match. In memory of Kyle.","March 4","true","8.0"," 1,822 of 1,916 people (95%) found this review helpful 1,340 people found this review funny","95","822","1","340","124"

I just spawned and got pretty lucky with finding a tier Three weapon really quick. as i was looting a player named Suicidal Chicken showed up. I knew i was going to win the match because my gear was far Superior than his. But what i found to come is he did not want to fight he wanted to be freinds, I threw down a man Tracker to gain his trust and then for the rest of the match we went and doubled team other players until we had amazing supplies. As the game was nearing the end we killed the last of the other contestants, we both threw all out weapons down and just looked at each other. As the gas was closing in on us he threw down a claymore and tried to kill his self. As he did i vigorously shoke my head no in disaproval, i grabed a shord and threw it in front of him so he could kill me. But he just shoke his head no and then ran into the gas and killed him self and i won the game. As he was running in to the gas i found my self yelling at the computer for him not to do it. We did not speak one word to each other but because of this game me and him had a weird connection and both had an amzing game.\n\nkeep up the great work with this game so i can have more experiances like the one posted above.","March 14","true","129.6"," 1,115 of 1,179 people (95%) found this review helpful 521 people found this review funny","95","115","1","521","41"

The Culling is a first person, survival multiplayer game. You play as an unfortunate individual who has been chosen to be a contestant in a bloody and brutal last-man-standing gameshow. You will attempt to craft, kill, and survive your way to victory and get some cool rewards along the way!\n\nPositives:\nThe game looks gorgeous.\nMost animations are very well done.\nThe game runs like butter 99% of the time thanks to UE4!\nThe playable area is a pretty good size, and there's plenty of buildings, crafting supplies and loot for everyone.\nThere is a drop system that rewards you after every game. Winning nets better loot.\nThe handling of most weapons feels smooth and natural.\nThe perk system allows for you to apply 3 different modifiers to yourself, letting you customize your playstyle.\nLoad times are pretty quick.\nCombat is well thought out for the most part. Everything has a counter if you're skilled enough.\nThis game doesn't take a lot to run, has pretty low minimum requirements for a 2016 game.\nKnocks H1Z1's Battle Royale out of the water, and it's cheaper.\nThe crafting system allows for more interesting fights throughout the match.\nThe game is par for the course on graphics options, and you can rebind every key!\nAirdrops, random events, and a smartass announcer make each game interesting and a little different.\nThe time limit is perfect(20min), allowing players time to plan ahead, prepare, stalk, craft, or whatever they want.\nYou can customize your character to a limited extent, but there are many different clothes you can get.\nThe map gets smaller over time so that players can't just hide2win.\nThere are plans for a ranked mode, so more hardcore gamers can compete!\nThe game currently uses EasyAntiCheat, which is actually pretty good despite what some people say.\nThe devs are very active and open. Future plans, bugs, fixes, and more are available.\nThe game has quite an impressive amount of weapons.\nYou can play alone or with a buddy!\nNegatives:\nSome weapons need to be rebalanced.\nDespite the large playerbase, sometimes you'll be in the queue for up to 10mins.\nThe game is currently locked at 62fps.\nThere is occasional lag/hiccups in online multiplayer. (Both network and FPS)\nSometimes the game won't connect to the online servers at all.\nThere is currently no ingame voice chat, though this may not be a negative for some.\nThe usual alpha bugs are present, it effects some people more than others. (Crashing, disconnecting, errors, not starting, etc) I personally have encountered very few of them.\nSo is it worth it?\nIf you currently like H1Z1's Battle Royale, or used to like it and then broke away because of Daybreak's recent shenanigans, then I can easily recommend this game to you. This is a game designed for replay value, which means you'll absolutely get your $15 worth out of it. 20 minute matches means you don't have to commit to long play times, you can hop in and play a match and then hop off! Every match plays out differently and will keep you on your toes, so getting bored won't be a problem if you're someone who likes these types of games. In my opinion, $15 is a steal for a game like this.\n\n(Did you like this review? If so, please vote it up!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Silver-Sama/recommended/437220/","Silver-Sama","Silverrrrr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Silver-Sama/","223 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI was alone in the hot, bug infested forest. Trudging through the swampy area as I saw an airdrop buzz by overhead. I was poorly armed with nothing but 2 medkits and a crowbar, so I really needed the supplies. I followed it all the way to the airdrop where I saw the man take a compound bow, a bowie knife and an impact grenade out. That guy was a walking armory and that only made me wanna kill him more.\n\nStalking the man a bit more, I tried to look for a moment to strike... Then I saw him toss his grenade, a moment later I saw a naked black man fly through the air from the explosion, screaming in pain as the armed stranger charged him. I knew that the black guy was a new player since he had no equipment or weapons, nor did he have any clothes. So I took pity.\n\nGripping my terse, rusty shaft in hand, I dashed out of the bushes and nailed the assailant square in the back of the head with a fully charged crowbar swing, pounding his occiput a few more times before he finally caught on, leaving the black man to slink away into the grass as I took on Rambo head to head. It was a tense battle, but ultimately, my surprise attack had damaged him too much for him to hope of recovering, so I bested him with a decent amount of health left.\n\nLooking into the distance, the bloodied and bruised newbie crawled back out to confront me. He swaggered from side to side as if to size me up as I just coldly stared. I didn't want to hurt him, and he obivously didn't want to try to pick a fight with me... Not when I was the one with combat experience and also a weapon.\n\nBefore the man finished examining me, however, some maniac with a machete ran in from off screen. Eyes fixed on my scared little friend as he cut a big chunk out of his torso, winding up for another hit that would have certainly ended the tortured man's suffering if it weren't for my swift actions.\n\nI deftly jumped in front of the blade, blocking it with my crowbar as I took on yet another psycho head on for the sake of this unarmed newbie. I was still hurt from my last brawl, and it showed. For the entire course of the battle, the deranged bladeslinger had more health and stamina than me, going into a heavily offensive playstyle as I struggled to hang in there. But then... An idea...\n\nAfter shoving my attacker away, I managed to quickly toss a medkit to my battered aquaintance. Hoping to god he'd figure out what to do with it as I struggled to not die. My hp was near 10 at this point as I clung to life by a thread. Just before my attacker delivered my own killing blow, I see someone leap from the hill next to us gripping a rock, bashing the machete weilding lunatic a few times in the back of the skull. It was the black guy. Full health and all.\n\nAfter my new friend bravely took the battle into his own hands, I took a moment to regain some stamina before bludgeoning our mutual enemy to death. After all the bloodshed, we looked up at each other. He didn't look scared this time, as I offered him the machete that almost killed both of us, as well as a backpack and some pepperspray. He gladly accepted and we traveled together to heal at a station.\n\nArriving at the station, I healed first. Then I went to scout ahead for a brief moment. Merely moments after I reached the top of the hill I was scouting, I hear very close screams of pain as the snide announcer told me some guy was gored by a spear. I ran back down the hill in a panic, I had no idea what had happened. When I came to the site, I saw a man with a strange bug-mask panting breathlessly as he held a blood dripping pike...\n\nThe corpse at his feet was my new friend...\n\nI felt no feeling after that, exept for pure, unbridled, boiling rage. And I saw no colors but red.\n\nWith reckless abandon, I leaped on the dirty friend-killer. Hacking away with a Bowie Knife as he tried to escape. But I didn't let him. I slashed and diced, butchered and mangled until all that was left was a quivering, miserable pile of meat and blood at my feet. I didn't feel happy though. No, no.\n\nI was still thirsty.\n\nAnother faceless nobody charged at me after hearing all the pleads of mercy, flinging a few arrows my way that whizzed past my head within inches, but I didn't flinch or waver. I charged head on, tossing a crowbar square at his nose and breaking it. Afterwards I gave the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ a lesson in manners. In my grief fueled stupor I gutted him like a squealing pig, I hardly had time to revel in my artful slaughter as ANOTHER ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ charged me.\n\nAfter getting nailed with a few tossed spears, I struggled around with the vulture, finding a pepperspray bottle on the ground and perfectly seasoning the ♥♥♥♥er's eyes. Sending him to the grave with a few deft backstabs as I tried to heal at the healthstation.\n\nThen another guy showed up.\nFor chrissakes...\n\nI immediately knew I wasnt going to win this, but I managed to quickly fall behind a rock and use my other medkit, restoring all my hp and yadda yadda yadda I won.\n\nAfter all that, I look up at the scoreboard. There was only one guy left, and he had 0 kills. But I didn't care. I didn't care about any of that. I went off in search of him using a mantracker. And after a few tense minutes of hunting, I found him. He was slowly walking out from behind a tree as I examined him. He was of moderate build... Dark skin... A backpack... A... Machete...?\n\nHe looked at me without a hint of fear as he just danced left and right. As some primitive sign of friendship. It was ACTUALLY him.\n\nI sat there astonished as I realized I mistook the corpse in the forest as my friend. And then it settled...\n\nWe were the only ones left.\n\nI didn't know what to do, I was overjoyed that the man I saved was actually surviving... But I was crushed because there can only be one victor. I tossed my weapons down and looked at him, hoping he'd realize what was going on. And he did. He took my pepperspray and blasted it into my eyes, I sat there awaiting death in the darkness... Waiting... Waiting... Waiting...\n\nI regained vision and looked around... He was gone? I searched around for a bit until I saw him again. He was tampering with a gas valve, and then activated it. As the gas alarms went off, he just stared back at me. He didn't try to run away from the gas... It hit me what he was doing.\n\nBefore I could stop him or save him, he fell dead at my feet. He had given his life so I could bask in glory. But there was no basking. It was dark, shady and the air had a thick macabre vibe looming about. I won. But at what cost? I watched my only friend die twice. And I can't even avenge his name this time. He truly died in vain...\n\n\n10/10 would draw tons of drama from an arena game again.","March 27","true","60.4"," 810 of 891 people (91%) found this review helpful 516 people found this review funny","91","810","891","516","52"

It's setup as a Battle Royale game-show, complete with Borderlands'esk Claptrap-style commentary, directing a group of 16 men to gather weapons or craft improvised ones from the game area. The rounds last around 18 minutes, with a steadily shrinking play zone forcing all contestents to the centre with only one making it out alive.\n\nWhat impressed me the most was the depth of the combat. It's not simply a case that "the guy with the gun is king". Melee weapons smack ranged ones out of the user's hand within the first few moments. And turning your back for a moment allows your opponent double damage in a backstab. Meaning contestents circle each other swinging, blocking and throwing blades/poisons at each other to get an edge. It always feels like you're learning something new each fight.  And I've seen heavily-armed new players quickly defeated by experienced ones armed with only sticks!\n\nHighly recommend so far.

And bring a friend!\n\nTIPS for new players: Put on the Surprise Me! airdrop and focus on that for the first several games as you learn the ropes and learn the map. You likely won't win many games for a while, but once the mechanics click, you'll have a blast destroying people.\n\nPro's:\n-No Pay2Win\n-Everyone starts Evenly (aside from perk choices/airdrop choice)\n-All perks unlocked from start (airdrops are unlocked through playthrough, though)\n-The map is a great size for the 16 players\n-Random spawns for players and loot keep things interesting while map awareness leads you to higher chance of good loot\n-Simple crafting system that is somewhat complex but easy to get a hold of with no menu's to fiddle around with\n-If you are unfortuneate, you can use said crafting system to somewhat catch you up to fight more fortuneate players\n-Melee combat is simple but interesting, and you can actually win against someone with a better weapon than you if you're skilled at it\n-Guns are few and far inbetween, typically 0-2 guns per round, making the rest of the combat fun\n-Character outfit customization is via random rewards after each match, whether win or lose.\n-Said outfit rewards can be sold on the Steam Marketplace, especially rare ones. Have so far made back $7.00 by selling outfits I don't want\n\nNeutral:\n-Not complete FFA, there is no 'Alliances', but that would probably make the game imbalanced anyways (fixable after voice added)\n-No Voice Chat (after playing for a bit, I'm not sure if it needs one or not anymore, since teaming up would become very unfair to others.)\n-Would like more random events in a match\n-Kinda want winning a round to give you something special, like a choice between 3 rewards or a new airdrop package\n-I think the Team mode should have the team fight it out at the end of the round until one member survives, last man standing after all. Would be fun.\n-Spectator mode could become something very interesting, like the spectators being able to call in airdrops/events with the FUNC they died with, while regenerating it over time or something\n-With above, the ability to join in and spectate matches already started and doing the same thing.\n\nCon's: (Most of this is already in the RoadMap)\n-1 map, really would like more variety (Confirmed more at later date, for free)\n-There isn't a custom lobby mode, for if you wanted to make a battle royale with just friends\n-Sometimes during loading of matches it can sort of freeze for a bit (could use more optimizations for the loading stuff, my SSD handles it fine but my friend can crash)\n-Guns need a slight damage nerf, as once you get one you are almost guarenteed a kill","March 7","true","119.6"," 129 of 137 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","129","137","5","4"

There is literally no other battle royale style game that comes even close to touching this one. But, and its a really big but, The Culling has always had bad netcode and as of late, possibly because of the last patch, its gotten terrible. The techicality of the melee combat is gone. Its dead. If the other player has a high ping or a spot of lag you'd do better to chuck all of your items in random directions and accept your inevitable death. Because of their high ping all of their animations seem to be a second or two behind and sometimes they're just dead wrong. The other player will hit you without swinging their weapon, block you while shoving, and stab you through a block. Especially if the other player is experienced, you can expect to lose half your hp before they are even visibly near you. Just moments ago I finished my tenth match in a row for the night, all of which I died to a player whose animations never correctly matched what they were doing. One of those deaths was to a player who shot arrows out of his wrist which was very clearly holding a bowie knife. As of now it seems the only way to deal with a high-ping player is to use ranged weaponry or throw your melee weapons. (and dont even get me started on how far weapons can fly if they hit the floor at a wierd angle, ive seen a bow fly 50 meters away because it landed perfectly vertically, and how weapons just seem to despawn sometimes when thrown) But with how quick players can move and turn in this game, unless your experienced with using bows or you have a gun, good luck, that can be quite difficult. Furthermore, since the last patch it seems that the devs are more focused on adding new rocks and caves to the map instead of fixing the netcode. So to summarize, I love this game, I really do, it is bundles of fun when it works, but I believe the general populace plays games to have fun, and right now The Culling is 90% rage-inducing irritation.\n\nUpdate as of April 20th, 2016~\n\nTo my knowledge there has been two patches since I wrote this review. Teamers in FFA have become a regular problem and are becoming a major one. Out of the last few days i've played this game, of the 7 FFA matches i've been a part of, five have had two players team up. Unless you are a player that possesses good kiting skills, an explosive (which are much more rare now, which is a good thing) or some really good gear, a 2v1 is pretty much sure death if the 2 are of decent skill. On top of that the problems with latency and netcoding are still very much apparent and if anything the two patches have made them worse. It seems with each patch the main focus has been balancing weapons and gear. The devs have done a good job of it too, but for this game to survive it needs to bring enjoyment to the player... and right now the lag kills it. Players will suddenly gain a boost of speed and run 15 feet in an instant because their lagging, and the melee combat is atrocious, hence my mention of kiting. All in all, ranged combat is about the only sufficable way to engage someone since a players animations during melee are out of sync. Again I ADORE THIS GAME. And the game certainly doesnt suck. But i CANNOT recommend a game until the majority of it is enjoyable.\n\nUpdate as of May 1st, 2016~\n\nPlease keep in mind that this review is outdated by two patches now but the problems do still persist. Maybe not as bad but they are definately still there. Lag isnt as terrible but some melee attacks can still be 'ghosted' (not registered) as I like to call them. And when that attack happens to be a fully charged backstab that would've won you the fight.... its disheartening to say the least. And some swings still go through your block, fps has become a major problem for a large percentage of the player base since shadows are forced to be on now, etc... As you said Happy, the ping/lag is heavily area/server based, but ping is still a problem for everyone, 100 ping on average being the base ping isnt the best, and I do not take my playstyle not being viable etc. into account for my review, especially since I do not have a playstyle per say. I constantly change perks, tactics, and more as that keeps the experience 'fresh' for me. I cant seem to word that better than that so i hope that makes sense. Thank you for the comment though, as it did include some points I should've covered. Overall though I want my main point to be this: The Culling is fun and since these last two patches it is now very playable and enjoyable if you keep in mind that it is early access and will have problems, but it is no longer completely broken. I do take that into account and the only reason at this point my review is still negative is that, personally, a game must be enjoyable for the majority of the time you will spend playing it for me to give it a positive review. And right now i feel that i cannot make that recommendation in good faith to someone new looking to pick this up.\n\nP.S. ~ As to the guy who just keeps commenting on my review "-1" you never provide any reasons or evidence to support your stance (not to mention your profile is private so one cannot even tell if you even play The Culling) so i will continue to delete your comment every time you place as it does not provide anything useful to anybody who may read this review and I am genuinely trying to help people here with nothing but honesty as I do not review games often and The Culling has pretty much stolen my heart, so I care enough to try and help it grow.","April 8","false","116.6"," 293 of 363 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","293","363","4","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkSoad/recommended/437220/","DarkSoad","DarkSoad [Curator]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkSoad/","383 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe Culling\nThe Culling makes a twist on the Survival Genre, taking us to a competition rather than an island or a city infested by zombies. 16 players have 25 minutes to gather resources, find loot and craft their own weapons in order to survive the rest of the players. Will you approach violently by building a chainsaw? in a stealthy way, with a crossbow? Or just trying to stay inside a house, setting traps at the doors and hoping no one will find you? It's up to you, and the game gives a lot of variety on doing so.\n\nStory: Introduction to The Culling\nThe game is focused entirely on multiplayer, so there's really no campaign mode or side quests available. But The Culling itself it's like a TV Show in a Hunger Games style. There's an announcer that makes comments when different things happen, such as someone dying, when a special crate or loot becomes available, among other moments. Also, if we look at the sky we can find the list of the current players in the match, along with their status and, in case of death, how and by whom they've been killed.\n\nThere are three modes available: Free for All, Team and Practice. The first one takes us to a map with 15 other contestants, where the main goal it's "kill or be killed". The second one lets us choose a partner from our Friends List or be assigned with a random player, in groups of two. There's also an in-game chat to communicate with our partner privately and he will appear in the game with a blue aura, so it's easier to find him. And the last one offers a basic and advanced tutorial for new players, with the possibility to play a match against the AI.\n\nEach player is deployed on the map inside a box and they all start with nothing but their fists. Once the match begins, we have to start picking up items such as branches and rocks in order to craft our very first weapons and equipment. But these actions cost F.U.N.C. points (which stands for Flexible Universal Nano Compound, I highly recommend doing the tutorial because it's explained in a very fun way there). This helps to balance the game, avoiding a player from crafting a fire weapon in the first 10 minutes of the game. We can find F.U.N.C. in the map and we'll obtain more by perfoming different actions.\n\nCrafting: How to survive, step by step\nThe Culling it's all about crafting and being lucky. Once we start playing, our main goal is to craft a weapon with only rocks and branches. For example, two rocks will give us a knife and if we add a branch we'll get a Spear. We can obtain these materials by interacting with the enviroment, like punching a tree or the floor to obtain stone. The Crafting recipes are always available in the pause screen, using icons to indicate which and how many elements we'll need. There are tons of different weapons, and they all belong to different categories, like Blunt Weapons, Knife type weapons like swords or machetes and then Ranged weapons. There are also stun guns, pepper spray, grenades and much more.\n\nBut don't worry, there are different loadouts and skills to choose from, which make the task of choosing which way we're going to play and approach our enemies fun and different each time. The categories are: Melee Weapons, Ranged Weapons, Utility, Health/Stamina, General Defense and General Offense. We are free to choose up to three perks per Loadout, and we can select them for a Melee, Ranged or Trapper build (Or just change their names and build our own category). Should we begin the match with a body armor? Less crafting time? Or perhaps having the ability to deal more damage with a specific weapon? There's no limit but our imagination, and we can expect to see even more perks in the future.\n\nWe can also customize our character by changing the hair, face, skin colour and it's outfit. After every match, despite winning or losing, we'll get a random  cloth equipment. And finally, in exchange of F.U.N.C. and using the needed locations, we can call an Airdrop with weapons, armor and items of our choice, selecting them in the main menu.\nThere are also special events where a drone will deliver a package to a random location of the map, and all the players will try to get it first.\n\nBesides Crafting, there are different locations like Gas Stations, an empty airport and warehouses that contain crates and lockers with different items. Each player has to begin looting the nearest place right away if they don't want to get overwhelmed by the equipment of their enemies. We can also find Hazard Valves which can be activated, either to spread a poison gas to everyone in that area or to poison our traps and weapons, dealing aditional damage when the other players get hit.\n\nThe Island: Graphics and Map Content\nAt the moment there is only one map available, but it's size it's perfect for 16 players. Apart from the buildings, we can find towers, a really long underground section trough the sewers, caves and lots of water. The region looks like a jungle, so there are a lot of trees and bushes where we can sneak and hide from enemies.\n\nBesides the giant players list, there is an indicator on the sky that works as a reference for the middle of the map, and that's where the Arena is located. When the clock reaches 10 minutes, the hazard valves will start activating themselves, leading us to the center if we want to stay alive. This is a great mechanic, because it stop players from camping or hiding for too long, and eventually all the remaining contestants will have to face each other in the arena.\n\nThe game is built in Unreal Engine 4 and it looks really good. Although the animations on the characters need some work on, but remember that it's barely starting it's early access process.\n\nKill or be Killed: The Verdict\nThe Culling is a great experience, a game that was shown like a contest among players and that is achieving it step by step. Each match is different from the previous one, and it takes some time to learn new strategies and achieve the victory. It's a fun game and the primary mechanics are already in it, but playing in the same map can get boring with time.\n\nWe can expect more maps in the future, weather and day/night cycle conditions, more crafting recipes and other features. The game is being developed by the studio Xavant Games, which developed Lichdom Battlemage in the past, and they are very active both in sites like reddit and steam forums. They managed to create a new game style and I can't wait to see where it will go on the feature, maybe with worldwide championships and a lot more content. There is also a community market and we can trade, sell and buy equipment right on Steam.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","March 16","true","5.8"," 130 of 144 people (90%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","90","130","144","14","6"

When the game first came out it instantly became one of my favorite games in my steam library of all time. But then the infamous combat update was released that literally ripped it's heart and soul out. What once was fast paced, heart pounding, skill demanding combat has now been replaced with a gear above all, button mashing ♥♥♥♥ fest. The game has essentially been boiled down to a dice roll as every match your success is now contingent on your spawn location and the value of the loot that spawns around you. Can't find a decent weapon? Well you're basically ♥♥♥♥ outta luck. Because you're evnetually going to run into someone who has a katana or sledge hammer, and no matter how much combat skill you have you're not going to be able to outmanuever the higher tier weapons. Before the combat patch, I would've given this game a 10/10. It literally consumed my life for the first couple weeks I played it. But after the combat update it is now a 4/10 imo. I miss the old Culling. If they ever decide to remedy these factors then I will gladly change my review to positive. But until then I cannot recommend this game.","April 8","false","77.9"," 563 of 755 people (75%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","75","563","755","21","43"

Small games of 16 max players (You vs 15 other people), 20 minute intense games.\n\nAbsolutely 100% P2P, no P2W or pay for cosmetics (As of Closed Alpha) all cosmetics are unlocked every round in the game. There is a tab for females although it doesn't work in alpha, hopefully on release it will be available.\n\nI think this is my new favorite game, I am a huge fan of BR type games and this one feels so much more realistic and skill based then any other in this genre. The combat system just feels so real.\n\nThis game does have a slight learning curve, at first you will be put in and wonder what the hell you're doing and why you constantly are throwing up mid combat or why some people seem to be so much better than you at combat. It all takes time to learn the ins and outs of this game and once you do the experience is truly rewarding.\n\nFight for drops, loot, and events in a challenging arena game show.\n\nThe adrenaline rush you get when you get a kill and the rush you get from winning is remarkable. A truly addicting game that will be well worth your $15!\n\nI hope to see you all on the Island!","March 4","true","90.0"," 89 of 106 people (84%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","84","89","106","9","6"

I found her there, lyin' there, lifeless. Blood soaked in the floorboard, blood on my hands, blood everywhere.\n\nAnd that's how they found me.\n\nI never made it big, so they saddled me with some doe-eyed child as green as lawyers come. But I'm poor and he's free. You get what you pay for. Never had a fightin' chance. Innocent 'till guilty... hah. The thing is, I as good as did it. I owed a man money who you shouldn't owe money, hopin' it would float us 'till I won big, but she wound up dead before I could get in the ring.\n\nNow they've sentenced me to this Godd$%mn television show. I gotta fight 15 other murderers for entertainment. Sick world we're livin' in these days. No place for a decent man. That's OK for me I guess, 'cuz I sure as S#%! ain't decent anymore. They say I'm a murderer, well I'm gonna be. How ever many it takes to get back out and find the men who did this. If killin' is gonna make this world a little more decent, then hell, I got nothin' to lose.\n\nEPISODE 2:\n\nThey got me in this trainin' room. Showin' me how to make things to kill people. There's this stuff called F.U.N.C. they give me; it's like magic, somethin' about nanotech-whatever. I take two rocks, rub em together with some of this FUNC stuff and I get a knife, I smash a piece of wood on that, I get an axe. Still pretty primitive lookin', and I prefer usin my mitts, but if it'll get the job done, I suppose in some F#%$ed up way I'm grateful.\n\nI know they're just doin' it for entertainment. The better they train us, the better the show we can put on, but the way they look at me, I know I'm doin' somethin' special. Maybe this is why I wasn't any good at anythin' else I ever did. Maybe it's 'cuz deep down, I'm a born killer.\n\nThis mornin' they showed me how to rig a steel trap, get someone right in the doorway and BAM, stick em right in the back. I always been the face-to-face kinda fighter, but if these are lowlife murderers and rapists, I won't have any trouble sleepin' at night.\n\nAfter that, they got me usin' bows, poison darts, throwin' knives, an' for the big finale, explosives. Godd@$n, I shoulda been a military man.\n\nI got one more day in this cage. Tomorrow they're gonna drop me in. No rules, just brutal slaughter to please the masses. I never felt more ready for anything in my life. I'm gonna sleep like a baby.\n\nEPISODE 3:\n\nThis is it. They got me in this room with every kinda weapon you could want. Say I can pick out a package. If I earn enough, they'll send some airdrop in for me. Isn't any scavenged business either; all top notch. Only the best for us cons. World's gone crazy. I pick up a rifle, check the clip: only four bullets. No way I'm makin' those shots. I move away from the firearms, too loud anyway, might as well wave one a those big fingers they got at ballgames. Bows, nah. Traps, make 'em when I'm in it. Close combat, now we're talkin'. I pick up a machete, feels alright. Grab one of those Japanese swords, really light, maybe.... Then somethin' catches my eye. Oh yeah, this'll do, this'll do nicely.\n\nEPISODE 4:\n\nEvery muscle I got is tense as a tow-rope. I'm droppin' through the sky and I can't see a damn thing.  In a box barely big enough to turn around. Like a piece a cargo...guess that's what I am now, here for everyone's entertainment. I'm about to give 'em somethin' they'll never forget.\n\nI think about my girl...always loved you, never meant to hurt you. Now the whole world's gonna feel your hurt.\n\nBAM. I land with a thud that rattles my skull. I hear some announcer they got piped in through the whole stadium, "GET READY! 5...4...3...2...1!" Top flies off my cage. I'm free. My heart's racin' like the Indy 500.\n\nI can't see a damn thing, just jungle all around. Need a weapon. I pick up a rock. Another one. Got enough FUNC for a knife...well a shiv. A branch. Now I got a spear, good; we've come a long way from the cavemen, eh? Hah. I need to find a buildin' before someone else does.  I scramble up a hill like a madman and look out. Past the jungle I see some tower in the distance. Bingo.\n\nFound a nice shallow stream that makes the goin' a little easier, should reach that tower in no time. The announcer booms out, "Somebody killed another player with a knife!" One down, fourteen to go.\n\nThere it is! Building is about 400 feet away. I stop and scout a bit. No movement that I can see. Alright, let's check this... Oh, S%!T. A rock just whizzed by my head. I whirl around and some  skinhead's swingin' hammer at me. Duck. I clock him with the haft of my spear in the ribs. I hear a satisfying crack. He jumps back, holdin' his side with one hand. We stand there. just breathin' hard. Go ahead, a$%hole.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeerSlayer37/recommended/437220/","DeerSlayer37","DeerSlayer37","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeerSlayer37/","146 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA lot of people give this game flak about how the recent updates have been, but you've gotta understand one thing: this game isn't scheduled for an "official release" until March 2017. The development team has been listening to the community very well, and have constantly been tweaking gameplay, graphics, customizations, weapons, etc. They attempt different things to see how the community responds, and if it's negative they attempt to fix it. I have confidence that future updates will fix the errors that are currently visible.\n\nI also have a story of my favorite match thus far:\n\nIt was a Teams match and my friend (who I was talking on Skype with) died fairly early. He egged me on to continue the match despite the early deficit. After escaping the team that killed him, I found Body Armor from a Green Crate, a Javelin from a Green Crate, a Stamina Shot, a Med Kit, and super luckily got an SMG from a Blue Crate.  I was able to craft 20 extra rounds for the SMG just before Phase 1's gas fully enclosed the center.\n\nThe remaining players at this point were me, a random guy, and 2 teams. I decided to wait it out and let the other teams fight, but I was approached by a random player who was blocking. I shot him once with the Blowgun thinking that he was a threat, but he didn't chase me. I realized he was the other player whose teammate died and wanted to team up. We did friendly blocks and jumped, then heard the other two teams fighting. I took the Stamina Shot and we began rushing towards the battle.\n\nI ended up shooting 2 players down to low health and he cleaned up the kills, while the other 2 players died in the brawl from each others' teammates.\n\nWe then headed to the center and threw all of our weapons away, both giving each other Med Kits to heal fully. We did one more agreement block and jump, then had a 1 on 1 fist fight for the victory. He ended up gaining the upper hand, and beat me squarely.\n\nThe whole time I was laughing and enjoying the game for what it was, and for the fact that we were able to team up and acknowledge the gentleman's duel, even though we lacked vocal communication.\n\nAfter the match, we both said well played in the spectator chat and went our separate ways.\n\nIf you're reading this, random guy, then thanks for being a great sport.\n\nTLDR; This game has loads of potential, but is not completely refined yet. If you just wanna have fun, I highly recommend this game. If you are super competitive, I still recommend it but all the mechanics are not finished being developed.\n\nHave fun!","May 13","true","53.3"," 117 of 160 people (73%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","73","117","160","12","1"

This game opened up a new era. I have spent many hours in it as per this review, but it is not holding up to its standards anymore. This game used to be wonderful. The updates the developers have been putting out are slowly ruining the combat, and there have been many claims that it gets better with each update. This does not seem to be happening. I constantly die to to being pushed, then hit, then pushed, then hit. I am defenseless. My friend and I have tested this in real life. He held his arms up in front of him, and I punched him at a medium swing speed, and seemed to have no issue. He didn't fall backwards, fly upside down, then flip over the face of the Earth to rehabilitate from his small tap to the front of his arm. This queue time is also ridiculous. THREE MINUTES? Are you serious? Do not get me wrong, this game is great, but I do not think it is worth buying right now, I may change my opinion in the future, but this is how it is, and there is no real way to determine the future.\n\nHello, Developer (if you are reading this)\nPlease fix your game, I really do enjoy playing it, but right now, you seem to not care. There is no fun in taking THREE MINUTES to find a game, I loot for about five, and then get absolute rekt from the mechanics. I believe that this has to be one of the worst updates yet. I understand you want to add new perks, and I understand you want to better the game for us all, but please, take the time to fix the issues that are present before adding things to the game. I would much rather have a neatly made game, which is small, with all these wonderful features, then have all of these features, that are becoming what seems to be too big to manage by the team. The gameplay should be kept advanced, but not to the point that there is no way to get anything before being destroyed by someone who has a hatchet. The other day, I was shot three times with a revolver by someone who had opened what I presume to  have been a blue or red crate. Who does that? Well clearly I am doing that now because I know there is a chance to get a weapon. Oh, I forgot to mention, that was three minutes into the game. There should be a feature in the game, and I know you guys are smart enough to implement it, that the drops in the crates get better as the game goes on. I love how the idea of the game was when it first game out, but now it has seemed to go down hill.\n\nThis is my opinion as of May 3, 2016. I hope to see improvements, thank you for reading my review.","May 3","true","66.4"," 102 of 141 people (72%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","72","102","141","17","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maullom1/recommended/437220/","maullom1","Stupid Snake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maullom1/","249 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe Culling is basically a Battle Royale/Hunger Games type game in which 16 contestants fight to the death. Only one person (unless playing teams) can win. I'd also like to add that this particular "Battle Royale" game more-so resembles the Hunger Games than something like H1Z1.\n\nGameplay\nPlayers spawn in random parts of a map that is contained in a force field. Players then craft items and/or loot nearby buildings for gear. Most weapons are melee based, but there are bows and firearms. Other items include backpacks, body armor, traps, explosives and status boosts/powerups.\nThe goal of the game is kill the other contestants and become the last man standing; deaths are permanent.\nGames last around 20 minutes, at the 10 minute mark players are forced to fight in an arena area called The Culmination.\n\nThe combat is mostly melee based. You can hit, charge hits, block and push. Though the combat is basic, it is engaging and solid. Hits feel heavy, backstabs crunch while doing massive damage; Yes, this combat is damn satisfying. There are also bows, which do a lot of damage if you have the right build for it (see perks, below). Guns are powerful, however I won't say over-powered as they are extremely rare and have limited ammo.\n\nFeatures\nThere is a cosmetic skin system in place. You get rewarded new skins every game; The "quality/value" is roughly determined at how well you do and/or how long you survive. You can buy and sell these skins on the Steam market.\nWeapons have multiple tiers ranging up to 4 (correct me if I'm wrong)\nA perk system in which you can choose 3 perks of any kind to build your contestant to a specific play style. If you want to use spears, use perks that pertain to spears, if you want to use bows, use perks for bows. The perks keep the game fresh for multiple playthroughs and makes every encounter interesting.\nIngame currency called F.U.N.C. that you collect by killing players, staying alive, collecting it from corpses (non-player), activating gas tanks, recycling gear, and collecting it from F.U.N.C. canisters. F.U.N.C. is used to open blue crates that contain mid-grade loot, and call in airdrops. It can also be used to heal yourself at healing stations, which I'll cover more later in this review.\nAirdrops that you call in using the in game currency. These drops usually contain high-tier loot that will give you a steep competitive edge. You can select specific airdrops that contain the same loot everytime, or use the "surprise me" airdrop that contains any of the available drops in the game thus far. The better the loot is in the drop, the more it will cost.\nRandom events that try to get players together and fighting. These usually consist of loot spawning somwhere and players fighting for it. There are multiple different variations, keeping it interesting.Bugs/Problems/Exploits I've noticed\nSometimes players lag through my blocks and hit me anyway.\nSometimes players hit me without the animation playing\nLag can be game breaking (chasing someone only to have them somehow attack you from behind)\nI've noticed some suspected hacker activity\nPlayers can camp the health machines and use it to tank health while attacking them. (Devs are on the case)\nChainsaw is OPFinal Opinion\nThis game is awesome. I've played enough hours to honestly say I recommend it.

Based around the idea of the Battle Royale movie, The Culling is like the arma3 battle royale mod and the battle royale style mode for H1Z1. The movie Battle Royale came out way before The Hunger Games, despite The Hunger games being more popular.\n\nYou have a ton of players all fighting to be the last one standing on this island. You go get resources, craft weapons and try to take out as many enemies as possible. After a certain amount of time the area you must be in on the island gets smaller and smaller.\n\nThe crafting is a great start, the island is well made, the gameplay is off to a good start and the tutorials are a great addition. Will you be the last one around when the fight is over? Only time will tell!!\n\nAs far as negatives, well there ar ea few of these to list. The blocking at the moment needs a ton of work. but in general is a good idea how it works. The melee needs more work to, it feels heavy which is nice ala Chivalry, but needs alot more polish to get to that games level of overall quality. There are also grpahical glitches and latency from the servers can be an issue aswell.\n\nStill, this game is well on its way to being the best of these battle Royale style games, which where made popular in ARMA mods and other games. Even after 2-3 hours I have had more fun than I had in H1Z1's mode which is like this one.\n\nIf you are patient and are looking for a battle royale style, multiplayer game and don't mind seeing it get made, pick this up and join the battle! What's here at the moment is far from perfect and needs alot of work but the good outweighs the bad and if the developers keep at it with updates and content this is a game I could see being played for many years. My first try at this game, was not all that much fun, but after doing the tutorials and played a bunch more, I have come to appreciate what the devs are doing, even though there is a good amount more to go before I can full reccomend it to everyone.","March 26","true","2.0"," 29 of 37 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","29","37","3","0"

It does say i have 30ms ping but i'm pretty sure this is server lag or maybe some optimization issue.\nOther than that, a GREAT game, and for me definately worth the money, also to support the developers for their fantastic work.\n\nI hope there will be a lot more work done as i would like to see this game grow arms and legs.\n\n\nEDIT **\nEver since the EU servers came out the game is unplayably laggy.

Sure, there were a few  bugs, a few kinks here and there, but it was a solid game. Then, they ♥♥♥♥ed up, and kept on ♥♥♥♥ing up trying to appease anybody while ♥♥♥♥ing over everybody.\nThe new update? It fixed the animations. Then made every aspect about the game worse. I'm not even sure how to start, so I'm just going to chalk it up to the following: I won and lost, and thought for the most part those wins and losses were fair and balanced. Now, any aspect of skill is completely lost, it is completely determined by how well you abuse the system or, if there is a fight with two people who don't abuse the system, luck, because there is no room for skill when the random items you find determine the winner in every an any aspect.\nThis game was exactly what I wanted when it came out. Now it is so rage inducing, so unbalanced, and so abusable, that the only pleasure I get is when all the cards align, I get a fireaxe or katana or whatever, a good set of misc items, kill six people, and then center off with the final guy, and have all my hopes and dreams crushed when find the guy who was squatting in a bush all game found a dynamite and crafted two tnt.\n\nOther than the concept, there is nothing redeeming about this game anymore. You'll enjoy it for about three hours, and then the Hunger-games haze will wear off, and you will then find everything about it ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Don't buy it.\n\nTHIS IS MY OLD REVIEW.\nI have been playing this game for months now, and until recently, I loved every minute of it. I have won nearly a hundred matches, and lost nearly four times that, and once more recently, I thought it was fair.\nHowever, with the most recent update, as a lot of early access games do, they dun ♥♥♥♥ed up, and the game's balance and mechanics have turned to "a little rough around the edges" to "cringworthy"\n\nThe most grevious offenders are:\n-Animations no longer sync. Your block could be up on screen, but the game will wait a second before it is up to block an attack. You enemy will sometimes damage you without swinging their weapon.\n-Weapon animations have deceptive depth. Since the new swings came out, you can't rely on your weapon animation swing to tell you what is close enough. Your spear tip could be skewering through your enemy, but they are to far away for hit detection.\n-Pushing costs 10 stamina. This would be fine if block had any penalties, but all it does is halt stamina regen. And since blocking animations aren't synced, it's very easily abused.\n\n\nMy other gripes are small in comparison, but now that the values have been changed, and the animations were not changed to match, it has become incredibly difficult to play this game.\nEND OF OLD REVIEW","May 22","false","180.0"," 46 of 71 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","46","71","0","0"

Unfortunately, I do not.  I apparently possess the uncanny ability to choose the most worthless perks that do absolutely nothing to help me during any particular game.  It doesn't matter what weapons I may find, as I am evitably beaten to death by somebody holding a rock or stapler or egg.  I think I've played this game for around three hours, and in that time frame, I only managed to kill one person (myself, when I suicided from breathing poison gas).  I'm convinced there are award-winning strategies and tips and tricks that everybody in the world knows except me.  I will probably continue playing this game, but I do not foresee myself improving in any conceivable way, and I hope some day the developer addresses this issue and releases a patch that makes me not be so amazingly incompetent.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azralynn/recommended/437220/","Azralynn","Azralynn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azralynn/","472 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe Culling is a battle royale game that bears a strong resemblance to The Hunger Games. It is currently in early access on Steam.\n\nCheck out my Quick Preview here: https://youtu.be/7giROcjphZk\nYou can play solo or in a two player team. Before going into a match, you can customize your loadout with perks, an airdrop, and outfit. Perks give you permanent buffs or different starting items. The airdrop is an items package you can call in as a supply drop once you earn enough F.U.N.C. in game. F.U.N.C. is the in game currency.\n\nOnce the game starts, you spawn randomly in a box somewhere on the map. Players scavenge items, and craft weapons to fight and kill each other. You win by being the last man or team standing. You can kill others with various traps, explosives, projectiles, and weapons. As you kill players, you will earn F.U.N.C., and if you get enough, you can call in a supply drop. You also earn F.U.N.C. over time, and by scavenging different F.U.N.C. items around the map, and selling items at the blue booths.\n\nIf you get low on health, you can craft bandages, and find med-kits, or use a red booth to trade F.U.N.C. for hit point recovery. There is also body armor, and stims with different buffs that last for a duration. There are also man trackers to detect people closest to you, and these are really helpful. Your inventory is limited to 3 items, but you can increase capacity up to 5.\n\nThe combat is the most enjoyable part. You have to be paying attention to how your opponent is playing. The way combat works in the game is a rock/paper/scissors format, which makes combat a whole mind in game in itself of trying to out think and outplay your opponent. Attacks are countered by blocks, blocks are countered by shoves, and shoves are countered by attacks. You can also backstab, headshot, and charge up attacks and throws to do more damage.\n\nAs long as you survived long enough or did enough player damage, you earn outfit items for your character to wear. They are purely cosmetic and have no stats.\n\nPros:controls are fully customizable\nthe queues pop quickly, and the games last up to 25 minutes or until you die, but once you die, there is no wait time before re-queuing again\nteaming up with friends is enjoyable, especially if you coordinate on Skype or some other voice chat\nperks and airdrops are a great way to try and change up your play style and coordinate better in a team\ncombat is awesome - having the rock/paper/scissors system feels really balanced, and makes you have to predict, and pay attention to outplay your opponents\nvisuals in the game are decent, and the environment looks good\nthe music is enjoyable, and the sound effects while playing are done well (hearing footsteps and doors opening is really helpful for identifying others around you)\ngame performs extremely well, I never had any issues or crashes\nCons:new players are put in the same games as other more experienced and skilled players\nit takes a little while to get over the learning curve, and new players will likely struggle at first, until they learn the recipes, map, and especially combat techniques\nthe tutorials don't give enough combat experience to prepare you for how much better a lot of real players are\nteam mode lacks voice chat (I hope this will be implemented in the future)\nthe announcer dialog can sometimes be funny, but the jokes do get old after you hear them a few times\nin some games you spend a lot of time scavenging and searching for resources, but this process can be a bit tedious and repetitive, especially if you don’t encounter any conflict\nonly 1 map available right now (I hope more will be added in future updates)\nOnce I started playing against real people, I got completely and utterly destroyed for the first few hours of playing… Needless to say, I didn’t enjoy it much at first. The game is not very friendly to new players, since you get put into the same games as people who have been playing a lot longer. However, I stuck with it, and kept playing. I watched a couple videos about weapons, and fighting strategy. Those really helped me a lot, and I finally started not sucking!\n\nSo far, I have played over 11 hours, I am getting better, and I’m getting kills much more often, and calling in airdrops for myself. I’ve still never won yet, but even when I die, the fights are a lot closer. It feels pretty intense fighting 1v1 and trying outplay your opponent and predict what he’s going to do. Just don’t give up though, if you put in the time, you will get better, and it gets much more fun.\n\nBecause it’s early access, some bugs are expected, but I didn’t encounter many. I do expect some things to change and improve before release with balancing, and tweaking of perks and weapons. So far, the game is showing a lot of potential. Despite the rough start I had with the learning curve, I’m glad I stuck with it because it turned out to be pretty fun game after all.","April 6","true","11.9"," 34 of 51 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","34","51","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/437220/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nMany years before Jennifer Lawrence starred in the Hunger Games movie there was a movie starring former WWE champion Stone Cold Steve Austin titled The Condemned. It was filmed near where I currently reside, on the Australian Gold Coast. The premise of the movie pitted convicted murderers against one another in a deadly reality television show on an island with the lone survivor being granted their freedom. The movie wasn’t actually half bad for a WWE movie and the Texan Rattlesnake made quite a positive impression on the locals in his stay Down Under.\n\nThe reason why I mention The Condemned is because that is exactly what Xaviant Games’s Steam debut, The Culling, reminds me of. As a contestent in this game it is up to you to survive. To do so you must use your wits as well as your braun by exploring, scavenging, crafting weapons and traps and hope like hell that you’re able to stay one step ahead of your contestants. Fight to the bitter end and survive if you can. The game attempts to change the meaning of a genre that has become accustomed to games featuring children’s characters and has lacked a true survival instinct.\n\nEach battle royale features 16-players with the ability to play the game in a solo or a team of two format. Every match is fast paced and frantic and with an average match time of about twenty minutes you know that you will always be kept on your toes. I love the idea behind the introduction of poisonous gas during the game’s conclusion as it has the impact of decreasing the game world and making everything feel claustrophobic – just the way you’d like it. It certainly stops one player or team hiding out in one sector of the playing field away from their opponents and attempts to force a face to face head on confrontation.\n\nOpportunity for variety is added to the game in the form of perks. You get to choose three different perks before you begin play. There are a significant number of perks available to you. Perks range from beginning the match with a tracking device, to perks that positively benefit your crafting skills and finally ones that give your combat skills a boost. A generous decision to newbies has come in the fact that all perks are available to all players without being forced to unlock them. However, given that there are such a significant range of boosts available many new players will be at a disadvantage because they are spoilt for choice without necessarily knowing which of the perks will best serve their basic strategy. This is overcome only through sheer playtime or performing the necessary research before playing.\n\nThe variety of weapons and tools within the game is one of the game’s strongest aspects. Melee combat is clearly the focus of the game with 24 different weapons making up a superb arsenal to choose from. The fact that each weapon can be thrown as well as the variety of ranged weapons makes ranged combat a dangerous aspect of the game but it isn’t nearly as electric as the melee combat. Traps can play a significant role in changing the course of a game giving players who may be light on the melee and ranged skills but who can out think their opponent an opportunity to shine and to become victorious. The range of traps includes remote-detonated advices, caltrops, snares, mines and more. The player also have items that can aide their pursuit with bandages used to heal, smoke grenades/bombs, etc.\n\nOne of the best game design decisions that the developers have made, in my opinion, is that players begin each match without anything forcing players to explore their surroundings in order to craft weapons and items to make up their arsenal. A hinderance to this is the fact that inventory space is limited which can make collecting the right recipe ingredients more than a little problematic. However, this all adds to the forced strategic thinking that is a neccessity if you are to survive.\n\nAn aspect of the game that I have found to be controversial comes in the form of airdrops. Players get to choose the care package that they receive before play begins but calling them in can often be to your detriment as your opponents will be alerted to yours being dropped and they can be stolen. Airdrops can also be shot out of the air before they ever reach the ground. Unlike perks which are unlocked from the start of play you must unlock different airdrops. This is achieved either through the finding of a random airdrop or through the theft of an opponent’s.\n\nThere is significant reason why this has been one of Steam’s most popular games since its release. However, poor patches and updates have started to disappoint and anger the player base. The devs do listen to their community, which obviously is a fantastic thing, but I fear that at its very heart the developers never expected the game to reach the peak in popularity that it did and as a consequence they have paniced. They’re not the most talented coders in the world and some of their work has damaged their game. The game is, however, an early access title and we can hope that the game continues to be a huge success and improves throughout the remainder of its developmental cycle.","May 2","true","3.7"," 46 of 75 people (61%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","61","46","75","5","5"

These nerfs are really killing the game, again the should concentrate on CONTENT, not COMBAT nerfs. The combat was completely fine before all these patchs, but it seems the devs are only responding to the children who cry in the back of the discussion boards. This game is really going downhill...\n\nREVIEW 2\nOK, ive played the new update, and im not changing my opinion. The new updates still concentrate on "combat" because many people still complained that it's really stupid and annoying. Simple BLOCK, PUSH, PUNCH/ATTACK, & THROW. It was mostly the hit-detection or the rubberbanding in the game making it unplayable and annoying.\n\nCurrent The update just made combat worse, and its just simply not worth playing any more.\n\nThe Past ALOT, and I mean ALOT of people agree. The game was fun at launch, hell even I enjoyed the game at launch! I really expected some good in it, It was better than 'H1Z1's battle royale gamemode. But after a few updates, the game started going downhill, the devs just seem to completely concentrate on COMBAT of the game, which is making it worse and worse. Adding more pointless perks, making weapons underpowered due to massive complaints, and terrible optimization.\n\nThe Updates The updates made the game worse for anyone who dosnt brag about having a GTX970, Shadows eat the hell out of FPS, and now there is no way of even turning them off. They should really concentrate on CONTENT, and OPTIMIZATION, not combat. It was fine, just many people die from guns too much. (Not really me, I had techniques to get a gun from airdrops which worked, but obviously people dont want me to do that.)\n\nSo far, DO NOT buy this, its simply not worth it!\nThe game was fine before, and updates are now making the game worse. They are not improving the game in anyway possible. Please wait maybe a few months after they make REAL updates, other than just terrible combat "improvements" its simply not worth it.\n\n1st Review\nAn update ruined the game, fan-base is cancer-like, and it was just going downhill. And I TOLD U SO! (Just a summary!)\n\nNOTE:\nI have this game on two accounts, so I actually have more hours than this account. I use my main to post stuff so bleh belh behelmv.\nAnother Note: The amount of dislikes is caused by the fanbase of the game. The community is becoming terrible now, almost like FNAF or Undertale.","April 27","false","19.7"," 92 of 160 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","92","160","4","0"

So why do I not like it? A simple reason: The RPS system of combat.\n\nAll melee combat boils down to a simple equation: block > melee > push > block.\n\nNo matter what weapon you're using, whether it's a hammer, a spear, or a sword, a block will stop all damage and leave you vulnerable for a couple of seconds. The response to this is to push your blocking enemy, which just shoves them back, however a push leaves you open so if they're not blocking you will eat the attack. Overlooking the fact that this makes no sense whatsoever, it leaves every combat feeling like a glorified Rock, Paper, Scissors simulator. Positioning, movement, all of that doesn't matter when it boils down every fight into a game of minimal strategy.\n\nOnce you get to later equipment (guns, explosives, chainsaws, etc...) this system isn't nearly as much of a problem, however every game forces this gameplay onto you as you scavenge for equipment from a random starting point. While this random system is the point of the game, it is horribly impacted by the melee combat system.\n\nI'd say save your money and wait to see if this ever gets changed.","April 30","false","1.9"," 35 of 56 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","35","56","2","2"

The small problems along the way have been due to people getting salty about patches and then the devs over changing things, but the Devs have been listening from day 1 and have been doing amazing work to bring this game to its full potential.\nIf anyone loves battle royal type game modes, this is the game for you!\nThe combat, although having some glitches in the current patch, feels the most skilled - and thought out - out of any game I've played.\nThe fact that there's so many ways to play each time you join a game - via different Airdrops, perk setups and just general in game luck (finding the right items at the right/wrong time) - makes it so much fun and enjoyable each and every time you play!\nThere's a bit of a learning curve to start, but if you watch some videos and maybe spend some time learning the map and fiddling with different setups and combat techniques, the game doesn't take long to learn well (10-30hrs to get the hang of it, 50-100+ to start to feel superior to a lot of players).\nThere are servers in Oceania, US EAST and Europe currently so some people don't have the best ping (mainly US WEST complaints) however the servers for me sit me on about 60 ping which is pretty similar to big games like CS:GO for my region (oceania).\nThis is the first bigger review I've ever written, but I've still not touched on many of the pros or some of the cons.. However, if you have the money, I highly reccomend this game to everyone!","May 9","true","253.9"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","17","23","0","0"

That's when I knew this game was good.\n\nThat's how good this game is. You can kill anyone with anything. Both Firearms and melee weapons are equally as good. Nothing is considered "OP". Unlike H1Z1 where, while yes, you can use both melee and guns, you'll be considered a complete idiot for using melee because they are that bad. Since it is early access, ofc there will be bugs, not game breaking bugs, but noticable ones where you can't pick up items you throw down sometimes.\nYes, there is crafting in The Culling, and no, it doesn't slow anything down. Crafting is really quick and gets rid of ALL the downtime. If you aren't crafting or looking for loot, you're hurting youself in the late game. Games are only about 20-25minutes long, so it's a good way to pass the time. You constantly get new outfits as well, win or lose.\nThe combat in this game is amazing. Q to push people that are blocking and you can then follow that up with a punish attack. Block someone's attack and you can also follow that up with an attack. Fights can turn INSTANTLY and it's all about timing and reflex.\nGot this game day 1 of release and I've only had good things to say about it ever since. Overall, I'm enjoying this game, having a lot of fun with my friend playing Duo, winning a lot as well.

If you can't stand the long time before finding someone then The Culling is the right choice. I will not say it's a perfect game but considering it's in early access I can only see good things coming. The perks increase the replayability value by an infinite amount. It's not just a shooting game. There's strategies and tactics involved. Specially if you play on a team. In my opinion, currently one of the best competitive survival games on the store.\n\nI made a laid back review video, you're welcome to watch it:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2eDOsQGktk&index=1&list=PLBqXrq67D6ooHk9drYSFDxURYRMCCUc-v","March 4","true","68.6"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","2"

But when i do, its ONLY on The Culling and this game is beyond intense! Use headphones when you play, turn up the volume and the game gives you the feeling of being hunted for real! The ambient sounds of the surrounding environment gives you anxiety. The feeling is that real. I feel I have to look around myself multiple times when I play to make sure i'm not being followed to be killed. Finally, the moment you see someone your heart pounds. The only thoughts that come to your mind is, Kill or be killed.\n\n10/10. This is worth more than $15!\n\nTO THE DEVELOPERS: Just a thought; We are in a jungle right? Add in some animals that can also kill you and add more stress to survival!!! Add in random weather, rain, fog, etc! Maybe voice chat that fades the farther you are from people, but your teammates always hear you.

Maybe because none of them appealed to me as this one has.\n\n- What is it?\nThe Culling is a game where 16 players fight to the death until one of them survives. It feels fresh in some aspects, for instance I really like the crafting system and the way they implemented the game's currency (F.U.N.C.'s) with the crafting itself and it also works when requesting an AirDrop and opening some of the chests.\nIt has a decent variety of weapons (melee and ranged), gadgets and some traps aswell.\nYou can unlock clothes and hair styles to customize your character to your liking.\n\n- Modes:\nYou can play by yourself in a Free for All matchup against 15 other players.\nOr you can team up with a friend (or a random online), and queue to the Duo mode where everyone plays as small groups of 2 people. Doesn't change much from the FFA, but if you have someone with the game, you'll probably find it more amusing than playing alone.\n\n- The bad:\nOn the other hand, the game feels really bad optimized right now, which sucks because the graphics aren't that great (but aren't awful either). On the store page it shows us really low system requirements and I play virtually all games with no issue whatsoever.\nI had to change my shadow settings to "none" which is done through the config file, on the game itself it only goes down to "Low", and I managed to get around 45~50fps average, which isn't acceptable but I trust the devs will fix this.\nAnother issue is the servers, there's only US servers. European players (such as myself) will suffer with this and be at a disadvantage. Please add EU servers asap.\n\n- Conclusion:\nI like it, but it can be MUCH better if it gets the proper love from the developers.\nI am really looking forward to the day the devs fix the bad optimization issues and some existing bugs and missing textures.\nApart from that, I'd really enjoy a new map (so it doesn't get monotonous with only 1 map available) and some new items/guns/gadgets.\n\nI am recommending The Culling right now because it's a fun game despite its problems, but if patched it has a huge potential!","March 5","true","57.8"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Every patch has made this game worse.  Let's break it down.\n\n-There is only 1 map and it is STILL glitchy as heck, lots of places to get stuck, items disappearing, it's a mess.\n-The weapons are marginally more balanced but guns are massively OP still, and thrown/shot weapons do too much and are unblockable.\n-Melee has become WORSE than first release, there was skill in block/push/attack but now there's 0 skill, just spam.  And charging is never really better than spamming attack...\n-The spawn locations and randomization are part of the game but HOLY HELL there are some really bad start spawns on this map, it makes you want to quit outright.\n-This game is NOT OPTOMIZED at all.  0% optimization.  Anyone who says otherwise is full of it.  I'm on a full gaming rig, modern cpu/64gb/980gtx/fiber internet etc.etc. and it runs like ♥♥♥♥.  Stuttering, jagged, clunky as hell, NO EXCUSES.  I play LOTS of other modern games that have 0 of these issues.\n-Hackers.  They are here, they make your experience unfun.  NOTHING is being done.\n-The unlock for your airdrop needs to be fixed like yesterday, this random unlock BS is NOT good meta, and should never have made it into beta.

Previous patch the game was still really good, easily top 5 candidate for 2016. Competitive but with RNG, skill was needed, everything was planned. There were some bugs with few weps + block not registering + some balance stuff when it comes to airdrops/perks but I believed it would be solved + new map would be added soon. Game was and still is running perfectly on my mid tier PC. The game was really worth it. What happened?\n27/04 patch: tons of new combat bugs. Combat became clunky, bugged, block going up too fast, charged attacks made useless and game not really responsive making combat RNG not a skill based fight. Tons of non comb,at related but game destroying bugs. I wouldn't even mind that, it's early access.... but on top of that you get random disconnect for no reason every 2nd time you are about to win. I'm really decent and competitive player and when on previous patches my win ratio was about 60-70%, now it's 20%. Game is unplayable and frustrating atm. Hope that during next patch I can change the review but if it doesn't get hotfixed today or tomorrow then it's just a joke because the patch looks like completely untested and it's simply unprofesional to make an update like that. I'm no qq kid, I can adapt to changes but honestly. This is the worst patch I've seen in my gaming history and I'm playing PC games competitively for over 12 years.\nAh, also devs force you to have shadows and certain graphics settings set to default otherwise you'll have 20 fps at max.\nVerdict: wait till next patch. This game can be a real gem (had fun combat, numerous items/builds/airdrops/ways of playing) but that joke of a patch makes me anxious about that.\nEdit: Hotfix didn't fix any of the gamebreaking bugs. There is still a bug where left click spammer can just hit you back for free after he got stunned which is against every rule the devs have created before.\nEdit2: there was another hotfix which slightly fixed the combat which is now in the playable state.\nWhile it's still not perfect devs made me optimistic. I may say that as a competitive gamer another serious issue would be a lack of maps. This game ain't Dota and once you learn how to play you just keep wreckin since you already know the map by heart after 15 hours of gameplay. I'd say a lot of decent players already stopped playing regularly since there's lack of replay value ,despite existence of RNG, because of really stale meta in current patch.

That movie had some "Stone Cold" killers.\n\nThe Culling is in alot of ways what i was hoping H1Z1's battle royal now called  "King of the Kill" could be like. There is no lobby so you drop directly into your match with 15 other players. So no teaming up with your friends and running the table in solo matches. Besides there is a 2 man team for that. There is no map or inventory screen to take you out of the action. and the play arena is much more tightly focused on the center. There is a countdown timer, with gas that corrals you towords the center and towards your opponents. but being that the map is smaller and that the gas's spread is fixed (unlike in H1z1 where you are constantly trying to guess where the next ring of gas will shrink to) you can set up traps and ambushes, Witch is important.\nthe craffting system is simple with the items almost evolving into newer better ones depending on what you mix and match. crafting costs something called f.u.n.c, almost like currency, which you gain by killing opponets, opening barrels-of-f.u.n.c, looting random funky body parts scattered through out the arena, or recycling items and wepons found through out the map.\nWepons are rated by tiers with the high grade tiers being found in lootable crates that cost func to open.\n\nThe host is a dead ringger for claptrap from Borderlands which i have to assume is intentional. while focussing on surviving i am always chuckling whenever he informs the contestants that somene killed another player with a blowgun, and congratulates him for being really great at blowing. or when someone was punched to death, and he repeats that someone has been fisted...to death. his other purpose is to inforn players when an event is about to occur. random supply drops will fly around the map and land in the arena these occur at random and are a great way to get hard to find weaponns.\n\nThe fighting system is interesting and different with an almost rock-paper-scissors feel ro it if your opponent is attacing then block to stun them and leave them open for a free hit if your opponent is blocking then you can shove to push them back again leaving them vulnerable. range weapons are powerful but easy to identify and avoid and ammo is scarce so your shots must count. be careful to not let an enemy get close while you have your ranged weapon equippted because if you are attacked you can drop your weapon leaving iyiu wide open untill you change to your mele weapon.\n\nCosmetic clothing skins are won for completing matches with rarer skins awarded for doing better. at this time there are no crates to open or keys to buy and the reward items have no stat boosts or anything like that.\n\noverall it is alot of fun matches that around 15 mins to complets, and i have had great results with queues with the longest being around 3-4 mins its still new and im hoping for a 3-4 man team option or maybe new maps in the future but for the price it is a blast.\n\n\npros\n*quick queues\n*intense battles that require yiu to think insted of just spamming keys\n*halarious commentating\n*random events\n* no pay to win\n\nCons\n*sometimes feel like crafting costs are to high\n* no voice chat","March 10","true","80.1"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","15","22","4","1"

Another rushed early access game on steam = Skip. I must stop you right there. Although The Culling may look like a generic battle royale type game, once you delve deeper into the game, you realize that it is much more than that. ‘The Culling’ by Xaviant games is a stand alone entry into the battle royale genre. This is a great game for learning about friendship and betrayal. Nothing screams life lesson like the guy that you just helped turning around and stabbing you right in your heart. A great educational game for adults who want to find out what the corporate world is like.\n\nThe very first comparison you will make is with H1Z1: King of the Kill. Let me tell you right now that this is a futile comparison. It is like comparing the German national football team with the Brazilian national football team, no matter what one group says, we all know which team is better. It must be pointed out that, whilst H1Z1 was unceremoniously split into two separate games, the developers behind The Culling have been very transparent with their road map for the future and have already released a number of patches in a short amount of time. Xaviant Games have clearly stated that they want The Culling to develop into a genre leader and grow into a popular E-sport. I believe this goal can be achieved if The Culling continues to receive the support it has received thus far.\n\nMoreover, I believe it is time to move onto the meat of the game and how it performs so far. The goal of the game is simple, kinda like that Jennifer Lawrence film, ‘American Hustle’. You have to devise a cunning ploy in order to overcome your adversaries. Or you could just kill them. The game revolves around 16 ‘contestants’ being dropped into an island and forced to fend use their environment to survive and kill all other contestants until only 1 person is alive. Just like my family’s Christmas dinner, it soon becomes a tense game of cat and mouse as you are forced to make decisions that are crucial to your survival. Should I spend my in game points to open this crate? Or should I save them up so I can open an even better crate later on. These decisions are often pivotal, especially if you decide to open a crate and then run into an unsuspecting enemy. The game also features a fully fledged, if odd, crafting system. You can pick up rocks and sticks to craft several in game items. For example, combining two rocks and a stick will craft you a knife. The recipes are easy to learn and quite basic. The real trouble is finding all the requirements without meeting an untimely end. If you don’t like crafting, you can also use your F.U.N.C points that you earn in game to open various crates. These crates often have better gear or if you’re really lucky, a gun. Speaking of weapons, the game has a nice little variety of weapons. I do enjoy when games provide you with several ways to decapitate, bludgeon or shoot your enemies. There are all the basic weapons to start your own prison gang.\n\nNot much point in all these weapons if killing an enemy is unsatisfying right? Thankfully, killing an enemy is satisfying in The Culling. Sure they could do with a bit more gore and weight just like Chivalry, but the current combat system is probably the best in the genre. You are able to block, shove and attack enemies to ensure you come out on top. It does take a fair bit of time to get used to it, but I think the tutorial does a fantastic job of getting you used to the mechanics of the game. Whilst I praise the combat for being the best in the genre, I do still think it can be improved. As mentioned above, some of the attacks feel a bit ‘floaty’ at times, but this is a common issue with all battle royale games that I have previously played. The game could do from learning a few tricks from Chivalry. Got bored of hacking and shooting enemies? You can also set traps to dismember wandering enemies or set off poison clouds to teach them a lesson. This latter causes everyone to be on the move, eventually converging upon the middle of the map like a discount SWAT team getting ready for a final stand.\n\nHowever, I must also point out a few issues with this game. Currently, in its Early Access state, the game only contains North American and European servers. This may cause a few issues for all of the Aussie blokes looking to satisfy their blood lust. I am certain this will be rectified in the future by the developers, but it remains an issue currently. In my 5 hours or so of the game, I have also run into a few hackers, whilst this remains an issue for a whole host of PC games, it is still a rather annoying issue currently. The game also has a few flaws that need to be addressed in the current meta. For now it is a bit too easy to just set up traps and wait, this discourages a proactive style of play and encourages camping. This works for the majority of the game and can be a rather cheap way of winning games.\n\nOverall, the game is actually quite deep for an early access game. Not only does it include the flagship 16 player battle, it also has team battles in which 8 teams of 2 players gang up to slaughter each other. What could be more fun than killing people alone? Killing people with your best mate. The game also has a robust perk system, allowing you to pick a total of 3 passive perk points from a big list of 50. This, coupled with a a lot of options for character customization, really allow you to create different loadouts for different styles of play. It can be very easy to give this game a 7.8/10 and say it has too much water, but the truth of the matter is that this game definitely has potential. It will be interesting to see how the developer is able to communicate and handle issues in the future as they inch closer to the projected launch date in 2017. Right now, it is definitely a really fun and tense game.\n","March 12","true","5.7"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","68","15","22","5","0"

Get this. The game is made great if that's what you want.

If you have nothing else to spend it on and you want to have a fun time with a friend then this is definetely a good option. Ton of fun to be had getting murdered with your buds. Just don't take the game too seriously because it's a mess right now.\n\nThat being said.\n\nGoing to TRY to keep it short because this is not a legit review. Never thought I would write one of these "Uninstalled until they fix this" reviews. I loved this game for what it was but I cannot even play it in it's current state anymore.\n\nThe devs seem to be systematically removing all the fun from this game. The mechanics were perfect and they get ruined every patch. Skill determined if you won a fight. Now it depends on the random loot you aquire and a muddled messy spamfest melee system. Perks worked together too in a way that encouraged experimentation. No "class" you chose seemed to feel like a bad choice. Now you'd be lucky to feel good about anything that you choose. Blocking was sneaky, and had to be timed well or you would be punished. Now it just doesn't work. It just... wont work! If that wasn't bad enough, somehow each patch they break mechanics by accident. They seemingly don't do any sufficient testing before releasing a patch. For example throwing items in the game would cause the object to float infront of your face, then teleport to where ever it would of landed 2 seconds later --.-- This ones been fixed but it's not the only example.\n\nI should mention that anyone and EVERYONE who complained that the fighting in this game was cheap or that it was broken BEFORE the past couple patches (4/13?) simply did not understand HOW TO PLAY THE GAME well enough to know what they were doing wrong. The melee was perfect. Where once I could hold my own against 3 guys with only a crafted knife, now I'm lucky to make it out of a 1v1 against a guy with brass knuckles. I didn't suddenly get bad at the game, the game turned into $#!+.\n\nI still love this game and I am confident that the devs have the power to balance their game. Untill then I cannot give it a thumbs up. Devs clearly have no idea what they are doing but there is still hope.\n\nLook at it this way.\n\nIf you made a beautiful cake, and I loved it and was eating it everyday cause I love good cake. Then you decided your cake would look great if you took a huge dump on it. I still think it's a pretty cake but now it's got $#!+ all over it. I aint eating that cake no more and I am certainly not going to recommend it to anyone.\n\nYou $#@+ on the cake Xaviant.\n\n[Update 5/20] Game is complete garbage now.

Tutorial doesn't give a good impression, looking boring as many other tutorials, and the lag is slightly bothering because pvp is well defined and most of the times requires fast solving solutions, even if the movement of the characters is limited to the usual fps range, i'd add the capability to strafe and to lie on the ground, but maybe it exist in the customization of the skills, that i find actually interesting because it adds strategy to your gameplay, i didn't check in depth yet. The "outfit" section looks entertaining for stylist minded people, a varied choice of clothes, (won at a decent score at death or victory), enhancing the humore and taste of the player. The game gives a tough feeling, captivating, even if the first day i kept loosing at any fight but slowly i discovered few ways to have fun. I really don't appreciate the fact that the anticheat contains a sort of bothering adware that alarms my system, but i'd reccomend to have a go at this game because you might find a cool pvp arena for a decent price/quality product that is still in alpha, (that means being used to glitches and feedbacks).","March 13","true","68.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Now that I finally open up the game, almost 2.5k reviews? This game sure is growing fast and for good reasons. If you ever wanted a stand alone hunger game experience, this is the one.\n\nGraphics are decent and the crafting system is reasonable. There are large variety of melee weapons and some ranged weapons. The melee weapons range from your knives and swords, to bludge, or even chainsaw. Range weapons include blow guns, bows, and modern weaponry. Everyone starts with nothing, unless you created a loadout that included some utitliy.\n\nYou start the game picking up stones and sticks to craft basic weapons or traps, and you adventure to collect power ups or random utilities that can be deconstructed to give you money. With enough money you can call in air drops, but you do need to guard your air drop location until it arrives.\n\nThere are random events during the game that will attract players to certain locations.\n\nPros:\n-One of the few, or only, Hunger Game clone.\n-Decent for 15.\n-Graphics are nice, not photo realistic but enough.\n-Supports different play styles, kinda.\n\nCons:\n-Minor motion sickness.\n-Controls are odd at times.\n\nOverall:\nGet this if you can spare 15 dollars, it is most certainly worth it. Not sure what to do with this when player base dies, since it is after all, a Hunger Games clone, and you can't play the Hunger Games without a player base. But as for the moment, it is certainly a must. And let the odds be ever in your favor.","March 9","true","21.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Graphics are good, controls are easy to understant, and they give you a crafting guide so you don't have to waste time trying to figure out how to make things. This is basically The Hunger Games in video game form and that isn't a bad thing at all.\n\nThe only thing that I do not like about the game is that the prize for first place is the same as the prize for anyone else who does enough damage to get one. If they could set up a reward system that gives the people who place first, second, and third something other than a clothing item, or at least multiple clothing items, I think more people would enjoy playing since they would get more of a reward.\n\nAll-in-all I love playing the game in both free-for-all and in teams.

Found an item drop, opened it. Recieved an explosive, directly after this dude came chasing after me with a pick axe. I had one thing on my mind, it was going to be kill or be killed so I planted the explosive directly in front of me knowing that I could possibly commit suicide but it would all be worth it in the end. As he stepped on the explosive 2 feet away from me I detonated it, and his body flew towards me and I was still alive.\n\n10/10","March 28","true","24.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","70","7","10","5","0"

However, there are some drawbacks, but there isn't anything majorly game breaking, and for £10.99, this is very worth it.\n\nfirst of all, the overall feel of the game is amazing, the game is super immersive, and tense as f*ck during moments of combat, and when scavenging around for those vital supplies. You can play the game in many different styles; for example, you may chose to craft yourself basic weapons using rocks and branches which you may find lying about, or by hitting rocks or trees, or you may save up your F.U.N.C (in game currency used for crafting, healing, opening crates, calling in drops) to either open crates, or call in one of your drops (however this usually results in you hiding, and being sneaky until you gather enough F.U.N.C, and may result in you being dead before you can open your crate, or call in a drop.)\n\nThe perk system contains a wide variety of perks, ranging from offensive, defensive, and utility perks, all of which can be paired up with eachother, allowing players to make very powerful combinations, and with the right drop, you can be very deadly to other players. However, the perk system is a little bit over powered at the moment (in my opinion.) For example, there are perks allowing you to achieve +15% damage on all weapons, or spawn with a man tracker (allows you to track any enemies within a 99 meter radius, aslong as you are standing still.) And I would like to see the perks being nerfed a little bit, as sometimes its very hard to win against a guy with a full set of defensive, or offensive perks.\n\nFurthermore, the combat system is quite weak at the moment, it feels very cheap in a sense, and very cluttered. If you are playing against players that are lagging, you'll find it very hard to block or counter attack their hits, and sometimes you may find yourslef or your opponent just mashing the attack button, until you can't block or counter them, which is quite unbalanced. If the combat is redone, this game would pretty much be perfect.\n\nOverall though, I definitely recommend this game, especially as its only £10.99, and the only microtransactions are for cosmetic items (which are very easy to get, as you get 1 skin per game, aslong as you don't die straight away.) I just really hope the devs don't ditch/sell out (cough cough, h1z1.)\n\n\n\nPositives:\nVery well designed arena\nPretty good graphics\nGood-ish performance on mid-ranged PC's\nVery intense and fun!\nDefinitely worth the price\nEasy to get cosmetic items\n\nNegatives:\nCombat feels cheap/random at times\nSome weapons need further balance\n","March 26","true","46.7"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","8","12","2","2"

A last man standing multiplayer deathmatch game with survival elements (basic crafting, looting, basic resource gathering). It's a Battle Royale-esque game (though more like The Condemned IMO), that takes place inside a dome with 16 contestants and up to 25 minute rounds.\n\nThe game itself has a good concept but overall it feels quite cheap.\n\nThe melee combat system uses a rock, paper, scissors mechanism consisting of attack, block & shove. The balancing with the system is fine IMO, no complaints here. (Shoving briefly staggers the opponent or 'defeats' their block for those wondering.)\n\nThe system is quite clunky in its current state though. Seeing as melee combat is essentially the main aspect of the game, it is quite disappointing. The feedback when you land a blow or get struck isn't great either. Rust has better melee feedback (& that isn't saying much).\n\nAdd bad netcode and high latency servers on top of that and it just feels very sloppy. (AWS cloud servers btw.. Horrible for real-time/twitch games. I hope they eventually move to proper dedicated servers!)\n\nI understand it's in Early Access, but compared to the other Early Access games I've played, this is lacking. I really wanted to like this game but the basic elements that make up the core gameplay have been ...I wouldn't say poorly but rather, crudely executed.\n\nHonestly, I would probably come back to this game sometime in the future once more time has been spent developing the core mechanics. I see a promising future ahead for this game as long as they iron out the kinks and continue working on and improving the current foundations of the game, but I don't see that happening for at least another 6+ months so that's why I cannot recommend the game at this point in time.","March 21","false","2.0"," 112 of 214 people (52%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","52","112","214","5","19"

I bought it the day it came out and played the hell out of ever since (~330 hours). The game was fast-paced, had a learning curve and even at top-end gameplay had a considerable amount of skill involved. This all changed 3-4 weeks ago with changes to their core combat system. We've waited through a few patches (and hotfixes) hoping the combat would be restored. No such luck. Instead, the devs focused on shiny cosmetics and random experimentation with weapon stats that served to simply imbalance the game. If you want a detailed example of the sloppy combat, see below. Before, when two people fought it consisted of a well-coordinated dance of blocks/jabs/charge attacks/pushes/jukes/out smarting. As of right now, this game is literally a random slug-fest. Two people face each other and it's a random spam fest of jabbing and push-spamming. If you try to block, you're punished (see below). It's a game of rock-paper-scissors with rock not working properly. Really sad, this game had potential. Too bad devs prefer shiny female clothing over core combat fixes.\n\nIf you buy the culling you're presented with a game with SLOPPY combat. Best way to describe this is with the following example: In The Culling, if you block and somebody attacks you, they become staggered and are stunned for ~1 second, giving you the oppurtunity to hit them. If you are blocking and somebody pushes you, you become staggered, leaving yourself vulnerable for ~1 second for them to attack you. In the current system, if I block an attack and then STOP blocking and somebody pushes me it shouldn't stagger me...but it does. The game is that sloppy that it still registers me as blocking and thus punishes me with a stagger (I have fibre op internet, 80 ms ping, etc, nothing has changed on my end, just the sloppy game)","April 30","false","398.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

No game has came close to feeling as exciting and intense for a long long time (for me at least). The patches have been hit and miss, some much better than others but eventually things end up great since the devs listen to the community all the time. Here is the thing though, it IS still EARLY ACCESS. Ignore the people acting like each patch is the death of the game despite the fact they have over 100hours play time...\n\nClosing statement: If you enjoy Battle Royale type games, chivarly-esque combat and rounds that last around 10-15 minutes this game is for you.","April 28","true","141.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Simple as that.\n\nThe reason i gave this review a "no" is because, in  its current state , there some game breaking bugs ( due to Alpha development stage ) and exploits .\n\nWarning : not for the easily frustrated. ( you are most likely to rage at some weird bug than at your own bad skill )\n\nTeam mode can have 2 outcomes :\n\n1 - your partner (assumed not from your friends list ) dies early and you get screwed 2v1\n\n2- be the target of 2 teams\n\nAs the game gets more developed , i may change my opinion. But for now, take this review and a warning. This review is not to discourage you from buying this , although its probably doing the oposite.\n\nHeres a description of some bugs i encountered :\n\n- I was running from a guy with a spear , i just rear to a rock formation and in mid-air i get 67 damage ( i had 68 hp ) and stuck mid-air . when i got killed by the guy behind me i just saw my body falling off the map .\n\n- i started a match while browsing some music , and when i joined i noticed something ...... my perks werent working (i had a perk that increases my max hp , it was still 100 O.O) , and the names were replaced by a long name with underscores , and the airdrop didnt seem to exist .\n\nI had fun , dont get me wrong , and i still get fun out of it , and just some bugs that get the salt flowing , but a quick break and im in it again :)\n\nIf you think you have the guts to be the king , then Good Luck Contestant!\n","April 23","false","20.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This could be easily remedied by placing servers at data centers in the 7 major U.S. hubs: New York, Chicago, Seattle, Los Angeles, Dallas,  Atlanta and Virginia. but sadly the servers run like its on a residential cable line in someones garage in Georgia.\n\nother put-offs are random crashes to desktop, from video drivers crashing, even though they are up to date. To further the insult, the bug thread in the steam forums relating to this very issue was locked by one of the Devs, because 4 people reported the "fix" worked.\n\nI cannot and will not recommend this title in the current state of the servers.\nAgain, the server issue is something that is 100% not related to "Early Access", it is entirely based on the server location. Anyone looking at this game should understand its like playing a multiplayer on McDonald's free Wi-Fi, while driving circles around the building.\n\nI have decent internet speeds of 175Mbps down and 12Mbps up. ping on average to NYC is 25~40.\nping to this games servers is anywhere between 70 and 160, and it goes up and down while you play, and typically stays in the 90 to 120 range. This isnt accounting for the other players that have equal or higher pings to the server, some  fights are so disjointed your opponent appears to teleport either out of your recticle or in a melee fight teleporting behind you.\n\nLAG","March 4","false","198.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Teams are punished and singularitys that can be abused are rewarded, constantly feel that even if i have the speed boost and stamina syringe people catch up to me like its nothing with no bonus.\n\nIts a waste of money seeing as how they are not seeming to even try and make people feel like they made a smart purchase.

This is absolutely one of my favourite games.\n\nA Note on other reviews: As it stands this game is littered with reviews saying "Devs broke game", "GG new patch". Yes, this game is in early access. Yes, new mechanics are frequently introduced, sometimes with negative results. However, I have never seen Devs so committed to rolling out new content while trying to respond to player's concerns. The entitlement of some of the community is exceeded only by their kingdoms of salt.\n\nThis game is hard, but it is also skillful. When you first start playing you will struggle to win a match, but the fun comes from killing other players. I have never found another game as thrilling or intense as when I first started playing The Culling.\n\nI urge anyone to give this game a try, probably takes the cake as my favorite online multiplayer game despite still being early access. This game continues to grow on you, until eventually you begin noticing weapons in real life and resisting the urge to cull.\n","June 3","true","301.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This game is mainly based on melee fights and crafting stuff to survive. The concept of the game is fantastic BUT some gameplay issues kinda ruined the game. Playing with a friend can be fun and rewarding but playing solo is just frustrating. The waiting time to get in a game is about 3-4 minutes and most of the times you get killed early once in a game. The combat system is kinda frustrating aswell where sometimes you find yourself in a situation where you can basicaly do nothing like 1v1 someone who stuns you with a stun gun then shoot you with an smg. And why not put 8 man solo games instead of 16? This would solved 2 big problems (frustration of getting killed fast and reduce the waiting time before games) If you're a casual gamer who play games for fun, don't buy this game if you don't have friends to play with. You just can't play this game alone without getting salty. On the other hand, if you have friends to play with go ahead and buy it. My review is MIXED and i chose thumbs down because there's no MIXED button.","June 1","false","17.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gallente/recommended/437220/","gallente","wormroom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gallente/","378 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is a really neat game. The design is rock solid except for its most important element: Combat. Let's start with the good stuff:\n\nThis is my kind of survival experience\n\nOne of my biggest complaints about most survival games is that most of them expect you to want your time to be wasted. The Culling doesn't, and I think that's really commendable. The game's basic mode (and my favorite) is an FFA, Battle Royale-style (or Hunger Games for those who haven't seen the best survival movie of all time) murderfest. Unlike long-term survival games (think Day Z, Rust, and the one with the Dinosaurs in it), The Culling's base mode boils down all of the worst-case-scenario social interactions that make these games so great into about 20 minutes.\n\nDeciding, for example, whether to try to punch out a spear-wielding sociopath because I decided to make a beeline for the lootable building near my spawn and came up empty is a really powerful feeling.\n\nCrafting, Mood and pacing\n\nTo get it out of the way: Yes, you punch trees in The Culling. Unlike most crafty survival games, however, the absurd practice of lumber-fisticuffs sorta makes sense within the tongue-in-cheek setting. You don't punch trees because there's no other logical way to find resources, you punch trees because trees make sticks and you only need two to bandage your bleeding gut.\n\nCrafting is quick, satisfying and completely fits into the gameshow-y atmosphere. You'll spend most of your time collecting weapons,  salvaging them for FUNC (the game's primary resource) and then using that FUNC to either open in-world boxes or to call down a wide variety of airdropped equipment.\n\nBarring specific airdropped equipment, almost all progression in The Culling is based entirely around a single game. You won't ever see a perk that you haven't unlocked yet. I think that's great. Instead of working your way up a crafting tree, I've found that most character builds focus on easy-to-grasp playstyles.\n\nThe two best examples off the top of my head is the close-range helldemon and the gun-wielding stealthlord. Both of these builds force players to scrounge for as much FUNC as they can get their hands on, but specific perk choices (you can pick 3) mean that they'll probably have to go about it differently.\n\nClose-range characters are best at murdering their enemies in the first phase of the game. He/she will probably pick up a sprint, health, and damage buff for their melee weapon of choice. They'll craft a weapon as quickly as possible then scout around buildings for any suspiciously-open doors or lockers. From there, successfulling ambushing enough targets will earn them enough to get their hands on an airdropped chainsaw. The chainsaw is deadly, satisfying and a beautiful cherry on top of any melee build.\n\nLong-range characters don't have to resort to murder, and instead will usually pick silent running, bow/gun aim buffs, and either a craft or trap bonus. They'll run around the map, hunting down FUNC through strategically placed skulls and energy containers. Bows, while functional and craft-friendly, aren't generally able to take out a bludgeon-wielding sociopath hopped up on whatever stims he's picked up in an abandoned research facility. With luck and enough moxie, he/she'll airdrop an extremely powerful rifle, then be tasked with killing enough players to deal with its prohibitively expensive ammunition cost.\n\nThere's a massive range between these two playstyles, but those're the two I've had some real fun with.\n\nThe combat is real bad.\n\nMy eternal love for melee-focused first-person titles like Chivalry lead me to one conclusion after about 20 hours of The Culling: Rock, paper, scissors doesn't work all that well in a twitch combat experience. This part gets tough to explain, but bear with me.\n\nThe basic combat is as follows:\n\n- Left-click attacks, and can be held down to charge a heavily-damaging strike.\n- Right click blocks, and will block any melee attack (not sure if chainsaws are included here) facing the front of the defender's hitbox.\n- Q (or whatever) shoves your opponent, intended to punish someone for blocking too long.\n- Blocked attacks cause the attacker to stagger for a moment, offering the defender a chance to take a quick swing.\n\nSeems simple enough, right?\n\nSadly, the system's simplicity means that there's not a whole lot of room for weapon specialization, aim or consistency within the game's confrontations. Most of my success has come from exploiting the game's floaty hitboxes and not-quite-accurate animations to score cheap shots on opponents who didn't search "the culling combat tricks" on YouTube.\n\nMy other move was to start charging an attack, wait for the opponent to block, and then cancel out of it by quickly pressing the right mouse button to follow up with a shove. I'm not sure if this is an exploit or not, but it doesn't make me feel all that good.\n\nUsing Chivalry's system as an example, I'd really like to see location based damage, multiple swing-styles and more uniqueness added to each melee weapon type (knives, bludgeons and spears). Fast weapons shouldn't punish their users as harshly for blocking, while stronger weapons should command a wider arc in front of their wielder. Rock, paper, scissors is a great starting point, but each weapon should offer its own set of rock, paper and scissor options to increase the game's skill-ceiling.\n\nWith all of that said, though, The Culling is one of the freshest takes that I've seen on a quickly-tiring formula. All praise be to the developers of the game, and one idea: Let players pay money to have your announcer VA record lines for them. It's another source of revenue, and streamer-types would probably go wild.","May 18","true","21.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I had bided my time the entire match, slinking in the shadows, only fighting when I knew I would win. The last three games I had died within the first five minutes, it was a rough losing streak, but I promised myself I would at least get a kill this round. That kill would be my first. A poor unsuspectng man in a red shirt peacfully crafting a bandage was my first target. I slowly crept around the bushes and contemplated if combat was worth the risk, after all I had been taken out so swiftly the last rounds. But no, my time was now. I raised my hammer. Before he knew what was happening I bludgeoned red shirt man in the back of his head. It took a couple more hits to finish him off, but within the next few moments i had finished the deed. It was exhilarating, my first kill in 3 hours.\n\nI quickly searched the red shirt mans body and found a claymore. I had to make a split second decision, claymore or mantracker, as I had yet to aquire a backpack and only had three slots. With great sorrow I dropped the mantracker and picked up the explosive, wondering if it was worth it, considering I hadn't used one before. Little did I know, that very claymore would be the exact reason I would win. After being chased, shot, and hunted for the next ten minutes, I eventually made my way to the center, as stage one had initiated and the gas was beginning to push contestants towards the center. I stupidly ran around the center for a few minutes, wondering when people would show up. When nobody did, I realized how idiotic waiting in the arena was, and I slunk back into the shrubbery, but not before throwing my claymore on the wall. As I waited in the trees another contestant was killed. Curious who was left I glanced up into the sky. I was shocked to see it was down to one more contestant and myself. 1 V 1. One on One. Mono a Mono.\n\nI'll admit, I was a little panicked. I had never gotten a kill before this match, let alone won an entire Culling. I decided my best course of action was to wait it out, see my opponent first, and try to use the element of suprise. Suddenly an explosion went off and I jumped, afraid that I was going to die, but then I realized what had happened. My opponent had set off my claymore! Now was the time to strike! Mustering my courage I charged forward, hammer held high, and I promply got shot with an arrow. Ignoring the wound I found my injured enemy and smacked the bow from his hands with a swift attack. He reeled back drawing his sword, holding it steady. We fought back and fourth, my hammer against his sword, neither of us gaining an advantage. That is until I did something very foolish.\n\nI threw my hammer. My hammer smashed into my enemy dropping him very low on HP. However, I had hoped it would kill him, and now the only weapon I had was a crafted bow. Standing between me and my hammer, the final contestant advanced towards me, cutting me up good before I managed to retreat to a safe distance. It was anybodys game at this point, both myself and my opponent were one good hit away from death. I pulled out my bow, taking two panic shots, missing both; barely dodging his counter attack. Finally I knocked one last arrow, carefully aiming; and knew that this shot would decide whether I won or lost this match. The time I took to aim meant their was no retreat if I missed. It was do or die. My opponent charged me, sword at the ready, jumping up to deliver a final blow. By reflex I pulled my shot up, praying the arrow would fly true. I released the bolt, closing my eyes, sure that I had missed and lay dead. I opened my eyes just in time to see my opponent fall to the ground, the shaft of an arrow protruding from his skull, defeated. I could't belive it! Not only had I got my first two kills, but I had also won the Culling match. Victory was mine.\n\n10/10 Can't wait for my next match, claymore, and a small loan of a million funk.","March 6","true","195.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","67","6","9","5","0"

Then after the first time you stand still, they shoot you again with another one, thus creating a chain reaction of not being able to do a thing.

It's some of the most fun i've had in a game in a while, and incredibly addicting with fairly well balanced gameplay. So why am I giving this a negative review? The updates.... The updates...\n\nThis game was great when it first released, and the first few "big" patches were fairly good, balancing weapons/perks and lots of bug fixes. But soon after, the devs decided they needed to change the combat to make it more slow to make the more casual players happy... And then the game went down a steep hill and never recovered. The combat just got worse and worse until it's at this point, where it's so unplayable that the games playerbase has gone from a constant 4000 players every day, to 800 players so fast.\n\nThe devs have also had at least 3 patches to correct the combat and revert back the fast and BALANCED combat. What we got was an even more broken combat system, and a new weapon that pretty much broke the meta of the game. Giving you the best stim (boost) full armor, and the best weapon in the game that ignores all effects of armor for about 110 func. Yeah... good one. So unless this games makes a 180 and gets their act together, I simply cannot recommend anybody buying this game at its current stage; and that makes me sad.","May 30","false","84.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

From someone who has been playing since beta, i've watched this game slowly deteriorate one patch at a time. It seems like the devs have comepletely lost their vision and passion in regards to this game. A great example is the resent patch getting rid of the speed mechanic and going back to the old speed rating instead of continuing the attack speed changethat they had FINALLY MADE PLAYABLE some 5 patches later, in some half-hearted attempt to win the community back. Regardless, maybe eventually I will come back to this game but as of how it looks right now I think I'm going to sit out for a few patches.

Still has a lot of balance issues and some annoying bugs, but totally worth $15, even in its current state. Not to difficult to get into and snag a few wins. You don't even have to be super good.

A day or so later there is a hotfix that typically fixes almost all the new problems. The whole point of this early access state is to test out a buggy game that doesn't really work yet. This game is buggy, but it works a lot of the time and it's really really fun.\nI often find myself wondering why I love CSGO and Rocket League. They're really fun games too, but the urge to rank up and progress provides a strong drive to keep playing. The Culling has no rank system (yet). Every time I log into a match I'm playing for the sake of the game. Playing to win. There is no master class rank to work towards, but I'm always trying to get better and figure out the best perks. I love the game purely for the gameplay.\nOften the reviews will yell and shout about the combat being broken. The combat changes a little with every patch and sometimes changes a lot. But the truth is that these people aren't good at the game. They don't understand how to play, and they would if they played the tutorial. The Culling is highly competitive, despite not having ranked play. And this causes people to feel frustrated. You have to hone your skill in online play which is difficult because every match has very good players in it, and to win you really do need to be the most cunning player.\nThis game was put on early access two months ago, and the rate at which updates and content get added has been absolutely astonishing. I recommend this game to anyone with a powerful computer who loves heartpounding PvP. To anyone else, it may be a risky buy in its current state.\n","May 6","true","130.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

I want my money back.\n\nThis game went from good, to bad, to worse. I bought this in early early access and have played a decent bit of it.\n\nThey've ruined this game, so bad. They won't listen to their fans, who've payed for an unfinished product to support development. The developers have taken our money, most likely bought themselves some new desks and computers, and have sent this game down the proverbial sh***er. Excuse my language, but it's true.\n\nThis game and these developers do not deserve your time, your money, or your frustration. They are nothing but frauds, who claim to be about the community and those who dedicate themselves to their game. If you like a horrible, destroyed game with flawed mechanics and bugs that will never be fixed, and constantly decaying content that loses sustenence with every patch, then this is the game for you.

I encourage you to NOT buy this game UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE.\n\nDon't make the mistake I made by paying for this game. Save your money for a developer that deserves it.\n\n\n\n\nDon't get me wrong, the game actually was a very good concept in the beginning, and early builds were incredibly fun. If they'd just listen to their community instead of turning a blind eye to their paying customers, this game would definitely be going places far beyind triple-a titles. However the developers have ruined any chance of this game being worth your time or money.\n\ntl;dr - Developers are frauds, don't give them your money. Don't give them your time. Spit on these developers and laugh as they burn for disrespecting their paying customers and ignoring any sensible feedback for their so called 'Game'\n\n\nPS. I'd like a refund, which they won't give us because they know they'll never make the money back. They owe it to us, for what a mess theyve made of this. This doesn't even qualify as a game anymore, and it is not what I paid for in the slightest.","June 5","false","61.7"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

It's not like Arma 3 or H1Z1 Battle Royals were you grab a gun then run around blasting people. The weapons and danger are weighty, combat is scary and risky no matter how good you are, weapons are scarce and you'll be lucky to see a gun once every few games. The thrill is amazing, you can really play any way you want. Nothing is quite as satisfying as stalking your prey through the woods for a few minutes and finally throwing a spear through their back. What a rush! Can't wait to see where they take this game.\n\nThings I'd want to see done:\n- Still needs optimizing, obveously, max graphics drop my fps faster than a stone cold stunner.\n- Some minor balancing on weapons: a nerf on the taser and buff on some of the melee.\n- I know they are making some new maps and I'd love to see something more lush. Stalking people through the woods is fun but there isnt a ton of cover.\n- Bigger team options (3 players or 5 players)\n- Finally, a voice proximity chat. Every survival battle game needs some trash talk!\n","March 5","true","63.2"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

This isn't your standard Battle Royale game which I like, we really needed a change from just guns. So the combat, I personally think it's really good and it requires a decent amount of skill to be successful. You actually have to think about when you're going to swing your weapon, when to block and push. If you just keep swinging your weapon you'll most definitely die. It's not perfect though it could use some improvments.\n\nThe optimization could also use some work as well but overall it's fine for me. 80% of the time my fps is over 60 but it can drop around 40 for me sometimes. It can get a bit boring playing by yourself after a while but I would highly reccommend playing this with a friend. It's a lot more enjoyable that way. There is a lot to talk about but I would just reccommend looking at other reviews or just watch YouTube videos of the game to find out more about it.

Matches are 20 minutes long, though most games run about 12. You can die within the first 2 minutes if you're new, but don't be discouraged. Remember to use your block key, and use your shove against other players who are turtling (blocking alot).\n\nThe map isn't too big where you cannot learn it, and if you're afraid of campers, the game has many built in mechanics to combat that. Those being many poison gas stations, usually placed near buildings a player might hold up in, and at 10 minutes in the map, the game emits gas to push survivors to the map's center arena,\n\nThe game uses an ingame currency, where killing players and picking up items and surviving gives you points. These reset between matches, and can be used to call in air drops or open crates, which can give either buff items, or stronger weapons/armor.\n\nWinning a match is difficult, but feels rewarding when pulled off. With an item drop system to keep you playing, the game has alot of replay value. Rewarding experience for hardcore gamers, easy enough where a casual player can hop in and not feel too lost.","March 5","true","8.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You find weapons, kill people, play with friends, play with bots, stuff like that.\nIt's got everything; simplistic crafting and inventory, fighting, teams, a rapidly closed-in arena, stuff like that.\n\nFor the moment, though I enjoy the game, it'll lag a whole lot for Aussies. So, if you're not an Australian, go ahead and get the game! Lots of fun to be had. And if you're Australian, then wait a little for the new servers, or just deal with it.\n\nThe only problem with lag right now is if you're trying to block or hit at the exact right time, it'll pause before actually hitting.

This isn't your standard Battle Royale game which I like, we really needed a change from just guns. So the combat, I personally think it's really good and it requires a decent amount of skill to be successful. You actually have to think about when you're going to swing your weapon, when to block and push. If you just keep swinging your weapon you'll most definitely die. It's not perfect though it could use some improvments.\n\nThe optimization could also use some work as well but overall it's fine for me. 80% of the time my fps is over 60 but it can drop around 40 for me sometimes. It can get a bit boring playing by yourself after a while but I would highly reccommend playing this with a friend. It's a lot more enjoyable that way. There is a lot to talk about but I would just reccommend looking at other reviews or just watch YouTube videos of the game to find out more about it.

Ever tried to kill someone in H1Z1 only to have them prone, stand, and repeat to "dodge" your bullets? Ever felt like the game is predetermined based on who manages to pick up the gun first? The Culling uses a smaller population per game on a still sizeable map, and manages to condense the games into a beautiful 25 minute game. The crafting system allows you to take trash and make weapons that will actually allow you to contend with top tier weapons. The currency system makes for amazing interactions and allows for easier balancing of items based on the ability or inability to access items without feeling like it's unfair.\n\n1. Craft a weapon 2. Loot a building 3. Recycle some garbage you probably won't use 4. Become a PCP addict and murder other PCP addicts with baseball bats and blowdarts. 5. Recruit your real life friends to do in game drugs with you in a game that's as addictive as actual PCP.\n\nBuy the game right now.

The developers are constantly trying new (drastic at times) things to rebalance the game, update on a regular basis, and will even admit a change was bad and throw it out sometimes.\n\nFor 15 dollars, it's a steal. I've made back about that much anyway just casually selling cosmetic items in the steam store.","May 4","true","58.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You will get farmed if you havent gone into the game with prior information and even then there are so many mechanics that put the player with more time ahead of you. The thing is The culling does it in a subtle - not immediatly apparant way. On the outside thngs look even - but there are many tricks and tactics to learn as well as things to unlock. Which brings me to my main point.\n\nOnce you have unlocked an air drop - you can call it in agian in subsequent games. Some of them contain exploives and firearms - which obvioulsy puts you ahead of the guy with the level 1 hammer. See my point?\n\nAlso there is too much of an advantage of waiting until 2 people have fineshed fighting and then ganking the survivor when they are low on health. The map needs to be bigger to mitigate this as much as possible (at least until the end)\n\nOnce this and a few bugs ironed out then the game will be playable as a short time waster. On thier road map they do say they are going to put in more mpas and other stuff - so if you want something more long term I would wait as see what they do with it.\n\nRecommeNDed on the assumption the Devs do what they are saying they will.","March 24","true","91.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You'll have to craft supplies, traps, and weapons to defend yourself. There is also a crafting system which is very easy to understand in a short amount of time. There are also two game modes. One is a free-for-all, the other is with teams. Basically, in free-for-all you do whatever it takes to survive, whether it's by eliminating players (teams can be made in free-for-all, but treachery is inevitable), waiting the whole game out, or improving supplies.\n\nWhen you're playing in teams mode, you'll be teamed up with another player, so your team will always be 2 players strong. It is crucial that you stick together and craft supplies and weapons for each other to ensure survival. Also, you must rely on each other in combat. Things can get messy pretty fast when you and three, four, or even five other players find themselves in the same area.\n\nWith all that being said, be warned of the following when you buy this game:\n\n-Extremely unreliable (and unintelligent) companions in teams mode. There is a reason why most people play with their friends on here, because being teamed up with random people usually results in the person logging out or dying early because they're too freaking dumb to type in the chat box and communicate with you.\n\n-A seriously strange combat system. Here's what you have in combat: Strikes, blocks, and shoves. Striking is so simple, guys. Just hit and cause damage. Blocking is a simple concept too. Just wait for the guy to strike and throw up a block to knock him off balance. But why do those things when you can just shove and strike the living ♥♥♥♥ out of your opponent? (technically, you'll just be shoving them most of the time) Shoves counter blocks, knock the player off balance, and keep them from doing anything to you in retaliation. So just shove them like an idiot and swing dat fist, rock, sword, or whatever you're using as a weapon and they'll be done in no time.\n\n-A constantly changing environment. As time progresses, the map you're in gets more dangerous if you haven't already died. Poison gas will eventully be released and will expand all the way into the center of the map after a certain amount of time. That means when you first notice a green cloud of toxic-looking ♥♥♥♥, and you see somebody panicking and running away from it, you probably should be doing the same. The last piece of refuge until the gas completely covers the whole map is the very center. By the time it gets to that point, the most skilled players will most likely be fighting there. So if you're not one of them, then you might as well call it curtains.\n\n-There are guns on this game. Be warned that if a person melees you while you have a gun, you'll end up being disarmed and the gun will be stuck on the ground.\n\n-I am also terrible at this game, which is why I don't play it that much, so if you end up having me as a teammate, make sure you can do better than me, because we'll most likely end up dead. On the bright side, however, we most likely won't end up dying at the beginning. So we won't be the first ones to lose.\n","May 29","true","14.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is obviously not a realism based shooter like Arma or a tiring rinse and repeat try hard competitive game like CSGO. Even though this is officially the third game to feature Battle Royal gameplay (following Arma 3 BR and H1Z1), The Culling feels completely unique from anything else. From the assortment of perks, weapons and craftable weaponry, every game is a different experience that is difficult to prepare for as there are no perfect counter for the ever rotating loadout of your enemies. You adapt, you survive!\n\nIn case you’re a newbie to Battle Royale, here is the JFYI. BR is a last man standing game type. You get one life. If you lose it..  you die and aren’t invited back. Over the course of twenty minutes or so the perimeter of the map slowly focuses in on a central point. At its absolute smallest everyone is practically kissing each other with blades and spears. The last person or team of two too survive, wins! This makes every game much more rewarding than your typical death match as everyone is always playing as if they’re the last player, in the last round, with their last life of a competitive tie-breaker final. For some, they may not have enough blood presume medicine for the stress nor skill required. For others, it’s life!\n\nStyle wise the game reminds me a lot of Gotham City Imposters. Gotham City Imposters was a SEVERLY under rated title that was KILLED by the failure known as Games for Windows Live (GFWL). Gotham City Imposters was a VERY unique FPS that went outside the comfort zone of traditional shooters with an art style equally complex as the diversity of combat.\nThe most appealing part of The Culling is the complexity of your evolving loadout and juggling between your perks for the best counters that will finish off your next opponent. The adrenaline rush that comes from knowing that you are living your one and only life keeps your ears perked like a blood hound on the scent of a blood bathed serial killer.\n\nYou have access to all of the perks/buffs from day one and the base loadouts are perfectly capable of winning you the game as everything is obtainable as pickups in game. Cosmetic drops are awarded at the end of your game regardless if it’s your untimely death or winning by the seat of your pants. Typically 10-25mins bouts. Cosmetic drops are one per game and are entirely up to chance. For air drops you start out with a handful in your inventory and you’re able to choose from one pre-game to call in during a match. These are purchased with in-game currency called FUNC.  Once you call a drop and open it the crate will forever be added to your inventory as a pre-game option. If someone else opens it before you, they get that drop added to their inventory! There are dozens of possible drops but in order to collect them all you need to select the random airdrop perk. This perk is pretty much so self-explanatory. You have no control over what drop you will receive but once you call it and open it, the ability gets added to your inventory to call during future matches. Eventually when you acquire enough drops you’ll have a nice collection to choose from. Ideally picking one that best complements your loadout.\n\nFor being an early access title there aren’t many issues. Any of the issues I come across seem to be addressed in upcoming patch notes. Gunplay unlike H1Z1 seems solid. The Culling is BIG on melee and picking up an actual handgun, SMG or rifle is a rarity. You are more likely to acquire an airdrop that comes equip with a gun than you are to find one out in the open. In 20hrs of playing I found one SMG in a loot pile and was able to kill another player for theirs. I do have gun crate drops but I’m still trying to acquire more crates with the random drop crate before I hone down on a specific crate to add to my loadout.\n\nThe Culling by no means beats Chivalry with how advanced the melee system is but it works, is fun and requires an acceptable amount of skill in order to master. The combat options are plentiful. The game feels rewarding and sometimes you are surprised with a victory while battling an opponent early on in the game to find that you’re the last survivor standing. When you do lose, it’s never a total upset. You’re always looking to jump back in for more and to use what you have learned to better yourself for your next match.\n\nA++ would bang","March 16","true","293.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The devs need to hire people for a QA department to better address these issues before it gets even worse then it already has.\nThis game has potential but is being held back by updates that are running the game and don't seem to have the best intentions when they are released.\nI would hold out on buying this product as the state it is in should not be worth your money.","June 4","false","41.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The Culling has a little bit of everything, crafting, looting, melee combat, ranged combat and specialized Airdrops that one who can rack up kills can call in for the in-game currency FUNC.\nWhile it isn't a perfect game it is a game that actually receives a lot of attention by the developers and is far from being a cheap cash grab like most early access games that never get finished. Yes, the latest updates have been rough, but guess what? It is very, very difficult to balance a PvP mulitplayer game that has melee weapon types, bows and arrows, guns and tools (stun gun, pepper spray, etc.). These developers actually listen to what the community wants, even put an entire system in the game that punishes people that team up to keep the game fair for everyone.\n\nPlease stop putting negative reviews on this game JUST because you didn't like the latest patches, you are effectively killing this game by giving this game a bad rating, keeping people from buying it in the future.","June 3","true","73.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

My heart was pounding in those final 2 minutes of the 1v1, where we went all out with bows, muscleman milk, iron 4 skin, guns, knifes and javelins. The feeling when you win is a huge rush.\n\nHowever, I would like some things to be added such as stats and ranks, since there isn't really a massive incentive to keep on playing aside from the outfits you unlock, and more airdrops. Also, please nerf the SMG, it's basically a guaranteed win when you manage to get it.\n\nAlso, I have encountered a few bugs, but this of course is the day one patch.

Even if it has fog of war sort of stuff, it's damn hard learning that giant ♥♥♥ level.\n2. More levels, or more variety in what to find IN the levels. More caves/hard to reach tunnels that sort of thing.\n3. Weather! This goes hand in hand with the more levels part. You could drop people in an abandoned research outpost way up in the arctic circle, where the cold is literally nipping at your health. Hell I'd take rain or sleet or tornados or ♥♥♥♥ing anything really.\n4. The level should change more often than it does and sooner. At 17 minutes (example) start pushing everyone towards each other, instead of the last 9 or 10.\n5. I hope the cameras come into play more often because it feels...useless to have them around otherwise. Maybe show a replay up on the scoreboard after a kill? SOMETHING!\n\nFor being in Alpha I'd give this game a 8 out of 10. Keep it up","March 9","true","11.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/YellowYT/recommended/437220/","YellowYT","Yellow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YellowYT/","155 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe game is great, but a bit annoying to get the hang of if you don't have experience with the combat system The Culling brings forth. And it gets more annoying if you are an AMD user, i basically found the config alteration on the subreddit and enabled that just to play this game at 55-100 fps. HOWEVER, the game does NOT require a high framerate to get played well. A higher framerate makes aiming easier. However thing is that melee is really good in this game if you know what to do. Which takes practice, but also makes it so that you can still do well even at 30 fps.\n\nBiggest gripe i got with this game lands on things that surrounds the early access norm. The mechanics need tuning, certain weapons are rather powerful, and bugs still gotta get cleaned up. The tazer is a great example. Or 1 perk combined with a tier 3-4 weapon thrown into someone's back. The damage become over 50, where you only got 100hp max. Armor, perks, syringes and such can aid you of course if you want to survive that. But all this can make certain builds win more than not, thus meaning that the game need tuning there. It is however really fun, and many early fights can run on for quite some time if you are aware and ready to play smart making even short games fun.\n\nRatings and technical details below. Do forgive my messy writings, i am not a pro reviewer.\n\nThe graphics look great, max as well as min. Game can use a ton of optimization but it works. The mechanics are well made and make sense for this type of game despite some glitches. While it takes time to get used to all this it is worth it for the savagery this game offers. Even if you get 100 ping.\n\nSo for play-ability, my rating lands on 7/10. It could be a lot worse, and we have seen worse examples in the past. Servers only exist in the US and Europe. Thus connection lag become annoying in fights, but if you live close it is manageable.\n\nGraphics lands on 8.5/10. It does not need to be advanced nor over the top to work, which is clearly demonstrated if you bother to track down how to set shadows OFF and everything else put on the lowest. If you need the extra frames that is (Nvidia users got an advantage here i do believe).\n\nOverall Rating is at 9/10 on Early access. Thanks for reading this far, i will dive deeper into the main content for those that care about this below. I decided to put it last not to spoil, for people that care about this & want to jump in fresh.\n\nThe game's style is based on the "battle royale" game mode we have seen in H1Z1, Minecraft, in other games and even as a mod in CS:GO. It works well in a gun heavy game as with H1Z1 but falls a bit flat because the map and randomization of the loot in H1Z1 can randomly annihilate you because of it's inconsistent nature and map size. While you can play around this with skill, knowledge, and a good float spawn in H1Z1, The Culling does the job properly i would argue. Example: You spawn close to start-gear you can build, based on F.U.N.C points (nano particles) which lets you explore 3-4 angles of the game instantly. Trapping, poison darts, blunt weaponry, bow and arrow and more. In H1Z1 though, even if you get to a good location it might be dominated by someone that got the only rifle at said area. This is assuming you even got a spawn that is close to where there is decent or a lot of loot. The consistency of getting weapons in The Culling is thus a lot better since you spawn close to crates and buildings by default. Unlike in H1Z1, at times. And it takes 15seconds to just get to 1 good location normally once you spawn in The Culling. Combine that with how it is impossible to get "1-tapped" and you got yourself a game that brings a ton to the table in an interesting way. Combine this ALSO with good perks, planning, some map knowledge, and a mastery of tactics and mechanics and you suddenly got yourself a game you can win very frequently. Yes, The Tazer, Chainsaw, SMG and guns are incredibly powerful. Yes, explosives are insanely strong and YES SKILLED PLAYERS DOMINATE. However, it takes skills and knowledge to get to said point which means that it is up to you to carve your path trough terrain, fights, and random events in order to get a shot at victory. Hard to believe that this was put together by a 4-5 man dev team but oh man such is reality. So enjoy the insanity, maybe you will get lucky as well and get a free random drop that you can sell on the market for a lot too? This also happened to me after getting 73 victories, and i have basically earned back the game just by playing a lot and having a ton of fun.\n\nGame comes with a practice mode, 2V2 and Free for all in a 16-man arena mode. If you can afford it, i'd recommend for you to pick it up asap. However if you are allergic to tactical play, some jungle running, looting and close-up combat then this game is not for you.\n\nMain content score: 8,5/10. Very refreshing take on Battle Royale.\n\nTotal score: 8,8/10. The bloody corny mess of a game that is The Culling struck home with me. And do remember that i got well over 10.000 hours played of First Person Shooter games, so it should go well over with most people if someone as picky as I have clocked 73 victories after 58,5 hours, 12 days after release it's release. That's it for this review. Not sure, but i am VERY interested in making a YT channel about random builds, how-to's and such for new players that want to play this game and such. I mean i got 50K subs on 1 channel already so i will look at the possibility since i digg this game THAT much. Thanks for reading, rate it as you wish. Play smart and enjoy The culling!","March 15","true","96.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Initially, your objective is to simply survive as well as to optimally gather defensive/offensive loot until the secondary objective, which is to slay any human you can find, comes into play and then the blood-bath ensues\n\nWhile published through Early Access Release, The Culling offers a robust array of features including over 40 perks to customize your playstyle, multiple weapon types containing three tiers in each, an array of traps, and custom airdrops earned through F.U.N.C. to help the players end-game experience. To go more in depth on these features, you're now going to read through a list of highlighted details within The Culling that I'd like to expand on that might help you make the choice to buy the game.\n\n‎   ‎   ‎   ‎   ‎   ‎   ‎   ‎   ‎   ‎   ‎   ‎   ‎   ‎‎Highlighted Features\n• Perks\nMentioned above, the Perks in this game are already pretty extensive. As of now you can choose a combination of three perks in your loadout to aid you in your conquest to become the killer of men. Perks range from silencing player movement/crafting to doing 40% more backstab damage when attacking with any blade. You can truly customize your gameplay experience and even switch it up every now and then if you get stale. I currently run the silent axe wielding maniac who regenerates stamina twice as fast.\n\n• Optimization\nThis was another feature that initially impressed me in how refined it was considering the Early Access release. At first I was running great, and then decided to max every graphic setting and am still playing beautifully. Also, compared to titles like Rust, The Culling doesn't put half as much of a tax on your hardware while running.\n\n• Dynamic Map interaction\nThis is something that consistently proves to be even better than I previously assumed to me. Not only are there map-to-map ranomizations of hazard tanks that can be strategically activated to explode-outward a noxious wall of gas in the near-by perimeter. Alondside this, you can craft Punji Sticks that cause incompacitating vomitting along with a visual debuff that causes distortions on-screen. Also, alluding to my first sentence, I've very recently found out that doing things like placing punji sticks jammed into health stations cause them to short-circuit and go out of use. Very good for the strategic minded individual.\n\n• Traps\nI wanted this section to be its own highlighted topic following the previous one that slightly mentioned one trap mostly because traps in this game can be utailzed to quite literally change the entire tide of the game. You can punji stick/snare a large area so that any human who comes into your combat-domain is automatically at a disadvantage. You can place found targeted explosives, posion blowgun people while snared, etc. It's just all around a smart thing to utalize when playing The Culling.\n\n• F.U.N.C.\nF.U.N.C is an in-game currency earned through most of the actions executable in The Culling. Killing players, being the first player in a structure, walking 100 meters, recycling found loot.. these are just some of the methods for gathering F.U.N.C. You can then expend this gathered F.U.N.C on everything from health at any red station to crafting traps and armor.\n\n\nSuggestions\n• Third person\nI really think a game like this benefits from a 3rd person option, and would love seeing something like this implemented in The Culling some time in the future.\n\n• Gun rebalancing\nYou can currently get guns by either being supremely lucky & opening a blue crate, or by expending only the largest amounts of funk to attain these devices of instant rage. They've currently made these weapons "balanced" by implementing a feature where if any player hits you while you hold a gun (you cant block with a gun) then it basically has an 80% (hell maybe even higher) chance to just fly out of your hand onto the ground as if you dropped it. So, at long range, guns are still incredibly overpowered, but at short range they aren't. Instead of this I propose simply removing all airdrops that have guns in them, and making them something that you can only attain via three crate monte or Viva Pinata. There's no reason for everybody to have the ability to get guns if the way you balance them makes them only balanced from a certain range.\n\nIf we did this, everyone would be forced to the middle who wanted a gun. This would make for more fast paced gameplay as well as more of a reason for people to go to the aforementioned events, as I often find myself the first person getting all the gear.\n\nConclusion\nHonestly, so far I've really enjoyed my time playing The Culling. I think that as it stands the price is wonderful for the content, and very reflective of a level-headed dev team honestly which is super respectable. I would definitely recommend this game to any friends, and despite my preface containing discontent for biased comparisons I do think that this stands the test of playability with titles such as H1Z1: King of the Hill/Rust battle royale. Providing that the devs stay on their toes and provide us with some nice updates I think that this could become a favorite title for me very easily.","March 8","true","233.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mercy_is_Bae/recommended/437220/","Mercy_is_Bae","Mister Scrub","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mercy_is_Bae/","247 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhat an excellent survival/combat game\n\nTL;DR Awesome game, Amazing tension and gameplay, some rare latency issues.\n\nPlease don't be like me and write this off as another early access survival game on Steam. This game is truely a one-of-a-kind experience. The game's concept is simple enough; 16 players are throw on an island to kill each other and the last man standing is the winner. However, this is no Hunger Games. There is no ridiculous romance sub-plot, theres no uninteresting world, and there is actually some real tension (A.K.A. You are not Katniss Everdeen, you are not garunteed to survive). This game's genius comes from it's simplicity. The crafting is as simple as it gets, meaning no flipping through wikis to figure out what does what, and there's even a quick access crafting guide in the pause menu if you desperately need it. There is even a very helpful and short tutorial in the game to explain the mechanics to you. The combat is also simple in that you have three different moves at your disposal, which are your attack, block, and shove (unless you are lucky enough to find a gun or bow). The combat system is simple enough for anyone to understand it, but difficult to master.\n\nThere are also some interesting ideas that The Culling attempts to implement into the survival/crafting game formula as well. Perks are present in this game and allow you to specialize in a weapon type or different abilities. For example, my preferred loadout is built around running faster and dealing more damage with blades, while also being silent to be able to sneak up on opponents. You can also equip airdrops that can be called in and you can unlock more of them by stealing drops from other people or by getting a randomly placed supply drop in game. These airdrops add even more elements to consider when making a loadout. You can also change characters clothing that can be unlocked by completing matches.\n\nAnother interesting feature is the F.U.N.C. system. To craft an item, call in an airdrop, or open a rare crate, you will need F.U.N.C., which stands for "Flexible Universal Nano Compound". This is like the game's currency system. F.U.N.C. is obtained over time from rewards, Selling items, killing other players, or by finding little caches of F.U.N.C. around the map (Usually in the form of human remains). This mechanic is greatly appreciated to keep the gameplay balanced and to add in a way to avoid too many care packages being obtained. What is also great is that the mechanic is also simple and accessible.\n\nAnd that is what makes this game so unique, it is a very  simple  game. These survival games keep trying to go bigger and larger, with more crafting and survival mechanics to make them "hardcore" games, but no game in my life has made my heart beat out of my chest like The Culling does. And actually being the last man surviving and winning The Culling?   Pure bliss\n\nThe game's atmosphere is also on point. Instead of a scoreboard that you can pull up at any time, there are monitors around the map and a giant projection in the sky that display the scoreboard, and the announcer for the game is funny and charismatic. The sound design also was ambient and always kept me guessing if someone was sneaking up on me.\n\nWhile every fight in the culling is blood pumping tense, they can also be fustratingly difficult. Latency issues sometimes cause thrown items or projectiles not to hit, hits won't register, or people to teleport. It has not been a common issue for me (I live on the East Coast of the US), but it is extremely noticable when it occurs.\n\nThere are also some awkward animations and some missing polish in gameplay, but this game could pass for a Bethesda Title. (Just kidding Bethesda, I love you bb) But seriously, there are early access games out there with much less polish than this (looking at  you  The Forrest.\n\nLatency issues and early access noticability aside, The Culling is an excellent and intense survival game that is brutally unforgiving while still remaining simplistic. Gameplay is fun and tense, the environment is cool and exotic, and the sound design is really cool. I can't wait for what else the developers are going to add in the make this game even greater.\n\nAs of 4/10/2016, this game is an 8.5/10\n\n","April 10","true","12.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

However, after many hours put into this game and practicing I can say that it is broken, invisible cheaters, people with rifles after two minutes, and constant crashes are just a few of the many plagues of this game. Also, the melee combat  had some good ideas like the whole block stagger concept, but it kinda loses me when a fully charged sledgehammer gets stopped by someone's bare forearms. All in all this game is a mess and the team gamemode, don't even start me on the team gamemode. I get spawned 700+ meters away from my teammate while a team gets adjoining spawns? In any way how is that fair? When the combat gets utterly broken in a two on one fight because one person makes you block in the front while the other stun-locks you in the back starting a non-ending cluster♥♥♥♥ of your screen shaking and you losing health until you die.

Always ends up a long boring 20 minutes running around picking up junk and hardly ever any action during that time. You do all the work  only to get pushed to the middle by gas once the game timer hits 0. Don't see how they will work around this repetitive play, it has very little tactical gameplay.\n\nCombat is not the greatest either. Targets taking multiple blows to bring down with even arrows to the head or hitting someone across the head with a pipe.\n\nA game like this shoudl be about brutality. You take an axe to the chest or head, you should be nearly dead.

The ability to drain an enemy's stamina is rediculous and I found playing right after a patch only yields to people who most likely played way longer than I have, making the matches one-sided.\n\nExample:\nI was so scared of people draining my stamina from their one-sided abilities (which happened 3 games in a row sending me directly back to a 3 minute queue time) that if I saw an open box or heard conflict I ran. Crafted gear served me no purpose other than stalling my demise. Call me bad at the game, sure, but my hours prove I am unexperienced in comparison to what I was matched up against. Can't run away or anything because all my stamina is gone from them pegging me while I had block up. Blocking doesn't drain stamina anymore, but it appears their perks cut through and still apply to your overall stamina pool.\n\nI stand with my decision of this being a good game, however things like this need to be fixed before it leaves early access.\n\n*end edit*\n*begin original post*\nI have only played this game for a short amount of time and every time I play I have an adrenaline-fueled panic attack.\n\nGames good. Enough said.\n\nI do not recommend this game for anyone with an arrhythmias condition.\n\nOn that note (and after reading other people's "reviews"):\n[Note: I have played post what appears to be the 'loadout' phase]\n*The perk system is not unforgiving: hardly any increase damage and the ones that do are on crafted gear / brass knuckles / thrown weapons (most are weak)\n*Guns are OP for a reason: YOU ARE MENT TO OUT SMART A GUN USER\n*Crafting is a vital asset to the game\n*Loading problems are hardware based, only downside is finding a match\n*Game emphasises smart players, not skilled fighters. Trap, ambush, and retreat as needed.\n*This is a game show set on an island: I wouldn't expect a new map, just RNG the buildings/spawns\n*I hardly (currently never) see teaming in free-for-all: not unless the enemies trying to kill the person with the backpack and then each other.\n*Anyone can craft a bow: rock + rock = Knife / Knife + stick = Spear / Spear + Stick = Bow\n*Game awards cosmetics EVERY TIME you perform well: you don't even need to kill, just survive.\n\nSo again before you go around thinking every negative review is right, know this:\n*Still early access\n*Still a good game\n*A fresh breath of air in the game development scene that involves crafting anything to survive\n\nBuy it. Try it for 1 hour 59 minutes. Dont like it then refund it. But this game is going to be, and already is, too good to put down.... granted after my panic attack I will keep playing.","May 15","true","5.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/syrekroth/recommended/437220/","syrekroth","Dankness Evermeme","http://steamcommunity.com/id/syrekroth/","135 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is honestly really worth the money spent on it. Just like in most competetive games people do not like change which is the reason for most of the bad reviews in my opinion. This is early access and people are not expecting big changes like this is a release game. Give the game a shot if you are looking into it. They do changes fairly often (about 2 times a month). I still do not regret my purchase of this game despite what others think of it.\n\nPROS:\n-Really good survival arena game\n-Much easier for newer players to get into with the new economy (no more teir 4 weapons or guns in the first couple minutes of the game, those are ending of mid game towards end game.)\n-Game pacing is really good now with all weapons seeing play with combat speed changes and economy.\n-Has a decent upper end community that is willing to help newer players learn the ropes.(LiBrizzi and Anthony just to name a couple. I watch LiBrizzi regularly)\n-Patches at a REGULAR RATE with a lot of changes.\n-Chat is only available after death\n\nCONS:\n-Patches at a regular rate with a LOT OF CHANGES. (this can be bad due to the shifting play each patch but this is due to Early Access)\n-A few bugs in combat system\n-Typical competitive playerbase (players being rude in spectator chat)\n\nAll in all I love this game. If you are interested in it watch some streams. I play this game every single day that I am home. It is a great game to look into, and if you want to, to invest your money into their Early Access.\n\nSee you in the arena,\nSyrekroth","May 24","true","215.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There are of course still a lot of physics and graphical changes that can be made to increase the realism, but the gameplay FEELS great regardless of how it looks. Fast paced and tons of fun, this game puts "Battle Royale" on a whole new level. The Culling has strength where it's counterpart H1Z1: King Of The Kill lacks. I am very excited to see where this game goes with future development.\n\nH1Z1 - Long game times, hundreds of players in each game, looting is your advantage (so if your spawn is in the middle of a forest then you're out of luck), sometimes a lot of waiting around in the safe zone and  avoiding others only to die in the top 3 and have wasted your time.\n\nThe Culling - 20-25 minutes average game time, maximum 16 players per game, crafting plays a major role as well as looting (so even if you can't find what you need in lockers or buildings, you can still craft yourself an arsenal), the shorter game times means less waiting around and more fighting other players or running from them.\n","March 8","true","9.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Ever get those butt clenching moments when you're trying to clutch on Counter-Strike? You pretty much feel like that all the time in The Culling. There's something so satisfying about winning a fight, or better yet, the actual match, that I just don't get with other games. Its just a pure adrenaline rush.\n\nThe crafting in this game doesn't get in the way, and I like how its handled. You want some more arrows for your bow? Oh hey, just rub this stick against your bow and the nanites inside you will take care of the rest!\n\nCombat is nice and simple, and no one ever has a huge advantage weapon-wise... if you're tactical about the engagement. I've been in various combat scenarios where I'm simply out-gunned but I'll come out on top. This guy has a rifle? Pffft, I'll move tree-to-tree and pepper spray the guy and disarm him as I repeatedly impale him with my dirty spear. I've been out-numbered and ganged up on, but with a bit of luck and careful combat... you can easily clutch! I've intercepted other people's airdrops and used it against them! Simply put, its fun to be in combat and you'll never know what's going to happen when you're fighting another player like yourself who's desperately fighting for their life too.\n\nYou have perks that you can use to suit your playstyle, and there's also airdrops to help reinforce that. You can unlock airdrops by opening ones you haven't discovered yet.\n\nTeam fights are also fun, you and a buddy vs 14 other people paired off into teams of two.\n\nGood luck, contestants!","March 8","true","23.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It was an early access game with quality. Now, it's just early access.\n\n\nR.I.P.\n\n\nAt this rate, Xaviant's going to win the "Most incompetent dev team" 2016 reward with flying colors. They're completely incapable of completing the basic tasks of improving performance or gameplay functionality. Each update is a literal downgrade from the last one. The only reason this game has any positive reviews is because the initial release was actually good. Which in terms of early access survivalesque games is unheard of. However, instead of trying to differenciate themselves from their competetion, they decided to become just like it. They're making H1Z1's king of the kill look good. They're making ARK Survival of The Fittest look okay in comparison. Everyone here keeps wait for a new update. "It'll be release by march 2017, they'll fix it!" No they won't. They haven't fixed it now, they won't fix it. It won't make it to the end of this year, let alone March 2017. If the game ever becomes a tenth of what it was, I'll eat my motherboard and screw an electrical socket with a fork tied to my phallus. This is a prime example of an early access game.

Very few good weapons, and money management also come into play in this game. Again well done. So where does The Culling go wrong? It seems like it is the perfect game... well not exactly. Cons:  1. Gets boring. I know some might say it does not, but lets be real here, there is only one map with the same gameplay every time. I was done with it after an hour. If you play with freinds yes it is more enjoyable, but still gets old after a short amount of time. This being said I did have a lot of fun in that hour.  2. Games are long. I know I should not be saying this as I am a csgo player, but still it is a little annoying sometimes. You will spend 15 mins getting the perfect gear together, and then you get hunted down. Now this does not happen all the time (thank god) but it still feels like a bit long of a game 20mins. I don't see this one ever changing in the future so just keep that in mind before you buy it, "can I spend 20mins on each game?".    So there you have it, my full review. So what, am I for or against The Culling? I am not sure really. I say buy it if you are interested in long strategic survival. If you are caught in the hype just wait a little, the price will go down and you will get your shot at winning the games. Hopefully this game will get some new maps and game types in the future. Hope you liked my review.","March 14","true","21.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I have to say, I don't see where the hate is coming from, I've played multiple sessions in both single and teams and never had any major issue except for one case of lag which still resulted in me getting a kill.\nIf you don't have a gaming setup or even a good gaming laptop, don't blame a game for that, you chose to buy your laptop or pc with its specs. I am saying this because I've played on my laptop and experienced no issues aside from the aforementioned single instance of lag.\n\nThe Culling isn't a perfect game and I do wish they would implement a sort of 'Crafted Weapons Only' gameplay so that it would require slightly more skill to play. I haven't run across guns I have seen the devastating power of explosives and how easily having just one can change the game.\n\nUltimately I enjoy the game and will continue to play it.\n\nEdit: I will say the biggest flaw of the game is where you start, whether it be in singles or teams. Some players start off right beside buildings loaded with loot and others start in the middle of nowhere and I feel this system needs to be balaned in some way for it to be entirely fair. Too often I have had sessions where other players start off fully equipped and I have little more than a spear.","May 25","true","2.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I am very lenient when it comes to reviewing EA games (my library has a lot of them) so bear with me.  In addition, I would say I'm pretty good at the game, I'm not a noob.\n\nI really loved this game when it released. I encouraged a few friends to buy it, which they did, and we had tons of fun together.  It's initial gameplay was balanced and was an exhilarating experience.\n\nHowever, each update seems to be making the game worse. I don't have a problem with framerates, textures, and perks.  What I do have a problem with this is the hand-to-hand combat, unbalanced weapons, lag, and a toxic community, (particullary players "aka teamers" team up together, in FFA, to win - unfair)\n\nMy main gripe is with the fighting combat.  The melee combat has become just a joke, it's become a shove-to-victory game.  Aside from the shove->hit->shove->hit I want to address also the lag issues.\n\nLag. I have always a great connection, I rarely lag on my end.  However when hand-to-hand fighting with a "lagger" trying to win the fight is just a dice roll.\n\nThe community is incredibly hostile.  On most of the discussions, users just shred apart each other (with their opinions) and thus are not very helpful.\n\nFree-for-all. Ahh it used to be so much fun, a good challenge.  Since the implementation of tokens, many players choose to "team up" in FFA matches.  As a result, in most FFA matches you will end up fighting a two-man team.  While the developers and community are taking measures against this, it is not very effective.\n\nMoreover, I used to love this game. I had so many great times playing with friends and going solo in FFA matches.  But each subsequent update seems to be just ruining the game.  Since I am now disinclined to play it, I recommend holding off purchasing this game.  However I do sugggest that keep checking back, once or twice a month, to see if the game has been restored to what it should be.\n\nP.S. I already know this is coming. "It's an EA game, of course it won't be perfect, give it time." I understand that, but there comes a point where you have to focus on the most important matter(s) at hand. I hope the devs read my review. I hope it will encourage them to make the changes we, consumers, want to see.\n\nWhat I'm saying is, fix the damn game already!","June 2","false","75.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

Some work to be done, but 9.5/10 in it's current state for me. Let's get into it-\n\nThe Culling is an amazing battle royale-type game with little to no faults.\nA lot of people say that the announcer's voice gets annoying, but after 28 hours+ of play, I don't find it annoying in the slightest. The gameplay isn't repetetive at all, which is great. There's a nice array of weapons in the game as well, which keeps gameplay fresh. Guns and Bows aren't OP either, you can literally disarm them with a well-aimed rock. The combat itself is really refreshing, too. it's pretty different from the other "survival/battle royale" games out there. It's somewhat like Rock Paper Scissors. There's Block, Attack, and Push. Push will knock back a blocking enemy, and an attack on a blocking player will knock you back. You can throw any weapon or item, and backstabs deal a nice amount of bonus damage. I'm not that great at writing reviews, and I'd rather not spend more time than I need to writing this game one. I just felt the need to because it was so good.\n\nGet this game guys. The devs are AMAZING, respond to nearly every question, and fix every known bug they can as soon as they can. EU servers just made it in too, so that's a plus. With time, I'm sure The Culling will become a solid 10/10 kind of game. Thanks Xaviant.","March 6","true","63.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I've been interested in a game that was reminiscent of The Hunger Games, and I've finally found one. The game plays great, with some issues like crashing every once in a while and bad frames here and there, but it's such a fun game!\n\nThere's crafting, which is how you make bandages, ammunition, and starting weapons. Then there's item crates where you can get more powerful weapons, and finally airdrops, which give you kits for a big pricetag.\n\nI enjoy this game not only because it's what I've been looking for, but also because of the playability. No match is the same, and don't get discouraged when you keep losing, as I haven't won once. I also am pretty happy with the graphics.\n\nPros:\n-Cool game style\n-No microtransactions (Yet, please don't add them.)\n-Good graphics\n-Great sound effects\n\nCons:\n-Crashing and minor frameskips as said above\n-Shadows, Anti-Aliasing, etc are very taxing when it comes to FPS which I hope will be fixed\n-Bad textures for the first half minute when starting a match, but it fixes itself after that\n-No servers outside the U.S. (I live in the U.S. so I don't really care about this, but others do...that's mostly why there's negative reviews right now.)\n\nGuys, I have hope that these developers are gonna do their job well and make this into a great game. There's so much content that's here already and I can't wait to see what else they throw into it in the next months/years. Yes I recommend this purchase. Yes I think you should buy this. The cons aren't that bad when it comes to how fun this game is; I'd recommend this to everyone. Cheers.","March 7","true","14.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

If they blocked, you shoved, if they attacked, you blocked, if they shove you attack. You had time to drop your block and attack if you saw the shove coming, you had time to shove if you saw their block coming up, you had time to react, but the last few patches have slowly been adding more time where a shove staggers you after you drop the block, and things like that. So now, reacting is damn near impossible, because even if you drop your block in time they can still stagger you, so the combat that was so tight and satisfying when I bought the game devolved into "just guess what they're gonna do next and spam things".\n\nOn top of that, cheating scum teaming up in the game's main mode, Free For All have ruined this game for me. Free for all is 1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1. There is a team mode, it's 2v2v2v2v2v2v2v2. but with teaming in free for all it becomes 2v1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1. Those two players have a massive advantage over all of the solo players. For example, they can have one player attacking while the second player goes behind the victim and backstabs him (double damage) until he dies. It is nearly impossible to beat two players if you are solo.\n\n\nI quit until they either revert the combat, fix teaming in FFA, or both.\n\nI will happily reverse my review when they fix both of these problems, I love this game. At this time however, I find these issues to make the game unenjoyable.\n\n\nDon't buy The Culling. Not unless you can go back in time and play the game it used to be.

But now, thanks to the developers and their great guideline, it became an Attack/Push/Push game since Block is useless, the game tend to encourage players to spam pushing. Thats one of the many examples which illustrate how aware the developers are about the path to take (i hope you detected the sarcasm here). Something else, they had slowed drastically all the melee weapon's attack speed, so much that they had to revert the changes with a few patchs. I told you, they have no clue about what they're doing, its realy scary.\nTo be honnest, when i'm playing this game i feel like i'm on a rollercoaster because head upside down, this is how i feel this game, this messy and clunky gameplay.\n\nI wish this game had a real skilled-based gameplay (like Chivalry), but thats not the case at all, its too much RNG-based. RNG can be good for games, as long as you control it, too much RNG kill games. Of course\nmaybe i'll update this review if this game becames interesting to play. Because, Yes, its a good game. Is it fun to play ? Definitively not anymore.","April 23","false","245.9"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Don't buy this game at the moment.\n\nYou get since a while a lot of people that are teaming in the FFA Mode.\nYes there are 3 contestants left but guess what, you have to fight against two. Wooow super cool....\nFew days ago I could play it fine in FFA but since the Patch its  broken. Now you will find in every second game few teamplayers....\n\nThis is more than frustrating! I know there are "no" rules in the game but this is a status that makes me sick.\nThis is not the fault of the devs but they need to do something to reduce the amout of teaming in FFA. I can't recommend this game right now. You will just get a heart attack when you try to play this right now.\n\nThe game was so far solid but the community/players need to "exploid" it.\nIt could be called as cheating/griefing. Why are there so many players that don't show respect for each other and start a 2 vs1 ? Where is the challenge?  I don't get it.\n\nI love what the devs try to do with this game, please devs do something! Thanks.\n\nUpdate -05.06.16: They try to fix the teaming problem in FFA what is good, but they also changed the pace of the game in many ways. So that players have less health and the time to pick up func & craft stuff has been reduced in a bad way (my opinion). The gameplay is now way to fast for me.","May 7","false","13.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","2"

The melee combat - a core mechanic in this game - feels stiff, choppy, and inaccurate - and this is coming from someone with hundreds of hours playing Chivalry.  The game is poorly optimized, stutters frequently, and has graphical problems abound.  I cannot even put this game into fullscreen or it flips out and my monitor starts flickering.\n\nI had some very satisfying moments in this game, and the immersion with a pair of surround sound headphones is great.  I also really appreciate a survival type game that doesn't have motherf*cking zombies in it.  The vast majority of my time however was spent feeling frustrated with the controls and stuttering problems.  I only didn't refund this game in hopes that the developers can fix these netcode and graphics optimization problems and improve the controls when they actually finish this game.\n\nUPDATE:  I wanted to edit my review as I have continued to play anyways because I have friends who foolishly bought this game too early also.  I would like to give this game TWO thumbs down at this time instead of just one, there seem to be some serious shenanigans with hackers and exploiters right now on top of its other problems.  I lose every game to players who have tier 4 weapons and guns waaaayyy to early in the match to have acquired them legitimately.  Sometimes you get lucky with good finds early on, but this is happening far too consistently to attribute it to mere luck.  This game has cheaters.\n\nThe devs for this game should be ashamed and embarrassed to charge this much for such a clearly unfinished product.  Of course they aren't actually, they are laughing all the way to the bank.  I hope they don't flake out and evaporate like some developers do with early access titles on Steam and actually make this game good.  The concept is still great which I think is what truly is driving the interest and excitement for this game, because it's definitely not the actual gameplay that's doing it.","March 12","false","140.5"," 17 of 32 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","17","32","0","0"

You can either choose to go in solo vs. 16 other players or pick a buddy and compete versus 7 other teams of two.\n\nYou get dropped at a random point in the map and have to loot/craft items to be able to defend yourself in the inevitable fight to the death. The weapons are very melee centered, even though it is fairly easy to get your hands on any of the various bows early on. Firearms however seem to be very hard to come by.\n\nYou can also fully customize your character with drops you receive at the end of each 20 minute match. These scale in rarity depending on how well you do during the game.\n\nI have had a lot of fun with this title so far and hope the developer keeps going in the right direction, as this game has great potential. The only con I can think of right now is that there is only one map and it is on the small/medium side, but I also know there are plans to bring us more maps so I will adjust this review as we go.\n","March 17","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

We took down the already wounded with ease and picked up some great loot. I got myself a rifle and a sword and my compatriot grabbed himself a brand spanking new recurve bow. Our journey then continued.\n\nAs we continued walking through the depths of the forest we stumbled across a building. I go ahead to search it through and through but I was stopped in my tracks by some sort of explosive bringing me down to a frightening 1HP. However my good pal seemed to be very clued up in medical sciences as he began to craft bandages out of sticks (I know, crazy right?) I was soon patched up and we began trekking towards the maps centre.\n\nBy now there were only 5 left, us, another pair and one lone survivor who'd already lost his partner in crime. We reached the centre, I activated the kill switch and we waited for the fun to begin. However the wait didn't last long as the first pairing came through the brush clearly up for a fight. My trusty partner fended them off with his bow as I went to craft some ammunition for my rifle. I was back just in time as our rival pair had moved up and began engaging in close quarter combat with my buddy. I rushed in firing my only four shots at one of the attackers, filling him with lead, killing him outright. The last of the pair was easy pickings and he was down quickly.\n\nNow it was just the one lonesome survivor and us. We had to win, surely. I was still bleeding from our rival’s offensive bringing me down to 1HP again. My partner on the other hand was on half health so I believed we could still win this. All of a sudden in the corner of my eye I saw someone run up the ramp next to me. He wasn't highlighted so I knew it wasn't my partner and incredibly he hadn't noticed me. I wielded my sword, snuck up behind and killed him in one swipe... "Nice work genius you just killed your partner" rang out from the announcer’s mouth. As I realised what I had just done an arrow from the bow of our final enemy strikes me in the head killing me instantly. I was flabbergasted; words couldn't describe the disappointment I had brought upon myself. I proceeded to turn my PC off and go for a lonesome walk reflecting on my actions.\n\nR.I.P Partner, gone but never forgotten (I'm really sorry!)","March 7","true","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

How i was wrong. This game is very different from the other popular BR game, H1Z1 King of the Kill. While the objective is the same (be the last one alive) it does it in such a good way that matches, which are around 25 minutes, pass so fast. So im gonna be looking at some aspect of the game.\n\nMelee Combat:\nMelee Combat is simple, but complex in a way. There are 5 main actions: weak attack, strong attack, throw, block and push. While it does feel a bit weird, its highly satisfying to win a fight in this game. Blocking someone gets you a a small time window to hit your enemy and blocking protects you form all sort of melee damage. The only way to break a block is to push the enemy and doing so will stun the blocker for a small time, which is enough time to hit them. Throwing a weapon gets you a hit, even if they are blocking but you lose your weapon by doing so. Attacking and pushing wastes stamina, so keep your eye on that.\n\nLong range attacks:\nThere are many ranged way of attacking someone in this game, such has: bows, guns, grenades and poison darts.\nThere is nothing different in this type of battle from another FPS. Also if you get hit while having a long range weapon, you will be disarmed of said weapon.\n\nStats/Effects:\nThere are status and effects that weapons and stims (pretty much drugs) will give a player, such has: bleed, poison, weakness, damage protection, more damage, faster stamina recovery, more speed, etc. Weapons cause the bad ones (of course) while stims buff the player.\n\nCrafting:\nWhat sets this game apart from others is its crafing system. The game gives you a crafting recipes which you can check by pressing ESC. To craft an item you will need FUNC, which is sort  of a ingame currency, that has a lot more uses (will be talking about that).\n\nFUNC:\nThis is a pretty important aspect of the game. You need FUNC to craft, heal, open weapon crates and to call an airdrop. You get FUNC for killing other players, from random corpses that you find and from a FUNC recicle station.This station allows you to recicle an item that you have for FUNC. The higher the tier of the item, more FUNC it will give.  The "healing" aspect of FUNC is the ability to use a health station.\n\nLooting:\nThere are some building which contain lockers, that may or may not have something in them. The most probable way of finding something is by opening weapon crates. There are 3 crates: green, blue and red. The green ones are free to open, the blue ones cost 50 FUNC and the red one need an explosive device to open them.\n\n\nThat everything that I feel like its important. There are more feature that i did not talk about.\n\nOverall, is a pretty good game. It may have its problems here and there but other than that, its a great early access game.\n\nRating: 8/10","March 10","true","51.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've played a solid 50+ rounds, and I have to say I'm haing a blast. The hit boxes are a bit wonky, and if you shoot an arrow or a poisoned dart from a high elevation the projectile mysteriously plummets to the earth, but otherwise this game is FUN. I've only knocked 5 victories, but I can definitely say that each win fully warrants a massive fist pump/jump out of the chair and dance around a little. (what, no one can see me, stop judging me you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly trolls) Given that the victories are so hard won I'd love to see a little celebratory, in game third person vid and/or replay of your kills when you're the last man standing. (c'mon devs, that wouldn't be that hard, and would be completely sick!!!)

This is your game.\nHuge focus on melee combat instead of ranged, guns are EXTREMELY rare and there's even a team mode where you can que together with a friend and fight as a team against other teams. The map is small, which I love. But not 'too' small for 16 players, and each match takes around 20 minutes. Because of that, you run into people fairly often. Even if you find something valuable and get killed, it won't be like you lost a bunch of time.\n\nThat being said, it's very obviously an early access game. Melee combat is clunky. Very clunky. If you make it to the last few, odds are most of them have bows and some pretty dangerous weapons. But there are good times to be had for the price.\n\nOh, and two sticks makes a bandage.

You wanna focus on sneaky melee combat ? No problem, you can for example focus on blades and use perks for them, just like "40% backstab damage with a blade" or "Run 10% faster with a blade", thats basically how perks work. Then you can also choose your own personal Airdrop, which you can call in, when you gathered enough "F.U.N.C", which is the ingame currency, that you get when killing other contestants or loot places. I like to use the "Ninja Airdrop", which contains a Katana and some smoke bombs. This crate fits my stealthy play style and the perks, I listed up there.\n\nThe Map is a jungle, with a small arena in the center of the map, which will be the place, where the showdown will take place, after 20 minutes, when the gas spread so much, that people have to gather in that small arena to fight till death, in a fckn intense fight ( I know what I'm talking about, lel ) .\n\nBut before this takes place you will spawn in a little capsule somewhere on the map and you have to collect loot, fight other players, try to survive the attacks of other players, try to call in your airdrop without letting any other person steal it from you, basically just -Kill or get killed.\nAnd believe me, killing is fun in this game, since the fight system is challening and no simple button mashing. You can attack, charge attacks, block and push to break the blocking of your enemy.\n\nIt could turn out to be one of the next big e-sports games maybe. I mean even the developers of the game said, they have the goal to produce the very first Hunger Games e-sports game out there, which I think they will accomplish, because this game in its state right now is propably better then any other pvp focused early access game out there!\n\nKudos to you devs! 👍","March 4","true","43.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Culling is one of the few. It's very tense and cleverly designed. You will have to come up with different strategies on how to use your time, map location and perks.

I saw the ground and water moving as he ran to what i assume was to punch me. I ran for it i thought maybe some type of visual bug. Further along into the game I activate the kill switch making sure the closest person was 99+ units away. With gas completly surronding the middle  I get hit twice with a compount bow( one of the air drop supplies) and died as I see what appeared to my killer flying away.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FinalContra/recommended/437220/","FinalContra","Final Contra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FinalContra/","397 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI am shocked by how much I like this game. I have been burned by early access in the past and I was hesitant to buy in due to the usual worries of devs abandoning the title, rampant bugs, and there just not being enough content yet to be enjoyable. Well don't worry about all that. I'm 24+ hours in after a week with the game and I'm happy to report that I have only found a few bugs and I'm still finding new strategies to be the last man standing with the current expansive range of perks, airdrops, weapons, and traps.\n\nThe gameplay rewards skill and strategy above who finds a gun first, which is a refreshing change of pace from other battle royale modes. I have won multiple rounds with tier 1 weapons, stealth, and skill. A gun will absolutely help your cause but getting hit with melee attacks while you have a ranged weapon equipped will cause you to drop your weapon on the ground. This is a brilliant balance mechanic that allows you to turn the tables on any gun wielding maniacs that don't realize you're in melee range.\n\nThe rounds are currently 25 minutes long and you're free to leave and find a new match if you're killed off early. Poisonous gas starts to pour in the arena from all sides once there are 10 minutes left to ensure that the remaining players are forced into a fight.\n\nThe game has 3 different playlists: free for all, free for all against bots, or teams which is split up into 8 teams of 2. Teams mode can also be played with a steam friend or just a randomly matched player if you haven't been doing a good enough job of bugging your friends to buy this game. At the end of any non-bot match, you're rewarded with a random cosmetic item for your character.\n\nThe game currently only features text chat between dead players and between teammates which is great. You get all the pulse racing intensity of a battle royale game without having to deal with 15 year olds that want to show you how many bad words they know.\n\nOverall, this is an insanely fun game with tons of depth to keep you coming back to sharpen your hunting skills and try out new strategies. If the trailer even vaguely looks like something you would enjoy, buy it!","March 12","true","229.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Ex: I was forced into melee combat against a team of two by myself. Killed one guy and took his blow gun. Started sword-fighting with the other guy until he took enough damage to warrant backing up and he started shooting me with his blowgun. The one I got from his dead partner only had one shot left, so I shot him with it then threw it at him hitting him in the sternum. As he stood there vomitting from the poison, I noticed his dead partner also had a compound bow and that I only had 1HP left thanks to the duel earlier. When he stopped puking he started shooting again, but I kept strafing and dodging his darts. I fired two, very panicked, hip-fired arrows at him. Both made contact. He died. I WON!\n\nCons:\n-If you don't know what your doing or if you just get a huge string of bad luck, you'll end up unprepared for the final fight.\n-If an opponent knows what they're doing or has a huge string of good luck, they'll show up to the final fight with a gun.\n-One of the current bugs is sometimes you can't swing your weapon or block incoming attacks. Although if you're me, none of that matters as long as your legs still work. RUN THE HECK OUTTA THERE!\n-The game's melee system is similar to that of Chivalry: Medieval Warfare. Although, it doesn't work as well (yet) and occasionally causes some frustrating melee battles, probably due to all the animations not being done.\n-Occasionaly there are game-ruining bugs: Five minutes left in a team game and I ran into an invisible player with a gun. Naturally, being a gamer, I suspected hacks, but after I was killed my partner said he could see the guy who killed me just fine.\n\n10/10: Would fight the Hollow Man again.","March 7","true","40.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As a fan of films like The Running Man, The Condemned, The Hunger Games.....even Logan's Run, this game made me think about all of those films and what I enjoy about them. Why? Because this game pits man against man in a game of death, It's set out as a game show, and only one can survive.\n\n\n- The Combat\n\nIt gets the job done and is pretty straight forward. You have attack, block and push. This is done in rock, paper, scissors fashion. While it is decent, I don't find it very thrilling or exciting and as a main part of the game, I hope this gets some love. To make this more enjoyable, for me, I would like to see aimed blocking and a few different attack directions so it feels more like a fight to the death rather than a snooze fest. It doesn't feel brutal or blood thirsty\n\n- The Map\n\nIt is a nice size and seems to work well with 16 players. You are not constantly fighting while trying to salvage scraps to create things you will need to survive. More often than not, you have room to breathe and take your time to plan. The environment consists of trees, shrubs, lakes, caves, buildings and bridges. It looks nice and seems well designed. The map closes in on the players at certain timed intervals to ensure the players must fight, and if this gets down to the final minutes, you will find yourself surrounded by toxic gas in the centre of the map with the remaining players.\n\n- Traps/Gadgets/Perks\n\nIt would take me too long to list them all, but you can have a lot of fun mixing up your perks to compliment your weapon or gadget of choice. For example, you might like using the blow pipe and using 'cripple insurance' perk. You might prefer to be able to craft things twice as fast....there's a perk for that. The point is, there should be a play style that you can come up with by using the tools available. Some better than others. You have the stealthy type. The tank type. The trap setting type. The archer....the list goes on.\n\n- The servers (EU)\n\nI have not had any issues with lag, latency or anything else. It has been consistently smooth for me. That said, I do have a very good connection and decent speed 160/16. I'm no internet technician, but that's what I have.\n\n- Performance\n\nThis runs perfect for me. Others on the forum have reported it does not run as great for them. I have not had a single frame skip, stutter, launching issue, crash to desk top or anything else.\n\nGTX 980 Ti\ni7 4790\n16 gigs\nWindows 10\n\n- The Dishonest Players\n\nThey exist. The dev team are apparently workng towards reducing these numbers. I can't confirm I have even met one yet, but there's plenty of reports on the forum regarding this issue. Being realistic, this is always going to be a problem for us all, in this game or the next.\n\n- Price\n\nI think the price is really cheap considering the amount of fun there is to be had. When an EA game comes out, and I think they have a good product, I always do a few giveaways. I have done 2 so far (first winner didn't claim and it rolled over) because even if the dev team jumped ship right now, the game is still very fun in it's current state and worth the price.","March 15","true","18.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Culling is just that, in all of its glory. The goal of the game is simple: craft, survive, and hunt. Use whatever you can find to kill others in horrible ways. The title adds an additional spin on this system however, in allowing you to call in care packages to help you out. Body armor, stimulants, and high powered weaponary  are a few of the things you can receive from these chests, and they can allow you to slaughter lesser armed foes easily. There's a catch with this however. A drone brings the supplies to you, and they can be seen and shot down by other players with bows and arrows. They also require a rather large amount of in game resources to call in. This brings up another interesting part of the game.\n\nCrafting is very prominant, and relies on the aforementioned supply resource. Using only rocks, sticks, and a nanomachine type material you can craft practically everything you need in the game. This may seem simple, but the reduction of the amount of things you need to look for greatly speeds up the game. Two rocks makes a knife, a knife and a stick makes a spear, two sticks makes a bandage, etc. Crafting low tech weapons, armor, and traps at the begining of the game is extremely important, so that you can transition into searching for gear around the map. A bow and arrow won't really help you when your up against a rifle or submachine gun.\n\nThe balance is surprisingly good. Gear appears in chests around the map. To open these however, you need a fairly ample supply of the nanomachine material. You can scavenge around the map to safely accrue this or, attempt to kill players to gather large amounts.  As a result, there's a risk reward system in place. More aggressive players can tech up faster, but risk dying much more quickly. Scavengers have a less chance of dying, but can fall behind rather quickly. But if you're down and out with nothing but your bare hands, you're not instantly dead. A single hit with a melee weapon can disarm a player using a ranged weapon. If you play your cards right, you can catch that guy with his automatic weapon off guard and take it off his hands. There is also a final method for obtaining gear, but it involves moving to the center of the map where supplies are dropped, which needless to say, is dangerous.\n\nTo add another level of depth to the game, you can customize you characters with 3 perks. Theres a rather large selection at the moment, probably in the range of  40-60. You can increase various stats or profiencies, and even start out with certain gear. Do you want to be a berserker type character, that starts out with armor, high amounts of stamina, and the ability to regenerate health? What about a marksmen, with heightened ranged damage and speed? What about a deadly trapmaster, who can carry extra materials and build improved hazards that impede and harm the enemy? Theres a large variety of perks you can choose, and it really adds to the game in that many players behave differently.\n\nThe game has a few tutorials to help you get started, and beyond that you can play a match or two with bots to get your feet wet. Having only played two hours, I have a fairly good idea of what I need to do, if thats to give you any indication.\n\n--------The Good--------\n+Simple but effective crafting system\n+An oddly appropriate ambience, think Clap Trap from borderlands being the sportscaster\n+Fairly decent gameplay balance\n+Allows for a large variety of play styles\n+Very affordable price\n\n\n\n--------The Bad--------\n\n-Optimization issues. Playable, but not as good as it should be.\n-As far as I can tell, only a single, albeit large, map to play on\n-Melee could use a bit more oomph. Currently only Hit, Strong hit, block, and shove\n-No all chat as of right now. Not even the ability to speak locally with those around you. Team and spectator chat is available however. Whether this is appropriate or not is up to you. It could be seen as a plus or a minus based on how you look at it.","March 4","true","93.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is your game.\nHuge focus on melee combat instead of ranged, guns are EXTREMELY rare and there's even a team mode where you can que together with a friend and fight as a team against other teams. The map is small, which I love. But not 'too' small for 16 players, and each match takes around 20 minutes. Because of that, you run into people fairly often. Even if you find something valuable and get killed, it won't be like you lost a bunch of time.\n\nThat being said, it's very obviously an early access game. Melee combat is clunky. Very clunky. If you make it to the last few, odds are most of them have bows and some pretty dangerous weapons. But there are good times to be had for the price.\n\nOh, and two sticks makes a bandage.

As soon as i start walking around someone shouts some gibberish about somebody getting absolutely wreck'd with a knife, i panic. Im running as fast as i can picking stuff from the ground including sticks and rocks and i managed to put two rocks together so hard it transformed to a knife, i was amazed. Still running and there it is, my first encounter with an opponent, he was crafting something and i was smart enought to pick sneaky perk for my first run, i was so near that i could see what hes making and oh boy there was a knife on the ground and stick in hes hand, i was ready to spill some blood. I managed to beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of him, there was loot including a pipe and a bow and some weird stims and i tought well why not use all the stims since i cant hold all these glorious items i managed to hoard, once again i was running with the power of various stims and then the ♥♥♥♥ hit the fan, explosion broke my legs and framerate for a moment and oh boy im in panic running all around bleeding all around, as soon as i realized what actually happened and started patching myself up for some more torture, i died. i died from an impact of an stone.....\n\nThat was the first bite in this game and it was deeeeep and the game had me so in it for a while, it amazed me since theres an early acces tag on it.\n\nCurrently for me there is only a few "problems" that annoy me and im going to list them here:\n- on european servers ping is at all times over 70 but under 120.\n- im having and slight performance problems with shadows enabled at close combat.\n- mouse acceleration cant be turned off at the moment but you can at least turn smoothing off.\n- and the god damn F.U.N.C is sometimes up in the tree and i end up running around it since i hear it until i see it.\n- some animations are still a bit funny but cmon its still early acces, i can forgive that.\n\nNow the good stuff i like:\n- ive experinced just 2 crashes and 1 of them was my own fault for fiddling with things is should not fiddle with.\n- i have not encountered any game breaking bugs so far.\n- overall performance is great with my current setup.\n- the game is everytime the same but at all times different and it keeps dragging me back into it.\n- holy balls this is fun with a friend!\n- at the beginning i was confused with the inventory system and crafting but i learned to love it suddenly after a while.\n- its 1st person view locked.\n- tutorial was actually really helpful tought i went in without the tutorial first 3 times just to get the raw picture.\n\nAt this very moment i do recommend this game.\n5/5 would push stones together so hard that it becomes a knife again.\n\n30.3.2016\nAfter the latest update im even more recommending this game!!\n\n5/5\n\n2.4.2016\n110h logged\nDevs please stop listening people and make it the way you want it to be.\n\n4/5","March 12","true","122.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I looked forward to the adventures we'd have on the island.\n\nWe started off crafting and picking up loot as we travelled through the terrains and as if by magic we were soon stacked with some wonderful tools. He sported the bow and arrow whereas I chose the classic spear. After a few minutes of walking we face our first enemies whom were already in combat with another pairing. My new found friend and I hold back until one of the pairs had been murdered. Finally our chance came; we charged forth, arrows blazing. We took down the already wounded with ease and picked up some great loot. I got myself a rifle and a sword and my compatriot grabbed himself a brand spanking new recurve bow. Our journey then continued.\n\nAs we continued walking through the depths of the forest we stumbled across a building. I go ahead to search it through and through but I was stopped in my tracks by some sort of explosive bringing me down to a frightening 1HP. However my good pal seemed to be very clued up in medical sciences as he began to craft bandages out of sticks (I know, crazy right?) I was soon patched up and we began trekking towards the maps centre.\n\nBy now there were only 5 left, us, another pair and one lone survivor who'd already lost his partner in crime. We reached the centre, I activated the kill switch and we waited for the fun to begin. However the wait didn't last long as the first pairing came through the brush clearly up for a fight. My trusty partner fended them off with his bow as I went to craft some ammunition for my rifle. I was back just in time as our rival pair had moved up and began engaging in close quarter combat with my buddy. I rushed in firing my only four shots at one of the attackers, filling him with lead, killing him outright. The last of the pair was easy pickings and he was down quickly.\n\nNow it was just the one lonesome survivor and us. We had to win, surely. I was still bleeding from our rival’s offensive bringing me down to 1HP again. My partner on the other hand was on half health so I believed we could still win this. All of a sudden in the corner of my eye I saw someone run up the ramp next to me. He wasn't highlighted so I knew it wasn't my partner and incredibly he hadn't noticed me. I wielded my sword, snuck up behind and killed him in one swipe... "Nice work genius you just killed your partner" rang out from the announcer’s mouth. As I realised what I had just done an arrow from the bow of our final enemy strikes me in the head killing me instantly. I was flabbergasted; words couldn't describe the disappointment I had brought upon myself. I proceeded to turn my PC off and go for a lonesome walk reflecting on my actions.\n\nR.I.P Partner, gone but never forgotten (I'm really sorry!)","March 7","true","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
