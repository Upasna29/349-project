Run's smoothly, community based game where the developer actually listen and adds suggestions the community talk about.\n\nCustom Moose Skins made by the community is such an amazing feature! #GreatGame #WorthIt\n\nI've supported the developer all the way till now and I will continue to do so, I am happy this has been released on steam as you too will be able to witness the greatest I am witnessing! <3","March 2","true","13.7"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

SO DON'T PRESS IT !!!!\n- One specific log on the island has physics problems and goes half underground.\n- Pressing S while cutting trees will make you stop cutting them, even tho you don't move at all.","March 4","true","3.7"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","11","16","2","1"

Really cool to play with friends. There is a lot of possibility for map making. You can build a racing or platform track to compete agaisnt your friends. The developer is actually listening the players too and it's amazing. I hope you will add more game mode.","April 1","true","7.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I am a left handed player and can not wait for keybindings options but there is a lot of great things about this game.... make your own parkour track or a dirty junior kickstart track (for the old skool lads) but lots to do. I even have my own face loaded up on the game adding a great touch....

So freaking funny. Nothing else matters, I haven't eaten in a weeks. My girlfriend left me yesterday..but it's worth it! The strongest point of this game is that you can test your level even if you friends is building it. There is no limit on the map size. I really like the funny atmosphere. Go talk to Suspicious Moose and he will give you the tools to edit the map. You can use your own custom skin in-game (Mine was my friend's head).\n\nAbsolutely recommended!\n1000 / 10 IGN","March 31","true","2.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

Wasn't worth the money at all. Maybe this game will go somewhere eventually, and I hope so, but right now there's really no instruction on what to do and seems pretty pointless. And I don't mean pointless as in you just do random stuff. I mean as in literally there seems to be nothing to do. I would not recommend spending money on it at this point.","March 30","false","0.4"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","3"
