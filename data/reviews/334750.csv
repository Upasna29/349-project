The brightest spots were that you start off as a small farm, with minimal buildings that you can upgrade.  For example, you cannot start off storing just all the grain you want of any type, you start off with wheat storage, and have to build bins for the rest and can upgrade them to hold more capacity.  The rest of the buildings work in a similar fashion.\n\nThe other biggest selling point is you start off as a novice farmer with poor skills.  There is a category for just about everything, and as you perform each skill, such as harvesting, you become better at harvesting making your combine perform with less grain loss.  You get similar bonuses for each other category.\n\nFarm Expert has a few other minor improvements over Farming Simulator.  It feels like a bit more of a simulation.  It actually shows you climbing up your tractor instead of magically appearing inside it as you do with Farming Simulator.  In Farm Expert, you also cannot jump out of your tractor when it is moving.  There are other little things too, like you actually have to go to a store to buy seed/fertilizer for your farm storage instead of always having an endless supply at your farm.  Also, in Farm Expert you can actually miss the wagon and dump your entire combine load on the ground.  Farming Simulator 15 will not let you make this mistake.  Another nice feature is when plowing, it actually shows furrows in the field, and you can actually plow with a wheel in the furrow and it tilts the tractor at an angle as it would in real life.  It also has realistic detection for the ground you are working in a field.  In Farm Simulator, even if you drive in a crazy curvy circle around the field, the ground you work shows up behind you in either a straight line across the field, perpendicular, or a 45 degree angle in between.  With Farm Expert, it actually shows the curves while working the ground and that made me giddy.\n\nAt this point, it actually sounds like an amazing game, and it would be, but then you start to notice the problems.  Like when I go to put down my cultivator at the main farm on the concrete pad, as I lower it before detaching, I see the blades disappear under the concrete.  Then I look over at my plow, and it is also slightly sitting below the concrete.  There are some other physics problems too.  Like when I parked my tractor at the edge of the field while harvest, parallel to the field, it slid sideways very slowly and ended up in the middle of the field by the time I was done harvesting.  There was barely any slope at all to the field.  I actually thought it was flat until this started to happen and then I noticed the slight grade.\n\nIt is more than just that mistake too.  While plowing slightly downhill, if you stop with the plow still in the ground, the tractor still rolls forward at a noticeable speed.  This is very troubling because in real life, it would have to be a very, very steep slope for this to happen, probably something like a black or double black diamond ski slope.  Maybe even steeper.  It does this for all equipment, not just a plow.  There is something very wrong with the physics engine in this game.\n\nAnother minus for this game is the lack of major equipment brands, but this might not bother you so much.  They do have some minor brands, but for some, like the base combine you can buy, it is generic green with no brand name on it at all.  I was so happy about the other features of this game that I overlooked this aspect of the game until other problems started to show.\n\nOverall, it is a good game, and if they continue to make improvements and possible fix the physics, it would be an amazing game.  However Farming Simulator 15 is already a better game, and without the wonderful community of mod support that Farming Simulator 15 has, I just cannot recommend Farm Expert 2016.\n","July 31, 2015","false","21.2"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","22","24","3","3"

You may find a years work will do little more than cover the interest on your loan.\n\nSo after all that why do I give the game a reccomendation? Once again we see a game that has the potential to be real competition to the only farm sim game out there worth playing.If the developers add the needed tool tips etc. and actually care enough to work out the many many bugs and as they have stated they would,add modding support, this game might also break the type of simulator sales records held by Farm Simulator 2015 and ETS 2.\n\nIf however the support dries up yet again ,then this possibly great game will find it's way to the bargain bins reserved for shovelware simulators and THAT would be a real shame.","July 16, 2015","true","62.6"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","24","33","0","1"

I just play farming games when I am bored, and this game has entertained me. I can list the few things that annoyed me in the game:\n\n- Screen flashes after the entering/exiting a vehicle animation.\n- The graphics are a bit sharp, and can be a bit uncomfortable (had no other way of explaining it).\n- After exiting a vehicle, you suddendly active superpowers that allows you to push every vehicle for several metres.\n- Low framerate, but I do not really notice it in this game. To be honest, you could play this game in 30fps without trouble.\n- A few glitches that are less annoying, because they do not affect gameplay (too much)\n\nThat was it. I would also like to include what makes this game good:\n\n- The groundwork. Plowing has been made awesome.\n- Rear cam in every vehicle. This is awesome even though I play in third person.\n- Lost of activities, like fruit harvesting.\n- Exciting music.\n- Fruit harvesting.\n- Improved a lot since the previous game (same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ engine though).\n- More animals, even though they just make the game lag.\n- You have to go to a store to buy wheat, and come back when you are empty.\n- The lvl and repairing stuff. I like that.\n\nMy conclusion is: The game is not quite finished yet, and it still needs a lot of work. It has some better bits than Farming Simulator, and some worse. It is definitely not worth the cash, but if you have some money that you don't know what to use for, and you enjoy farming simulators, I would go for it. It's very glitchy, but it does not affect gameplay too much. I wouldn't say that the game is better than Farming Simulator, but it has some better parts. Thanks for reading, and remember:\n\nIf you aren't able to play the game because it won't start or your pc is too weak, don't post a negative review. That is like posting a negative review of a book that you are unable to read.

Yeah it isn't Farming Simulator 15 so what?\n\nYes it has quite the Pro Farming 2014 feel to it but it still has more stuff added that makes it worth it. For example, the whole fruit farming and the DLCs. It is something extra to keep you busy and give the farming feel to it.\n\nThe negative side however, is that it still needs more work to make it better.It has the potential to be an amazing farming game.\n\nAll in all, it really isn't THAT bad of a game! Don't always take the negative reviews as a done deal. Give the game a try, you can always get a refund.\n\nAlso, One of the Devs is actually interacting with us in the community and have reassured us of ongoing support and free DLCs now and then.  They take notice and give feedback. So before you jump on the ''I want my money back!'' bandwagon, make sure you actually take the time to check it out and not just review  after 5 minutes of playing the game.\nAnd as a female gamer with family history of farming, this is fun! No it aint the real deal or it isn't that accurate, it still gives the farming aspect and it can keep you busy.\n\nDefinitely recommend checking it out.","June 25, 2015","true","32.9"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","16","25","2","3"

Very... but not identical. Feels more developed, but that said, this needs more lovin' from the Devs.  I bought it because I'm desparate for an alternative to Farming Simulator's repetitive cycle of shiny, cleanly built, solidly-performing anual copy of Farming Simulator 1.  Something with a sense of player/farm progression (getting better at farming, building new structures that actually have a function, etc).  Something with at least a reasonable amount of physics...\n\nFarming Simulator is shiny, but flat. Its devs don't seem to want to try anything new, and I get really tired of paying $50 +DLC every year or two for essentially the same game with a slightly higher polygon count.\n\nFarm Expert has the things I'm looking for, but not the level of development and polish that FS's higher budget affords.  Bias out in the open- I WANT THIS GAME TO SUCCEED.  That said, performance is choppy at times, even on high-end hardware. The physics feel like the devs had higher hopes than funding (or higher profiteering?) Still...\n\nGiven an under-developed game abandoned(?) to the market before its proper time, or a shinier farming game that suffers from KSP-like syndrome of needing dozens of mods to make it what it should be...I'll stick with FE2016 for a while. It's cheaper.","October 3, 2015","true","7.5"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","1"

I was one of the first to jump on the band wagon and get this on the initial release, only to find a game that wasn't even half completed, and with no documentation to explain how things are supposed to work.\n\nTo the developers credit, they had/have tremendous potential for a blockbuster in this game, if only they'd complete it.  Sadly, I gave up on it after a few months of it's release last year, and simply watched the forums to see if they were improving it.\n\nThey're not.  I can only conclude that this is now 'abandonware'.  I cannot recommend this title.","April 23","false","69.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
