"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Saleck/recommended/6910/","Saleck","Saleck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Saleck/","650 products in account","In 1997, John Romero of Ion Storm Dallas approached the producer of System Shock, Warren Spector, said "Make the game of your dreams. No limits" and the end result was the creation of Ion Storm Austin and their first game; Deus Ex.\n\nDeus Ex is a First-Person Shooter/Role Playing Game with a heavy emphasis on stealth and thinking carefully about your surroundings. The game provides you, from start to finish, with a number of ways to solve every single problem put in front of you. The level design is open ended enough for any method of completion.\n\nThe game is inspired by Looking Glass Studio's System Shock and Thief and as a result, the freedom you have to approach and complete your objectives is simply staggering. You are given a huge world to explore, some tools you might want to use to complete your objectives and let loose upon your environment. Careful exploration is needed to uncover all of the hidden gadgets, secret tunnels and small story elements.\n\nThe only time you will ever receive a Game Over is if you die. There are no penalties for doing things your way and the game dynamically changes as you play. People in the game may think differently of you if you don't do what they expect of you and may effect certain things as you progress through the story.\n\nSpeaking of Story, the story of Deus Ex is one of a heavily political and conspiratorial nature. You play as JC Denton, an agent on his first day with the UNATCO, an organization that deals with the growing rise of foreign and domestic terrorism in the early 21st century. It does not take long however for JC to discover that he is merely a pawn in a huge political game that leans far beyond his own understanding.\n\nHe will have to travel far and wide to gather the help he needs from unsuspecting allies. Hong Kong, Paris, New York City and various US locations will be visited, all of which have a fitting Tech-noir feel and stellar music to match. One listen of the music for Hong Kong and you'll never forget it.\n\nBeing an Role-Playing Game as well as a shooter, Deus Ex allows you to customize your character to your preference. The game features a skill system that will allow you to improve JC in a number of fields. Like big guns? Master the Heavy Weapons skill and go in with the GEP Gun blowing people and locked doors to bits. Want to silently infiltrate every location with skill and precision? Master Computers and Lockpicking to open doors, hack security machines, ATM machines for money (if you don't find any bank account details lying around) and read e-mails for clues about the environment you're in.\n\nAnother notable part of Deus Ex are its unforgettable characters. Every major character in the game has a well rounded personality with their own expectations of you. What you do in the world or tell them can affect how they treat you which might be crucial in your immediate future.\n\nThere are boss battles in the game but some may be avoided entirely by learning information from other characters. If you do walk into a boss fight, you even have the choice of running right out the door behind them and not bother engaging them at all! When was the last time a game let you do that? Things might even happen to that character later on if you don't fight them.\n\nWith all the above praise, Deus Ex is not without its small faults however. Some of the levels are huge and empty of detail, forcing long walks if you want to get anywhere specific in a short amount of time. The large empty levels also make the game feel a little devoid of life in some places. A lot of areas that look as if they should be full of people, are completely empty except for maybe two or three characters at once.\n\nWith every conspiracy theory under the sun under the microscope in Deus Ex, you must learn to question everything and trust no one.  You may even find that things that this game was talking about in the Year 2000 are happening right now or have a very real possibility to happen at some point during our lifetimes; wealth and the increasing gap between the rich and the poor across the globe, omnipresent electronic surveillance, technical augmentations that can enhance the human race beyond what nature intended and much more.\n\nIt's a roller-coaster ride of a game that everyone simply has to play to experience at least once. Your favourite game was probably inspired by this piece of art so do yourself a favour, set next weekend aside and play this game already. You will never leave the house without your tin-foil hat again!","March 4, 2014","true","61.7"," 333 of 362 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","333","362","3","15"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cxero/recommended/6910/","cxero","Cxero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cxero/","76 products in account","FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, INSTALL A MAP PATCH BEFORE YOU PLAY THE GAME! The GOTY Edition has older editions of the maps due to an archiving error at Ion Storm. There is an unofficial patch to restore the maps to the correct versions which fixes many things. Without it, many pathways are missing, bugs unfixed, and an entire ending looks like crap.\nhttp://www.dxm.be/navigator.php5?lang=en&content=202\n\nDeus Ex was a pioneer in the action RPG genre. It manages to tell a great story without ever forcing the story in the way of gameplay. There's a few unoficial patches that let you run this game better on modern PC's. There's a lot of good mods for this game, which is really good.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nDeus Ex's gameplay has aged a bit, although it's still very fun. Most notably, the game has a level of interactivity that has rarely been reached even by modern titles. The game isn't very linear, it more or less just nudges you in the right direction. The first few missions are kind of slow, so don't quit before you complete them. Pretty much all of the maps are large and expansive and have tons of items, enemies, and unique NPC's scattered around. There's a huge level of interactivity in the game world, which was a big selling point when this game came out. You have a variety of skills in the game that you can upgrade. You gain skill points by completing objectives or discovering hidden areas. You can also get "augmentations" to give your character new and unique abilities. Some people say that the shooting gameplay has aged - if that applies to you, update your weapon skills. It makes a huge difference.\n(You may want to install Shifter or Biomod to improve the gameplay, although I prefer the original.)\n\nPRESENTATION:\nThe graphics weren't paticularly amazing for the time (they weren't bad, either), but it manages to use what they had to create a wonderful atmosphere. They depict many run-down decrepit buildings littered with homeless, sick people to show a country on the edge of collapse. The music is great and really adds to the atmosphere. Every location has it's own unique soundtrack that fits great and adapts to what you are currently doing. This game has full voice acting along with tons of unique characters, so the voice acting quality will vary. All main characters will have at least decent voice acting.\n(If you want to augment your graphics even further, install the D3D10 renderer and New Vision)\n\nSTORY: (Don't worry, I'm not spoiling anything):\nDeus Ex takes place in a cyberpunk vision of the world where high-tech prosthetics and transhuman augmentations are commonplace. You are introduced to a memorable cast of characters. A great thing they do with their characters is that they take care in reminding you that they are still human beings and not just targets or objectives. It's all about uncovering ancient secrets and it's pretty cool in this aspect.\n\nIts story was great for the time - and even today it is rarely equaled in the philosophical depth it has. The gameplay was revolutionary, blending shooting and RPG elements. In summary, I'd definitely recommend this - it's a truly classic game.","November 16, 2014","true","131.7"," 106 of 109 people (97%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","97","106","109","4","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/suparockr/recommended/6910/","suparockr","Suparockr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/suparockr/","195 products in account","This game is like a box of your favorite cereal: you might have accidentally left it open in the cabinet and forgot about it for  a couple of weeks, but after you pour another bowl of it, it still tastes great.\n\nI say that because this game is outdated, cripplingly so in certain regards.  The enemy guard AI has a field of view that can be equated to holding two paper towel rolls up to your eyes.  If they spot you, you can trolley out of sight, and they won't come investigate.  The AI doesn't noticeably improve as you progress further into the game (it's especially jarring because the guards you come across look like menacing and dangerous, but it's like they forgot their prescription glasses at home), and instead the game relies on subsidizing the amount of cheese tactics you can perform (by the end of the game, some of the enemies can only be taken out by a soft spot on their back using the cattle prod).  The controls are beyond archaic, and I don't think they even made sense back when they were conceived in 1999 (you use the + button on the number pad to quicksave).  The resolution does not appear to surpass 480p without getting yourself one of the many mods this game has to make it playable in the days of DirectX12.  The general quality of the game (from a presentation perspective) is so bad it's legendary.\n\nHow's the actual meat of the game?  Well, the story is serviceable.  It's beautifuly timeless due to its themes of how far are we willing to give the government control over our lives to protect us from terrorism, and whether or not the government might get carried away in abusing their power.  This game was released before 9/11 and world paranoid about terrorism, but not so early before that society was wildly different.  There really isn't a lot of character development; a character starts and ends the game acting similarly (you could argue the protagonist, JC Denton, gets development, but he could act wildly depending on your actions).  With that said, the people you meet along the journey become good guys or bad guys solely depending on your opinion of them (for example, is Paul Denton justified in wanting to treat being a UNATCO agent like a day on the police force, or is he just being a blind hippy by not wanting to kill some ♥♥♥♥ing ragheads (or this game's French equivalent, the NSF).\n\nGameplay wise, the primitive AI doesn't really lend itself to any tense gameplay you might see in other stealth games like the Arkham games, Metal Gear Solid, or successors like Dishonored.  The stealth approach is just as valid as the loud approach, and it's not impossible to adjust depending on your supply reserves (save your cattle prods, kids).  You get skill points by doing objectives.  They improve your general skills (though they're not impossible to use without the said skills).  Don't put skill points in Swimming.  This game carves out its niche with its use of the nano augmentations.  As you progress through the story, you'll get the choice to augment yourself by choosing one of the two options you're given (e.g. you can choose to augment your feet to move quicker, or to move quietly).\n\nThe game really shines through with its level designs.  If you dedicate the time to explore the levels, you start to realize that there is no one way to approach a situation, and there are areas you could easily miss which houses a ton of augment upgrades, supplies, or even some weapon modifications.  You might want to invade a park through the front door, being caught immediately and blasted down, or you could survey the park, and find a back door that's loosely guarded, and housing your true objective much sooner.  Which objective is best?  Well, you get to your target either way, and that's all that matters.  The first path to the objective might not be the best route for you if you want to want to pick people off, but somebody who wants to toss a tear gas grenade in and then take down the group would already be stroking their boner at the opportunity.\n\nThis is why I recommend Deus Ex.  Nonlinear stealth is tough to pull of meaningfully (looking at you Metal Gear Solid V).  This game blends together talking with civilians to learn how to get your best edge, to watching your step so that you don't get caught by the bad guys.  You can try to bypass an electronic grid by using a multitool, or by just looking for a route to bypass the grid.  It's a game where the only reason your choice matters is for what you had to do to do it.\n\nFinal Words: "A bomb's a bad choice for close-range combat."","September 29, 2015","true","72.9"," 100 of 111 people (90%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","90","100","111","18","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheHamma/recommended/6910/","TheHamma","Hammer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheHamma/","267 products in account","First of all, don't let the Steam game hours fool you. I am a 6 year veteran of the multiplayer of this game, and have completed (and replayed without completing) the single player multiple times. It was in early 2000 (2001-2002? Maybe later?) that I began playing this game. We had a 'Sold Out' retail copy of the game, it was rare to find the game elsewhere. I had multiple go's at the single player, somehow managed to complete it in my youth with the help of my father, and got curious about the multiplayer feature... in fact that was the most memorable thing for me, and I'm sure many people have already reviewed the story of the game, so instead I will share my long time multiplayer experiences with the game. Maybe someone will actually read through it and consider trying to host servers for this game, or bring friends in to start another population, who knows? Maybe even one of my many forgotten friends from Deus Ex back in the day will see this and remember me.\n\n\nI don't remember what player name I used starting out, I frankly don't think I even used a custom name... I just went under the many "player" variations. (Player5483, etc. It randomizes IIRC) Of course, I wasn't a good player, being a slow typer, younger with less reflexes (I had to be like, 5-6 years old or a little older at the time.) I was there to experience GODZ, Deja Vu's attacks on 0 aug servers, the move to MTL and Nepthy's (or whatever its name was)... everything. It wasn't until I went on Nobody's (That was his name) maps, an edit of Silo with a Stargate type of mutator active (I had no understanding of UnrealScript or mutators/mods in my younger age), that I got an actual username.\n\n\nThere was a bar after teleporting, in which a Bartender NPC (said nothing, performed no functions) resided, standing still and blank. I decided that to better suit the atmosphere that I would bartend... getting my official username "Bartender". In that time I had played many modded servers for the pure sake of fun instead of competition, was even involved in a machinima recording with a great friend of mine back then, who I no longer have contact with. That same friend eventually got involved with a clan named DXC (Deus Ex Council, I think it was?), and I wanted to be a part of it with him. It was then that he said that they're looking for people who are "good" at the game. It frustrated me at the time, that he said I was not good enough to be in the same clan as he was. At the same time, that was what drove me to compete and practice, to eventually surpass him.\n\n\n\nAfter he had turned me away from the DXC thing, I joined up with RTK, otherwise known as Ready To Kill, a 0 augs (augmentation) clan focused on competition. It was there that I made many friends (Karkian, Maverick/Mustang, Killing Machine, Jima, and others), who taught me the tricks of 0 augs combat, being the tricks of movement to throw off the hitboxes, where to aim with an assault rifle/shotgun, leading and predicting player movement with a sniper rifle, and most of all... it gave me my headstart in to gaming. I've had good and bad days, I've went off on people who just clearly outclassed me that day, I've pulled off feats that people accused me of "hax" purely because I worked hard to develop that reflex/skill. I've seen players like Clix who just clearly dominate 0 augs who I could only wish that I'd be able to hold my own against. I've seen the mappers and modders make both fun maps and great fighting maps, which amazed me as a kid growing up... practicing my skills in this game for quite a few years.\n\n\nI did end up beating my close friend on most occurrances of him fighting me, he had left DXC by that time and made his own clan. I had been promoted multiple times for showings of skill, and it was a wild ride in the multiplayer world of Deus Ex for both of us. It was around 2005 family issues arrived (parents got divorced, was not doing well in elementary school due to issues back then... somewhat involving this game heheh), and I was not able to play as often. I had dropped out without much of a goodbye, got addicted to Runescape later, and dropped back in around 2008 just to find out that my favorite clan was dropping out of Deus Ex, and I couldn't find my friend anymore. It was then that I gave up Deus Ex, because the disc was undergoing major wear and tear, and the game had taken its toll on me in immense rage having warped my mind (I practiced on that game a LOT, and as a kid I had not developed the anger management skills to understand a loss in a videogame doesn't equate to any real life value loss).\n\n\n\nIt is now 2014, the Gamespy servers for this game are shut down, effectively putting the final nail in Deus Ex's coffin, which was already becoming a dish only served cold. There are those among what remains of the Deus Ex Multiplayer (DXMP) community that are trying to host master servers to replace Gamespy, so that servers can be hosted once again. Do I think Deus Ex's multiplayer could return strong today? I don't know what to think, most people had started leaving Deus Ex after 2005... and all the servers on the master servers I've tried are empty. The good servers with interesting mutators/maps, whether RPG, botkilling or 0 augs/full augs... are gone. I'm afraid that DXMP is forever dead... and may it rest in peace as the biggest influence in my young gaming days. I only regret that now I have the technical interest to learn how to mod with UnrealScript and the unreal engine for Deus Ex and other games, to be too late to contribute anything before it croaked.\n\n\n\nIn a nutshell, that's my 5-6 years history with this game in its multiplayer form, but since Gamespy's shut down its servers, multiplayer probably won't matter to all but the persistent. So, what about the single player? The single player back then was very good, it was a system in FPS that was new and different from how FPS's worked at the time. Now? I think people can still get something interesting from it, even in its age... but you might want to get some mods to tweak the graphics. I couldn't play Deus Ex any other way than how it was made to be honest, but some people can't stand looking at low poly counts. The story is cliche, but how it is all executed... I felt involved in something bigger than I could imagine, and I found that exciting. I don't know how active the modding community is, but I have heard of singleplayer big name mods coming out for this game... and I feel you should give this game a try if you like single player. I hope that one day multiplayer will make a comeback, but I think that it has finally ran its course.","September 16, 2014","true","48.2"," 106 of 121 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","106","121","5","0"

Use lockpicks to open a door or find a key for it, look for computer login info or use your computer skills to hack it, find acces codes for door keypads or use multitools to disable them, jump on your enemies and slaughter them the way you like it, or look for alternative ways, tunnels, air ventilation systems, etc, and avoid unnecessary kills. It's very rewarding also. A lot of augumentations to choose from, a big variety of weapons, ammo, tools, enemies, locations, etc, which will increasingly keep you interested in going through this cyberpunk conspiracy story.\n\nProclaim yourself God, be part of The Illuminati, or plunge the world into another Dark Age. The choice is yours.","July 16, 2014","true","62.4"," 114 of 136 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","114","136","0","4"

Here's a review from someone who's NEVER played the game before a week ago, and I have to say it's still worthy of all the praise it gets from the long-time fans around here.\n\nIn short:\nGood\n+ Biggest plus is the story, still relevant maybe even more so today.\n+ Took me over 30 hours to beat on Normal difficulty and only 1 ending.\n+ Gameplay. Surpringly smooth platforming and stealth mechanics. Feels good to change playstyles.\n+ Best level design in a single player FPS I might have ever seen. Lots of places to explore and secrets to find for an FPS, even by todays standard.\n+ Figuring out certain problems actually requires you to use your brain instead of quest arrows pointing the way you have to go and telling you exactly what you have to do.\n+ Completing objectives the way you want to feels AWESOME. You really feel satisfied after completing a mission.\n+ Even though the graphics have aged, the voice-acting and sound-effects are still great! (explosions are LOUD) A bit quirky and stereotypical at times, but still endearing and engaging. It really grew on me after a while.\n\nNot-So-Good:\n- Controls might be too complex if you're not used to old single player games with lots of buttons and menus. I got used to it though.\n- Certain sections might be frustrating. Be prepared to die a lot to find out exactly what to do or what path to take for optimal survival.\n- The graphics haven't aged great and you need to get used to it before you start to see all the details like what grates you can or can't open, which buttons to push etc. etc.\n- Personally not a fan of some of the RPG-elements. You shoot guns as if you're drunk with parkinsons in the early game.\n- You might want to play through it in one go because of the crazy storyline, but the game is LONG so you're forced to take your time with this game. Might actually be a good thing though! Expect it to be far easier after your first playthrough though.\n\nSo basically Deus Ex is a fantastic game for any one who enjoys single-player, story-driven games and can overlook some of the elements that haven't aged well. There is enough action for any FPS lover so I recommend it to any one who has enjoyed games like Half-Life 2 or the more recent Fallout games. So put this game on your wishlist and buy it ASAP! This truly is one of the classics every video game fanatic should have played at least once!","January 17, 2015","true","57.0"," 62 of 64 people (97%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","97","62","64","4","0"

Nearly every aspect of this game has aged very well. The plot is engaging and intelligent. The gameplay allows you to approach nearly any situation in nearly any way you wish and the levels are so damn big and well designed that you will often find all sorts of alternate ways to do things each time you play.\n\nFor that matter there are so many little things and side missions you can find in the game that it is almost always worth exploring everywhere that you can. Not to mention that the game WILL reward you for exploring.\n\nBuilding a character is so much fun and there are so many things that you can specialize in and it will change the way you play the game in very significant ways.\n\nThe story is very malleable and you can pretty much do anything you want and rather then giving you a "MISSION FAILED" thing when you kill a story important character the game will mold to your actions.\n\nThe Music is awesome and really captures the atmosphere of the game.\n\nPretty much the only two things I could imagine somebody objecting to would be the graphics and voice acting. Which sure, I mean the graphics ARE pretty ugly but if such an old game having bad graphics bothers you so much then you can easily download some graphics mods to make the game much more paletable for you. (As a side note this game has a pretty decent modding community you should check out.)\n\nAnd while the voice acting can be pretty bad it (thankfully) is the funny kind of bad so you shouldnt be bothered too much by it.","November 9, 2014","true","59.4"," 69 of 78 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","69","78","0","0"

I've then gone on to purchase the game maybe 3-4 times.\n\nCompleted the game so many times with every ending possible and I even have the soundtrack to the game on my phone. I can't remember the last game ive actually wanted to complete recently let alone several times.\n\nThe story line is absolutely fantastic, something games developers just dont seem to spend time on these days *cough* Destiny *cough* ...but also, the sheer volume in detail, there are so many hidden extras...like the Majestic 12 base hidden in the sewers in NYC. Modern games would have shipped that as DLC and it took me 3-4 play throughs to discover it.\n\nOne of the first games to offer a non linear play through, it gave you options on different ways to storm a building and even tested your morality by giving you the choice to kill or spare.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrSirShpee/recommended/6910/","MrSirShpee","MrSirShpee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrSirShpee/","138 products in account","tl;dr Do yourself a favor and buy this game if you're even slightly interested. Absolutely incredible game. Timeless level design and story, GOAT imo\n\nOverview Deus Ex is a classic FPS/RPG from the year 2000, but it manages to offer more player choice and better level design than most games today. The story also manages to stay compelling and creates a sense of tension as you uncover a massive international conspiracy.\n\nGameplay\ntl;dr for gameplay: loads of choice and neat weapons plus the signature augmentation system, offers a lot of replayability even if the gunplay and melee are weak by modern standards\n\nDeus Ex plays like traditional stealth games from the late 90s with RPG and FPS elements. It has some odd controls that may take some getting used to for those of you more used to modern games, but keys are fully rebindable. Deus Ex offers a massive range of weapons and tools to help you through levels, from tranquilizer crossbows and 10mm pistols to sawed-off shotguns, snipers and an energy sword.\n\nIf you wish, you can finish the game without killing any enemies and silently strike from the shadows with your trusty baton or riot prod, or you may choose to assault your enemies with shotguns and rocket launchers. Deus Ex is all about choice.\n\nThe signature feature of Deus Ex is the Augmentation system. Throughout the game, you find canisters that, when installed with a medical bot, give you a choice of a new power. This may be an invisibility cloak, health regeneration, stronger melee attacks, ballistic protection, etc. These drain bioelectric power, which may be refilled with biocells or a repair bot. You can also find augmentation upgrade canisters that let you upgrade your existing augs (less energy consumption, new perks, etc).\n\nHealth is also an important system, as each body part has its own health bar. For example, if you lose all health on your legs, you lose your legs and crawl around until you heal them with a medkit or Regen aug. Lose all health in your chest or head, however, and you will die.\n\nDeus Ex also has a skilled system. Each major gameplay function has a skill associated with it that has four ranks (Untrained, Trained, Advanced, and Master). Each rank increases your proficiency in that area. You automatically start with Trained Pistol skill from the outset. Upgrading your skill in a weapon skill (Low-Tech, Pistols, Rifles, Heavy) increases your damage and accuracy with that weapon type with each rank you take and in the case of Heavy lets you move faster with said weapon equipped. Upgrading your Electronics or Lockpick skills decreases the number of multitools or lockpicks required to hack defense systems (cameras, laser grids) or open doors. Computer skill controls how much time you have to hack a computer terminal and access emails, security controls, etc. The list goes on and on.\n\nWeapon mods exist in Deus Ex, too. Silencers obviously make weapons quieter and more effective for stealth purposes, laser sights negate the need to line up a shot for max accuracy, scopes let you fire accurately from a distance, recoil and accuracy mods affect those traits respectively, clip mods add ammo to your magazine, etc. etc. etc. Beware of adding a scope and a laser sight to a weapon, however, because having a scope installed negates the laser sight's accuracy bonus for whatever reason. This does not apply to sniper rifles, however.\n\nAlmost every weapon has multiple ammo types. For example, the minicrossbow has lethal darts, tranquilizers, and flare darts. The assault rifle has an underbarrel grenade launcher, the shotguns have buckshot rounds for organic targets and Sabot rounds for armor-piercing (security bots, etc), and so on.\n\nAs far as actual combat goes, the gunplay and melee gameplay are very weak and unsatisfying overall thanks to iffy hitboxes and unsatisfying animations, but that's more of a limitation of the time the game was made at. Again, the combat is defined by augmentations and creative combinations.\n\nOverall, the gameplay holds up to modern standards in terms of creativity with items and the unique augmentation system, but the gunplay and melee combat is weak thanks to it being a very old game. Loads of choice and replayability offered by the augmentation system, weapons, and skills.\n\nStory\nFor a fifteen-year-old game, Deus Ex has an amazing globetrotting story revolving around conspiracies in a world ravaged by a plague. Deus Ex contains many exotic locations and memorable characters to assist you (or fight you) along the way. I would rather not spoil too much of the story or locations, but I will say that your choices do matter and some will come into play later in the game than you would expect. I don't know what else to say about it without spoiling, but it's a crazy story with plenty of twists and turns along the way.\n\nDesign\nI feel like Ion Storm got the 2050s cyberpunk aesthetic right. It mixes the current world at the time with their vision of the future. Plenty of neon lights, futuristic weapon designs and armor, hologram communications, etc. Even though this game is 15 years old, it manages to be immersive with its very natural-feeling level design. The excellent visual mods New Vision and HDTP also do wonders and I would highly recommend them.\n\nBut back to the level design; it's quite amazing how much work went into the levels. Each hub area or level is tailored for any playstyle you could have. They made it feasible to complete the game with perfect stealth and no kills, melee only, full-on combat, or just hacking security systems to mow down enemies with turrets at your disposal. This adds even more to the replayability, knowing that the game will never force you into any particular playstyle.\n\nConclusion\nAs someone who played Deus Ex for the first time this year and just finished it, I feel that Deus Ex is a masterpiece. It gets everything right where it counts, and its only real weakness in my opinion is the dated combat. The level design and player freedom combined with the story more than make up for it, though. I strongly believe today, as I write this, that Deus Ex is the best game ever made, hands down. I love Ocarina of Time, Half-Life 2, all the usual suspects, but this is really a special game that every RPG/stealth/FPS fan owes it to themself to play. I got it in the 2014 autumn sale for $1.74 USD, and it's absolutely incredible value. Even at the current full price of $6.99 it's well worth it.\n\nI'd rate Deus Ex a 10/10. Masterful, timeless game. The only thing that could make this game better would be a from the ground up remake with modern visuals, mechanics, etc. You owe it to yourself to play this game if you're even slightly interested in Deus Ex.","November 25, 2015","true","30.9"," 45 of 48 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","45","48","4","0"

The review of one of the best games i´ve ever had the chance to play, and personally, the summit of videogames.\n\n\nDeus Ex has a cyberpunk hue, which is a subgenre of SCI-FI in a near future (specifically in the 2052) such as Blade Runner, Matrix o The Sprawl Trilogy of William Gibson. Also is an acction videogame stapled with Rpg mechanics, adventure and Simulation.\n\n\nWith all these traits, Deus Ex gives you the chance of make profit of your own skills, there are a lot of ways to achieve your goal during a quest. Despite of the fact that there are 4 genres of videogames taking part in this game (rpg-fps-adventure-simulation) the gameplay is just hilarious, and all this because these 4 elements are so well coordinated that you get over the prejudice of having "gameplay issues due to the quantity of the genres", just attending the story and the characters.\n\nIn addition to this, as we accomplish goals we will be rewarded with "skill points", these are used to enhance our skills in different ways, moreover we can improve our weapons with a wide variety of "Weapon modifications".\n\n\nWe assume the role of Denton. J.C. Denton is an special agent under the orders of U.N.A.T.C.O. (United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition) with nanotech-augmentations. As we fathom into the world of Deus Ex, we will discover that the society has been splitted by the differences between "augmens" and people who cannot pay them, the illnesses and the expensive heals, and of course, between goverment and people. As the plot unfolds, JC will face organizations like Illuminati, Templars or Hong-Kong Tryads.\n\n\nAnd what about the OST? Well if they Succeeded with a 4stylegenres-mixture in the videogame...why not mix musical genres too? Its just amazing how this music complement the game with a gorgeous melody made with Techno, Jazz and Classical music. Just check it on your own here.\n\n\nPersonally, and as i said in the top of this review, for me this game is the Pinacle, the summit of videogames. I still playing this game, and yet i keep finding new resources to achieve my goals in the game, just amazing..\n\n\nAnd sorry if i made any mistake, i just woke up and i had to write this. :mortis:","June 11, 2014","true","45.3"," 101 of 141 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","101","141","0","0"

Deus Ex was a fantastic games from developers who were not that good at the time. It's a genre defining classic. Well okay, the graphics might not be the greatest, the gun play is really bad, and the AI really acts like blind maniacs. But the idea and concept of the game was truly uncomparible to any other game at the time. One of the greatest aspect of the game is the writing. Pretty alright voice actors and you can choose what kind of sentence you want to say to a person and that can affect the game. If you do something to character, like walk into the womens bathroom, they will remember that and will mention it and even my boss told me about it. The controls are extremely clunky for todays standards and there are also a crazy amount of keys. Not very user friendly for todays standards. If these controls came out in a game in this day and age, it would spark up some controversy with some.\n\nThe health was also like no other. You have health bars for your head, torso, left and right leg, and left and right arm. This can really affect your gameplay if you've damaged a part in your body. If you damaged you leg, you would start limping. Augmentations are also really interesting. You can get a augmentation for turing invisible! I wished that seriously every game had that ability. While I was playing, but you can't swap out these augmentations for other ones, so you have to be careful with what you are sure you are getting. Now lets talk about the soundtrack. The soundtrack is very well composed and the person who made the soundtrack also made songs for the Unreal series. Look, this game isn't for everyone. Some people will like this and some people not. When first playing the game, I found it one of the most confusing games that I've ever played and I didn't really enjoy it. Would I recommend this game today? Yes, if you arn't too bothered by the graphics. As for the sequel, NO! Never play it. It's as if the developers didn't know this game was going to be this great and they tried too hard to do the same thing again. I can't wait for Deus Ex: Mankind Devided. 10/10","July 31, 2015","true","26.4"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","23","28","3","0"

Whilst the game hasn't aged well visually, and the voice acting is terrible, the amount of freedom afforded to the player to make decisions is still impressive. The feeling of reactivity and decision on the player is quite exhilerating, especially as the game goes on and decisions have further reaching impact.\n\nThe opening can feel clumsy, but as you realise how immersive the level of reaction can be, and the opportunities you have to make meaningful decisions, the game really comes to life. The endings lack a little impact due to how they are presented, but the journey to making those decisions is worth the investment, the game is a true classic. It's a shame most games since have focused more on narrative and mechanics as separate elements, rather than blending decisions into meaningful influences on the game (as an aside, I think the closest to achieve this other than Deus Ex is Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines).\n\nWhilst Deus Ex: Human Revolution never lived up to the freedom and openness and impact that the original set in place, the two slot together beautfully lore-wise, so if you've played one and not the other, I'd highly recommend them both.","January 2, 2015","true","0.9"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","18","20","0","2"

I feel like I would have loved it more if I had played it back in 2000 instead of 2014. By now, I must view it as a retro-style game, and because of that I felt like I had to rush through this game in order to play the next two in the series.\n\nAll in all, the plot was a bit convoluted, but by no means bad. It was dark and gritty enough to keep me interested to see what happens in the end. However, the ending was a bit disappointing since I had expected a lot more movie/cinematics. That's what I get for applying 2014-standards to a 2000-game.\n\nI think to rate this game fairly, I should give it a 8/10 at least. The sheer number of ways to get through the levels alone can qualify the game for a GOTY status since it allows the player to try numerous methods to accomplish the goals.\n\nThe music was very good, surprisingly, and I think it definitely caught my attention so that I would feel more immersed in the cyberpunk environment of Deus Ex.\n\nOverall, I'd give the game a 8/10. I wish I could have enjoyed it more, but I found this gem of a game too late in my life, and I'm sorry that I missed out a little on how much fun it could have been.

As a person whose first Deus Ex game was Human Revolution (played in 2015, no less), the original game still managed to make me feel nostalgic. I even grew FOND of all those low resolution textures about halfway through the game.\n\nGame of the year, and for good reason. Where Deus Ex lacks in visuals, it provides in storytelling, character interaction, variety, the freedom of choice, loads of the unexpected, and a rad as hell soundtrack. Not to mention how thorough the developers were with filling in just about every single voice line and detail they could no matter what kind of tricks you tried to pull in the game. Simply amazing, and the very opposite of linear. Play through the game 10 times, you'll keep finding secrets and surprises.\n\nGet it. Play it.

That's really it. It's pretty easy to look past the flaws however and to see a game that is superb in (almost) every area.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/talgaby/recommended/6910/","talgaby","talgaby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/talgaby/","334 products in account","Short version: 93%Deus Ex is an old game, but still among the best cRPGs you can find. It offers a wide variety of options and choices, which are supported by a complex and conspiracy-heavy storyline keeping up your interest. Just don’t forget to get the community-created patches to make the engine compatible with modern video cards.\n\nLong version:The internet likes lists, especially if they want to collect the best of all times in a specific category. If you find one about the best cRPGs, you’ll more than likely see Deus Ex near the top of that lists, and for good reason.\n\nThe gameplay is all about freedom. Freedom in play style: you can take out your enemies in lethal and non-lethal ways (you can finish the whole game with only taking one life), or you can sneak past them using cover, or create a diversion (throw an object, hack security, or even blow something up). You can rely on your wits, your items or your special augmentations, which– like magic in fantasy games– let you do supernatural feats as long as your energy levels remain.\nThere is also a freedom in the story. Almost all goal can be reached in at least three different ways; all of the maps include several hidden spots and secret routes that lead you to shortcuts, additional rewards or sometimes even new secondary goals. And to make the list complete, you can choose among different endings for the story, which is something that even some of the best RPGs out there couldn't tell about themselves.\n\nThe game was made on arguably the best engine of its time, Unreal, which really shines in night scenes. (Pardon me the oxymoron.) This not only creates a very fitting atmosphere, but it's also integrated into the game: there are plenty of dark corners to hide – and that’s another reason why Deus Ex is often compared to another successful FPS/sneak hybrid, the Thief series.\n\nThe plot itself is an amalgam of all modern conspiracy theories ranging from the little grey people of Area 51 to the Illuminati and government-controlled epidemics. Still, it’s a very complex story with a lots of questions regarding human nature and sociology. And if we add in the excellent and memorable soundtrack, it's easy to understand why this game is still ranked so high even to this day.","September 10, 2014","true","54.9"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ayres662/recommended/6910/","ayres662","Bloody George","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ayres662/","350 products in account","The original Deus Ex has made its way into my all-time favourites since my very first time playing it about three years ago, and it is unfortunate that I did not experience this masterpiece when it came out. Just over two months ago, I finished replaying it, and those were amazing two-odd weeks ploughing through its almost perfect campaign.\n\nThis is the ultimate epitome of a first-person role-playing game. Even its very few flaws do not result in any considerable frustration, and the fluidity in gameplay and mechanics outbalance the blemishes, thanks to its excellent insertion of the augmentation system and its relevance to mission progression, or its meticulously designed maps, or its well-balanced and concise skill chart. Stealth would a little improvement in terms of AI response and timing of critical moments (e.g. the player is often found in situations in which, after being flat-out spotted, the only urgency is to hide behind a crate so that the sin is forgiven), and it must be said that this is the game’s most apparent problem. In sum, the challenge that the stealth element poses is greatly reduced by the enemy’s poor response and follow-up actions to spotting. Another problem is the shallow issue of graphics and general animation. Naturally, this is a minor aspect to worry about, but it could be argued that textures, as well as said animations, are not en par with games from the same period, such as the posterior Return to Castle Wolfenstein, or even the preceding System Shock 2; both more visually appealing than Deus Ex.\n\nIt could be argued that story, writing and player’s choice are the pillars that hold the game up there on the eRPG Olympus. The main premise encompasses themes such as global conspiracy, scientific/pharmaceutical agendas, corporate domination of geopolitics, and the confines of biological manipulation. The approach to such themes demonstrates the maturity and profound research done by main writer Sheldon Pacotti, and the ideological directions that the game can take will depend solely on the player, without any biases ultimately affecting the general mood. Main missions are no-nonsense tasks that are as intimately related to the plotline as a story-driven gaming narrative can get, and the side missions are an additional flavour to the lore that periodically unravels with each book or data vault accessed. Everything works in perfect unison.\n\nThe long and versatile campaign can be played several times and still not be exhausted from all the plot possibilities that arise should the player simply pick a different choice when dealing with a major objective. The choices shall always be there, whether the headway involves breaching into a building to reach a quest target’s whereabouts, or choosing the fate of the populace from a destitute area portrayed in a grim future. Additionally, the story carries convincing alternate chronicles for the fictional geopolitical scenario that it proposes: the protagonist J. C. Denton travels to multiple locations in different real-world countries and, either through news segments found on papers casually lying about or through dialogue, is able to make sense of the plot and the dystopian intricacies that it articulates. In fact, every piece of plot-related data is cleverly placed and communicated, and even the interpolations are executed meticulously and with later lore to back it up as the player advances through the missions. The several twists in the narrative never wane, precisely because every bit of adversity is accounted for during gameplay and is there to integrate the political dilemma posed by the storyline.\n\nRemarkably orchestrated, Deus Ex excels at virtually every aspect of gaming development, which paved the way for the title to become such a successful franchise afterwards. Incorporation of several gameplay dynamics may be its most notable quality – quite a novelty for a late-90s/early-2000s game, and a virtue that it shares with the likes of the aforementioned System Shock 2, for instance –, even though story and writing may be its greatest one *for an RPG*. In terms of audio production, besides some decent voice acting, the beautiful soundtrack conveys the game’s cyberpunk aesthetics, and the synth-based music is an aural delight composed by Unreal-genius Alexander Brandon and Michiel van den Bos, among others. Deus Ex is a genuine gem of its time and onwards; a complete package for those who crave for a mature action-RPG experience and/or for those who want a taste of high-quality sci-fi in a videogame.","April 19","true","49.3"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

This was my second playthrough of the game and i played it on hard this time but it was easier then the first time i played it because i knew what i was doing. This game can be brutal to newcomers or modern gamers that don't play these classic pc games, the game doesn't tell you where to go, you are not specialised at any skills at the start of the game so those first few hours can be very difficult and you can easily f*ck up what you chose to upgrade and you cant reverse it.\nStages like Hong kong, raiding the warehouse in new york and the ocean lab is why i really like this game (and the laser sword) however i do feel the gameplay is a bit dated and some of the stages i found really boring like paris.

It is a game that revolutionized the FPS genre as the original "Thinking Man's Shooter". It was groundbreaking in every single aspect, from the open-ended gameplay to the storytelling to the RPG elements it borrowed.\n\nBasically, Deus Ex is an FPS with some RPG elements added on to give your character a better sense of progression. You start off as just another agent but as you improve your skills and acquire new implants you become a truly unstoppable force.\n\nThe maps are huge and sprawling with tons of enemies and civilians and there is never just one way of going about accomplishing your objectives. Everywhere is littered with secret tunnels, hidden stashes, locked doors, automated defenses and patrolling sentries. Although the storyline isn't quite open enough to say that every game plays differently you can safely say that each map has hundreds of different ways to complete it.\n\nThe storyline will from the start seem like a classic cops vs. terrorists but as you progress through the game you will find that nothing what it seems and nobody is who they pretend to be. You will find that your actions have real tangible gameplay consequences as you decide who should die and who should live and there are many surprises waiting for you down the line.\n\nIt's not a game that holds your hand and tells you who to kill and who to spare, more often than not a first time player will allow his enemies to live never realizing that there are real consequences and rewards to putting a gun to their head and ending their existence right there. Similarly there are those who can be spared or saved from death that will come back to help you or haunt you later in the game. This is all something you have to figure out for yourself as you play through the game and I wouldn't want to spoil it for you.\n\nAlthough the graphics have aged quite a bit since it's release the availability of high-resolution texture packs and other fan-made graphical enhancements means it's playable even in this day and age.\n\nDeus Ex is perhaps one of the greatest games ever released for PC and, in my humble opinion, the greatest shooter ever released. It's only real competition being from the System Shock games.\n\nTruly a masterpiece of gaming and hopefully one day we will see a proper sequel.","November 13, 2012","true","179.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Was Deus Ex  that  good?  YES   Yes, Yes, Yes. It was even better than I expected\n*Spoilers Ahead*\nDeus Ex drives you into a futuristic dystopian world, where you find out that the government is corrupt, that UNATCO (The organization that you worked for) is corrupt too and that they are working with different organizations that hide the vaccine to the plague from the civilians, one of those groups, Majestic 12, is doing experiments with humans and animals, and other terrifying experiments.\nIn Deus Ex you change sides from the UNATCO to the NSF, Illuminati, Triads and the Silhouette.

No, I have just finished the game not more than 10 minutes ago, and managed to grab all 3 endings in the process. I will tell you right now, although games like Oblivion and Portal cloud my top 5 favorite games with the ham fisted strength of nostalgia, this game is one of the greatest games I have ever experienced. The stealth is near-superb, with the only hiccups being that bodies will go undetected and JC will be chewed out for killing, even though everyone was rendered unconscious. I played through the game utilizing only the stealth crossbow, taser, and police baton in a fruitful effort of not killing anyone, but the beauty is that you can play through however you want. Depending on how you allocate your skills, you can speed through maps toting a nuclear death launcher or a small machine gun, paving the way with bullets. You can be cautious and invest in disabling security, then sneakily headshotting enemy troopers. Or you can be like me, and be the ghost that is never seen.\n\nAll of the above only focuses on the gameplay aspect. The story? Fantastic. It has the right amount of plot deviations and well versed story telling that surrounds itself in conspiracy. The graphics? They are subpar, but for the year 2000, not too bad. The soundtrack? While it is very 2000-centric in nature, it still holds up very well and fits the mood of the area. It will leave your ears wanting more and more.\n\nSo, do I recommend this game? Yes.

Deus Ex is a stealth action game created by Ion Storm in the year 2000. Now this legendary entry in the gaming industry is considered one of the most innovative of all time to many, included in its theme of stealth, roleplaying, choice, action, exploration, and many other labels, as its popularity has transcended since its creation. In Deus Ex, you play as protagonist JC Denton, an operative for UNATCO who’s primary focus is to thwart a terrorist organization, NSF’s, tactics, such as the theft of a chemical weapon known as Ambrosia. The player given primary and optional objectives during the briefing for each mission, and then are allowed free reign to complete said objectives in, pretty much, any way they wish.\nHere are a few items that I found of interest in Deus Ex:\n\nRoleplaying - As protagonist JC Denton, players traverse various stages with given objectives while gaining experience points to enhance aspects of their character’s statistics. The upgrade system is impeccable, and allows the player to proceed in situations in nearly any way possible, which allows for multiple forms of play and progression. Another element of great importance is how choices-both in and out of dialogues-affect an abundance of things within the game. For example, your starting equipment choices and statistics will influence how you manipulate the world and its peoples, allowing you to uncover a multitude of secrets. Simple actions such as going to the ladies’ restroom to check for loot may prompt simple dialogue changes, hence why Director Joseph Manderly, the protagonist’s boss, scorned me for doing so. A touch of realism is portrayed in Deus Ex as well since getting paid actually feels like getting paid. For example, Director Manderly will explain your monetary and experience gains after each mission within a conversational flow, which accentuates a seamless transition between operations and downtime.\n\nStealth System - It is difficult to entirely describe the sensation that is this title’s stealth gameplay presents. Character augments, statistical upgrades, and player skill all contribute to the experience, yet this game seemingly knows how to also look past these and simply demonstrate a stealth ‘feel’ in comparison to relying on only the said features. Like nearly every other game created in the genre, the player can maneuver while hidden through territories by utilizing the crouch command-activated with the Control key-and by passing silently in the shadows, preferring muffled or melee eliminations over brutal assault. Several useable items such as the stun rod and tranquilizer rounds for the crossbow emphasize the purpose of stealth, but are not so overpowered that it makes the approach simple; player timing and cunning are key to success while dodging enemy forces in Deus Ex.\n\nPlayer and Non-Player Dialogue - As described previously, many of the actions that JC Denton can perform may be mentioned by non-player characters throughout the game; some of these exchanges can occur randomly-such as in the incident mentioned within the spoiler text-, but mostly appear within conversation with others. There is also a great dialogue selection when speaking with civilians or UNATCO personnel ranging from calm and inquisitive to brash threatening.\n\nLevel Design - Though similar themes may be present through individual missions, each level retains its own unique feel and layout that abstains from any two levels being blindly alike. Deus Ex utilizes a multiple-layer design in many of its missions, with street-, basement-, and roof-accessible venues that contribute to the open-ended gameplay; this may not seem like a huge feature, but with so many stealth action games forcing players to endure ‘straight’ level mechanics while claiming its style to be open-world, this ideal is magnificent. Strewn throughout each level are also intricately-placed traps and alarms that Gary Gygax himself would be proud of.\n\nTL:DR - Deus Ex is undoubtedly a legend in the gaming world, and continues to shine in its current age. This title near-flawlessly executes a stealth gameplay experience that all fanatics of the genre must play. There is so much more I would like to say about Deus Ex but nothing anyone could say can truly bring justice to how innovative this game was and still is. I highly recommend this title to individuals who enjoy stealth action, roleplaying, and cyberpunk themes. Thanks for reading.\n\nDo you enjoy these reviews?

Okay this game is so great because some guys from Looking Glass (the dev team behind SS2, that is System Shock 2) decided to make another great game.\n\nIt is pretty similar to SS2 in a variety of ways:\n-inventory\n-Role-Playing-Game features are almost alike\n-weapons are almost alike too\n\nThere is something more:\n-talking with other people will help you get through a lot of troubles\n-there is some simple Stealth mechanic which makes the game more interesting\n-non-linearity makes replaybility feasible\n-deep reasonings around philosophical concepts (not too much I assure you and they are not unnecessarily mind-bogglingly complicated as Hegel)\n\nThis game talks about how humans modified their bodies to become more powerful through cyber implants. This shifted human potential limitessly. You are the newest model: a genetic enhanced human being. Someone is hiding something, but for the moment you are safe. Watch your back Agent, for lots of issues lie up ahead.\n\nThere is the DeusEx Editor if you wish to spend some time building your own levels.\n\nIn short:\nI recommend this game because it is a must have in the FPS-RPG hybrid genres. I consider this game as the indirect offspring of SS2 and because it is a lot more deep than most games nowadays, I want you to consider this tiny review with a great deal of care.\n\nThanks for reading.","December 1, 2014","true","31.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Despite the years, is a very complex game and introduced a series of mechanics which are still praised today.\n\nPROS :\n\n- Incredible story (What begins as the simplest thing in the world, ends up becoming a story full of conspiracies and betrayals to the point of not knowing who to trust, followed by a climax that few games can reach).\n- The decisions you make along the adventure change the narrative of the ending.\n- Completely open-character to all missions (From the first to the last, you have multiple ways to fulfill your primary and secondary objectives).\n- Long campaign (If you dare to explore absolutely everything, you will ensure a minimum of 60 hours of gameplay).\n- Multiple options for character customization (Integration of augmentations that allows you to perform specific actions and skills that can be enhanced at different levels).\n- You can mold the character to fit your playing style (If you're a pacifist, you can create a stealthy character to avoid direct confrontation, or if you prefer to face the situation ala John Rambo, you can create a real killing machine).\n- Wide variety of weapons (From improvised weapons to non-lethal, knives, pistols, shotguns, rifles, bazookas, energy weapons, etc. Many of these, completely customizable in their performance).\n- Various options to interact with the NPC's (Resolving a situation by the way of the dialogue, intimidation or force. Your choice affects the opinion of other characters and their behavior towards the protagonist).\n- The exploration is encouraged (Many hidden areas that keep items, ammunition, experience points to spend, etc).\n- Features Multiplayer option (Amazingly for a game of these characteristics, you have the option to play in LAN or Internet. At the time of writing this Review, there were about 15 active servers with people in them).\n\nCONS :\n\n- Relatively small inventory (Although this is not necessarily a bad thing, but merely strategic. You must decide very well which items to carry).\n- Some bugs and graphical glitches (Textures that become invisible, walls that inexplicably you can go through in certain situations).\n\nAn unforgettable story set in a Cyberpunk atmosphere of the mid-21st century. The multiple customization options added to the various narratives that you have for your style of play, ensures that the Single Player mode will be played more than once.\n\nMy Score: 8.8/10\n\nNote : Played it on Windows XP - SP3","February 23, 2014","true","73.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","2"

Whether you storm into a hostage filled room guns blazing, enter quietly through an open window or hack the code lock on the front door; there are many different approaches to each situation you find yourself in.\n\nThis is combined with a satisfying character progression system that allows JC to increase his proficiency in everything from firearms, lock picking, computer hacking and even swimming. Because of the range of non-violent solutions to each scenario, Deus Ex is often considered to be closer to an RPG than it is a straight shooter; something that was a very new and exciting prospect in 2000.\n\nIn a similar vein to another PC classic Thief; Deus Ex blends stealth, gunplay and a mature cyberpunk setting to great effect and has created an enduring legacy for its legion of dedicated fans.\n\nThe game’s final quarter is a bit weak though and many aspects of the story form a labyrinthine mess of conspiracy angles when you get down to it, but none of that spoils what is an excellent game and one rightly regarded for letting players take their own individual approach to the task at hand.\n\nDeus Ex is the game that taught other games how to grow up and reach a wider audience.\n\nExceptional.\n\nRead the full retrospective at my blog »[www.celjaded.com]","October 21, 2015","true","0.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The game puts you into the shoes of JC Denton, a government operative who is thrust into a world of violence, politics and intrigue while struggling to figure out who to trust.\n\nThe game combines elements of an FPS with an RPG-style management and upgrade system, well-written and developed characters and a variety of interesting locales to create an experience that is still unmatched. Whether you're searching through the streets of New York to take down a generator, investigating a conspiracy in a high-rise office building in Hong Kong or trying to stop a missile launch in the middle of the desert, the game throws a variety of situations at the player in the context of a major global conspiracy.\n\nOne thing I've always enjoyed about the story, and which keeps me coming back time and time again to replay it, is the range of possible solutions (and responses) to various problems faced in the game world. You can do things that seem counterintuitive or even absurd, and the game will recognize and praise/admonish you for your actions. Want to kill that nosy reporter, despite the fact that no one has asked you to? The game recognizes it. Want to skip the first mission by throwing a gas grenade at the front door of UNATCO HQ? The NPC's remark on it. Wait too long to talk to an NPC? They may have different introductory dialogue based on when you visit them.\n\nLikewise, the characters are very well-written, and have actions that extend beyond conversations with the player and into e-mails, newspapers and books found around the game world. All this material is optional, and players can skip it as they so choose.\n\nThe combat and NPC reaction to damage can come off as a bit "stiff" to modern audiences, but the movement and reaction system in general still holds up quite well, with enemies and NPC's reacting to damage and running away if they are hurt, stopping to reload and changing their firing position or chasing after the player during combat.\n\nIf there's anything I can criticize this game for (and that's very hard to do), the GOTY does introduce a couple of musical/ambient sound bugs that can lead to multiple pieces of music playing in the same level. Besides that, though, this is still the same tried-and-true Deus Ex experience - you'll play it for the deep characters and storyline, and stay for the different gameplay approaches and solutions (not to mention all of the mods and total conversions!).\n\nDeus Ex is a classic, and it's a game I'm honored to have both in my physical and Steam library.","December 5, 2013","true","191.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It also taught me the consequences of choice and how different choices can lead to opposite or even unexpected results. It might be a dated game by today’s standards, but this game actually respects the player by interacting with him/her through choices and liberty of gameplay to reach from point A to point B while maintaining the player grasped into the plot that is masterfully delivered and never feels unrealistic or over the top. It makes you think on the final outcome of all the choices and paths you have taken and can even make you second-guess yourself for doing it.

This game defied all my expectations. I didn't expect to be given so many choices or so many possible endings, especially from a 14 year old game! It was engaging, challenging, moddable, and overall: enjoyable! You may be skeptical at first, but by the midway point you're intrigued. By the endgame, you're hooked! Personally, I have not used any mods, and I only completed one ending, but DANG. WHAT AN ENDING. If you enjoy games with serious plot, action, stealth, decision making, and laughable voice acting on all the non-essential characters, buy this game! $7 is a pittance compared to the mighty wealth of enjoyment you will get from this title.

You can go inside a building through the front door, or you can find a back entrance. You can hack computers, digital locks, and security consoles, but you can also get the password somewhere. You can pick locks, but you can get the key from somebody. You can kill your enemies, but you can just avoid encountering them at all.\n\nThe level designs are just brilliant. They're big, but not huge. You can easily memorize them, so it's easy not to get lost. Some of the levels are visited more than once and it feels different everytime, yet you still remember the places.\n\nThe graphics aren't amazing and they may look outdated, but they fit the atmosphere perfectly. The music is great and every location has its own soundtrack that fits to what you're currently doing.\n\nThe story is great and a little bit complex with conspiracies here and there, but there's not much to tell without spoiling it. This game is set in 2052 and it takes place in a chaotic world filled with terrorists, drugs, diseases, and augmented humans. There's a lot of memorable characters in this game, and every single one of them has their own personality. You can kill some of the important characters but instead of failing the mission, it will change the story and you will have to face the consequences.\n\nIn short, it's a great classic game with a great story and music that combines RPG, FPS, action, and stealth elements with a lot of different playstyles to choose.","April 14, 2015","true","34.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThatZelousGuy/recommended/6910/","ThatZelousGuy","Zelousmarine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThatZelousGuy/","55 products in account","DEUS EX is a Role Playing Game with First Person Shooter elements in it, made in the year 2000 by Ion Storm and published by Warren Spector, releaced for the PC, using the Unreal 1 engine.\n\nThis is the greatest game ever made of all time (PC)\nNo I'm not kidding, lying, or even just saying that to signify it's importance or how great it is:\nThis really IS the greatest videogame ever made for the PC.\nIt has won over 200 GameOfTheYear awards, and many areas of videogame ideas and influence of even compleatly different generas can be traced back to Deus Ex.\n\nThe concept for Deus Ex came from Ion Storm (Austin) being split into three groups:\nGroup 1 was dedicated to creating the best PC exclusive FirstPersonShooter ever\nGroup 2 consisted of people with a lot of experiance in RolePlayingGames, and\nGroup 3 mostly included people from Looking glass studios, whose recent success in Thief: the dark project, wanted to see a future version of their FPS Stealth game.\nAnd by combining the ideas and thoughts of all 3 groups, Ion Storm (Austin) created the greatest PC game of all time. And when you play it, you won't find it hard to believe.\n\nThe plot is set in a dystopian world during the year 2052, and follows the rookie United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO) agent JC Denton (hint: YOU), as he sets out to combat terroist forces (the NSF), which have become increasingly prevalent in a world slipping ever further into chaos, through a highly contaigus viris called the Grey death, only curable by the vaxine Ambrosia. As the plot unfolds, Denton becomes entangled in a deep and ancient conspiracy, encountering various organizations (to say whom would spoil too much), conspiracies, lies and twists, that carry on throughout the whole game, as he travels through various environments and cities, from NewYork, to Rome, to Hong Kong, and manny more.\n\nThe RolePayingGame parts include Upgrading skills and Augmentations to increase JC's effectivness in the field, and choosing diologe between characters, which not only effects the way characters treat you, but also the effects of the multiple endings, and the multiple roots and pathways PRIOR to said multiple endings.\nBut the real inovation in Deus Ex lies within the open-endedness in the levels: It's not a sandbox game, but its levels have manny pathways to the objectives and manny ways to approch them. You can go in all guns blazing, which gun is up to you, or choose different weapons, Lethal or Non-lethal, and try to stealth through it, and because JC has an inventory system, this is possable, although that certain weapons take up a bigger space in the inventory slot, and the re-aranging of the items has created the name "Inventory-Tetris".\nRemember when I said Non-lethal? Yes it is possable. You can stun, or knock out enemies to make them unconsious, meaning you didn't kill them, or hack a security turret to kill them, meaning YOU didn't kill them. Also, you can skip past the Boss fights entirely, not killing them or knocking them out.\nHeck, it won a guiness world record for being able to compleate the game and only have to kill 2 PEOPLE.\nIt's that kind of deph you will find here.\n\nObviously, it's not just stealth, and a few areas require you to shoot through them, and the FPS elements are pretty good:\nThere's no iron-sights since they hadn't been invented at the time, although you can upgrade some weapons to have a scope on them, although if you aren't trained in these areas, your aim and crosshair will fumble and spread all over the place. There's no regenerating-health (F that cow-waste) or Heath-bar per say. Damage is taken through to the different parts of your body. Too manny arm shots & you're gonna struggle with aiming. Too manny leg shots, and you're gonna have trouble with movment. Health is replenished by using Med-kits on the different body parts, eating food found in certain places (i.e a drinking fountain or resteraunt), or using Androids found in a few places in various environments\n\nAnd the MUSIC: holy heck the MUSIC. Just look up the Unatco theme on YouTube, and you'll see how AMAZING the music is.\nIt was composed by Alexander Brandon, who also did the Unreal tournament music, and a few others I haven't listed.\n\n\n\n\nOK...\n\n\n\n\nNow I've praised Deus Ex long enough, time to get into the problems.\nIt's not perfect. When I say best PC game of all time, I mean that all the things good about it outweigh the bad parts so much, that it makes it the best Pc game of all time: it's THAT good.\n\nThe first problem is for the modern era: it has aged like absolute COW-WASTE. The visuals are very dated, & it wasn't ground-breaking for it's time either, and that can put off a lot of first-timers.\n\nThe second problem is with the design choices:\nCertain skills & augmentations are downright USELESS.\nAsk any Deus Ex veteran about the "Swimming" skill, and they'll instantly get what you mean. The skill is never needed to progress ANYWHERE in the game. This is the same-ish issue with "Environment training", because being able to use radioactive suits, dull effects of poisons, and things of that nature isn't that helpful.\nThe skill for "Melee weapons" is also debatable in usefullness, because half-way through the game you are given a powerful sword that can kill most enemies in 1-2 hits.\nStealth can be a bit glitchy with certain weapons downright wierd.\nThe Crossbow with tranquilliser rounds for instance:\nThe effects on the poison depend on where it hits the body. If it hits the head, it takes 1-4 seconds to pass out. Anywhere else and it takes 5-12 seconds, during which time the enemy can run around, warn other people, set off alarms, & be a downright pain.\n\nAlso, the final problem, and this is directed at YOU if you plan on getting this, is that it has a VERY small accessabuillty factor.\nIt can be hard to get into, if first-timers don't know most of the flaws.\nThey read all of the reviews saying how awesome it is, and load up the game, expecting a good old time; YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO. They'll see the character creation screen, put a few points into lethal weapons, and gun handling, expecting to shoot their way through the first mission, only to find themselves out of ammo, and not killing anything.\nPeople who expect to play through the game, and listen to all the audio diologes, collect every weapon, hack all the security cameras, and upgrade everything on the first playthrough; It will JUST NOT HAPPEN the first playthrough.\nYou may get into the universe, and master everything in the game, but this WILL NOT happen during your first playthrough.\n\n\n\nBut at the end of the day, Deus Ex still stands the tests of time, and deserves ALL of those GOTY awards it got.\nYou know the saying with Deus Ex? Every time you mention it, someone re-installls it? Yeah, there's a reason for that.\n\nSo the 2 big questions are:\nIs it Really the best game ever made of all time on PC? and\nShould you play it?\n\nTo answer both those questions simply: YES*\nAnd I said Yes with the asterix ( * ) as a disclaimer for first timers.\nBecause there are problems with it that you should watch out for, but get over them, and there really hasn't been a better game then this.\nDeus Ex also had 2 sequels: Invisible war, and Human Revolution (the latter better well known), and while fans will argue till their mouths are sore over which is better, out of the 3, Deus Ex is the best of them.\n\nI  EXTREMALY HIGHLY recommend this game to pretty much anyone into this.\n6/5","August 31, 2014","true","5.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","1"

The radical choices you could make (one example: you can actually trot away from boss fights, like a hippie chasing a butterfly). The fact that the game lets you play any style you want: gun maniac to stealth hacker, superior smart-mouth to humble and reasonable agent, and anything in between. The near-perfect blend of shooter, stealth and true RPG elements. The intellectual coherence of the game's philosophical and political conversation, most of which is starkly valid today. And just when you least expect it, a subtle touch of perfectly balanced humour.\n\nI won't spoil a bit of this game's fantastic story, which is a complex OCEAN of meaningful events, each one offering enriching, frightening and stunning insights into the condition of the world and the nations that live in it.\n\nOne issue: the crossbow is useless as a stealth weapon. If an enemy is hit with a tranquilizer dart, they run around screaming, shooting and activating alarms for several seconds before passing out. It's useful if you're doing a pacifist playthrough. For stealth, stick with the prod. pro- with the prod.\n\nJust please, please don't let the graphics put you off. The game is widely considered a strong contender for the best game of all time. Don't let your addiction to particle clouds and tessellation and ragdoll physics and 9-hour playthroughs keep you from experiencing this sublime game.","December 25, 2014","true","40.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Last time was in 2013 ^^\n\nAs each game of the series, you will move in an awesome cyberpunk environment, which is as complex and consistent as in the best SF books.

Graphics are really poor by modern standards and even at the time I hated the feel of the modified Unreal v1 Engine that this game uses, so those who put a high premium on look and feel should stay away.\n\nIf, however, you can tolerate these shortcomings, you should know that everything that made Deus Ex one of the best games of all time is still intact.  This game pioneered open-ended gameplay and still does it better than most modern imitators: the level design and character creation system enable players of every persuasion to meaningfully approach the game with their own style.  For example: some bosses can be insta-killed through dialogue if thorough players found, via hacking, the necessary code words.  You can even kill everyone that the game's plot absolutely cannot do without, and characters will react accordingly.  The plot is rich and the world is immersive, with secrets that cannot be discovered by players of one build or other, creating a sense of credibility - like Dark Souls (my other favourite game ever), Deux Ex doesn't willingly give up all its treasures, but demands to be explored.\n\nIn summary, this game started a genre, and it's still the paradigm of the action/RPG because it does so many important things so much better than its modern imitators.  If you're a fan of immersive, reactive action/RPGs, you NEED to play Deus Ex.","July 18, 2014","true","0.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

The themes and ideas presented in Deus Ex are not for the light of heart, and perfect for the skeptic and those that realize that what you're presented with on the evening news is anything but the whole, true, real picture. All the world's a stage, and Deus Ex illustrates that magnificently.\n\nDeus Ex is an arguably timeless video game that transcends the medium into something much more than a way to spend a few hours shooting bad guys.

The sheer amount of player agency is a testament to how well the developers accommodated a wide variety of playstyles. Your character is your character alone, with many choices in both skills and augmentations this game offers gameplay diversity that is very rarely seen. Combat is interesting, using modular health meaning taking damage in different areas of your body will vary in negative effects like reduced aim in the arms. This isn't limited to you, as it also effects npcs, for example striking a npc in the lower back with a melee weapon will rendered them unconscious (baton) or dead (knife) in a single hit.\n\nMoving away from gameplay/combat, the story and pacing is generally great, however it seems far to rushed come the last quarter of the game. Sure the illuminati aspect seems overused today in popular culture, but this doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the story. Finally the music is absolutely fantastic with great sound design adding immersion to the world.\n\nOverall Deus Ex is a fantastic game, it has aged considerably, from the outdated control scheme and sometimes idiotic ai, Deus Ex still holds up as an enjoyable experience with an enduring legacy, very much worth playing.","December 15, 2015","true","34.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Game mechanics, plot, characters, visuals, level designs, good marketing move to release at certain time or other nerd stuff.\nSo why's everyone keep telling that a game with broken mechanics, outdated graphics, nonexistent ai and muhconspiracyfoilhats plot is one the best games ever made?\n\n\nIt's always delivery. Deus Ex setups setting and drag you in from the first minutes, every time you play you will find something new: new newspaper article you didn't read, new way into some important building,  another chat from hobos about area 51 and stuff like this. Every level in this game is made for exploring. First time i played (2012, so no nostalgia tripping here) i didn't even know there's sidequests in this game.\n\n\n"Kill a prisoner against my orders!"\n-- Joseph Stalin\n\n\nWide variety of weapons with most of them being useless until you max out weapon mastery like it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Morrowind, one-shotting soldiers and randomly running enemies probably make it a bad FPS. But every time you find new weapon mod in some dumpster you're overjoyed like a boy who sees ♥♥♥♥ for the first time. Halfway in the game you're just noscoping with sniper rifle and stabbing people with jedi nano-sword and you're unable to notice any flaw, since plot has no brakes whatsoever and you jump around the globe engaging in terrorism and other pleasant activities.\n\n\n"I am the bartender... I am your man."\n--Bartender\n\n\nBunch of ABSOLUTELY useless skills and augs that are in no circumstances would help you WHATSOEVER, non-existent economy and dialogue decisions once in forever would probably make it a bad RPG. However, with a way that characters react to your decisions and even playstyle,JC's killer quotes and a lot of really interesting stuff you will argue with absolutely random people (this barmen in triad club talking about how chinese dictatorship is far superior to corrupted Burgerland capitalism. I don't even want to mention this cool AI dude in some room in Illuminati hideout) along with sometimes pretty non-linear ways to handle stuff (Only time when game-designers will not let you do whatever you want and force you to bend to the plot by throwing at you invincible enemy and a bunch of invisible walls can be noticed only by true MLG autists like me) will make you forget this too. Not to mention that main character is collest and dangerousestest ♥♥♥♥♥ in da hood (major fault of deus ex 2 was a bunch of tumblr-like characters, even JC will talk some boring quotes of old farts like nobody's business).\n\n\n"I think the black people didn't show up for work at all...suspicous..."\n-- George Washington\n\n\nAnd atmosphere! It really feels like you're secret agent on the run in decaying near future society: uncovering conspiracies, killing corrupt officials, engaging in corporate espionage, lethally throwing soy food at soldiers, blocking enemies with cardboard boxes, using explosives to climb walls and healing yourself by jerking off a water cooler for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minute. While majority of good old games is rendered barely playable by time because of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ interface, already fixed in remakes/sequels ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechanics, applied wizard science to launch them or what not, deus ex instead of being a barely moving old fart is a motherflipping MC Vspyshkin: game is unarguably pretty old, but is still fun and kicking butt. Once you played it one time you will reinstall every time you hear The Synapse on the internet.\n\nAnd with all this replay value, there's also mods and multiplayer.\n\nConsidering all that, i can only give this game 100 rusty skull-guns out of 100 and encourage you to play it as fast as possible in case you haven't.\n\n\n"my 3 daughters turned up dead, heres your op bonus 1000 credits"\n-- Manderley","March 11, 2015","true","24.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Deus Ex is hard, and that's good; it forces you to plan ahead.\n\nBut the interface is really difficult to use, and the AI is so inconsistent that it breaks game immersion. These were problems when the game was new.\n\nToday, the original Deus Ex offers a walk down memory lane for people who played it when it was originally released But for younger gamers who are searching for some PC game history, it's confounding. I would recommend instead another groundbreaking game from the same era and same studio: Thief 1 and 2, which have aged much better.\n\nI give a cautious recommendation for Deus Ex, but only for people seeking historical perspective.","January 30, 2011","true","2.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","2"

People already know how good this game is right? They don’t need me to be badgering them to play it! But the sad truth is that as the younger demographic come onto the scene, this is one of those gems that they are missing. And can we really blame them? Just one look at the screenshot or the gameplay on YouTube is enough to tell you that this is not a pretty looking game! Is it really worth getting in 2015?\n\nWhat Deus Ex provides is a lot of mechanical depth. There is a lot of freedom in the way you approach things: you can be a ruthless murderer, a hacker, a stealthy assassin… it’s entirely up to you how to approach the situations you encounter in the game. Also the mechanics, with the exception of the awful crossbow (don’t try it) don’t feel all that dated. Upgrading your abilities and the various augmentations you can make to yourself is implemented really well to the game, and feels quite modern. What I will warn you about though is that you should not expect to be able to shoot accurately when you start the game. If you don’t put points into pistols then you are going to suck with pistols – it’s annoying but mechanically it makes a lot of sense. After all, in order to shoot accurately you have to be a skilled shot!\n\nUnfortunately it does look terrible, which is the point that I’m going to put the challenge on you as the reader to make the decision. This is one of the best PC games of all time, that’s a fact. If it was released nowadays with modern graphics it would be winning awards. So if you think you can cope with the outdated graphics, then I challenge you to play this game. I advise that in the opening section of the game you put those points into pistols and stick to the shadows to begin with. But if you can get through that opening level, then you are in for a treat – because this game is fantastic.\n\nPlease do feel free to comment if you’ve tried and you get stuck or whatever. Or if you were able to break through the graphics barrier and are enjoying arguably one of the finest narrative experiences ever created. I’d love to hear the feedback.\n","March 12, 2015","true","37.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I received this title as software bundle when I bought a video card, back in my early days of building rigs.  I had no idea what it was, but my roommate at the time said he had heard good things.  Boy was I in for a treat.\n\nDeus Ex is (yep, still is) the pinnacle of you picking whatever way you want to achieve your objective.  On top of that, you get conflicting objectives, forcing you to choose your path; thus shaping the game into one of three outcomes.  Sometimes it’s easy to get lost exploring the alternate routes you didn’t take on the way to an objective; it’s that engrossing.\n\nYou are given a wide variety of skills, powers (cybernetic augmentations), tools, and weapons to go about your business; more choices to shape your gameplay.  As you play through you’ll get “skill points” (just another unit of RPG exp), and pick up “augmentation canisters” to establish your superhuman abilities.  You can even get upgrade modules for the weapons (silencers, lasers, etc.).\n\nTo tie it altogether is a polished cyberpunk atmosphere with a well-written narrative.  The graphics limitations of the time are compensated for by legit voice acting, and AI behavior that’s impressive for the time it was released.\n\nA testament to this title is how the fan community has produced patches to maximize its performance on modern systems.  It makes playing it all over again that much more fun…over a decade later.  It is far better than its sequel (garbage), and still better than its flashy (but still good) prequel.\n\nNow, for the paltry price offered, why on earth would you not pick this up?\n","April 4, 2015","true","18.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Deus Ex.\n\nEven though it was released way back in 2000, and had never been considered pretty, I'd found that most well honed gamers still revered Deus Ex as a quintessential, almost religious-like, gaming experience... something I'd never experienced before (in anything.)\nSo, sometime around the beginning of the year, I crawled into the skin of one J.C.Denton, spy guy.\n\nDeus Ex wasn't a difficult game for me (especially set on 'easy'), but it was challenging.  To spill blood or not to spill blood? (I'm a natural born spiller.) Should I  help the crazy lady find her cat? (I didn't.) Am I to go east or west? (I usually just turned left.) Will these decisions make a difference, somehow? *shrug*\nDeus Ex  was a game of Nerves and Patience and Decisions... and bullets.\nBut, especially, Decisions.. which, by game's end, had become pretty monumental.\nYeah, I really can't say that I had heaps-o'-fun playing Deus Ex. Sometimes it felt long and grueling. Or dark and oppressing.\nBut, then, that's how it is, when something is intelligent and thought provoking.  And that's why I kept playing, because.. well, it was the object of the game.  I felt that, if I could make it to the end, I might, somehow, come out better than when I started.\n\nAnd, I think I did.","May 27, 2013","true","494.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I bought it during a summer sale nearly a decade later and got really, really into it. All the characters look the same, aiming is a pain, it -never- autosaves and the stealth elements are clumsy at best. This game should be horrible – but somehow, it isn’t.\n\nIn fact, Deus Ex is one of, if not the, best game(s) that I’ve ever played. If you like games with a strong sense of setting, it’s a must-play. The dark, filthy cities and the gritty techno music give you the feeling of a world that doesn’t have much time left. The developers also did a superb job at creating a world that feels fun to explore – there are plenty of (actually interesting) secrets to find, and many opportunities for sequence breaking.\n\nThe dialogue is sharp, analytical and often thought-provoking, characters get philosophical at the drop of a hat and the plot manages to tie most famous conspiracy theories from the last century or so together without falling apart. J.C. himself is also really suave and charismatic despite looking at least twenty years older than his given age, kind of like a mix of Dirty Harry, Rick Deckard and Neo. All in all it's a very satisfying experience. They simply don’t make them like this anymore.\n\nP.S.: The Shifter mod improves some of the game's minor flaws and also adds secret weapons.","July 30, 2015","true","230.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrlinx/recommended/6910/","mrlinx","MrLinx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrlinx/","203 products in account","Deus Ex desenvolvido pela Ion Storm e dirigido pelo seu idealizador inicial, ninguém menos que Warren Spector, mente por trás de jogos como  System Shock e Thief, além de vários outro títulos aclamados no currículo. Diz-se que Spector depois de desenvolver System Shock, estava cansado da temática de fantasia e ele queria algo mais contemporâneo, algo mais atual. Com isso ele teve uma ideia: porque não usar todas essas teorias da conspiração esparramadas por aí? Warren usando essas diversas teorias da conspiração criou uma amarração mirabolante entre elas, unindo tudo isso a um gameplay e dando corpo a uma criação cyberpunk de altíssimo nível, chamada Deus Ex.\n\nDeus Ex, inicia-se colocando o jogador na pele do agente JC Denton um agente secreto da UNATCO (The United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition) que apesar de humano, tem capacidades especiais devido a implantes nanotecnológicos. A agência de Denton, lhe dá a missão de encontrar seu irmão Paul Denton (também agente da UNATCO), em um pier aos pés da decapitada estátua  liberdade  que por sua vez lhe dá seu primeiro objetivo oficial: interrogar o líder terrorista do grupo de maior ameaça a paz do momento a  NSF (National Secessionist Forces)  que além de ser responsável por arrancar a cabeça da estátua tomou seu interior como base. Daqui em diante sem, mais detalhes da história, pois seria uma injustiça estragar essa trama cheia de intrigas, reviravoltas e as mais diversas conspirações possíveis.\n\nMais Deus Ex não é só história e conspiração, outro ponto de igual destaque, é a jogabilidade incrivelmente livre e adaptável ao estilo do jogador. Apesar de ter um objetivo fixo, como o jogador irá alcançá-lo fica a critério do mesmo. Por exemplo, imagine uma porta trancada pela qual você tem que passar, ela é protegida por câmeras que ao avistarem você fazem com que uma metralhadora abra fogo contra você, além disso temos dois guardas patrulhando a porta do lado de fora. Difícil entrar? Depende de você e de suas aptidões. Você é um mestre em destrancar portas e quer evitar confronto? Então esguie-se pelas sombras e use um lockpick para abrir a porta. Você é um hacker? Hackeie um computador e faça com que as metralhadoras atirem nos guardas eliminando-os e deixando o caminho livre para que assim você possa pegar a chave de um dos corpos. Você é adepto da força bruta? Deixe um guarda inconsciente com uma pancada na nuca  e pegue a chave de seu bolso tranquilamente. Além dessas temos várias outras maneiras, além de quase sempre se ter rotas alternativas.\n\nJuntando esses elementos citados acima, com uma trilha sonora muito bem trabalhada e dublagens espetaculares, Deus Ex consegue fazer o jogador mergulhar em seu universo e se sentir realmente na pele do agente Denton.\nAcho que um único ponto que pode acabar afastando alguns jogadores é justamente o ponto que fez o jogo se tornar tão aclamado que é sua história que pode ficar chata, aos menos aficionados por ficção e teorias do gênero.\n\n\nEnfim, descrevi apenas alguns pontos principais do que é esse grandioso clássico, o porque dele ser um clássico, só você jogando pra entender. Deus Ex é tão complexo que e até difícil descrever. Não é nem um jogo que vale muito a pena ser destrinchado em review, afinal é o tipo de jogo que merece ser jogado no escuro, é do tipo que cada jogador merece experimentar a sua maneira, tendo o prazer de interpretar, viver, jogar, se iludir e se surpreender com cada novo ponto apresentado, com cada reviravolta, com cada conspiração e com cada conspiração dentro das conspiração.\n\nDeus Ex é um título praticamente perfeito no que oferece em sua proposta, é um jogo que certamente não agrada a todos, mais certamente agrada a grande maioria e basta jogar um pouco pra perceber porque se tornou o clássico que é. Recomendo fortemente.\n\nJoguem e se surpreendam.\n\nPostado originalmente em:   RPG Players[www.rpg-players.com]","June 22, 2015","true","28.5"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","8","13","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/realhumanbean/recommended/6910/","realhumanbean","Real Human Bean","http://steamcommunity.com/id/realhumanbean/","500 products in account","Fun Fact: A woman put this game on a chip and implanted i in her skin, that's how much she loved it.\nDeus Ex, which many of you probably know due to the infamous "Bomb" scene, is a true revolutionary by the literal definition. It's a game people seem to respect more than enjoy, but I disagree. It's probably jsut me, but I don't see its age at all, and I still consider to have the best replay value I've ever experienced with a game. Why is that?\n\nOne simple word, choice.\n\nDeus Ex isn't a perfect game. Hell, it has more flaws than I can list, but it does what no other game I've played outside of anything Eidos has made, it gives true free choice, no illusions, no cop-outs, no story routes that converge, true freedom. It counters the world of the game. Deus Ex takes place in a dystopic United States, whose government has seized control of the planet. Paranoia plagues this world after terrorists attacked New York and destroyed the Twin Towers and the Statue of Liberty (This game was made in 2000, what a coincidence) and an anti-terrorist organization named UNATCO polices the world against the terrorist organization, the NSF. You are JC Denton, a cyborg recruit for UNATCO. A plague called the Black Death sweeps the globe, killing off the Proletariat, its cure in the hands of a select few in power. Suspicions are raised, questions are asked, paranoia grows. Is the government sacrificing freedom for safety? Where has this plague come from? What is the true intention of UNATCO?\n\nAnd that's about all I can say without spoiling. The game has enough twists and turns to make even M. Night Shaymalan blush. The game is everything you'd expect from a dystopic sci-fi fiction combined. Everything is thrown into the melting pot of conspiracy: the MIB, Illuminati, the Templars, evil corporations, Area 51, hushed up alien landings, gene-splicing experiments, the debate of man VS cyborg, and self aware AI are all crucial to the plot. The result leaves you as paranoid and confused as any other person living in this time, and the morality of good VS evil become decisively grey.\n\nThere is unbound choice and freedom in Deus Ex. Being an RPG that just so happens to be in first person, the game doesn't have a black and white good or evil morality system. Instead, the storyline judges you from the sidelines in secret. The choices you make don't really matter (Some are a tad more advantageous) and none prevent you from unlocking a new skill or getting a new ending. There are an infinite ways to solve a scenario. Facing a boss? You can run away! You can knock them out if you wish (it is entirely possible to beat the game without killing anyone if you try hard enough). Need to break into a building? You can kill everyone and walk in, you can crawl through nearby sewers, you can hack the security to turn on the guards or disable it altogether, the list goes on.\n\nDeus Ex is also something most modern games struggle to be, it's balanced. Throughout the game you can score new Augmentations, cyborg superpowers. Each Aug is a choice between two different play styles. Do you want the Aug that makes your footsteps silent or do you want the one that makes you run faster and jump higher (Go with the 2nd actually, it is so much more beneficial for creative players)? Being an old RPG shooter, EVERYTHING requires skill points, but unlike System Shock 2 (A very similar game) the game doesn't punish you for investing in other skills (Though if you stupid and just fully max Poison Resistance and Swimming then you're ♥♥♥♥ed) because each scenario can be solved in so many ways and each way rewards a different playstyle.\n\nThe choices in Deus Ex are some of the hardest I've ever had to make in any game. No, no choice gives you a different gun or anything and they don't affect the game, but there's deep rooted philosophical questions and ideals tied to every choice. The title is derived from "Deus Ex Machina", "God of the Machine", which means that no matter how hopeless a scenario is, something good will come out of it. That being said, I can not think of a more ironic title for a game as this one. Nothing good comes out of Deus Ex, and each dilemma typically involves judging the fate of mass groups or even few individuals between two evils. Do I allow this terminally ill man suspended in stasis to live with the hope that he can one day recover or do I put him out of his misery? It doesn't affect the game at all, but it's still one of the most haunting decisions I've ever made in a vidya.\n\nAnd that's the genius of Deus Ex, it's a game that sticks. It's story is so massive and so deeply rooted in real life conspiracy and philosophy that it's impossible to decipher in one go. Deus Ex tells a story most films struggle to, it is a sprawling epic that hits hard and never misses. Each little choice feeds into our larger and ever growing fears of our privacy being seized, secret oligarchies, tyranny, anarchy, and forces us ourselves to ask the most important question, "s there any better alternative in a world as ♥♥♥♥ed as ours?"\n\nThe struggle of JC is one I will never forget, and the game itself created the core of modern gaming to say the last. 14 years later and games, and even the creators of the game itself, are still struggling to surpass Deus Ex. It still has the best and most established writing I've encountered in a video game while also allowing for free choice and having the storyline mold around the player. The game's penultimate moment is choosing between three possible endings, and it's still the single hardest decision I've ever encountered in gaming. Each one is dark and depressing but a necessary evil in some eyes and all 3 tie in different philosophical views on humanity and the state of the United States, which become more relevant with each passing day.\n\nIt is a given that the difficulty curve is beyond ridiculous and it takes a heavy investment to know how to create your own style, but it's well worth it. There's an old saying on ♥♥♥♥♥ and is in fact written in the Rules of the Internet, "Every time you mention Deus Ex someone will re-instlal it". But I find this gross, as I can never imagine uninstalling it in the first place. It has been and will probably always be my favourite video game, and what I consider to be among the very top greatest games ever made. I don't rate games but if I had to it'd probably be 9/10, the difficulty curve is Satanic on a first playthrough and the voice acting (Specifically in Hong Kong) at times is hammy at best. But that adds to the charm to me, but I know it isn't universal.\n\nAlso, the soundtrack is beyond Godly,\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxMf4BdVq_g","July 1, 2014","true","40.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Whatsoever. They simply couldn't get past the first level.\n\nYou simply cannot dislike this game.\n\nThere's reasoning behind this. This game ends up the way you want it to be. Murder those terrorists? Go right ahead. Render them unconcious? Sure. But those are common staples of the stealth genre. What about failing your objectives? A certain mission comes to mind. I won't spoil anything, but there is a mission regarding hostage rescue. Most games would make you reload if you cause the kidnappers to kill the hostage. Not Deus Ex. No, you evac in your chopper and are forced to deal with the consequences. This game turns out exactly how you want it to.\n\nMost games have you set as a predetermined character. You're Batman, or Steve, or Recker. But with Deus Ex, you're who you want to be. You want to be a master of stealth, picking off enemies strategically and becoming invisible when sighted? Cool. You want to master Technology, turning enemies' turrets against them, and using security cams to scout up ahead?You can do that. You want to be a tank, running into a room full of guards, guns ablazing, with no clue what might be up ahead, shooting down anything that makes your crosshair turn red, and then some? Thats fine too. You aren't looking through a character's eyes, you are looking through your own.\n\nThe loacations are another matter altogether. You end up visiting the same location three separate times, but every visit you find something new. Your set of objectives is completely different every visit. It doesn't feel repetative, it feels new. You might need to go through the same alley,but you are looking for different things. Things you didnt notice the first time around. It may be the same atmosphere, but there's fresh air every time. The locations you visit only once makes you wish you visited them more. Every time you leave, you wonder if there were secrets you missed, or important items to collect. Everytime the cinematic plays of your helicopter flying away, you just have to wonder of you really did look around every corner, or through every sewer tunnel(yeah, sewer tunnels)\n\nReviews are a bad way to describe this game, as each person's experience is completely unique.

Whatsoever. They simply couldn't get past the first level.\n\nYou simply cannot dislike this game.\n\nThere's reasoning behind this. This game ends up the way you want it to be. Murder those terrorists? Go right ahead. Render them unconcious? Sure. But those are common staples of the stealth genre. What about failing your objectives? A certain mission comes to mind. I won't spoil anything, but there is a mission regarding hostage rescue. Most games would make you reload if you cause the kidnappers to kill the hostage. Not Deus Ex. No, you evac in your chopper and are forced to deal with the consequences. This game turns out exactly how you want it to.\n\nMost games have you set as a predetermined character. You're Batman, or Steve, or Recker. But with Deus Ex, you're who you want to be. You want to be a master of stealth, picking off enemies strategically and becoming invisible when sighted? Cool. You want to master Technology, turning enemies' turrets against them, and using security cams to scout up ahead?You can do that. You want to be a tank, running into a room full of guards, guns ablazing, with no clue what might be up ahead, shooting down anything that makes your crosshair turn red, and then some? Thats fine too. You aren't looking through a character's eyes, you are looking through your own.\n\nThe loacations are another matter altogether. You end up visiting the same location three separate times, but every visit you find something new. Your set of objectives is completely different every visit. It doesn't feel repetative, it feels new. You might need to go through the same alley,but you are looking for different things. Things you didnt notice the first time around. It may be the same atmosphere, but there's fresh air every time. The locations you visit only once makes you wish you visited them more. Every time you leave, you wonder if there were secrets you missed, or important items to collect. Everytime the cinematic plays of your helicopter flying away, you just have to wonder of you really did look around every corner, or through every sewer tunnel(yeah, sewer tunnels)\n\nReviews are a bad way to describe this game, as each person's experience is completely unique. I cannot stress how amazing this game is.\n\n10/10 Everything","August 6, 2014","true","101.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Deus Ex is up there with Bethesda's games in terms of sheer freedom of play. Wanna be stealthy? Go for it. Wanna go balls to the wall guns blazing? No problemo. There's also hacking, lock picking, nano augmentation, hiding bodies, dialog options, multiple endings, you name it. This game was stupidly ahead of its time. Even the story is eerily conspiratorial and prophetic. A dystopian cyberpunk future where global governments use surveillance and engineered pandemics as population control. Did I mention the game predicted the destruction of the WTC at the hands of a terrorist organization? in the year 2000.\n\nNow with that being said, this is an old ♥♥♥ game with wonky shooting and dated graphics.

The plot is definately solid, and the gameplay is smooth but the AI is a bit clunky and oblivious mostly when it comes to Stealth and sneaking. But that can be compensated for on Realistic mode, and the graphics are nothing too special but that's all forgivable since this is a pretty old game, and this game is the ultimate proof that graphics don't mean anything as long as you've got an enjoyable experience one way or another.

Whether you hack, stay in the shadows, or go guns blazing you'll find an element of the levels to meet your needs. Choice is the word, and for the most part every choice is fleshed out very well.

Your behavior is noted by other characters and changes how you interact with them. Sometimes your actions affect their fates as well.

It is exceptionally well-written in every single detail. At first it's funny how it manages to incorporate all the popular conspiracy theories, and it becomes frightening when they all turn out to be true. The way people are kept in line with constant terror alert, the shoot-on-sight cops, and the artificial plague is a very dark vision of the future, but the events since the release of the game suggest that it may be prophetic. The role-playing elements, and the fully interactive environment provide lots of freedom to the player: in every playthrough one can find new ways to complete an objective and discover new details hidden in unexpected places. It is advised to talk to every NPC for several rounds, because almost all of them have something interesting and potentially useful thing to say. Mirrors are rarely found in games for some reason, but, interestingly, in this one they are abundant (unfortunately the character animations are as horrible as the voice acting). The music is also noteworthy, Straylight Productions composed another great soundtrack after their previous work in Unreal.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/realhumanbean/recommended/6910/","realhumanbean","Real Human Bean","http://steamcommunity.com/id/realhumanbean/","500 products in account","Fun Fact: A woman put this game on a chip and implanted i in her skin, that's how much she loved it.\nDeus Ex, which many of you probably know due to the infamous "Bomb" scene, is a true revolutionary by the literal definition. It's a game people seem to respect more than enjoy, but I disagree. It's probably jsut me, but I don't see its age at all, and I still consider to have the best replay value I've ever experienced with a game. Why is that?\n\nOne simple word, choice.\n\nDeus Ex isn't a perfect game. Hell, it has more flaws than I can list, but it does what no other game I've played outside of anything Eidos has made, it gives true free choice, no illusions, no cop-outs, no story routes that converge, true freedom. It counters the world of the game. Deus Ex takes place in a dystopic United States, whose government has seized control of the planet. Paranoia plagues this world after terrorists attacked New York and destroyed the Twin Towers and the Statue of Liberty (This game was made in 2000, what a coincidence) and an anti-terrorist organization named UNATCO polices the world against the terrorist organization, the NSF. You are JC Denton, a cyborg recruit for UNATCO. A plague called the Black Death sweeps the globe, killing off the Proletariat, its cure in the hands of a select few in power. Suspicions are raised, questions are asked, paranoia grows. Is the government sacrificing freedom for safety? Where has this plague come from? What is the true intention of UNATCO?\n\nAnd that's about all I can say without spoiling. The game has enough twists and turns to make even M. Night Shaymalan blush. The game is everything you'd expect from a dystopic sci-fi fiction combined. Everything is thrown into the melting pot of conspiracy: the MIB, Illuminati, the Templars, evil corporations, Area 51, hushed up alien landings, gene-splicing experiments, the debate of man VS cyborg, and self aware AI are all crucial to the plot. The result leaves you as paranoid and confused as any other person living in this time, and the morality of good VS evil become decisively grey.\n\nThere is unbound choice and freedom in Deus Ex. Being an RPG that just so happens to be in first person, the game doesn't have a black and white good or evil morality system. Instead, the storyline judges you from the sidelines in secret. The choices you make don't really matter (Some are a tad more advantageous) and none prevent you from unlocking a new skill or getting a new ending. There are an infinite ways to solve a scenario. Facing a boss? You can run away! You can knock them out if you wish (it is entirely possible to beat the game without killing anyone if you try hard enough). Need to break into a building? You can kill everyone and walk in, you can crawl through nearby sewers, you can hack the security to turn on the guards or disable it altogether, the list goes on.\n\nDeus Ex is also something most modern games struggle to be, it's balanced. Throughout the game you can score new Augmentations, cyborg superpowers. Each Aug is a choice between two different play styles. Do you want the Aug that makes your footsteps silent or do you want the one that makes you run faster and jump higher (Go with the 2nd actually, it is so much more beneficial for creative players)? Being an old RPG shooter, EVERYTHING requires skill points, but unlike System Shock 2 (A very similar game) the game doesn't punish you for investing in other skills (Though if you stupid and just fully max Poison Resistance and Swimming then you're ♥♥♥♥ed) because each scenario can be solved in so many ways and each way rewards a different playstyle.\n\nThe choices in Deus Ex are some of the hardest I've ever had to make in any game. No, no choice gives you a different gun or anything and they don't affect the game, but there's deep rooted philosophical questions and ideals tied to every choice. The title is derived from "Deus Ex Machina", "God of the Machine", which means that no matter how hopeless a scenario is, something good will come out of it. That being said, I can not think of a more ironic title for a game as this one. Nothing good comes out of Deus Ex, and each dilemma typically involves judging the fate of mass groups or even few individuals between two evils. Do I allow this terminally ill man suspended in stasis to live with the hope that he can one day recover or do I put him out of his misery? It doesn't affect the game at all, but it's still one of the most haunting decisions I've ever made in a vidya.\n\nAnd that's the genius of Deus Ex, it's a game that sticks. It's story is so massive and so deeply rooted in real life conspiracy and philosophy that it's impossible to decipher in one go. Deus Ex tells a story most films struggle to, it is a sprawling epic that hits hard and never misses. Each little choice feeds into our larger and ever growing fears of our privacy being seized, secret oligarchies, tyranny, anarchy, and forces us ourselves to ask the most important question, "s there any better alternative in a world as ♥♥♥♥ed as ours?"\n\nThe struggle of JC is one I will never forget, and the game itself created the core of modern gaming to say the last. 14 years later and games, and even the creators of the game itself, are still struggling to surpass Deus Ex. It still has the best and most established writing I've encountered in a video game while also allowing for free choice and having the storyline mold around the player. The game's penultimate moment is choosing between three possible endings, and it's still the single hardest decision I've ever encountered in gaming. Each one is dark and depressing but a necessary evil in some eyes and all 3 tie in different philosophical views on humanity and the state of the United States, which become more relevant with each passing day.\n\nIt is a given that the difficulty curve is beyond ridiculous and it takes a heavy investment to know how to create your own style, but it's well worth it. There's an old saying on ♥♥♥♥♥ and is in fact written in the Rules of the Internet, "Every time you mention Deus Ex someone will re-instlal it". But I find this gross, as I can never imagine uninstalling it in the first place. It has been and will probably always be my favourite video game, and what I consider to be among the very top greatest games ever made. I don't rate games but if I had to it'd probably be 9/10, the difficulty curve is Satanic on a first playthrough and the voice acting (Specifically in Hong Kong) at times is hammy at best. But that adds to the charm to me, but I know it isn't universal.\n\nAlso, the soundtrack is beyond Godly,\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxMf4BdVq_g","July 1, 2014","true","40.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Deus Ex is a first person shooter/RPG hybrid, regarded by many as the best game ever made. Is it? In my opinion, no, but it is still a great game. If you've played System Shock or Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines, you should feel right at home here.\n\nLet's get a few of the 'bad' things out of the way first, the things I've seen a lot of people ♥♥♥♥♥ and moan about on here and on Metacritic. First off, yes the game is ugly. Look at the screenshots before you buy it. If you don't like how it looks, then don't buy it, simple. The graphics are bad, the character models are fairly wooden, and the voice acting is so bad it's good. Oh, and the default key bindings are pretty bad. But you know what? You can re-map the keys. So it's really a non-issue.\n\nOnto the good stuff. This game focuses a lot on inventory management. It's like an old RE title, or Diablo II, where you have only so much room in your inventory for items. So you'll constantly be wondering if it's worth it to carry around the huge flamethrower or keep a couple of pistols and a sword; personally I find this a great change in pace from some games that just let you carry around everything.\n\nThe sheer level of character customization is crazy. You get skill points, but only at certain points; you gain nothing from defeating enemies, unlocking doors, etcetera. When you find a secret room or explore a certain area, you get skill points, and you get them from completing objectives. Then its up to you where to put them. Pistols, rifles, melee combat, explosives, pickings locks, swimming, healing, and more. You can't master them all (withoug exploting a bug late game) so you have to manage the skill points wisely. On top of that, you can find countless modifications for your guns, among them recoil, reload speed, range, scopes, and laser sights.\n\nOh, and and on top of that, you have several slots for augmentations to your body to give you healing power, quicker speed, strength, defense, and more. But you only have so many slots, and the augmentation items you find carry two for one slot. So do you take health regeneration, or an energy shield? There are so many ways to customize the character to your playstyle it is really astounding.\n\nThe levels themselves a huge and allow for a variety of routes. In the first mission, I was looking for the person I needed to speak to for my objective; he was to allow me to get into the building where my foes were. Instead I found a big stack of boxes and jumped up on them until I got to the roof, totally bypassing that part of the mission. Later on, if you're careful and look everywhere and make the right decisions, you can even find information to skip entire boss fights.\n\nThe story can be a bit on the confusing side, but it's well written and takes into account a lot of different conspiracy theories from the real world. I can't say to much without spoiling it so I'll leave it to you to figure it out.\n\nSo should you get this game? Yes, absolutely. For $6.99, it's practically stealing.","May 10, 2014","true","51.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It was a surprise because when I first playt the game  I thought it was awful because of the aged graphics but with time I started it to love the game. It was very addictive and coudnt stop playing its was really weird; the gameplay for that time was amazing and i played a lot of old games and the mayority of them the gameplay is not that good and with reason, they are old.\n\nThe story makes you to keep going  even when their  faces aren't even moving  while talking; its just the the story and the script that is so good and even the voices some aren't very good but the game has that something that  make you like it. I personally don't like old games, I dont play much of them. When I play some its because I want to play the games from the beggining and dont miss anything when I play their secuels.\n\nWell for me it s a big 10/10. No regrets at all.

If you're a fan of futuristic settings or the cyberpunk science fiction genre as I am, Deus Ex's storyline and environments should be right up your alley.\nSet in 2052, you take on the role of JC Denton (JC supposedly refers to Jesus Christ) a rookie to an anti-terrorist organization called UNATCO. But things quickly get out of control and you are soon involved in a huge conspiracy involving various factions - including the Illuminati and the Hong Kong Triads, as you travel over the world to unravel this conspiracy.\nThe game allows a great deal of freedom and various choices - you will also have a few multiple endings to achieve.

Even better than Final Fantasy VII, better than Tomb Raider, better than Unreal Tournament, Counter Strike and Command and Conquer. It's like totally awesome.\n\nSo how what exactly is so awesome about Dues Ex? Well everything (apart from maybe the graphics).\n\nThe Story is truly excellent, an exciting and compelling cyber punk narrative about huge companies conspiring to maximise profits at the expense of peoples lives (sounds far fetched I know)....what's truly great is the game gives you scope as a player to make meaningful choices that affect the story in large, sweeping ways. OK, that's just not true, though the choices in the game feel really significant and weighty, they don't have a large impact on the story itself (for example one choice is the decision between killing an important character in different ways, but ultimately she's toast) but the fact these choices exist was at the time groundbreaking and led to a real sense of investment in the world.\n\nThe gameplay is satisfyingly emergent, you have the choice to approach different scenarios like Snowden (by hacking), Clinton (being duplicitious) or Putin (by using overwhelming force) or some combination of the three. This ties into the character you have designed in a very natural way (so you can choose to make a cyber specialist if you love the Matrix, a character who can sneak around like Corvo in Dishonoured or, if your big and stupid like me, just tote a huge rocket launcher around blowing everything to smithereens). This leads to a real sense of creativity and fun as well as giving the game tonnes of replayability as it feels deeply cool to solve the same problem in multiple ways.\n\nThe writing of the game is intelligent, and uses sweet science fiction technology like super powerful AI's and cloning to ask questions concering the nature of humanity and consciousness, the trade off between security and liberty (still very relevant in the digital age) and to what extent (if any) we should avoid using lethal force in the fight against "terrorists" (an argument which came up recently in UK politics thanks to Corbyn). There's some scenes in the game where JC (the protaganist / antihero) will simply debate concepts like nationalism versus individualism or the tendency of power to corrupt (as in Cicero's famous dictum) and his opponents will present compelling counterarguments of their own (and awesome lines like "God was the dream of good government"). The nuanced, slightly ambigous, "grey" tones of these discourses matches the grim cyperpunk pallette of the landscape without descending into nihilism or a feeling of futlity.\n\nThe game even manages to work as a power trip in certain moments as JC can turn invisible, set huge ED 209-esque robots against one another and (with the help of an overpowered augment) regenerate his health like you were playing call of duty. Yet at the same time the game (despite what some will tell you) clearly does not want you to play the game like a mindless shooter, on the hardest difficulty setting the easiest, most cannon-fodderry baddies can kill you with one shot to the noggin and cute Sir Killalot robots will shred you in seconds.\n\nThe game isn't perfect, as stated the graphics are average, the game arguably gets easier as you get through it and the choices are largely illusory. Yet it's clever and engaging, memorable and  fresh.","January 14","true","40.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It brings you into a world where every conspiracy you've ever heard of is true.  The Illuminatti, the Majestic 12, the myths about Area 51, every one of them.  Then they ask you, what kind of person are you?  Every choice you make has reprecussions.  Every person you kill has their blood on your hands.  Every door that is opened shuts another.  What kind of world will there be when your journey is done?\n\nNotes:  This game is UGLY and requires internet patches to get working on Modern computers, however once you enter the world you won't want to leave without seeing everything through to the bitter end.

Ya surely saw this quote somewhere on the internet, but how can this old game made in 2000 is so damn important? Is it enjoyable? Does it hold up to today's standards? You shall see these answers in this review!\n\nThe game takes place in 2052 where the world is plagued with the Gray Death and some people are desperate to recieve a vaccine called "Ambrosia" with any dangerous means. You play as JC Denton, the agent of UNATCO which protects people from terrorist organizations, until your brother left and joined the terrorists, while the organization you work on wants him dead without giving any information you want to know why. Why your brother did that? What is UNATCO hiding? I cannot spoil further. But I can guarantee that you will meet many conspiracies related to it.\n\n\nWhen it comes to the graphics, in 2000 it was really amazing what you could do with Unreal Engine 1. Today it is pretty much outdated but there are still some modifications that lets you play on higher quality graphics such as DirectX 10 Deus Ex with New Vision and HD models installed. If you are really bothered with normal graphics then get em, if not then enjoy how Unreal Engine 1 did in 90s if used correctly.\n\nThe gameplay is outstanding. Despite it is a FPS game, it also has some RPG elements on it and no ya dn't level up. Instead you recieve Skill points that you can spend to upgrade your skills. The Skill Points are recieved if you complete any main objectives along with side missions, yet there are also recieved as a bonus if you use a different route.\n\nNow we are talking about the 1st main thing...You have multiple choices in this game, if you want to concentrate more in getting past undetected, lockpick the lock, hack the terminal and use turrets to do your job? It is possible. Going gun-blazing and use any tricks you have at the disposal to deal with the enemies? CHECK. Also any action you take in a populated area may affect your progress as well!\n\nNow the 2nd main thing about this game are...augmentations. You can modify your body parts with the correct augmentation to gain more sweet stuff that can be used anywhere and change your gameplay style and upgrade them!. Be aware that there are limited slots for some body parts to modify. Wanna go invisible and jump really high and run fast at the same time like a ninja? YOU CAN. But be aware though that there is a limited energy for using augmentation so if you have multiple augs on, then deal with the fact that you may run out of them pretty fast.\n\nThere is a lot of weapons in this game yet using them depends on your skill level and you can upgrade them with the correct kit for more interesting results, except these two some weapons can use different ammo which some enemies are weak against it. For example using the Sabot shells will allow you to deal more damage against robots than the Buckshot shells. Combining your weaponry with augs may give you great results like using Targeting aug at the level 2 with laser sight pistol lets you sniper your enemies without wasting any ammo for sniper rifle or use the Agressive Defense System with Balistic Protection augs and shotgun to become a tank which no missile or bombs won't hurt you.\n\nThe music in the game fits perfectly for any situation and the world itself filled with cutting edge technology and the dialogues may be cheesy but funny while the weapons gives some oomph when you fire.\n\nIf you consider getting this for a low price then DO IT! It is worth any money for not only how amazing this game is but as well as game mods that give even more dramatic changes in the gameplay to make it more fun such as The Nameless Mod and other.","December 18, 2010","true","30.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Well, it's hard to believe. Game is about future so does it's codes too. Too many details for an old game. For example, I went to women restroom and I got caught then she tell on the boss about me and he chew out. Whatever, game is really good for it's release date. You can upgrade your skills by completing missions, exploring areas or using speacial ways to accomplish missions. Also you have a technological body so you can add yourself some Augmentations and you can upgrade them by finding Augmentation Upgrade Canisters. You can hack computers, bypass the secure codes and lockpick the doors. These are too hard for you? Just poke around a little bit and you'll find the nano keys for doors, security codes and logins to computers. So this is what this game like.

One of those occasions had occurred recently and Deus Ex was my choice at the time.\n\nBy many still considered the best PC gaming has to offer, I must say I was surprised how easily I got dragged into this game. Even though the graphics were decent for its time, starting out with a classic like this was a tad hard for me. One cannot ignore the fact that computer screens in overall had a lower resolution back then so these textures and models did look better (that, and expectations were on par with what technologically was possible). However, the combination of most audiovisual aspects and game content blend in perfectly, creating a convincing atmosphere and compelling plot (and worth mentioning is that this plot is a sequel to Deus Ex: Human Revolution). Another thing Deus Ex does right is its gameplay, because even though this isn't advertised as an RPG, it does a better job at being one than, say, Final Fantasy 12. The character development is absolutely rock solid!\n\nWhen I add all of this up I can only conclude how this game is a masterpiece for its time and still well worth a playthrough today. It's also worth mentioning that there are several mods improving texture and model quality to something more fitting for today's technological level, though I haven't really used any of those.\n\nVerdict: definitely buy. This game offers a lot of content, more than today's standards.","April 27, 2013","true","7.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","4"

Though the graphics and sound have not stood up well to the test of time, the gameplay alone can still hold its own against that of modern games. This is coming from someone that didn't play Deus Ex back in 2000 when it was released -- my first experience with it came a decade afterwards. Even with all of 2010's shiny, new games, the one thing I kept thinking about Deus Ex was, "This plays like a game that was released today."\n\nIf you consider yourself a fan of all games (and can forgive the older ones for showing their age) then you owe it to yourself to play Deus Ex. It is an amazing game that completely deserves all of its praise, as well as the place of honor it holds in the annals of video game history.","October 5, 2011","true","37.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game has a unique story in the game industry.  It makes the gamer keep playing just to see how the story will unveil. It is also possible to reach the goals by various ways, not just the standard go forward and shoot approach. You can approach a goal by sneaking, by finding different paths, or by shooting everything on sight. The last option usually does not work.\n\nThere are a few places where you can make a choice that changes the story a bit, and that makes the replayability of the game amazing.\n\nIt is a great game to be replayed every year!","April 19, 2014","true","1.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is one of many places where I need to call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on metascore, because it deserves more than 90. I would not go as far as to say it deserves a full ace, but about 96-97? Sure.\n\nBack when it came out, it was the biggest deal. Sure, Half-life laid the foundation for FPS games, but this game is no mere FPS. It is an RPG, and an excellent one at that. Comparing it to other old-school RPGs, it would always come out on top for me.\n\nThe best feature of this game is, it does not stop you from finding your own solutions to problems. Say there is a laser tripwire that sets of an alarm. You can solve this problem in so many different ways. You can run through and shoot your way through. You can hack the control panel. You can find one of usually at least two ways around it. Or, alternatively, you can stack up some boxes and jump over it. The game will not stop you.\n\nAlso, everything you do actually matters. It matters if you go lethal or peaceful, it matters if you talk to people or not, it matters if you explore and it affects the game, and the story. It is up to this day, one of the most sublime non-linear RPGs on the market.\n\nThe story is very good, provided you are into conspiracy theories. The hero, JC Denton will struggle with or against UNATCO, the UN, US government, NSF and even the Illuminati. To avoid spoilers, I will just say that the conception is just fantastic, but you need to experience it yourself.\n\nThe graphics don't hold up today, unfortunately, but a true connesieur will be able to look past that, as lack of graphical fidelity is the case with many games of the past age. The soundtrack makes up for it, though. This is one of many cases where music from a game is a real piece of art.\n\nYou would do yourself a great service if you bought this game and played it to completion. It bears the name of a classic with pride, and does not disappoint. After a little bit of tinkering it will run at 1080p, and the controls are fully customizable, so you should make do with those somewhat clunky mechanics.\n\nIt is really that good. And dirt cheap too. Take my word, and pick it up.\n\nDeus Ex gets my 0451/10","May 30","true","38.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has spoilers, so consider yourself warned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy JC Denton was a good agent. In the field, he was an intelligent, efficient snipe-happy hacker, with a pistol for emergencies. (Side note: Silenced sniper rifle + laser-sight pistol, both at Advanced skill level =OP.)\n\nHowever, when he infiltrated the building Paul Denton told him to to show him that UNATCO was corrupt, my JC mixed up his objectives and went to the roof, where the satellite dish he was supposed to change if Paul was correct was located, instead of the basement, where the proof was. This was a bit of a dilemma.\n\nThen my JC Denton had an epiphany.\n\nHe realized that he would work for whichever side allowed him to shoot, loot, and hack as much as possible. So right then and there, my JC hacked the satellite dish and looted what was inside, betraying his country for some immediate cheap thrills. Don't get me wrong, he wasn't psychotic; my JC was just extremely vindictive, self-righteous, and challenge-seeking, and he had a lot of guns.\n\nHe then went through the rest of the game, shooting and looting and hacking all over the place, and when the time came, he took the only sensible option and merged with Helios.\n\nDeus Ex has a lot of problems. It looks awful, there aren't enough character options for the action-oriented player, the voice acting is atrocious, and some enemies have way too much health (lookin' at you, greasels). However, any game with this amount of player choice and understanding of the player (one time, when lost and trying to leave a cathedral, I walked up to a French chef and JC promptly asked how the hell to get out of there) deserves whatever recommendations it can get.\n\nSeriously though, f*ck all the transgenics.","April 25, 2015","true","44.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That may sound like a empty statement, but trust me, it isn't. This game is one of the classics and considered to be one of the best games of all time.\nBut there are some downsides. I mean, really big downsides. Look at Half Life (1998) and then look at Deus Ex (2000). Noticed something? Yeah? Deus Ex looks bad. Really bad. Beyond bad. It's funny that Half Life came out two years earlier and still looks better than Deus Ex 1 does.\nThe first few Levels (Liberty Island, etc.) are really memorable, but they also may be a tiny bit difficult for newcomers , due to the lack of acquired skills and augmentations.\n\nOkay, so now we're finished talking about the bad parts. But why is this game so good?\nEasy. Back in 2000 when we were still afraid of approaching the new millenium, FPSs\nwere good, and they were getting better all the time (Systemshock2, Half Li...I think you know where I'm going with this).

You play as JC Denton an augmented rookie agent working for UNATCO.\n\nThe gameplay takes the form of 1st Person with many Role Playing elements, such as skill points. The game also incorperates narrative paths, and many ways to complete a single objective, an example would be the first mission of the game, your objectives are to rescue a fellow agent and capture a mamber of the Terrorist group, the NSF. This mission you can sneak in by looking for an easier was to get in than the front entrance, or you can just run in and kill everything. It is also possible to access the computer terminals either by retrieving the the log in credentials, or by hacking the terminal. Some terminals allow you to disable cameras, or change who a gun turret may fire at. Referring back to the first mission, you can access a gun turret near the entrance, lure the guards out and watch them get taken out by the turret.\n\nWithout spoiling too much, the game takes place in a cyberpunk-esque future of the year 2052, involving conspiricy theories, etc. I won't go further into the story as I feel it is something that needs to be experienced by the player themselves in their own way.\n\nThe sound of the game is wonderful, the music is really good, with some tracks that really standout such as UNATCO HQ theme, the Main Theme and many others, the music of the game changes depending on the current situation, such as when you are in combat, the music will change to a more upbeat and urgent rendition of the standard level theme.\nAlong with the Music of the game, the Voice acting is rather mixed through the game, with some characters being playing incredibly and then others quite poorly, for example, later through the game you arrive at Hong Kong, where you are greeted to stereotypical Asian accents, that may even be consided offensive to some.\nThe sound effects of this game aren't really overly amazing, they seem rather average, but aren't bad and don't negatively impact the experience.\n\nThe game to some may seem quite difficult, as it just throws you in the game and you have to figure a lot out your self. While I prefer this than having my hand held, it's understandable that some may not like out. The highest difficulty of the game, Realistic, is quite difficult in many ways, such as headshots are insta-kills, so you may find yourself dead a lot when spotted, but this is also the same the other way around, headshots are also insta-kills to your enemies too.\n\nOnce you have finished the game, I recommend multiple playthroughs of this to experience it multiple ways, however, if you feel like breathing new life into this, then there are some fantastic mods currently out, or in development, here are some of the mods that I myself have used that I think are incredible. I have split them into ones that I feel are fine to use on a first playthrough and ones that I think should be used on subsequent playthroughs.\n\nFine For First Playthroughs\nHDTP -\nThis mod greatly enhances the models of the game, however, this is only in Beta so some of the models aren't updated which really stand out.\nRelease 1 - http://www.moddb.com/mods/project-hdtp\nBeta (Requires Release 1) - http://offtopicproductions.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=11566\n\nNew Vision -\nThis mod greatly enhances the textures of this game, this mod has had its final release and will receive no further updates.\nhttp://www.moddb.com/mods/new-vision\n\nDirectX 10 Renderer -\nWhile this mod doesn't change much on by default, it allows you to use to use detail textures, modify FOV, Anti-Aliasing, Anisotropic Filtering, better lighting and improved draw distance. I also get much better performance on this renderer than any of the others out there.\nhttp://kentie.net/article/d3d10drv/\n\nKentie Deus EXE -\nThis is an improved launcher for the game that includes loading of mods from their own folders, setting custom resolutions and enabling/disabling GUI scaling, among other features.\nhttp://kentie.net/article/dxguide/index.htm\n\nSubsequent Playthroughs\nShifter -\nThis mod is a fantastic mod that changes so much, it includes addictional Augmentations, Unique Weapons, Random NPC Inventory, Alt-Fire, Additional Skill System and Better AI.\nhttp://www.moddb.com/mods/shifter1\n\nDeus Ex Revision -\nThis is a mod that I have only recently started using, it's quite new and still in development, there is a demo of the mod available but the final release is expected some time in 2014, it is a reimagining of the game, it changes the levels of the game, but leaves the story as is. It is nice to go through the game with this mod for the level changes as while it isn't a huge difference, it is nice for the slight changes of the layout and enemy positions.\nhttp://www.moddb.com/mods/deus-ex-revision\n\nOverall I feel that this is a must play game and that it should be played by everyone at least once. I highly recommend this game for anyone.","November 30, 2013","true","30.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

A new plague, known as the Gray Death, is spreading rapidly with no cure; only a vaccine known as Ambrosia can prevent infection, and only if you can keep taking it. Worst of all, production is extremely limited and most of it is rationed out to key government and utility workers. You play as UNATCO (United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition) agent J.C. Denton, fresh out of the academy, on his first mission to reacquire a supply of Amrbosia that has been stolen by the terrorist group NSF (National Secessionist Forces). But it doesn't take long to figure out that something much more sinister is going on.\n\nDeus Ex features incorporates conspiracy theries (Illuminati, Trilateral Commission, Knights Templar, Majestic 12, etc) into a well-integrated cyberpunk storyline. It is the most cerebral game I've ever played, which focuses on the ideas of liberty and authority with very intelligent dialogue.\n\nThe gameplay is incredible as well. Deus Ex is a FPS/RPG hybrid and the best I've seen in it's genre. You gain skill points that you can invest into different skills, such as Heavy Weaponry, Lockpicking, or Medicine. You also receive nano-augmentations throughout the game that can be toggled on or off at the expense of bioelectrical enegry, such as Quiet Movement or Invisibility.\n\nThe only downside to this game, if you want to call it that, is that the graphics are outdated as the game came out in 2000. However, there are lots of mods that improve things like texture quality which make the game more visually pleasing. If you were a PC gamer around the time though (Half Life, Unreal, Tribes, etc) then it shouldn't phase in you the least bit.\n\nPlay this game NOW.

Its one of those games where you never want to really finish it because its so good, you dont want to see the ending come just yet.

I highly suggest you hop into it if you ever have a weekend to get ingulfed in a game. The first 2 levels arent top tier by any means, so dont let  them drive you off like they made me for awhile.\n\n\nI played this in 2014, and loved it.

Regarded as an incredibly influential game of it's time which it is greatly known for it's ability to know players actions, referred to as a breakthrough in emergent gameplay and through experimentation secret dialogues and other rewards unlock, it's art direction, atmosphere and surpisingly, it's scale, intelligent design and humor help deliver an intense, conspiracy-themed world.\n\nDeus Ex's engine was written in the Unreal Engine 1 at the time it was made, housing coloured lightmaps, skeletal animation, sprite-based particle effects and qutie a bit more.\n\nGameplay\nDeus Ex is a hybrid of First Person Shooter and Role Playing elements. Though semi-linear, there is many quests to do in the game which offers a challenge and reward of skill points or weapons/upgrades. These upgrades improve Denton's ability to hack, swim, shoot certain types of weapons, jump higher, regenerate health, deactivate security restrictions such as a locked door to an armory or shop.\n\nCriticisms; Minor\nDeus Ex is very clunky gameplay wise, so it will take a bit of time for you to get used to it if you've never played Deus Ex before.\n\nDeus Ex's level design can be confusing.\n\nGunplay\nThe gunplay varies, you can use literally everything from Crowbars, Tasers to Rocket Launchers and Turrets (with the help of a skill) to take down enemies or you can use stealth and toss a throwing knife into his throat. Varied in it's approach to pretty much combat or lack of it.\n\nMusic\nDeus Ex music is focused heavily upon eletronic and classical hybrids. It is dynamic and very beat heavy - influenced in a unique way by the players actions. assualting friendlies will cause the music to be suddenly rough, choatic classic electronica hybrid ochestra (yes, it is THAT good) to a calm, placid ambient drone that heals the ears when visiting the bustling cities when walking around or sneaking.\n\nGraphics\nThe Unreal 1 engnine was updated in Deus Ex to allow for coloured lightmaps, textured shading, mipmapping, skeletal animation (to include more advanced animations). Though Deus Ex paled in graphics in comparison to other games, the world is still believable and large for it's time. Due to the expandability, the source code and SDK's packaged with Deus Ex, this produced many modifications from graphical, gameplay and to minor changes such as changes to HUD.\n\nMechanics\nDeus Ex uses a 'Skill Point' design to allocated a fixed price of skill points which are earned by doing quests, use of dialogue, clever exploration or by experimenting.\n\nStoryline\nDeus Ex revolves around J.C Denton, an officer at UNATCO. UNATCO is an anti-terrorist organisation founded after the Statue of Liberty was blown up by NSF terrorist forces. J.C Denton is sent with his brother Paul Denton to find the plague that haunts civilizations with an atmosphere of death and control. The player finds out more and more about the sinister plague and the lack of Ambrosia, its cure. This leads you, the player into finding out much more than what meets the eye as you find leads all round the world.\n\nDeus Ex awards exploration, inquistiveness and theres tons of hidden content, including story, items, mini-quests and lets you play as if it were an open-world and it gets better from there! Many, many guns to choose from, many ways to play stealthy or violently.","March 30, 2014","true","73.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Game is built around exploration but the punishing combat mechanics will see you mashing that quicksave key or lose precious progress to a two second firefight that didn't go in your favor. (Bots that aren't using sniper rifles shouldn't be able to instant kill headshot you.)\n\nThey coupled together a magnificent soundtrack with the most hilarious (so bad it's good) voice acting I've heard in quite awhile. Ye olde countable polygons and short drawdistances (complete with fog) reminiscent to the N64 and playstation radiate an unsettling vibe similar to the first couple Tomb Raider games.\n\nDespite an emphasis on multiple interlocking branching paths in each map, thirty hours is quite awhile for the mechanics to start feeling formulaic. It boils down to finding the keys/login information/rockets/lockpicks/hack tools you'll need to open the next door and then pulling up the item or information and punching it in. Augmentations should have been passive and not reliant on yet ANOTHER finite bar of constnatly depleting energy. If you're going to make your game dark as all hell (as opposed to orange) the flashlight shoudln't sap your energy leaving you potentially irrevocably blind. The cache of items you can hold is unforgivably small and the firearms are HORRENDOUSLY IMABLANCED. I put every upgrade onto the assault rifle and it still couldn't carry its own weight. You only need the pistol, crossbow, dragontooth, stun baton, and of course the gep gun.\n\nA masterpiece in it's own time.\n\nAlso there's an irritating bug that crashes the game about two thirds of the way in on the frigate escape.","January 19, 2014","true","32.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","6"

Deus Ex (DX1) one falls emphatically into the latter category. If you have never played this game, you have missed out big time. Because video game graphics have advanced so much that the default graphics will make it hard for any new player to play without cringing. However, thanks to moddb.com, you can install a high definition mod that will improve the graphics of the game immensely! (HDTP, New Vision to name a couple. There are even elaborate guides out there to make the graphics great)\n\nThe RPG elements in this game were revolutionary. So much realism in the gameplay for a game that was released in 2000. So much thought/philosophy/depth/insight put into the storyline, you would've thought Christopher Nolan had a part to play in writing it; many little details in the game have meaning and consequence; a newspaper lying around, your conversations with people, how much you kill/explore. The music is so well composed it will stay with you long after you have finished the game, more like haunt you. This game will put you in a reminiscing trance. I first played the preview for this game in 2001, then played the full version 2-3 times over until 2008. And after I got my new gaming rig, I played it one final time in May 2014 with all graphical enhancement mods.\n\nI've probably set incredibly high expectations for anyone who has yet to play the game, but it really is the best single-player game I've ever played, and I've played many shooters out there. Just play it with an open mind, knowing that it was a game built more than a decade ago. The AI behavior isn't something to ride home about.\n\nIf you played Deus Ex III: Human Revolution and thought that game was brilliant and immersive. That game is a remake of this one in so many ways. DX1 won several game of the year awards, and at least one game of the decade that I know of. All that has got to account for something.","January 28, 2014","true","43.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ravingmonk/recommended/6910/","ravingmonk","MONTY","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ravingmonk/","68 products in account","Ignore the cheesy cutscene at the start. Ignore the awful graphics, the dodgy AI, the bugs - just bear with it for the first hour. The first few missions are basically tutorials; a prologue establishing the atmosphere, the sense that you're merely a pawn in a larger conflict, and how you want to play the game. Then, the twist comes and your thrust into a world of conspiracy, corruption, and moral ambiguity.\n\nThe huge levels and the amount of choices available makes 'Deus Ex' exceptionally replayable also. You may be surprised to find that there are many sandbox elements. There are many areas with large volumes of NPC's who can be toyed with, as well as many hidden nooks and crannies. Exploration will usually reward you with additional story, rare items, or both. Regrettably, these areas only show up after the first mission.\n\nOnce you get used to the combat, you'll find it smooth. The abundance of open areas means sniping is possibly the most rewarding option of the game. But there are also flamethrowers, rocket-launchers, grenades that can be turned into mines, plasma-rifles, assault-rifles that can also throw bombs, and a LIGHTSABER (well, it's not called that...but it totally is) Plus you can apply upgrades that turn you invisible, regenerate your health, lift heavy objects, see though walls, deploy a remote-controlled missile, and can make you jump like your in 'The Matrix.'\n\nOf course, 'Deus Ex' is at heart a roleplaying game - even though it has plenty of FPS and stealth elements. Unlike 'System Shock 2,' you can pick up any weapon and use it...but you'll be terrible. You'll move like a drunkard if you pick up a rocket launcher untrained, you'll aim like a drunkard if you try sniping, and you'll hit like a drunkard if you try melee. But you can still pick them up in an emergency. (The only thing you can't do untrained is hack computers.)\n\n'Deus Ex' is bugged, but whilst it may sound odd, it's bugged in a quirky way that only breaks the immersion if you want it to. You can use mines to climb up buildings to reach places your not supposed to get to until later - which often causes NPC's to completely freak out. You can cheat during boss-battles by setting mine-traps, throwing TNT at them mid-conversation, or just running past them. Enemies won't attack you whilst  in the shower out of politeness, and Paris nightclub guards won't care if you murder someone before their very eyes. Finally, you can get the entire Anti-Terrorism squad to attack a vaccum-cleaner. My advice is play the game straight first time, then spend every playthrough afterwards trying to see how you can turn 'Deus Ex' from serious cyberpunk-thriller into hilarious funland.\n\nThe recent 'Deus Ex: Human Revolution' is worth your time, but it can't hold a candle to it's grandfather. Whilst it might seem uninuitive and difficult to begin with: stay with it. You will be rewarded with one of the best games ever made.","December 7, 2013","true","163.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is deep and draws from major conspiracy theories (Ex. Illuminate,Chupucabra, The Mothman). As you progress through the game you will gather skill points. All skills have 4 levels:\nUntrained\nTrained\nAdvanced\nMaster\nThe game is very balanced, until you get a master skill in weapons. You see as you progress in weapons the changes are noticeable but not tremendously game changing, but... once you hit master in a weapons category.... you are GOD. My pistol (as long as I am aiming at somebody) can't miss. I have put 4 accuracy mods (each pumping up the accuracy by 2% I think) and all I have to do is aim above the torso and everybody DIES. There are many skills to talk about, such as lockpicking and bypassing electronics. You can open any door and bypass any alarm as long as you have enough multitools (electronic lockpicks) and enough lockpicks (well um... not-electronic lockpick). But a person who is not trained in the lockpicking and elctronics skills will leave more broken lockpicks and shorted out multitools than a minecrafter leaves behind broken pickaxes and shovels. So investing in those skills is not necessary but it really helps (but a word to the wise NEVER INVEST IN SWIMMING THERE WILL NEVER BE A TIME WHERE SWIMMING IS REQUIRED TO GET TO A OBJECTIVE! IT IS A VERY STUPID IDEA!) However by far the best part about this game is that it has more freedom of choice than any other game out there. There are literally hundreds of ways to solve a objective. Let's say you need to recover sensitive data about your organization.What do you want to do? Do you want to equip your trusty plasma rifle (heavy weapons) and go in guns blazing, or do you want to sneak in and quietly neutralisethe guards, or how about you hack that computer you didn't even know about and flood the entire building with lethal amounts of radiation then equip a hazmat suit and grab the data without ever pulling the trigger, or maybe you bribe that terrorist guard you didn't even know had dialouge and have him gat the data for you. Well what do you choose, I mean you don't have to, you can find your own way in (THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE SWIMMING NICK!) because there are definetly more options that I haven't found yet. Okay you got the data and you ar eleaving the area WHEN SUDDENLY! The terrorist leader appears! As far as you know he is a very bad guy! He has killed friends of yours before and he will probably do so again! He asks for the data and he will kill your brother if you don't give it to him! Now it appears that there are only two options, BUT WHAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW EAS THAT AFTER YOU MAKE YOUR DECISION IN THAT BRIEF TIME THAT HE WAS HEADING TO HIS CAR... you could put a bullet straight through the back of his head. You know the dozen armed men that he broght with him will be SUPER ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you did that, but hey you are super badass JC Denton you probably have a way out of this predicament already... or maybe you never got into that situation at all.....","August 17, 2014","true","43.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is deep and long and worth telling. The gameplay is RPG told through the first person perspective, and it refelcts accordingly. Your abilities are limited but progress to your desires.\n\nThe dystopian cyberpunk vibe is both exhilerating and creepy at the same time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PutYoGwassesOn/recommended/6910/","PutYoGwassesOn","Gubs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PutYoGwassesOn/","87 products in account","Fifteen years and some forty save files later I'm STILL finding new things almost every time I open this game. It's amazing that Deus Ex managed to pack enough worthwhile content to make every playthrough feel unique, and not just in the game's scenarios themselves, but how you handle them. Every single weapon and aug has potential to do great things depending on how you build your character, with the exception of extremely situational, one use items like the P2000, or gimmicky augs like the Spybot.\n\nDeus Ex is a game that's hard to compare to others, because of how neatly the package is tied together. It's the way the atmospheric elements like music or even something as simple as lighting combine with the meandering you'll end up doing in the game's hub-worlds, and the hubs are where Deus Ex becomes a completely different expirience. Sure it's fun to play one of the good ol' linear levels with fairly straightforward objectives, but the sprawling, open areas are where the game goes from an explosive action flick to a gritty neo-noir with hours worth of sidequests and aimless exploring. For me, this is what makes Deus Ex so great. It plays off of the best characteristics or all the pieces that put it together.\n\nThe soundtrack can easily switch from a fast-paced electronic beat to a faint ambiance to fit each level specifically. which perfectly coincides with combat. In one level you'll be mowing down every NSF soldier you see with a Sawed-Off, and the next you'll be methodically weaving between buildings, hiding from cameras and deciding to silently take down that group of enemies or avoid them all together. The game reinforces this shift between styles with the limited amount of items you can find. Instead of holding you back from entering an area in the game meant for later, it'll slightly nudge you away by guarding it with really tough enemies, or locking the door with a numpad that takes 4 tools to open. It's the small elements that were taken account with the level design in mind, especially with the hubs that elevate the game so much.\n\nWhile the story starts to sound like the focus group were a bunch of tinfoil-hatted conspiracy theorists, it's all explained so well and in great detail that makes it seem more "realistic". There's constantly data being thrown at you that it can be hard to absorb, but it creates a scale that really isn't realized until you pay more attention to it. Reading datacubes on tables or emails on a computer will give more insight into what's going on around you, and more importantly the people involved. Characters you liked early on might become more despicable, or vice-versa depending on how much you know about them from those optional little bits of character development that are placed throughout the game.\n\nHell, this review is just another paper thrown into a file cabinet, but it's more of a personal love letter to the expirience I've had with Deus Ex over the course of my life. It seems every 3 or so years after I haven't played it in a while I'll reinstall it and sink another 50 hours into, and those little things I find that I didn't notice when I was a kid 10 years ago will put a huge smile on my face. It's by no means a perfect game, and it's not the first game to mix different genres in a very similar way (see System Shock), but it's a game that has to be expirienced first hand to know just how great it is.","December 2, 2015","true","27.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I underrated this phenomenal stealth-shooter-RPG hybrid at first, because of the terrible graphics and sound.\n\nYou play as a cyborg in the future that gets wrapped up in the shadow government when agencies try to seize all government power. The story is built from conspiracy theories. It's ultimately pretty simple, but it works and gives the world an interesting feel.\n\nFor each problem in Deus Ex, there are many ways to solve it, and many ways to build your character to take advantage of them. You can gun down enemy bases soldier by soldier, or use non-lethal force to sneak in and out with no casualties. There are many viable options, and this is where the game really shines.\n\nHowever, the graphics are horrible (even for its time), most of the music isn't very good, and the voice acting is hilariously bad.\n\nI got this really cheap, and I've loved it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarknessGlow/recommended/6910/","DarknessGlow","Crimson Ghost","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarknessGlow/","483 products in account","Quite simply my personal favorite game. For this title those words have been heard, read, and repeated hundreds of thousands of times over and with good reason. Those looking for a master piece of an experience this is it. Few games understand what elements it wants and how to achieve them quite like the original Deus Ex does.\n\nWhile graphically the game is somewhat blocky, it still holds up with memorably characters and a strong story ripe to burst with conspiracies mixing in to one another in a cohesive package that will have you curious about what is really going on right until the very last minutes of the game.\n\nHot off the heels of Thief this title allows for a purely stealth character to the point where characters even acknowledge the use of stealth and lack of a body count in the dialog, and sometimes even reward the player for taking such a route. While its encouraged to not make Duke blush at the amount of corpses and ways to make them, its still an option within the game and a perfectly viable one at that with special abilities known as Augmentations that increase resistence to bullets, or skills that can be trained to perfect aiming. Weapon mods also add to the deadly efficency of guns. Silenced sniper rifles with a laser sight and maxed out accuracy mods in the hands of an expert marksman? Watch the badguys drop to the floor before their friends even figure out what's happening.\n\nHow about bypassing security? Get a strength mod and put a dumpster against a wall and simply leap over it, usurping an entire security network of elaborate traps, cameras, and patrols. Perhaps something a little closer down to earth is your style? Then crawl into a vent and ensure you're not caught by guard. Feeling like you want to be a little tricky? Have pepper spray in hand? Spray that in the path of a laser beam and quickly crawl passed it as you block the beam without alerting the guards.\n\nAll of this wrapped into a setting so rarely explored, Cyberpunk, and the game is a treat for any tech enthusist to go "what if" with. Those looking for the definitive Ghost in the Shell experience, look no further and enjoy.\n\nOn a personal note; this is a game I come back to and play to competion at least once every year and there is almost always something new that I experience in some fashion, be it through gameplay or dialog. I strongly advise against looking up guides or tricks beyond the ones mentioned above that are less intuitive and not an easy few to discover on your own.\n\nHint: Open the credits and type: "thereisnospoon" without the quotes and enjoy the effects once in game.","November 30, 2013","true","12.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The games dialogue reacts to everything you do, whether you kill people on sight or simply knock them out, whether you remain hidden or run out in plain view, obey orders or find your own way, how much exploring you do, how much you interact with others. Each time changing the dialogue and story in subtle ways. It's stealth system was one of the most robust for it's day, very much focussing on sticking to the shadows and staying low behind cover.

This game. Those screenshots up there? Yeah, that's how dated the graphics are. It was released in 2000. The gameplay, on the other hand, is a standard-setter for the RPGFPS genre.\n\nNever played Deus Ex? This is your chance. Get ready to be tactical about your entrances. Plan it out a little before you fire off a shot, or don't shoot at all. You can be stealthy! You can hack that door! You can bash that other one down and shoot people! The Deus Ex series' level design alone sets a standard. Sure, you have exact goals to get to. You have about a dozen ways to get to each one, however, and the harder you have to look, the better it generally is for your health bar.\n\nThe weapon spread is realistic. Didn't put any points into using that kind of gun? You're going to have to stand there for a while to be able to land your shot, or you'll miss the broad side of a barn in broad daylight. Put ALL of your points into using that kind of gun? Give it about one second. Yep, headshot.\n\nI will admit. There is no recharge for your augments' energy supply, nor is there any health regen. You have to find items to recharge your energy, and medkits for your health. But that's part of the charm of these old shooters. You don't just sit there patiently and undo all of your mistakes. You play through it right. Not all that hard to do so, though, they do have some pretty darned easy difficulty settings and a quicksave button.\n\nThe dialogue is not this game's strong point. Oh well. The story itself is good regardless.\n\nThe optional objectives, as is the norm for Deus Ex, are highly rewarding to carry out. <spoiler redacted> to complete the optional objective in the first mission and you'll see how lucrative it can be.\n\nOn a scale of six to potato, this game is... Y2K Standards Raiser. And at the time I'm writing this, it's seven dollars. The campaign will take you a lot longer to beat than I've put into it. It's worth the seven dollars.

I have played it through many times, and each time you can discover little things you did not find the first time. There are many alternate ways to reach your goals, and a few different endings.\n\nThe story is very well written and engaging, it takes you to many interesting locations and at times might surprise you. The Character building system is not very complicated, but the choices you make have a real impact on the way you go through the game, and does not make you feel limited, or afraid that you might make a "wrong" choice. Some combinations might offer better strategy, but I cannot see anything being completely non-viable.\n\nThe only weaknesses with this game are a symptom of its age, outdated graphics and AI. Both of these were quite good for the time it was made and that is all anyone can really ask of any game. They in no way impede your ability to enjoy it completely unless you are a Princess about graphics being the best they can be, or too young to remember when games like this were in their prime.\n\nI am glad to see it is now available on steam.","December 29, 2013","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After playing this game from start to finish (40 Freakin Hours mind you), I can say that I was surprised and interested at the story, the cast of characters, the gameplay, and the music. Deus Ex is one of those games that allows you to do whatever you want. You can either play the game as John Rambo and kill every single enemy in your way, or you can play the game as Snake and take out enemies stealthily. It craves for you to get immersed into the complex story and make some pretty story-altering decisions. This game is an FPS game but there is an RPG element to it as well since you can upgrade your abilities or "augmentations" as the game calls it. The atmosphere of the game is apparent as you hear the music and face multiple adversaries. Overall, this game caught me off guard with the amount of content that it has in store for you, the player.\n\nLet's get into the positives of the game first. Even though this is a 2000 game and the graphics may not look appealing, the positives of the game overcompensate it. In this cyberpunk and futuristic world of Deus Ex, you play a new agent of an organization (called UNATCO) named JC Denton. You will find that JC and the various people throughout this universe are "augmented", meaning that they are combined by the powers of nanotechnology. He has a brother named Paul Denton, and both of you are taught that you are a part of UNATCO, the organization that brings peace to the world of 2050! Even though JC and Paul are trained in combat and have massive amounts of knowledge on the world of Deus Ex, they do not know one thing: their past. Without spoiling the game, the truth hits them right in the face and they are forced to trust their instincts and make some risky decisions. The story of the game is complex, for there are many characters, many organizations to explore, and many twists to understand. The game gives you options that can make you make your own story in the game and this becomes extremely critical when you have to decide between three different resolutions for the end of the game.\n\nThe gameplay of Deus Ex is a lot of combinations. Like I said, you can play the game as Snake and stealthily kill people with your silenced weapons. Or you can play the game as John Rambo and explode people with your GEP gun (You'll know what that is later when you play this amazing game!). NOT ONLY that, but also there are other features such as the ability to hack terminals and computers. Since this is a highly technological world, JC can hack in order to bypass security, obtain key iinformation, and use the turrets and robots to his advantage (If you have the upgrade for it!). There's also a lockpicking mechanism, where JC can automatically open a locked box or chest with one or more lockpicks. You can get essential items by doing this. You can also use melee weapons, assult rifles, shotguns, explosives, pistols and so on! One unique thing is that you can use your augmented powers that you gained. For example, you can super-sprint or you can soak bullet damage! Be careful not to rely on this too much because this uses your energy!!! So as you can see, the gameplay has a lot of factors into it.\n\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is apparent and unqiue. The music is pretty catchy with its electronica influences and it fits with the different and various locals the game has to offer. The developers actually took the time to simulate realisitic email discussions that you can read if you hack or login to a computer. Also, there are "datacubes" that you can read if you find them. Although these seem like minor things, it adds a lot to the information-seeking mentality of the game. The characters you meet throughout the stages add to the atmosphere of the game as well. Hell, you get to chat with augmented people, people who are busy clubbin', gang members, and AIs for crying out loud. The developers definitely did a great job establishing the futuristic atmosphere of the game.\n\nNow that I pretty much said the positives, let's go into the negatives. For one thing, Deus Ex has a weird way of saving data. If you don't know how Deus Ex works, YOU WILL lose hours of content. I'm not even exaggerating.  In this game, DO NOT EXPECT AUTOMATIC CHECKPOINTS, YOU MAKE YOUR OWN CHECKPOINTS!  There is none of the typical checkpoint system we see in most games. For this game, you can save anytime you want and you can make multiple save files if you want. This took time for me to get used to but this is still considered a bit of a negative in my book. Another negative is the inventory system of the game. There are times where I wanted a specific gun but it couldn't fit in my inventory. Deus Ex's inventory system is similar to the Resident Evil 4 inventory system, where everything is based on block space. So if you don't have any more blocks, you don't have service. I don't know but it feels like inventory space fills pretty quickly, especially when you get more than 4 guns or more. The explosive guns take up way too much inventory space and I rarely use them as a result. One last negative is that the AI (I'm talking about the enemy AI not the AIs featured in the game!) are stupid at times. Sometimes they run past you and sometimes, they kill themselves.\n\nOverall, Deus Ex is amazing when it comes to the complex and immersing story, the multiple-sided gameplay, and the unique atmosphere. Some negatives include a weird way to save the game, inventory space problems, and derpy enemy AI. I'm glad I bought this game when it was on sale and this game is definitely worth more than the $4 I paid. If you're looking for a challenge, if you are looking for a unique premise, if you are looking for freedom of choices, then this game is worth trying out.","June 2, 2014","true","39.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Imagine if someone asked you to critique Tetris. What would say? It would be hard not to look at things through rose colored glasses. Luckily, I had only heard that Deus Ex was great when I first picked it up. I wasn't a fanboy, I didn't really care, even though I had played and enjoyed Human Revolution. And when I got my hands on it, oh boy. Everyone was right.\nDeus Ex is fantastic. Like, the type of fantastic that doesn't exist anymore. Imagine a game that accounts for everything the player can do. Deus Ex is just short of that, and only fails to be utterly perfect because it hasn't aged well. There are no autosaves even though there really should be. The voice acting can be horrid. An automatic inventory sort would've been nice. Deus Ex has tiny problems that are really only caused by being a product of a different time.

So many titles that fall by the wayside never standing the test of time, yet Deus Ex remains over the ash heap of long forgotten games.\n\nTo me what made this game so appealing is the universe in which it exists. A future that could easily be our own with the technology, conspiracy theories and similar named global powers that have had an effect on the real world we experience today.  Often if you took the time within the game to read information about current events happening and the parallels between our worlds it often seemed prophetic. That makes this game all the more intriguing and a satisfying experience.\n\nCharacter interactions also shaped the way you approach the game throughout. Do I try to talk my way out? Do I try to sneak in to accomplish my objective or go in guns blazing? Depending on the type of playstyle you want, you could distibute your skills and augmentations in specific ways so that your enemies would barely know you were there and if they did, it would be too late.\n\nSuch an awesome game..I would definitely recommend this game to fans who love a futuristic, dystopian, and cyberpunk universe.

A focus on just one would have made a good game and it is a testament to just how great Deus Ex is that they have been combined so successfully into an even better one.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/porkpk/recommended/6910/","porkpk","xuvetyn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/porkpk/","76 products in account","I've been meaning to play DE1 for the past few years, given that I have heard so many good things about it, but I was too busy playing other games. Regardless, given the fact that this game is available on Steam (and was only about $5 when I bought it, can't beat such a deal), I decided that it's finally time to give it a try. And so I did, being extremely impressed with the game. My knowledge of older (2000 and prior) game titles is limited to MS-DOS games like Wolfenstein 3D, Commander Keen, Doom, Quake, Blake Stone, etc., and as such I didn't play anything like Deus Ex or System Shock, or other important games of this time. I am stating this because I am making it clear that I have absolutely nothing to compare DE1 to.\n\nWith that said, this really is a phenomenal game. As plenty of other people have said already, the amount of ways to get past a certain mission, being able to do things at your own pace instead of being forced into a linear storyline type of game is quite refreshing. It's not quite an open-world game, but that's completely understandable. The lore of DE1 is unparalleled in video game history, in my opinion. It's the kind of game that comes along once in a lifetime, blows everyone and their mother away in sheer disbelief, and is never matched in overall quality (at least in its genre, though one can argue that it has its own genre, again making it unsuitable for comparison to other games).\n\nThe bottom line is that I really can't find anything wrong with this game. I waited way too long to play it, but it's better late than never. Others have claimed that it would probably be more enjoyable to have played DE1 in its prime (the year 2000 where there was little or no competition in that regard), but as I've already said, this game hasn't quite been surpassed by anything. Therefore, I don't believe that it makes a difference whether you play this game in its heyday or (almost) 15 years later. This is a highly excellent game that I'll recommend to anyone, and the fact that it runs on very much any computer made in the last ten years (even netbooks), makes it even more accessible. 5 out of 5 stars for this game.","February 27, 2014","true","35.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You are an agent of the government, assigned to quell terrorist actions which will take you across the world, starting off with you capturing the terrorist that blew up the Statue of Liberty. You'll travel across the world and uncover deeper plots.\n\nThe plot is fantastic. Some of it can be predicted but for the most part the story is exciting, fresh even today's standards, and gripping. Eventually you'll decide not only the fate of the world, but the rest of humanity with it. You'll have an experience that is special for you, and how you play is totally up to you. You can go in guns blazing or sneak and hack your way around, not killing a soul.\n\nThe music is also catchy and the game makes you feel like a badass, yet caught in something overwhelming and completely huge to you.\n\nI'm not going to lie, I've played this game ten times now, since it first came out.

I´ve installed the high-res mod ( very important IMHO) and started playing.\nI was surprised how the game and mechanics are well driven and executed (vs the animation - horrible, but hey, this game is 14 years old!), but what is the most incredible thing on this game are your decisions and their affection on the whole story and gameplay. You can do basically what you can think of, you can do everything very stealthy or rambo style, you can talk your way through and shoot every single madafaka in the head. Now I see why all the fans of the original Deus Ex loved  Human Revolution, because Human Revolution is a very good sequel and it respects it´s predecessor in every way. Now it all makes sense.\nI love the story, I love the gameplay (it´s pretty hard though) and I love to search every single bit of each location. There is a good "skilltree", augmentations (that one I screwed up, I´ve chosen some augmentations that I won´t use much) and inventory that doesn´t sucks.\nI have no idea where I am in the story ( maybe one fourth?), but so far it is very, very good RPG FPS, and I am sure when I will finish it, it will be one of my favorites game of all time, despite the fact that I´ve played it 14 years after it was released :)","April 4, 2014","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When first tried to play this, I really didn't like the game because I thought it was too cheap and confusing. But after a few more tries the game finally clicked and then I started liking, and once you learn how to like this game, trust me it's probably one of the best games you have ever played after that. What I think makes it heard for people to like it at first is that the game is not what it looks like. To most people it looks like a FPS shooter(which to an extent it is, but I'll get to more about that later), therefore people play the game like it's an FPS(Guns Blazing) and expect everything else to work. That's where you then realize what it really is. Deus Ex is actually a First Person RPG. To begin with, Exploration is very important in this game, and I'd say you have to do it in order to get info to open doors or get more important information to the story, plus you get points from exploring. Also while Deus Ex is in First Person and seems like a FPS Shooter, it's not that really. To begin with going in Guns Blazing will alert guards, in which they can lock a door, sound an alarm to atract more guards, and can use explosives. Therefore Stealth gameplay is much better suited for this game, as your chances of survival and completing your objective is more possible. Also Deus Ex's gunplay is kinda bad, therefore even if you do go guns blazing, the gunplay doesn't work well with you. Now another important thing is that you really need to listen to what NPC's say, as it is actually important to the story(in a another more important way which I won't spoil) and plus they might say some important tactics which can help. One last thing is that the story is affected by what choices you make, for example you can actually choose to kill a certain character if you want, which significantly changes the story. And before I go, the Story for this game is very intersting. It brings up many philshoical and poltical points about corruption, what is right, and more.\nOverall I'm more than gald to recommend this game, but just remember this game has a steep learning curve.","January 25, 2015","true","122.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

IT. NOW.\n\nFirstly, the combat is not very good. But who even goes out and releases fire in a game like this? If you want to do that, then play DOOM. (My all time favorite game.) It's even more fun to play it stealthily. Yes, the AI is dumb and will do the whole "HUH? I HEARD SOMETHING." thing. But at least when one guy detects you, it's only them and not every other person in the room, their wives, their children, their pets, the grandchildren, Kermit the Frog, etc. (Unless he presses that dang alarm.)\n\nAlso, the RPG elements play a good role in the game. When you learn how to use a pistol better, you don't get crap like just plain higher damage. You actually get stuff that would make sense, like faster reloading and quicker aiming down.\n\nThe story is great. I won't leave any spoilers, but it left me leaning forward in my chair.\n\nFor the graphics, you can fix them with the HD mods and such. Also, make sure to fix the framerate issues in those mods by putting on VSync and such.\n\nBut the one thing that I will say is somewhat critical to this game, is the voice acting. "MISTAH JAY SEAH DENTAWN. IN DA FRESH. AS DAHK AND SEWIOUS AS ID BRUDDAH."\n\nSo, I'd say it's a 9/10, despite how aged and flawed it is. Just buy it. BUY IT. It's one of my favorites.

The entire world is dangerous. Its easy to die, but easy to live to. And the range of interactions with the world, simply fantastic. Choices are also less linear than most present day rpgs. I remember being shocked when i realised that some characters did not "have" to die if you manged to save them (often a difficult task), or you did not "have" to kill them, and whether they did or not changed the future plotting (and to a decent degree by todays standards).\n\nTo date, only Witcher II offers greater plot choice pathing than Deus Ex.\n\nAnd to date only Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines managed to improve on the social interaction aspect and character development. Sure some of you are going to say bioware, blah blah, and they do do a good job, but its not quite the same when its characters in your own party that are falling all over themselves with development, and yet that development often has little or no impact on the overall plot. I prefer the NPC's (who are the obstacles or aid to the plot) to be the developed ones. And you will find this in Deus Ex.\n\nThis game still remains one of the best, despite the dated graphics and dated 1st person persepctive (We all know the camera from just behind is the best view so you can actually see all the cool gear, and cool moves that your character does :)","October 30, 2013","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That's not even the point of this video. Alright, I'm gonna talk to you guys about something. Frickin' Doos frickin' EX. WHAT THE FRICK? Okay, seriously, what the frick is this frick? Doos' Ex? WORST FRICKIN' NAME for a video game, one of the worst frickin names for a video game I've ever heard. I mean, COME ON! DOOS EX? So frickin' dumb. BUT GUESS WHAT?! THE TITLE ISN'T EVEN THE WORST PART OF DOOS EX! IN FACT IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE! Alright? I haven't even played Doos Ex and I already know it's a terrible game. In fact, from what I've seen so far, the game gets a negative 30,000 out of 10. That's right you fricks! And guess what? Guess what? I'm gonna explain why this game is frickin' frick! Alright, let's start it up, shall we? Alright, so first of all the game tries too hard to be frickin' violent, real, and dark! I mean, what the frick? These kind of games are frickin' dumb because they are all the frickin' same.\n\nOH! I'M GONNA RESCUE YOU! OH I'M GONNA GET KILLED *Imitates gunshot noise* WAAH! WAHH! WAH! WAHHH! WAAAAAH! *Collapses on floor*. So frickin' dumb. Alright? Just a funny impersonation of those types of frickin' games.\n\nSo this game's one of those games and guess what? IT'S FRICKIN' HORRIBLE! I mean, come on, and the story's so dumb and a bunch of people are dead. ARE YOU FRICKIN' SERIOUS? I mean, really? Really? What the frick? We don't frickin' care! You're just laying like *imitates dead guy holding gun*. Frickin' dumb. And then we have these frickin' cops they're just frickin' talking to each other. WHAT THE FRICK? Oh oh no it's a frickin' cop frickin' video game. DON'T WE ALREADY HAVE ENOUGH OF THOSE? Such a frickin' rip-off. Oh, we should do this because it's a creative idea AND WE CAN'T COME UP WITH ANYTHING ORIGINAL UNLIKE NINTENDO AND SUPER MARIO!\n\nSuper Mario is the best gaming franchise in the world. Don't deny it! It's the best game franchise in the world and you know it. WHY DO YOU THINK, WHY DO YOU THINK MARIO GAMES ARE SOME OF THE BESTSELLING GAMES ON THE PLANET? "Oh, I don't know why," WELL I'LL TELL YOU WHY! It's because MARIO actually has good games. His games are platforms, the best genre of gaming in the world. AND LET US NOT FORGET HE IS THE KING OF PLATFORMING! HE SET THE STAIRS FOR PLATFORMING! Alright? Not Doos Ex! Doos Ex didn't set the standards for anything! Alright?\n\nSecond, let's talk about what style game it is. It's a Minecraft style game WAAAAAAAAAAAA! ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I HATE FRICKIN' MINECRAFT! I don't like Minecraft 'cause people waste their lives on there every single day. They're probably just sitting there, y'know, probably just sitting there eating countless bags of chips and turning themselves into frickin' jelly and playing the frickin' game, building frickin' tiles and blocks everywhere and avoiding creepers and inviting their friends online BECAUSE THEY PROBABLY HAVE NO ACTUAL FRIENDS. And using their frickin' weapon sashes to BLOW THINGS UP BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO DO! So frickin' dumb. Play Mario, play frickin' Mario guys. Alright? Mario is on pretty much every Nintendo system. In fact, he is on every Nintendo system. Alright? The Wii U? Buy it! Playstation? Xbox? DON'T BUY IT! And also, I don't really care about the Nintendo and Apple rivalry because they aren't really rivals. Why do you think Nintendo makes apps for them? So Apple, I don't care you can buy stuff from them too for all I care. Just as long as you guys, y'know, agree that Nintendo is the best gaming company in the world.\n\nAnd I'm sorry if it sounds like I'm forcing my opinions onto you guys 'CAUSE I'M NOT! BUT I'M SIMPLY SUGGESTING WHAT YOU GUYS SHOULD REALLY BE PLAYING! I'M NOT FORCING YOU GUYS! I'M NOT TELLING YOU, "IF YOU DON'T PLAY NINTENDO, THEN YOU MUST DIE" 'CAUSE THAT'S NOT THE CASE! I'M SIMPLY IMPLYING THAT NINTENDO'S THE BEST GAME COMPANY IN THE WORLD AND THAT'S WHAT, THAT'S WHAT GAMING SYSTEMS AND GAMES THAT I RECOMMEND THE MOST! ALRIGHT?ERRRRRGH! And another thing. Let's talk about... okay, you see when you look up at Doos Ex, people say that it and Minecraft aren't alike, but LOOK AT IT! Look at the controls! The CAMERA controls! The CHARACTER controls! THEY'RE FRICKIN' UNCONTROLLABLE! BOTH GAMES! BOTH GAMES! *grips sword*\n\nOh yeah, this is my sword by the way. I made it on my own. Unlike you frickin' fricks BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT! Look at it, and then look at the inventory of weapons in Doos Ex! Reminds you of Minecraft, doesn't it? This game- Doos Ex was made before Minecraft but guess what? I STILL DON'T LIKE MINECRAFT! As a matter of fact, I bet in the modern world most people only play Doos Ex because it's like Minecraft! Well guess what? I don't freaking care. I don't like Minecraft and I don't like Doos Ex. I may do a rant on Minecraft in the future.\n\nBUT THAT'S THE FUTURE! RIGHT NOW I'M RANTING ON DOOS EX! ALRIGHT?! IS THAT FINE WITH YOU FRICKS? ARE YOU GOING TO HATE ON MY VIDEOS FOR THIS? HUH? HUH? Anyways, 's'continue, shall we? So, um, basically it's a Minecraft-style game which was made before Minecraft though. So, I'm not saying it's a ripoff, but I just hate those kinds of games? Alright? This game is like early Minecraft except Minecraft is more of a simulation game AND THAT'S NOT EVEN THE POINT!\n\nUhm, let's see, oh yeah! Another thing that I hate about this game, alright, I mentioned that the game is uncontrollable, because guess what: IT IS! It is uncontrollable! The camera is uncontrollable, the character is uncontrollable and guess what? All first person games are uncontrollable! People should just y'know, make like, y'know, platformers! Platformers are the best genre. They could make other genre games too. I'm not saying only limit every single game to being a platformer. I'm not saying that. There could also be puzzle games, party games, racing games I DON'T CARE! Please just- please, gaming industry. Just get rid of first person shooters! JUST DO IT! FIRST PERSON SHOOTERS ARE HYPNOTISING GAMERS! They're drawing gamers away from the actually good games Please! Please! Alright?\n\nI was born in 1998 when, y'know, that's when Mario 64 and Zelda were popular, especially Ocarina of Time and Super Mario 64. THAT WAS WHEN PEOPLE ACTUALLY HAD TASTE IN GAMING! I wasn't a gamer at that time because I was a frickin' infant, but I got into gaming when I was like, what, 4 or 5 years old and that was when people actually had taste in gaming! That's when Mario reigned because people actually knew what to play. That's when many first person shooters came into play such as Call of Duty and I have to say, around, around 2006 or 2007 that's when, y'know, the quality of games started to go down. Not Nintendo though, but I'm talking about other companies. SEGA being included. Sonic's better now, but still. Sonic '06: DON'T EVEN REMIND ME OF THAT! Gosh.\n\nAnyways, so the game's uncontrollable and the camera is uncontrollable and the level design is just horrid. Alright? It's just plain horrid! You go around talking to people exploring the frickin' environment and it's boring as frick. I'll get onto the setting of the game a little bit later, but.\n\nAND GUESS WHAT?! When you, y'know, go around and you just, y'know fight people- POORLY DESIGNED. It's half baked; it's- it's just NYA! Why did you people even ask me to talk about this game? Why not ask me to talk about an actually good franchises like Rayman, or, Kirby or Metroid or, y'know, the frickin'... y'know, the frickin'... let's see... or just some other frickin' franchise that's actually good. A franchise that I might actually like?\n\n~SammyClassicSonicFan","May 9, 2015","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","1","1","2","2"

A focus on just one would have made a good game and it is a testament to just how great Deus Ex is that they have been combined so successfully into an even better one.

I´ve installed the high-res mod ( very important IMHO) and started playing.\nI was surprised how the game and mechanics are well driven and executed (vs the animation - horrible, but hey, this game is 14 years old!), but what is the most incredible thing on this game are your decisions and their affection on the whole story and gameplay. You can do basically what you can think of, you can do everything very stealthy or rambo style, you can talk your way through and shoot every single madafaka in the head. Now I see why all the fans of the original Deus Ex loved  Human Revolution, because Human Revolution is a very good sequel and it respects it´s predecessor in every way. Now it all makes sense.\nI love the story, I love the gameplay (it´s pretty hard though) and I love to search every single bit of each location. There is a good "skilltree", augmentations (that one I screwed up, I´ve chosen some augmentations that I won´t use much) and inventory that doesn´t sucks.\nI have no idea where I am in the story ( maybe one fourth?), but so far it is very, very good RPG FPS, and I am sure when I will finish it, it will be one of my favorites game of all time, despite the fact that I´ve played it 14 years after it was released :)","April 4, 2014","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Regardless, given the fact that this game is available on Steam (and was only about $5 when I bought it, can't beat such a deal), I decided that it's finally time to give it a try. And so I did, being extremely impressed with the game. My knowledge of older (2000 and prior) game titles is limited to MS-DOS games like Wolfenstein 3D, Commander Keen, Doom, Quake, Blake Stone, etc., and as such I didn't play anything like Deus Ex or System Shock, or other important games of this time. I am stating this because I am making it clear that I have absolutely nothing to compare DE1 to.\n\nWith that said, this really is a phenomenal game. As plenty of other people have said already, the amount of ways to get past a certain mission, being able to do things at your own pace instead of being forced into a linear storyline type of game is quite refreshing. It's not quite an open-world game, but that's completely understandable. The lore of DE1 is unparalleled in video game history, in my opinion. It's the kind of game that comes along once in a lifetime, blows everyone and their mother away in sheer disbelief, and is never matched in overall quality (at least in its genre, though one can argue that it has its own genre, again making it unsuitable for comparison to other games).\n\nThe bottom line is that I really can't find anything wrong with this game. I waited way too long to play it, but it's better late than never. Others have claimed that it would probably be more enjoyable to have played DE1 in its prime (the year 2000 where there was little or no competition in that regard), but as I've already said, this game hasn't quite been surpassed by anything. Therefore, I don't believe that it makes a difference whether you play this game in its heyday or (almost) 15 years later. This is a highly excellent game that I'll recommend to anyone, and the fact that it runs on very much any computer made in the last ten years (even netbooks), makes it even more accessible. 5 out of 5 stars for this game.","February 27, 2014","true","35.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is still to this day one of the best games ever made, but sadly hasn't been given the time and attention that it deserves by the community, and is still very dated despite what mods you install. The quality of the game however will force anyone with a fully functional brain to quickly forget about the awful graphics.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VivianVaderNelson/recommended/6910/","VivianVaderNelson","Vivisector","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VivianVaderNelson/","685 products in account","Deus Ex is a hard game to review. The game has a devout following of fans heralding it as 'the best game ever made', and even 14 years after the original release and 2 sequels many have not move that title to another game. While the guise of nostalgia may blind many to the errors of their loved titles of the past I did not play this game until about 2010 (which is considerably recent considering that this game was already 10 years old by that time). Through my experience playing it I believe that Deus Ex deserves much of the reverence it receives.\nFrom the moment of starting a new game you can see why Deus Ex is often held as one of gaming's greatest titles. From the conspiracy laden cyberpunk setting filled with a dark aesthetic and an ambient soundtrack that becomes more intense when being perused by an enemy this game sets tone well even by today's standards (If you can get over ten antiquated graphics that is). Though the setting and story are a strong suit I will not spoil them for you, for you should experience them yourself. Though setting and ambiance are all good, gameplay is really where Deus Ex truly shines.\nFrom the beginning you are able to see how much freedom Deus Ex gives the player for a First Person Shooter. Upon starting a new character the player is able to distribute skills to the places they see as suiting themselves. A player can focus on wielding a number of weapons, they can focus on stealth, they can focus on one particular skill, or they can focus on open as many pathways as possible. This freedom is not just a gimmick, but it is echoed in the level design. The player is given the choice at the start to be given a sniper to take down targets long range, an electric prod for a non-lethal approach, or a GEP gun to take down armored targets. They are also given a number of ways to approach the first mission which they must find an execute themselves. The player may run in guns blazing (Though they will probably fail), they may silently take down targets and climb boxes for a shortcut towards their goal, or they may may sneak in undetected without violence, they may retrieve a key for a secret exit, all of which is up for their discovery. Deus Ex is designed to give players a number of options so that no matter how the build their character they are able to play to their strengths. They can even later augment their character to buff their weaknesses or enhance their strengths. All of this is because Deus Ex is not simply a First-Person Shooter, it is an RPG. From character dialogue trees to experience to item hoarding to digging for information in a surprisingly well written world, Deus Ex brings the best of what RPG's have to offer and wraps them in the skin of a difficult early 2000's FPS. Though, the early 2000's part may be seen as less than a boon to many.\nAlthough the game may not have aged so well. Don't get me wrong, I very much enjoyed my time with Deus Ex, but the game is still 14 years old. Textures are blurry, the models are edgy, loading points in levels are short but frequent, animations are primitive, the lighting is hardly there, the controls are more ancient than many choose to remember in their default layout, the AI isn't always too keen, and the voice acting can even be painfully bad to some, though it does run without error on modern PC's as far as I've seen. Even with mods and updates most of the edges remain un-smoothed, and as such the experience may be tainted for many newcomers, especially for those not prepared for a difficulty that would today be commonly viewed as obscene were it not for the release and popularity of titles like Super Meat Boy and Dark Souls.\nIf you can get through the fact that Deus Ex is an old title it will be absolutely worth your time and money. Even though I didn't grow up with it, I still enjoyed the hours I put in enough to declare it as one of my favorite games.

This is our flagship exclusive. The combat has aged, and is more action-RPG oriented, so it may be a bit frustrating at first, but this game is absolutely amazing even today with it's heavy storyline, and a huge open-ended world.(Though of course the game isn't open-world as it's over 15 years old.)","October 13, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/quinnbardon/recommended/6910/","quinnbardon","Quinn Latifah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/quinnbardon/","329 products in account","Deus Ex is both my favorite game and arguably the greatest PC game of all time. It appears frequently at or near the top of best ever lists by both journalists and the gaming public. It was ranked #1 of the top 100 PC games of all time by PC Gamer, PC gaming's most widely respected publication.\n\nThese accolades are no surprise when one sees how brilliantly the game succeeds on so many levels. The story is a masterfully crafted, globe-hopping cyberpunk adventure through which the player's character navigates a dystopian future world on a mission to unravel a Gordian Knot of conspiracies, secrets and lies. Both the player's character and the world he inhabits are shaped by nanotechnology, the former for better, the latter for worse. The player assumes the role of JC Denton, an agent of UNATCO, an international anti-terrorism organization. The terror he combats is largely attributable to the Gray Death, a nanomechanical virus that has ravaged the planet. Denton, however, is immune to the virus thanks to nano-augmentation, a cutting-edge technology available only to elite government agents. Nano-augmentation endows Denton with an array of superhuman powers such as infrared vision and invisibility. Augmentations may be customized to suit a particular playing style, for example stealth artists may opt for the footstep-silencing lower body augmentation while aggressive circle-strafing gunners can choose increased speed. The game's augmentations perfectly complement the open-ended design that is its greatest feature of all. Every level features secret areas for circumventing enemies, gathering intel or finding resources. These avenues might be accessible only with certain abilities, for example a fence might be surmountable only to players with the speed-boosting aug that allows them to leap it or the strength-boosting aug that allows them to stack enough heavy crates to climb it. Every mission can be approached in multiple ways using stealth, force, diplomacy or a combination of the three. The story itself actually adapts to the ramifications of the player's approach to the missions. The game is so open-ended, in fact, that there are only two required neutralizations. It can played as a straight-up run-and-gun shooter, a sneak-through-the-shadows stealth adventure or anywhere in between. Further complementing the open-ended gameplay is the RPG-style stat system in which players can develop proficiency in certain weapons or skills such as hacking, lockpicking, or even swimming. This level of freedom was unprecedented in shooters at the time of the game's release. Before, such games would tell the player  "Go here, do this." Deus Ex, through the very end, asks: "What do you want to do?"\n\nDeus Ex is superb in other areas as well: There is a great arsenal of weapons both lethal and non-lethal, familiar and futuristic. A favorite of many is the nano-edged sword, which when combined with footstep silencing aug, is immensely fun to assassinate enemies with. The weaponry is so well-integrated with the augmentation and skill systems that by the end of the game the player feels like a techno-deity. Although the story veers rather outlandish at times, the game never stops encouraging players to think skeptically. The graphics, from an artistic standpoint, convey the game world's bleakness very effectively. The game is set entirely during dusk and nighttime; blues, blacks and grays feature predominantly in its palette. The soundtrack never feels incongruous with its setting and the theme music is one of the most memorable in gaming history.\n\nDeus Ex is not a technically perfect game. Its graphics were somewhat dated at the time of release, the foreign accents are hilariously bad and the boss fights are a drag (though all but two are optional). These flaws do not detract, however, from what a monumental achievement this game is. Deus Ex may not be the most technically polished game of all time, but it is among the most influential. Doom and Wolfenstein 3D established the first-person shooter as a genre, but Deus Ex elevated it to an art form. This was accomplished through its ingenious fusion of role-playing elements with familiar shooter conventions, giving birth to a new genre: the action RPG. The action-RPG has become one of today's most popular genres; echoes of Deus Ex can be seen everywhere, from the decision-trees of the Mass Effect trilogy to the plasmids of BioShock.\n\nAny game as influential as Deus Ex must be considered a classic, but to call this game a classic is almost an understatement. The defining aspect of video games as a medium is interactivity, and interactivity is maximized when the player is granted as much freedom to shape their role within a game as possible. Deus Ex fostered this freedom to the utmost degree. Deus Ex was not only the instantiation of a new genre, it was and remains to this day, the highest instantiation of what a game can be.\n","October 14, 2015","true","24.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(Happy birthday Deus Ex)\n\nIt's heeded as the best game ever for a reason. It's not because the gunplay is fantastic or because it's "The Next Big CoD Rival"\n\nCoD was this game's rival and still is.\n\nThe story's foundation are actual conspiracies from the 90's and 2000's, which is part of what made it amazing. To tell the other parts would spoil it.\n\nThe characters, while having bad voice acting, were some of the most alive characters in any videogame. The characters displayed real emotion, and their characteristics affected how they acted and how they viewed your actions.\n\nThe levels are pretty expansive, and offer multiple solutions to a problem that aren't obvious. From the streets of NYC to underground laboratories and military airfields, this game has plenty of environments of all shapes and sizes.\n\nThe music is a part of what makes the game legendary. The game has set music for each level/area of the game, and all the music sets the mood extremely well. Each track has different scores based on what's happening in-game.\n\nThe gameplay itself is also amazing, but clunky. The stealth is pretty nice, and the weapons and tools you have at disposal offer many different ways to approach and deal with a problem. Inventory management is big too, and makes you decide whether you want to dedicate yourself to big weapons with little room for more, or small weapons with multiple tools to use. When you navigate a level, you aren't told what to do. There is no waypoint or minimap. You're given, usually, a map of the area you're in, markers on that map, a compass, and you set off exploring the world yourself, getting clues and information on your objective as you explore.\n\nThe skills and augmentations also play a big role in gameplay. Before you start a game, you are shown a skills screen. You can upgrade or downgrade skills at the start to fir the playstyle you want to start building on, whether it be based around stealth, gunplay, or both, it's possible. Augmentations are gained through the collection of Augmentation Canisters. You can find these throughout the game, and each canister has 2 different augmentations. Once you install an augmentation for each body part, you cannot remove it. Through the use of Augmentation Upgrade Canisters, these can be improved, and some body parts have more than one slot (2 or 3), so you can have plenty of different augmentations to choose from and use.\n\nTL;DR\nPros:\nAmazing music\nAmazing level designs\nCharacters full of life\nHuge range of character customization\nGreat story\nLarge amount of world interactivity\n\nCons:\nClunky gameplay\nMessy graphics (Although fairly good for a game from 2000)\nVoice acting isn't exactly good, pretty bad at some points\nUnoptimized for modern machines (Not heavily, but some things can fix the little things wrong with the game. Get Deus Exe to fix some of these: http://kentie.net/article/dxguide/)\n\nJust buy the game already.","May 9, 2014","true","37.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That's not even the point of this video. Alright, I'm gonna talk to you guys about something. Frickin' Doos frickin' EX. WHAT THE FRICK? Okay, seriously, what the frick is this frick? Doos' Ex? WORST FRICKIN' NAME for a video game, one of the worst frickin names for a video game I've ever heard. I mean, COME ON! DOOS EX? So frickin' dumb. BUT GUESS WHAT?! THE TITLE ISN'T EVEN THE WORST PART OF DOOS EX! IN FACT IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE! Alright? I haven't even played Doos Ex and I already know it's a terrible game. In fact, from what I've seen so far, the game gets a negative 30,000 out of 10. That's right you fricks! And guess what? Guess what? I'm gonna explain why this game is frickin' frick! Alright, let's start it up, shall we? Alright, so first of all the game tries too hard to be frickin' violent, real, and dark! I mean, what the frick? These kind of games are frickin' dumb because they are all the frickin' same.\n\nOH! I'M GONNA RESCUE YOU! OH I'M GONNA GET KILLED *Imitates gunshot noise* WAAH! WAHH! WAH! WAHHH! WAAAAAH! *Collapses on floor*. So frickin' dumb. Alright? Just a funny impersonation of those types of frickin' games.\n\nSo this game's one of those games and guess what? IT'S FRICKIN' HORRIBLE! I mean, come on, and the story's so dumb and a bunch of people are dead. ARE YOU FRICKIN' SERIOUS? I mean, really? Really? What the frick? We don't frickin' care! You're just laying like *imitates dead guy holding gun*. Frickin' dumb. And then we have these frickin' cops they're just frickin' talking to each other. WHAT THE FRICK? Oh oh no it's a frickin' cop frickin' video game. DON'T WE ALREADY HAVE ENOUGH OF THOSE? Such a frickin' rip-off. Oh, we should do this because it's a creative idea AND WE CAN'T COME UP WITH ANYTHING ORIGINAL UNLIKE NINTENDO AND SUPER MARIO!\n\nSuper Mario is the best gaming franchise in the world. Don't deny it! It's the best game franchise in the world and you know it. WHY DO YOU THINK, WHY DO YOU THINK MARIO GAMES ARE SOME OF THE BESTSELLING GAMES ON THE PLANET? "Oh, I don't know why," WELL I'LL TELL YOU WHY! It's because MARIO actually has good games. His games are platforms, the best genre of gaming in the world. AND LET US NOT FORGET HE IS THE KING OF PLATFORMING! HE SET THE STAIRS FOR PLATFORMING! Alright? Not Doos Ex! Doos Ex didn't set the standards for anything! Alright?\n\nSecond, let's talk about what style game it is. It's a Minecraft style game WAAAAAAAAAAAA! ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I HATE FRICKIN' MINECRAFT! I don't like Minecraft 'cause people waste their lives on there every single day. They're probably just sitting there, y'know, probably just sitting there eating countless bags of chips and turning themselves into frickin' jelly and playing the frickin' game, building frickin' tiles and blocks everywhere and avoiding creepers and inviting their friends online BECAUSE THEY PROBABLY HAVE NO ACTUAL FRIENDS. And using their frickin' weapon sashes to BLOW THINGS UP BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO DO! So frickin' dumb. Play Mario, play frickin' Mario guys. Alright? Mario is on pretty much every Nintendo system. In fact, he is on every Nintendo system. Alright? The Wii U? Buy it! Playstation? Xbox? DON'T BUY IT! And also, I don't really care about the Nintendo and Apple rivalry because they aren't really rivals. Why do you think Nintendo makes apps for them? So Apple, I don't care you can buy stuff from them too for all I care. Just as long as you guys, y'know, agree that Nintendo is the best gaming company in the world.\n\nAnd I'm sorry if it sounds like I'm forcing my opinions onto you guys 'CAUSE I'M NOT! BUT I'M SIMPLY SUGGESTING WHAT YOU GUYS SHOULD REALLY BE PLAYING! I'M NOT FORCING YOU GUYS! I'M NOT TELLING YOU, "IF YOU DON'T PLAY NINTENDO, THEN YOU MUST DIE" 'CAUSE THAT'S NOT THE CASE! I'M SIMPLY IMPLYING THAT NINTENDO'S THE BEST GAME COMPANY IN THE WORLD AND THAT'S WHAT, THAT'S WHAT GAMING SYSTEMS AND GAMES THAT I RECOMMEND THE MOST! ALRIGHT?ERRRRRGH! And another thing. Let's talk about... okay, you see when you look up at Doos Ex, people say that it and Minecraft aren't alike, but LOOK AT IT! Look at the controls! The CAMERA controls! The CHARACTER controls! THEY'RE FRICKIN' UNCONTROLLABLE! BOTH GAMES! BOTH GAMES! *grips sword*\n\nOh yeah, this is my sword by the way. I made it on my own. Unlike you frickin' fricks BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT! Look at it, and then look at the inventory of weapons in Doos Ex! Reminds you of Minecraft, doesn't it? This game- Doos Ex was made before Minecraft but guess what? I STILL DON'T LIKE MINECRAFT! As a matter of fact, I bet in the modern world most people only play Doos Ex because it's like Minecraft! Well guess what? I don't freaking care. I don't like Minecraft and I don't like Doos Ex. I may do a rant on Minecraft in the future.\n\nBUT THAT'S THE FUTURE! RIGHT NOW I'M RANTING ON DOOS EX! ALRIGHT?! IS THAT FINE WITH YOU FRICKS? ARE YOU GOING TO HATE ON MY VIDEOS FOR THIS? HUH? HUH? Anyways, 's'continue, shall we? So, um, basically it's a Minecraft-style game which was made before Minecraft though. So, I'm not saying it's a ripoff, but I just hate those kinds of games? Alright? This game is like early Minecraft except Minecraft is more of a simulation game AND THAT'S NOT EVEN THE POINT!\n\nUhm, let's see, oh yeah! Another thing that I hate about this game, alright, I mentioned that the game is uncontrollable, because guess what: IT IS! It is uncontrollable! The camera is uncontrollable, the character is uncontrollable and guess what? All first person games are uncontrollable! People should just y'know, make like, y'know, platformers! Platformers are the best genre. They could make other genre games too. I'm not saying only limit every single game to being a platformer. I'm not saying that. There could also be puzzle games, party games, racing games I DON'T CARE! Please just- please, gaming industry. Just get rid of first person shooters! JUST DO IT! FIRST PERSON SHOOTERS ARE HYPNOTISING GAMERS! They're drawing gamers away from the actually good games Please! Please! Alright?\n\nI was born in 1998 when, y'know, that's when Mario 64 and Zelda were popular, especially Ocarina of Time and Super Mario 64. THAT WAS WHEN PEOPLE ACTUALLY HAD TASTE IN GAMING! I wasn't a gamer at that time because I was a frickin' infant, but I got into gaming when I was like, what, 4 or 5 years old and that was when people actually had taste in gaming! That's when Mario reigned because people actually knew what to play. That's when many first person shooters came into play such as Call of Duty and I have to say, around, around 2006 or 2007 that's when, y'know, the quality of games started to go down. Not Nintendo though, but I'm talking about other companies. SEGA being included. Sonic's better now, but still. Sonic '06: DON'T EVEN REMIND ME OF THAT! Gosh.\n\nAnyways, so the game's uncontrollable and the camera is uncontrollable and the level design is just horrid. Alright? It's just plain horrid! You go around talking to people exploring the frickin' environment and it's boring as frick. I'll get onto the setting of the game a little bit later, but.\n\nAND GUESS WHAT?! When you, y'know, go around and you just, y'know fight people- POORLY DESIGNED. It's half baked; it's- it's just NYA! Why did you people even ask me to talk about this game? Why not ask me to talk about an actually good franchises like Rayman, or, Kirby or Metroid or, y'know, the frickin'... y'know, the frickin'... let's see... or just some other frickin' franchise that's actually good. A franchise that I might actually like?\n\n~SammyClassicSonicFan","May 9, 2015","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","1","1","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PutYoGwassesOn/recommended/6910/","PutYoGwassesOn","Gubs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PutYoGwassesOn/","87 products in account","Fifteen years and some forty save files later I'm STILL finding new things almost every time I open this game. It's amazing that Deus Ex managed to pack enough worthwhile content to make every playthrough feel unique, and not just in the game's scenarios themselves, but how you handle them. Every single weapon and aug has potential to do great things depending on how you build your character, with the exception of extremely situational, one use items like the P2000, or gimmicky augs like the Spybot.\n\nDeus Ex is a game that's hard to compare to others, because of how neatly the package is tied together. It's the way the atmospheric elements like music or even something as simple as lighting combine with the meandering you'll end up doing in the game's hub-worlds, and the hubs are where Deus Ex becomes a completely different expirience. Sure it's fun to play one of the good ol' linear levels with fairly straightforward objectives, but the sprawling, open areas are where the game goes from an explosive action flick to a gritty neo-noir with hours worth of sidequests and aimless exploring. For me, this is what makes Deus Ex so great. It plays off of the best characteristics or all the pieces that put it together.\n\nThe soundtrack can easily switch from a fast-paced electronic beat to a faint ambiance to fit each level specifically. which perfectly coincides with combat. In one level you'll be mowing down every NSF soldier you see with a Sawed-Off, and the next you'll be methodically weaving between buildings, hiding from cameras and deciding to silently take down that group of enemies or avoid them all together. The game reinforces this shift between styles with the limited amount of items you can find. Instead of holding you back from entering an area in the game meant for later, it'll slightly nudge you away by guarding it with really tough enemies, or locking the door with a numpad that takes 4 tools to open. It's the small elements that were taken account with the level design in mind, especially with the hubs that elevate the game so much.\n\nWhile the story starts to sound like the focus group were a bunch of tinfoil-hatted conspiracy theorists, it's all explained so well and in great detail that makes it seem more "realistic". There's constantly data being thrown at you that it can be hard to absorb, but it creates a scale that really isn't realized until you pay more attention to it. Reading datacubes on tables or emails on a computer will give more insight into what's going on around you, and more importantly the people involved. Characters you liked early on might become more despicable, or vice-versa depending on how much you know about them from those optional little bits of character development that are placed throughout the game.\n\nHell, this review is just another paper thrown into a file cabinet, but it's more of a personal love letter to the expirience I've had with Deus Ex over the course of my life. It seems every 3 or so years after I haven't played it in a while I'll reinstall it and sink another 50 hours into, and those little things I find that I didn't notice when I was a kid 10 years ago will put a huge smile on my face. It's by no means a perfect game, and it's not the first game to mix different genres in a very similar way (see System Shock), but it's a game that has to be expirienced first hand to know just how great it is.","December 2, 2015","true","27.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Two things make this game especially good: the story and the gameplay. The augmentations that you use to add new abilites really drastically change the ways you can approach situations instead of just adding passive bonuses like most perk-like systems in so many other RPGs. Each problem you encounter has a dozen ways of solving it and can be solved by any type of character build, so each player can play through the game in their own unique style. Combat has this aspect as well, as you level up your skills with different weapon types, so you can play as a sharpshooting sniper or a rocket-launcher weilding maniac. Without having to explain every game mechanic, all you need to know is that the gameplay is deep, complex, and can be enjoyed basically however you want.\n\nWhile the actual plot line isn't the best, it's the underlying themes that really make it stand out. Not a lot of games ask the types of questions that Deus Ex asks. How much control should the government have on the people? If people were left to govern themselves, would the good side of humanity win over the evil side, or is man's hunger for power and control too great? What does it mean to be human? Are machines more perfect than man? It's a very philosophical game, and it's great to see different, distinct endings that aren't black-and-white in their morality, they all present different governing philosophies, and it's up to the player to decide which they think is the best as they play through the game.\n\nThe only drawbacks to the game are the awful voice acting, dodgy engine and the shoddy graphics. However, if you're going to prevent yourself from playing this game because of the poor graphics (even for 2000) and the engine hiccups, your really shouldn't. Particularly with this game as it's rightfully a classic and should be played by anybody who enjoys RPG's, FPS's, or both.","June 24, 2012","true","24.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

To put it bluntly, Deus Ex is a stealth game, and a damn good one, at that. It offers an unprecedented amount of freedom and lets you take on your objectives in whatever way you want, or just not at all.\n\nSo many unexpected consequences and little variations, multiple playstyles and different augmentations to support each one mean that every playthrough can be completely different.\n\nThe only real problem is the AI. They're forgetful and seem to lack basic combat sense. Also, the tiny inconvenience of not being able to move a body without looting it. I don't want to have to clear room in my inventory to pick up a flamethrower that I'm not using so I can move a body.\n\nOther than that, the game lets you play completely non-lethally with the exception of having to glitch past one boss, which is actually really fun.\n\nThat's about it, I guess. The game mechanics still hold up very well and the story is even more engaging than most modern games, so Deus Ex gets a 10/10. Would play again, many times.

Choices and actions you make, no matter how small, actually have consequences that can reach far into the game's story.

It combines stealth, RPG, cyberpunk, and action so perfectly. Simply running around and talking to strangers is a lot of fun, let alone sneaking through facilities, hacking into computers, and reading nearby databooks. Only problems is that the voice acting is a little cheesy and I can sometimes get really lost. Also, I know you're suppose to use stealth, but my God, it'll take you twenty rounds of assault rifle ammo to his skull to even dent an enemy's health bar. But besides the laughable voice actor, moments where you can barely know what to do, and overpowered enemies, this game is dead near perfect and you should play it.","December 30, 2013","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Side characters and side missions are extremely enjoyable. The design of this game is nothing short of incredible. The story is very enjoyable and even though the game is so old i found my self on the edge of my seat to see what the next twist is. The world is so immersive and well developed and I really feel you would be doing yourslef a disservice by passing this one up. The game is also pretty cheep for the amount of content. Doing only one story route the game is going to last around 20 hours and this game is not very expensive. There is also a mod that improves some of graphic assets if the bad graphics really bother you. Finally not to be forgotten this game has one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard period. The soundtrack is really amazing and even if you do not play the game go listen to it on youtube it's awesome.

I tried the original Deus Ex a few years ago, but I just couldn't get passed its outdated visuals (including New Vision) and especially its awful animations. Which I think is probably typical for the Deus Ex series, since Human Revolution also wasn't a looker to begin with. But I suppose I kinda matured in terms of gaming in the last two years, because when I started Deus Ex again a few months ago, the visuals didn't bother me.\n\nBut enough about me. Besides the convincing dystopia future with its own share of society problems dripping with atmosphere, I needed some time to adjust to the gameplay. Because it has been quite some time that a game didn't spoon-fed me how to play the game or which way to go with a huge pointer on-screen. Overwhelming at first, but the level of player freedom makes you comfortable very quickly. You get a relatively big area each level where you can go where ever you please, do whatever you want in a manner you find appropriate. The excellent level designs makes sure of that. Later on, based on the augmentations you choose, you get even more options that suit your play style. No wrongs or rights.\n\n+ Excellent level design, a lot of player freedom, all roads lead to Rome.\n+ Not a single moment of holding hands, just good ol' fashioned exploration and finding the way on your own.\n+ Dystopia cyberpunk future and its problems are represented very well and convincing.\n+ A great story to boot that rarely to never loses its grip.\n+ A lot of choices and consequences that can make your life later on easier or harder.\n+ Great atmosphere and an even better soundtrack.\n\n- Ugly face animations, probably even for 2000 standards.\n- Mediocre/static voice acting, except Bob Page whom I thought sounded excellent.\n- Stupid AI, though understandable considering it's 15 years old now.\n\nI still prefer Human Revolution (first love and all that), but now I can understand where most of its brilliance comes from. If the next Deus Ex, Mankind Divided, can combine the strengths from both Deus Ex 1 and Human Revolution, and somehow iron out their respective little flaws, Mankind Divided will be a very, very unforgettable experience.

While I would give Thief II that honor, it's not hard to see why this game tops so many "best of" lists, and it's one of my personal favorites. This game may also be one of the best examples of why you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover, as it looks like absolute ♥♥♥♥, with freaky-looking human models, blocky levels, barf-inducing textures, and subpar voice acting. However, if you can get past all that, you'll quickly find that this game is something special.\n\nDeus Ex appears to be an FPS on the surface, but it's really an FPS-RPG. Throughout the game you acquire skill points that you can use to upgrade your skill with certain weapon types (pistol, rifle, heavy, etc.) You can use any weapon you find and have room for, but to be even remotely competent with them, you'll have to upgrade the respective skill, which increases damage and accuracy, and occasionally adds some other benefits. There are also other skills you can upgrade, such as Computer, which allows you to hack ATMs for money and security terminals to deactivate cameras and reprogram turrets, and Lockpicking, which decreases the amount of disposable lockpicks you need to open a door. The great thing about Deus Ex is that there is no one correct way to play the game. Every skill in the game, with the exception of Swimming and arguably Environmental Training, is useful, and there is a way to beat any mission with any skillset. You could use Multitools to bypass a security keypad to open a door, or you could hack a security terminal and open it from there, or you could lockpick your way into a drawer with a datacube containing the code, or you could just blow the door open with an explosive. There is always more than one way to solve a problem, something that is very, very rare in even the best games out there.\n\nThe amount of depth this game has amazes me. Once I was in a high-rise apartment, and I decided to break the window and jump out, merely for the entertainment of seeing how far up I actually was. I instead landed on a balcony, lockpicking my way into a room with binoculars and a computer terminal containing interesting details about the lore of the game. My jaw was literally agape. I could not believe that such an obscure location would actually have something noteworthy in it. No matter how many times you play Deus Ex, you will always find something new, be it a new way to complete a mission or just a fun easter egg, and this makes the replay value extremely high. The game is massive, and I believe this to be in part due to the extremely low-budget graphics. Since so little time and money was spent on the look of the game, the mechanics could be polished to a mirror shine and the world expanded in a meaningful way, with things to find in every nook and cranny.\n\nI would also be remiss not to mention the game's fantastic story. It's a wonder the game managed to be so compelling despite the awful voice acting, and it speaks to the quality of the writing that this was achieved. The characters you encounter are lovable, and the overarching plot is both extremely complex and full of twists and turns, which is why, in the interest of avoiding spoilers and laziness, I won't be providing a plot summary. You'll just have to find out for yourself.\n\nLastly, there is the music, which is phenomenal. Alexander Brandon's compositions are varied, memorable, and always fit the location and the themes of the story (edit: I derped, there are two other composers as well, named Michiel van den Bos and Daniel Gardopee). On top of that, the music isn't just nice to listen to: they also serve a gameplay purpose. During the missions, the music that plays will normally be very ambient and fade into the background, but when enemies are alerted of your prescense (this game has optional stealth), the music will become more intense, not only to change the mood from that of quiet sneaking to fast-paced gunplay, but also to let you know the enemies are on to you even if you're too far away to see or hear them. The rest of the sound design is solid, with satisfying gun noises that make shooting satisfying if you have to get into a fight. The only sound that isn't good is the sound of assault rifle bullets hitting a wall, which is utterly dreadful. It sounds more like rain hitting the ground than bullets colliding with solid steel, and it takes you out of the intensity of combat.\n\nOverall, Deus Ex's presentation has some problems, but the overall package is one of the deepest, most complex and most fun games ever made, and it also has the advantage of being utterly unique. No other game is quite like Deus Ex and few are as well-designed and compelling.\n\n10/10\n\nP.S. If you're a newbie and you want to play this game for the first time, I highly reccomend downloading this mod for the game:\n\nhttp://www.moddb.com/mods/biomod\n\nIt makes several balance changes to the game, ranging from small changes like buffing some of the melee weapon's damage, to massive overhauls, like replacing the useless Swimming skill with the very useful Atheltics skill, which increases speed and jump height on land as well as in water. There are also some new additions, like the ability to do a Thief-style wall mount if you upgrade your Athletics skill to Advanced, the ability to pickpocket keys from guards, and white phosphorus grenades. Additionally, the game runs smoother, saves take less time, the game autosaves when maps change, and overall it's a straight upgrade from the unmodded version.

And it’s genuinely difficult to choose, when the time comes (and unlike a lot of games I could mention, the conditions for each ending are very clear-cut). I went with my gut feeling just as I did the first time I finished the game all those years ago, picking a kind of benevolent dictatorship, which meant turning my back on an old friend. And I felt genuinely bad for betraying him, for derailing his most worthy intentions. When a game can elicit that kind of emotion for a character who is a few lines of code, some sound files and a 3D model, that’s probably about when you’re hitting the magic criteria of art.","July 30, 2011","true","23.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kentlang/recommended/6910/","kentlang","Protesting Guy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kentlang/","230 products in account","Deus Ex is often claimed to be the best game in computer game history. Personally I agree but it's not without it's problems. Join me while I take a look at this critically praised title.\n\nThe Story\nDeus Ex begins in the docks of the island where the statue of liberty is located at. The island is under lockdown because of a terrorist attack by an organization called "NSF" that has managed to overtake the entire island. You are "JC" Denton, a nano augmented super agent working for the security agency UNATCO (United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition) and your task is to infiltrate the statue of liberty and capture the leader of the terrorist attack alive. You meet up with your brother: Paul Denton which gives you a weapon and the location of a contact that can help JC into the statue. JC is later tasked with working under the supervision of his machine augmented collegue Anna Navarre in several tasks related to attacks against the NSF.\n\nThe story has no problem introducing new characters to you. All the major characters you meets are colorful and memorable but most of all they feel real.\n\nLevel Design\nWhen you exit the docks you come across patrolling terrorists pretty much instantly. How you prefer to go up to the tower of liberty is entirely up to you as there are a number of ways to do so. The level design in this very first level is optimized to be as open as possible with plenty of secrets so it makes newcomers confused as to where to start and how to approach the problem. If you search around you will find to be able to get the Sniper rifle and the Crossbow on the very first level of the game.\n\nThe other levels in the game varies with open areas and enclosed areas but they're never entirely linear. They are more often than not full of branching paths but of course there are a few linear levels which JC has to venture though but even those can be progressed through in different ways, making for a truly varied experience. Almost all levels in the game allows for a subtle approach (or even several) but a direct assault approach is never out of the question either. However, the game rewards subtle approaches more than lethal ones which is apparent even in the first few levels of the game.\n\nThere is however one level that I want to bring up, directly before you arrive in Hong Kong - where you need to rescue your helicopter from a hangar of some sort: While not being a bad level in it's own right - this level did not add anything to the game and felt entirely unnecessary to me.\n\nRPG Elements\nJC Denton starts out with a couple of skill points which he invests in different skills. These are in several different areas ranging from very useful to merely a convenience. The developers are aware of the convenience skills and they cost a lot less than the more essential skills that you can invest in. So if you want to be able to be a great swimmer it will not cost as much as being a good hacker or a good shooter but it will still cost something. Even if you don't have any skills in the different areas you will still be able to do these tasks - albeit at a higher cost of the resources to carry out the tasks. For example you might come across a locked door. If you are untrained in lockpicking you will only be able to unlock 10 points (of a universal maximum of 100) from the lock per lockpick. As the tools of these trades are relatively difficult to acquire large numbers of and locked doors being plentiful this skill easily turns out to be one of the most useful ones. So if you're untrained you will merely have to be more selective in the doors you want to try and unlock. If you run out you can also sometimes just blow up the door with explosives but the explosives in this game is even more rare than lockpicks. Unlike lockpicks though - explosives mostly only need 1 charge to succeed.\n\nDeus Ex also features an "augmentation" system where you get to choose between different buffs and abilities JC will permanently be outfitted with during the game. JC can choose between being better at smashing peoples skulls in with melee weapons or lifting heavy boxes and crates. One allows JC to take people down in one hit and the other allows him to bring cover or trap people. You also get other kinds of abilities like being able to either be invisible to people or to cameras or being able to see details of your target (like health and weapons) or have night & heat vision. You always have to choose between two augmentations that works in similar ways but they also need to be upgraded and upgrading is something I think the game could have done without; because without the need to upgrade, augmentations could have been playing a larger role (especially in the early parts of the game) instead of being a bonus on top of JC's more useful Skills system.\n\nCombat and Stealth\nBecause this is an RPG - Deus Ex's combat changes according to the skills JC acquires during the game. The game favors silent takedowns as the game isn't afraid of pitting you against several enemies at once, but in a way it is possible to try and engage the enemy with lethal weapons as well but perhaps not as rewarding. Eventually though JC pretty much needs to equip himself with some form of lethal weapons due to the increase of armored enemies during the later stages of the game. This oddly enough gives a sense of progression and a strange dynamic to the fights where you have to use the less lethal weapons against human grunts and the lethal ones against the tougher ones.\n\nThere is one strange thing with Deus Ex's aiming system where you have to crouch in order to get maximum accuracy. It's mainly a way to allow players who doesn't have good fighting skills to still be able to defeat someone with a gun. The games has some other, more desirable options open for such players such as throwing grenades and using pepper spray.\n\nOf course sneaking is the greatest asset to JC and you don't have to skill up in order to be a great ninja in this game. In fact: JC starts as a pretty good ninja right from the start. As long as the player sticks to the shadows or behind the enemy he's not going to be able to see JC coming and be entirely in the mercy of the players whims.\n\nConclusion\nDeus Ex does have it's problems, just like every single other game but somehow what Deus Ex tries really works. The story, despite it's weaknesses is ultimately very good. The pacing is brisk and you're never without any goals. The level design ranks as one of the best in games up to this point. And unlike so many other games from 2000 this game actually looks really good. Much of what isn't done very good or great is at least solid and the game has very few apparent weaknesses.\n\nMost games I play have quirks that makes the experience playing them somewhat worse by being central mechanics. Deus Ex's problems are very minor in comparison of it's qualities. The augmentation system that I mentioned earlier is after all "a bonus" since JC's power really comes from his skills system. That's why I believe Deus Ex is as great as gaming has ever gotten and deserve a 6 out of 6.","January 11, 2011","true","32.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
