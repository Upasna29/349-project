"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/454200/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Neon Hardcorps is a top-down action game that has, to date of writing, received a positive reception. The game is clearly inspired by the top-down shooters that were at one stage the rage of the gaming industry. Although some time has past since that was well and truly the case I do have a place in my heart for these types of games. Some of them are among my all-time favorites include the Alien Breed franchise on the Atari, The Chaos Engine (Soldier of Fortune) also on Atari and Mega Drive, Commando, Gauntlet, Ikari Warriors and plenty more. That I am instantly reminded of enjoying those titles only served as a positive to Neon Hardcorps.\n\nNow I'm not going to lie to you and tell you that the game is as good as any of those classics or that it measures up to them in any way. Those titles are some of the more treasured titles in gaming history. It would be unfair to expect that from a young developer. However, what I can tell you is that I thoroughly enjoyed the several hours that I spent playing Neon Hardcorps. It was certainly not just a case of playing the game to collect the trading cards that came with it. There are far worse top-down shooters on Steam and yes, there may be some better ones as well. But for an asking price of just $1.99 if you don't get it bundled you're in for a treat.\n\nPros:\nSimple controls & gameplay: The game plays and controls very simply. This will make getting enjoyment from the title a relatively easy affair for most. You don't need to be a specialist top-down shooter player to get into the game and enjoy it.\nUnlockable characters: I quite enjoyed the fact that you begin with three characters unlocked and then you get the opportunity to unlock even more as you go along.\nLow specs increases accessibility: Most Steam gamers will easily satisfy the spec requirements to play the game.\nTrading cards: A lovely set of Steam trading cards\nPrice: A low price for a small indie title shows that the developers aren't out to screw their player base over. It's also been bundled quite heavily so I'd jump into one of those if you can.\nCons:\nGamepad controls: I found that the game was better and more intuitive to play with the keyboard and mouse than I did using the gamepad. I can't quite put a finger on it though it did seem quite a bit easier.\nNo achievements: c'mon man.. This is a game that should have achievements and they're not there!\nTrailer: This isn't related to gameplay but a lot of people watch trailers before they elect to purchase a game. Being unable to get the name of your game right in your own trailer does not do a very effective job of marketing your game. That this has remained the case for quite some time lends a level of criticism to the professionalism of the developers and/or publisher. I support you guys but please fix this silly error. If the original name of the game was Neon Harcorpse then I could understand, perhaps, but at some point you're stabbing yourself in the foot.\n\n\nConclusion\nNeon Hardcorps is a solid debut title. A fun little top-down shooter that many gamers will find some joy in playing. A little bit more professionalism from the developers would be nice (re: trailer presentation not being updated) but genuine kudos on bringing a solid title out of Early Access. A solid recommendation at the cheap price and doubly so if you jump in on one of its bundles.","May 30","true","5.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shaide/recommended/454200/","shaide","GaNoo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shaide/","1880 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe game looks good for a retro wannabe top down shooter. Though honestly, I am not sure if these graphics qualify as retro anymore, since there are more "Retro" game releases than there are eye melting graphical games. It's pretty much "Modern graphics" now, and the epic  graphics are almost Retro in a way....Anyway! That's beside the point, and I am rambling.\n\nAs I said, the game looks good, and is a top down shooter. I personally love top down shooters, but I did not like this. I'm not sure why exactly unfortunately. I think the main reason is the controls. It's keyboard only, and I just feel this type of game plays better as a twin stick shooter.\n\nAnyway, as the game develops hopefully they will had gamepad support. I am still recommending the game, because it's not HORRIBLE.....in fact it has really good potential and I am kind of anxious to see where the game goes.","April 1","true","5.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/r0flcopter/recommended/454200/","r0flcopter","Rip","http://steamcommunity.com/id/r0flcopter/","963 products in account","I think this game has a lot of good intentions, I think it has a lot of positives, I think the developers had the right idea. But right now (as of the time of this writing) as it is, I feel like it's a not a product ready to be rolled out to the public.\nI think it has a great visual style, it brings me right back to old 90s DOS top-down shooters, this is what appealed to me the most. This is the games most redeeming feature at the moment. The game does need a ton of small tweaks and fixes.\n\nThere is very bad feedback, visually or aurally, when it comes to the UI. When you click on something in the menu, it doesn't highlight or make any significant sound when you click, it feels very cheap and whipped together this way. If you click on the wrong item, like "New Game" instead of "Continue," you can't go back at all. You're doomed to start over (which I did). You can't adjust the volume, controls, or anything else once you're in the game. You have to exit to the main menu first. In the stats at the end of each level, the words "Bullets" in "Bullets Fired" is spelled wrong ("Bullits"). Overall, the UI needs some serious quality of life adjustments.\nThe flow of the game is not very intuitive. I was playing the first level, then at the end you can choose to go 1 of 2 ways. I chose way #1, ended up fighting a boss, beat him, then went back to the beginning of level 1 (??). So then I chose way #2, fought a boss, beat him, and went back to the beginning of level 1 (??). At the end of each level, you lose all of your weapons for some reason and go back to just having a pistol which, like all ot her weapons, is very unfun to use. There is no dialogue, no subtitles, no story to speak of, so I don't why I'm doing anything.\nIn the game itself, the graphics are 90's sylistically, and so is the music. But sound effects are straight from the 70's, as if they were from the Atari 2600. In my opinion, all of the sound effects need to be scrapped. It makes combat extremely unsatisfying. The shotgun, for example, doesn't feel chunky and heavy and it isn't satisfying to fire because it just let's out such a pathetic little sound. This goes for all weaponry, including the enemies'. There is no sound for reloading and very little feedback when you take damage. Your character moves very slowly, but  the movement animation is very fast, it's a little awkward and stange. Some of the bosses and mini-bosses shoot projectiles that just move too quickly, it makes trying to time the rhythm and finding a pattern very clunky and awkward. When you die, there is nothing. One frame you are alive, then when you take the last hit, the very next frame you're at the last checkpoint. And for some reason, often times when you die, you will continue AHEAD of where you died. Again, it feels very cheap and patched together. Enemies don't have a death animation, the just turn into a blood splatter on the ground, again, within the span of 1 frame. It just makes everything feel low quality. Finally, after about 20 minutes of gameplay, I had more than enough money to completely max out all of the upgrades for all 3 characters.\n\nAs you can see, the game just needs a lot of small things. I think the devs need to put more time into details (death animations, weapon feedback, sound effects, menu feedback etc), not take shortcuts and put some more focus into quality of life for the user, because right now it's very frustrating to play. Keep up the good work devs, ignore the naysayers, work hard, don't be afraid to fail, trust your vision, I'll be happy to turn this into a positive review when the game gets polished.","June 3","false","1.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","3"

A return to the main menu would probably be better\ni got it on sale for 95p but dont let the price disuade you. ramp up the difficulty and let this game last till the dev(s) add more content","March 20","true","0.5"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

It offers you a variety of different weapons and 6 different characters with different armours. You can also use abilities like rushing to an enemy and knocking him down. You are also able to purchase character upgrades and make your character even stronger. The Game is played on tactical and boss maps with a very nice cyberpunk design.\nThe controls of the Game are not too hard to understand and work perfectly fine. Also the character moves around perfectly smooth and the KI of the enemies is also well programmed. Also the difficulty of the levels increases just fine.\nSince this Game is in early access I am pretty sure it will improve a lot and will become even better!\nSo all in all the Game is very fun to play and remembers of old retro flash Games. So I would suggest you to buy the Game now because the discounted price of $1,20 is just perfectly fine.\n\nRating:\n7.2/10\n\nPros:  Well-made Game\nGood top down action shooter\nSimple controls\nA lot of different characters\nWorks also on older devices\nWell-chosen music\nTrading Cards\nCheap\nCons: No Achievements\nHardware Information\n\nHardware   Type     Monitor   BENQ 24 inch 1ms    Headphones   Apple Earpods    Keyboard   Dell Basic Keyboard/ Integrated Alienware Keyboard     Controller   Xbox 360    Mouse   Zelotes T-90    Microphone   Integrated Laptop Micro    OS   Windows 7","March 25","true","2.5"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

The controls are good and action is non-stop. Its clear this game is a homage to the 16-bit era shooters. You can buy upgrades for every member of your squad. And you control only one member at a time; if you wanna change it you have to reach a certain checkpoint.\n\nOverall, a nice retro and stylish game, easy to pick up and play.","March 22","true","1.9"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

It's realy thought out, the graphics are great, the dificulty is way high, just like i like it. The fact that its in Early Access is clearly visible but the game is going the right way and with more content i could easily lose myself playing this for a couple of hours. It realy reminded me of the old Contra games. Its a great little game and i can easily see this turn into something more.","March 21","true","0.4"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"
