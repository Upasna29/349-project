All achievements and collectables unlocked.\n\nThis game was an absolute pleasure to play. It's a short indie game telling a mature story of a young girl and her broken family trying to come back together as they make painful choices, solve difficult situations, and all the while unraveling a mysterious tale of science & intrigue closer to the heart than expected.\n\nI understand this may not be for everyone... but the deciding factor I believe we should all consider is this is a very affordable, small-team, indie game worth experiencing. That said, the amount of storytelling I experienced was amazing.\n\nIf it is worth anything, I have a background in animation as a storyboard artist... I am especially keen to stories that feel "thought through" from start to finish, and not merely trying to get to certain moments or even the climactic finale just for the sake of it. This story has scenes from the whole way through that truly made my wife & I get pretty darn sad.  Stay for the end...\n\nThe difficulty is quite easy, and that may throw some people off... in my opinion however I enjoy story over challenge, so making all the collectibles glaringly obvious throughout only made me focus on their content and how it intertwined with the story rather than the pursuit. This is very subjective, so those looking for a hard time may be turned off. I've read here & there some having troubles with the shadow puzzles; this again is a tough one, as I got through all of them pretty easy... the most I spent was maybe 20-25 minutes on the last act's few big ones... still, the visuals and little rewards you are given with wonderful voice acting or visual design was well worth it.\n\nSpeaking of voices, the acting was tremendous. We especially enjoyed the voice of Didi, as child voice overs can sometimes be a hit or miss.\n\nVisually the game is an absolute joy to experience. Didi and Dawn are interesting, and I even grew to love the wonderful silhouettes of the characters around them. The soundtrack is very well thought out and you can clearly see the sound & visuals were designed hand in hand to compliment each other.\n\nI know reviews can be a subjective mess for some, but I hope this helps in whatever way it can! I'm a pretty level-headed, patient man who really appreciates good art & story. If this isn't your cup of tea, I again remind you it was a fifteen dollar purchase that definitely wouldn't make you regret the experience.\n\nI'm not a hardcore "anti-big publisher / developer" gamer, but I do want to say, humbly, that games like this make me so hopeful and excited about indie games. They provide an intimacy and patience in story I don't see often enough in the AAA titles.\n\nVery best regards,\nDDCP","November 27, 2013","true","4.2"," 309 of 319 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","309","319","0","8"

One of the real treats of the game is the music - perfect jazz and sexy voice of Kat Malenkaya (what a nice character name). The main  theme reminds me of a song "I wish you love" from "Eye of the Beholder" and Jessica Rabbit's "Why don't you do right". It is so romantic, sensual and emotional. Dawn is a very interesting main character (now I want those striped leggings), but I want to know more about her, her mysterious story was not fully told. Contrast is a game full of beauty, the dialogs make you sympathize with characters, 1920's Paris, the lights, burlesque and the circus are absolutely gorgeous. There are couple dissapointments - the movements (jumps) are glitchy and the game is too short. Thats it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/224460/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","There are so many cool ideas floating around Contrast without a vessel to carry them.\n\nA puzzle platformer focused around shadows in a wondrous 1920's Paris, it showcases so much potential but fails to utilize it into something compelling. There's a sense developer Compulsion Games wanted to do a lot more with the concepts they introduce, but whether for time or budget reasons were forced to dial back and condense the experience, the results of which are often middling at best.\n\nContrast opens itself from the start with a desire to tell a dark, complicated story of a family split apart, with a husband in debt to some bad people, a mother who just wants the best for her child, and said child blissfully unaware of the trouble surrounding her as she just wants both her parents back. It's promising beginnings however are quickly cast aside for poorly written reunions, characters that seem to recognize the own stupidity of their actions yet follow them anyway, and a juxtaposition of science fiction elements that are all rushed and strung together as if the writer lost sight of the narrative halfway through and began grasping at straws to tie it all together.\n\nEverything interesting about Contrast's plot, from its world of shadow people, impossible environmental deformation, and female led cast are underutilized and painfully unexplored. I wanted to know more about what was happening but all I ever got were a handful of documents left lying around which sketch out a scenario so haphazard and contrived that the story is worse off for including them. Compulsion went through the trouble of making a great environment for your character to explore, but stretched it too thin while simultaneously having nothing to discover if you want to deviate from the set path. It's a lifeless, sterile city that seems so mysterious from afar but ultimately has nothing to show you as you make your way through its barren streets as quickly as possible.\n\nContrast's main mechanical hook of being able to jump into shadows is on paper really neat and creates an immense about of possibilities for puzzle designs and world navigation, but like everything in Contrast it's underdeveloped and poorly implemented. The places you're able to shadow jump (for lack of a better term) are fairly minimal, and you spend more of your time walking around in the real world lifting boxes and trying to control your finicky character. When Contrast works it's tedious and does a lousy job explaining its mechanics, opting for style over engaging gameplay which gets lost under the mountain of technical issues.\n\nYour character moves awkwardly as if it's a puppet trying to break free of its strings. I was constantly clipping on edges while attempting to platform onto places I needed to, and even simply entering shadow mode failed more often than not, sending me careening to my death as an obnoxious restart sound bite played for the umpteenth time. Audio, graphical, and performance issues round out the family of technical incompetency that more than anything sell home the fact that Contrast needed more time in the oven.\n\nWith how great the foundation of Contrast is, to see it come together in such a halfbaked manner is truly unfortunate. There's a very clear vision amid the mediocrity that the developer had much bigger plans than the neutered length allowed them to execute, which makes it so disappointing they weren't able to hold the game back from release until they could be better implemented. I hope this isn't the last I see of Compulsion, but I pray they're given a better time frame for future projects that allows them to capitalize on the potential they almost completely missed this time around.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","December 14, 2014","false","2.6"," 264 of 345 people (77%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","77","264","345","9","10"

The artwork is gorgeous and simulates a surreal, detailed world in an atmosphere similar to France in the 1920's. The soundtrack is also amazing and fits the game and environment perfectly. Contrast is overall quite original, from the shadow-shifting between two different worlds to the special artistic style.\n\nIt takes about 5 to 6 hours to complete. You could think this is rather short, but the delightful artwork really makes up for it. This game really is a story-driven experience, so if you're not into this, maybe this isn't really the kind of game for you.\nI really like the story and the characters. They did a great job on the voice acting. The story is touching, lovely and well thought out, kind of mysterious due to the two different worlds. In the end, I still don’t really know which one’s “real” and which one isn’t.\nThe puzzles are special because of the shadow-shifting mechanism. Each puzzle is different, fun and challenging, not repetitive in my opinion.\nSometimes the game's a bit buggy, like the shadow-shifting mechanism between 3D and 2D at certain moments. The camera can also be a bit buggy and clumsy sometimes, but it doesn’t ruin the game.\n\nSomething you need to know: you can't change the controls. The game works with a QWERTY-setting, so keep this in mind. You can also play this with a controller, which I think suits the overall controls better. I still have to try this, though.\n\nIf it’s in sale, buy this immediately.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/224460/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","We follow the story of a young girl called Didi, viewed from the perspective of Dawn, her imaginary friend. Didi’s parents have a troubled relationship to stay the least. Her father is constantly falling in with the wrong crowd, while her mother is struggling to make a name for herself as a singer. Didi takes it upon herself to mend their marriage, with a lot of help from Dawn. No one else can see her, but that doesn’t mean she doesn’t exist, as she has the ability to switch from the 3D real world into the 2D shadows.\nIt is a really interesting mechanic that has you relearning what you know about puzzle games, much in the same way that Portal did back in 2007, but sadly not to the same extent. There are some very clever puzzles to be solved here, but they are just not up to the same quality as Valve’s finest. Most of the game you will be moving physical objects around, or shining lights on them to create shadows. You can then run up to a flat surface and shift into it, and platform across the shadows as if they were physical objects.\nThere isn’t a great deal of variety though. In general if you can interact with something, you will know it needs to be used to solve the puzzle in some way. You gain a dash ability, which enables you to smash through real world objects, and more importantly to travel through solid shadows blocking your path, but other than that you will just be jumping. You can grab ledges and pull yourself up, but the game is very picky about which ledges you are allowed to grab. The platforming itself isn’t as precise as I would like it to be. Being able to clamber over the shadows of people as they are having a conversation looks really cool, but I was constantly slipping off or getting caught on little edges.\nThe first time I loaded the game up, I was about to hit New Game, as you would expect. But then I stopped. The song that was playing over the menu was so good, that I sat there and listened to the whole thing before beginning my playthrough. It wasn’t long after that I was supposed to follow Didi to the next area, but instead I stuck around in the Ghost Note, a cabaret club, to catch the end of a song through the closed backstage door. The soundtrack in collaboration with Laura Ellis is superb, I just wish there were more of it later in the game. And that goes for the actual gameplay too.\nVisually it looks pretty good, with an obvious emphasis on contrast between light and shadow. Although the overall tone of the game is dark, there are some nice splashes of colour, and some really bright areas. The only character models in the game are that of Didi and Dawn, the rest of the characters are depicted only in shadow, a device used by much of the noir fiction that Contrast is based on. There are plenty of clichés from that era that the game falls back on, but it is never too cheesy. Despite the youth of the character that the story revolves around, the narrative is quite grown up, and definitely becomes more complex as it progresses. I got a very Bioshock Infinite vibe from it, although the storytelling and the world are not as in depth.\nThe games  premise is one of the most original I've seen in recent times, but it’s just not quite fleshed out enough. I would still recommend playing it to see the clever ways in which you can interact with the environments, and the story is good enough to keep you interested throughout. I hope the ideas and themes can be perpetuated into a new game in the future.","July 13, 2015","true","8.9"," 43 of 48 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","43","48","0","0"

Its got a similar art style to Bioshock Infinite and Dishonored (although a little less refined) - which I loved in both those games - so I didn't hesitate to order when the game popped up on the store front for pre-order.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=201760763\nContrast sets its tale in the 1920's and contains a mix of Vaudeville and Film-Noir elements. This is where Contrast succeeds admirably. From the carnival atmosphere (something I imagine Coney Island would have looked like back in the 1920's) to its bitter-sweet tale of a child born to parents that have very little use or time for them. These are the kind of parents that never gave a second thought to what it actually means to raise a child simply because it looked like fun and then not dealing well with the intrusions to their personal lives and space that children bring along. It's also about how these kinds of children learn to cope in families like these by often retreating into fantasy worlds.\n\nNow if this where a movie it might have almost been one of those little indies that crosses over into the mainstream on its way to becoming a sleeper hit. With a heart-felt story about the perils of growing up somewhat unwanted and set within a striking sense of place, a wonderful jazzy 1920's soundtrack and a rather ingenious gaming world that makes use of the physical realm but also the planes that exist between light and shadows. So where did it go all so wrong? If Contrast was Compulsion Games first stab at a puzzler/platformer made by people who have never played a puzzle/platformer before in their lives then it shows. Now that I have finished the game - I would be loath to call Contrast anything but a success story considering the games platform mechanics are so God-dam awful. Simply put they are a complete mess.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=196189523\nFirstly - the games jumping mechanic barely functions the way one would expect when it comes to games of this nature - with precision. Getting too close to an object often results in the main gaming character (Dawn) unable to perform a jump of any kind. These invisible walls seem to work differently for almost every object you encounter in the game so it becomes a mix of frustration and anger when you begin your 10th attempt knowing full well that skill has very little to do with it. In fact you are better off casting your dice with lady luck to be honest! It doesn't end there however. Dawn has only two movement speeds (controlled by the left analog stick). Press down too hard on the control and Dawn will appear as if she has a rocket attached to her backside as she flies off in the direction you have indicated which often results in her falling to her death or from the particularly high level platform you have spend the last 30 minutes trying to successfully climb. The other movement speed is akin to watching paint dry and it doesn't help one iota that the movement controls are so super sensitive.\n\nDawn also has a rather annoying habit of constantly getting stuck in the environment which no succession of jump presses will resolve as she stands dead on the spot. This happens more often than not so frustration is going to run pretty high for those that don't tolerate this kind of stuff very well. There are a host of other problems like Dawn being able to pass through various solid objects but not others when in the physical realm. I lost count the amount of times I passed through a rope-lining because I pressed too hard on the twin-stick and went flying off the edge of the screen - passing though barriers and all. The save feature doesn't work either (why we PC gamers are still subject to this console save crap is beyond me) but on more than one occasion the game said it had saved my progress only for me to return and have to repeat sections of the game I had already passed before the game saved. Let me tell you how quickly annoying that gets in a short space of time.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=195499806\nI suppose the biggest disappointment is that Contrast squanders it's rather novel concept around light and shadows. Required to traverse between the two planes successfully in order to compete the adventure disappointment settles in quickly when you realize that while the concept is awesome its totally squandered here. This ain't no Portal or Quantum Conundrum in terms of design and creativity. What we are left with is rudimentary and thoughtless. With such a novel gaming world concept you would think that it would have been successfully exploited and fleshed out. If you were expecting this then be prepared to feed on the bitter seeds of disappointment. I could scarcely believe I was playing the same game I was so eagerly anticipating since the trailer made it look so promising and exciting. Its like having a university student hand in a thesis with killer topic only to realize once you start reading it that they abandoned any creative thought after coming up with the title. The puzzles involving light and shadows are so simple that there is no challenge to them whatsoever. The game even starts phasing them out towards the end opting for the annoying "place this box on this lever plate to open this door". It was incredibly sad and annoying to see the game go this way especially when I had been rooting for it all year long.\n\nI really wanted to love this game but it's a mess on the game-play front and I simply have to ask did Compulsion Games even bother playing their own game because a lot of the games issues are so evident right off the bat and especially when your game relies on them so heavily too in order to be successful. A few more months of tweaking and fixing might have resulted in the game meeting expected platform standards, however, no amount of mechanics tweaking would be able to offset the dull realization that the main shows implementation falls completely flat. Rather purchase during a sale or at a discount price instead. As it stands this game is not worth the paltry $14.99 shape it finds itself in currently.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","December 15, 2013","false","7.0"," 100 of 144 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","100","144","0","18"

But it isn't perfect. The controls are noticably stiff at times, but one can argue that this is purposly design because your character is walking around in heels. Not much opened endedness, which seems like it should but you are stuck on a one way path. But, the good things about this game is the platforming sections and it's unique "shadow" mechanic. The platforming feels like it wasn't just a another "ok, let's just put this here, that there, and this over there" kinda platforming. I honestly felt like I was playing in a Banjo and Kazooie style platforming, something crafted over time and really thought about, not just something crafted in a few minutes. The story is kinda there, and not. Your character is utlimately ignored in the main story, only a few people will talk about your character. But they never provide much information about you, and your character never talks either...so that doesn't help with this mystery about your character. The game can be done in a matter of minutes, or a few hours, it all matters on your skill level and how fast you are capable of beating platformer games. But, I will tell you this, you won't regret this experiance if you liked banjo and kazooie.","November 25, 2013","true","12.5"," 47 of 58 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","47","58","0","2"

I will however touch on a few issues; the controls - the whole shifting into shadows and out again sometimes bugs out, tossing you out of shadows for no actual good reason. In addition, some puzzles require you to stand in a specific place before it'll show you the progress, having spent about 30 minutes trying to make an impossible jump I face palmed fiercely when I found out by accident that I simply needed to walk onto the shadow of a cigarette.\n\nHowever, those two issues aside? The game is worth the money, I wouldn't say you're getting spoiled rotten with content, but you will get an appealing little tale, with decent graphics, amazing music score, and a fresh take on the platforming genre.","October 21, 2014","true","5.2"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","25","26","0","0"

After that you have to complete a few of jump sequences,....i fell a lot of times into nowhere and that was not that dramatic because you restart at the very same point where you made a mistake. So finally I was there,....and had to complete my very last task. To point with a spotlight at a specific point. That was not working. It didn't trigger the cutscene. So I had to go back to main menu and "resume" my game. But,...I was far away from the spotlight. So I had to complete all puzzles again.\n\nSo what I want to tell you with this? It's not perfect.

The story is pretty compelling as well, it has quite a few heavy subjects done in a way that seems genuine and not just thrown in for shock value...  The game has a few somewhat open areas to play through in each Act, the game is comprised of 3 acts,  each act will probably take about an hour or so.  The puzzles are fairly simplistic, although that isn't really a bad thing.\n\nThe story centers around a little girl known as Didi, she has an imaginary friend named Dawn, often being left alone at night so her mother can preform Didi enlist the help of her friend Dawn to sneak around in a landscape which is set in 1920.  Going along with Didi, the player (Dawn) will be introduced to numerous interesting characters shown only via their shadows.\n\nThe length of the game is rather short, I have 11 hours clocked in but over 8 of those hours were from  idling cards while I slept.  I played the game completely and got all the achievements in a little under 3 hours.\n\nI'd recommend this game for the gameplay, interesting art style and compelling story.

The game takes place in a Paris-like city in the 1920's and is also the debut for Canadian developer Compulsion Games.\n\nSTORY\nDidi's mother dumped her father a long time ago and since she is a singer at a night club, nobody is watching after Didi at night. Naturally, little Didi takes this as an opportunity to take her imaginary friend Dawn with her on a night-time scouting expedition throughout the city to discover that her father came back and tries to win the heart of her mother again. But something stands in the way...\n\nI'm not sure if I just didn't get the reason for this during my play or of this was a story element deliberately chosen by the developer to create a certain experience, but apart from Didi and Dawn, all characters in the game are shadows, so you never see them in 3D. This works out okay, but makes the city look fairly empty and liveless most of the time. Considering the beautifully designed enviroments, this is a bit of a shame.\n\nVISUALS\nThe game is based on the Unreal Engine, so visually the game looks really beautiful. The overall art deco style of the game, the level design and the lighting effects fit together perfectly and create an immersive atmosphere. Quite frankly, a lot of the visual elements remind of of Bioshock: Infinte which, funnily enough, is also based on the Unreal Engine.\n\nUnfortunately, as with many UE-based console games being released on PC, the game doesn't really offer a vast amount of graphics options. Apart from gamma, graphics quality, resolution and fullscreen there's nothing else to adjust through the game directly. Don't get me wrong: The game looks great regardless but definitely could've used a bit of Anti-Aliasing. This could probably be tweaked through the config files or external tools such as SweetFX or your graphics drivers directly, but personally that wasn't really worth the hassle for me, so I decided to stick with the options that were available.\n\nVOICE & MUSIC\nThe voice acting is surprisingly good for a non-AAA game like this. Didi's voice actor has that cute little girl's touch to her and really fits great to that character. Her imaginary friend Dawn, though, doesn't say a single word throughout the entire game, so whenever Didi talks to her (you), it always feels kind of weird that she never really answers. Might be one of those imaginary-friend-drawbacks, though. Who knows, heh.\n\nDidi's father is voiced by Elias Toufexis, who also voiced Adam Jensen in Deus Ex: Human Revolution. I was definitely surprised to hear him in this game but recognized him right away because of his distinctive voice. Voice acting for the side characters, which often tends to be poor because of limited budget, is also pretty decent, so nothing to complain on that side.\n\nThe game being set sometime in the 1920's, it is accompanied by a fitting and relaxing Jazz-y soundtrack which fits the overall atmosphere of the game perfectly. Not exactly my musical taste, but then again, a Death Metal soundtrack wouldn't quite work in a game like this. Heh.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nYou control Dawn, the imaginary friend, and Didi effectively becomes your sidekick. Throughout the game, she will assist you with a couple puzzles but most of the time you will have to solve them on your own to clear the way for her, so you both can progress on your journey.\n\nThe main gameplay mechanic is the shadow shifting, which you will use to solve puzzles and overcome obstacles such as huge gaps and so on. How this works is, that you basically approach a shadow that is cast by certain objects in the level, hit the shadow shift key/button and Dawn transforms from a 3D character into a 2D shadow, allowing her to climb around on those shadows. Together with the dash ability, that you unlock relatively early into the game, this makes for some partially challenging platforming as often the shadows will move (because the objects that cast them move) and thus require you to time your actions.\n\nWhile this mechanic is pretty cool and unique and works out quite good, it often suffers from imprecision and the fact that you often get shifted back into 3D for no apparent reason. You can't die in the game and if you fall down into the void, you will simply respawn at the puzzle again. This makes failing not that much of a big deal, but keeps you wishing the developer had put a bit more fine-tuning into the gameplay mechanics to reduce or eliminite those annoyances alltogether.\n\nFor some puzzles, you have to move objects around such as wooden crates, serving carts or cardboard stand-ups, so they cast shadows in the right size and angle for you to be able to jump and move on them. This adds a bit of variety to the puzzles and demonstrates the impressive lighting effects the Unreal Engine is capable of.\n\nThe puzzles as such generally are farily obvious and easy. The challenge often lies in the platforming or the object manipulation that comes with them, so often you have figured out how the puzzles work but will eventually struggle with the right shadow setup or the right timing during the platforming itself.\n\nAll in all, it's definitely a cool mechanic but could've been pushed a bit further with a bit more extensive and varying puzzle design to actually test your combination rather than your platforming skills.\n\nPLAYTIME & REPLAYABILITY\nWith roughly 4 hours of playtime, which included collecting all collectibles and getting 100% of the achievements, the game is relatively short and could probably be beaten in around 3 hours if you just rush through it. There aren't any additional game modes, so, apart from replaying the story for the collectibles/achievements, there's nothing else to do in the game once you've beaten it.\n\nCONCLUSION\nContrast is a short but beautiful and charming puzzle platformer with a fairly unique gameplay mechanic.\nThe game undoubtedly has some minor flaws and annoyances, but if developer Compulsion Games is able to deliver such a debut, I'm definitely looking forward to see more of them - and more of Contrast.","December 28, 2013","true","4.0"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","2"

Puzzles are built around the concept of traversing shadows to get to places you could not otherwise reach. Unfortunately the execution is lacking. The game is VERY finicky when it comes to where you can enter the shadows and if you get even the slightest bit off while in shadow you'll pop back into the 3D world and have to begin what you were doing from the beginning.\n\nFurther, there's no educating the player going on at ALL. Studying Half-Life 2 and Portal's puzzle education should be mandatory for all aspiring puzzle game developers. On several occaisions Contrast throws some new concept at you and forces you to realize it's there. The end result is a game that you're fighting with in order to play instead of one you're figuring out. Frustration abounds, not because you cannot figure out what to do, but because the execution has to be pixel perfect or you have to start over.\n\nI would LOVE to be able to recommend Contrast. I really would. The music, the art style, the gameplay concept, the story of a kid with a troubled home life seeking to fix her world in any way she can. It's all great, but the core mechanics are just not there. Perhaps with some polish Contrast can become a game that I can recommend.

A simple three-dimensional platformer where a flick of the wrist turns into a two-dimensional platformer. Such a decision we have already seen in several projects, unlike Contrast - to use lights and shadows to create and manipulate level elements.\n\nContrast short game: Three acts can run for 2.5-3 hours, even with search collectibles and secrets. The final stories are so predictable that they are even insulting. The visual style and mood of the game promises some mystery , detective story or drama, and as a result we get some banal family history, a place that in some lowly daytime drama. A pity.\n\nGameplay:  This puzzling platformer built around the ability to turn into a two-dimensional character shadow. You press the button, the camera hangs somewhere on the side, and Dawn leaves from himself only a shadow in the form which overcomes obstacles and chasms . Depending on the shape you need to change the situation: a break in the wall will not go through the shadows, but to circumvent it in bodily form can be easily. On the other hand, the flesh will not leak, for example, through the glass, but the light (and shadow) will penetrate through it without any problems.\n\nEmotional Impact:  The emotional impact that you receive from the story is the jewel of Contrast.  This leaves you with a very memorable performance throughout the three acts.\n\nVisuals:  Incredibly stylish and beautiful thing. Almost every game screenshot can be long and enthusiastically regarded as if considering - a jazz fan, retro, cabaret and burlesque - the pleasure is doubled.\n\nStory:  The whole essence of Contrast - in the plot. Didi not the happiest child in the world : the parents at odds , mother rambles in the entertainment business , his father trying to deal with their problems , but even more breaks in them. But meanwhile, the sly little Didi goes into his inner world - a natural reaction of protection against the constant attacks of the vernal world. And the inner world in turn leads you, purely friendly shadow named Dawn\n\nSummary:  Contrast is a game full of heart, beauty, and at least a few excellent puzzles. It’s at its best when it marries its poignant story to its platforming, and at its weakest when it’s about moving boxes, but it rarely goes very long without showing us something worth playing.","November 27, 2013","true","22.7"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","0"

The controls are okay - would be nice to be able to bounce off walls.  There were a few situations in Act 3 where a light cart would get stuck or a ball would end up in the wrong place and I was unable to move it back.  An addition of nice save spots in Act 3 would have been a good.  What could have better?...a bit more interaction with the little girl..with Dawn voiced.  That would help.

It's thick with noir atmosphere.\n\nBut you play as Dawn, a mysterious woman who can transform herself to a shadow and run on the walls whenever there is light. This is when the 3D gameplay changes to 2D. You can use same abilities in the 2D and the 3D world. Which aren't much, movenent, jump, interact  and dash. There is no combat in this game, but on one scene you need to use your wits to overcome an enemy.\n\nThe world and the characters look great, although the world is really empty. You can only see Dawn and Didi in this world. While others are shown only by silhouttes and this only happens in small cutscenes and other storytelling parts during the actual gameplay. The Jazzy soundtrack is really great whenever you get to hear it.

Some of the story is also explained with the collectibles only, so if you want to get the whole story you need to collect those.\n\nFun little game that clearly needed few months more developement time before publishing.\n\n\n[Score: 79]","July 14, 2015","true","3.3"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

Remember how afternoons after school could be filled with fantastical worlds brought forth from the trees, the rocks, the tall grasses in the backyard or the field near your neighborhood: all you needed was your imagination. Remember as you went to sleep at night and stared at the shadows in your room, sometimes in wonder, and sometimes in fear of the shapes they made. Remember how life could be magical in the most ordinary of things and how, as you grew older, you longed for the days when reality didn't have to be so damned real all the time: homework, bills, politics, relationships, family...\n\nThat longing is at the heart of Compulsion Games' lavishly realized and gorgeous platformer adventure Contrast. Set in 1920s Paris, it paints a dreamlike world of cobblestone roads, nightclubs, and carnivals, all of which will at once remind you of Bioshock Infinite's art deco atmosphere, the simple drama of Hollywood's Golden Age, and with perhaps a helping of the musical Cabaret. Didi is the young daughter of a quarreling nightclub singer mother and a sometimes-there father who is trying to strike it rich with some shady investors but, as often is the case with shadiness, never quite seems to get a break. Didi copes with all of this with the help of the player in the form of Dawn, Didi's tall, waifish, silent imaginary friend, and the game leads Didi and Dawn through the nighttime town trying to help her family with their woes. To say any more of the plot would be a disservice to you, so let's move on to the gameplay.\n\nAnyone who recalls making shadow puppets on the wall as a kid will instantly feel in tune with the core mechanic here which involves Dawn's singular ability to become a shadow on the wall, quite literally. There is a sense of astonishment every time the game opens up a new platforming section because it is all done with light sources: streetlights and spotlights are switched on and suddenly and quite beautifully make the most ordinary setting, like the facade of a storefront or the walls of a hotel, into a visually striking obstacle course for Dawn to traverse. While sometimes the gameplay could occasionally be a tiny bit tighter, it never gets old to "shift" into shadow, and you will be challenged to think in some strange ways to solve some of the puzzles in your path. This is a mechanic as new and different as Portal's portal gun and it's something you will remember long after Didi and Dawn's story has concluded.\n\nThat conclusion, unfortunately, comes much too soon as this game is quite short on the order of four or five hours, although you could spend a long time marveling at the charming art style of the characters and the setting of the moonlit Paris suburb, not to mention looking for and gathering each of the areas' collectibles, which add little distinctly artful flairs to the main story here and there. Normally I would find this too short of a game, but I can't bring myself to complain and here's why. A lot of story-driven games want to say and do a tremendous amount of things in the course of their stories, because, understandably enough, the developers want to have as many opportunities as they can to wow the pants off you with crazy setpieces and wild spectacle. The trouble with that is they almost always seem to get off course somewhere along the line and it can feel like a total sensory overload that in the end leaves you reeling, and not always in a good way. (I'm looking at you, Bioshock Infinite.) But Contrast has a single story to tell through Didi's young eyes and, without distracting you with twenty different characters and eight bizarre environments and thirty different weapons, Compulsion Games excels at telling it, a very ordinary, touching, human and absolutely enchanting story. One of my top games of 2013 and I very much hope it receives the wide recognition it deserves in 2014.","January 3, 2014","true","8.8"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dons20/recommended/224460/","dons20","TRU±PlayMaker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dons20/","569 products in account","IntroductionContrast is a wonderfully designed, story-based platformer and adventure game that combines intriguing puzzles with 2d shadow elements. Unfortunately, the game suffers from quite a few jarring issues, and I'm only recommending it because of a pretty interesting story.\n\nGameplayYou're Dawn, the 'imaginary friend' of a little girl named Didi, and you'll go around with her discovering a pretty intriguing story involving Didi's parents. Now I won't reveal anything more about it, since the story is the best part about the game. So what about the actual gameplay? Well you usually have puzzles to solve involving shadows. Dawn can go into shadows, anywhere that light is blocked by an object, and she can move along a 2d environment whilst in the shadows. This is a very promising mechanic, but unfortunately it can feel rather clunky at times. To be honest, the idea was a very good one, but the execution was a little less satisfying. Puzzles were very creative, and never felt too difficult to solve at any point, but some interactions were rather slow and boring, turning the excitement from discovering a really cool puzzle into a boring waste of time. There were a lot of mini-cutscenes constantly interrupting gameplay which made the game feel a lot more laggy than it should.\n\nBut the gameplay was not all bad. It had some really fun moments, including a minigame where you played a shadow character inside of a story, moving light sources/objects around to manipulate shadows and even shadow dashing through some timed objects in order to reach a certain platform. There are many collectibles to get and they are divided by Acts. Each act has its own set of collectibles and achievements, so if you're interested in getting those, I'd suggest you follow a guide because this game has one glaring issue here. Bugged achievements.\n\nAfter completing the game for the first time, I went to each specific chapter in order to get the required achievements/collectibles for those sections. However some of them took a couple tries to even work, and one refused to work no matter what I did. I had to start a completely new game and get all the collectibles in order to finally get the last achievement. And the bugs aren't limited to achievements or collectibles, oh no. There are a lot of glitchy areas in game which can cause you an immense amount of frustration depending on how hard the game is for you in the first place. I've managed to collect everything and complete the game, but others have had issues with various bugs, so be aware of this.\n\nVisualsContrast shines with its unique, noir-film styled game. Every aspect of the game feels like something from an 80s film. Lowering the graphics to the lowest setting removes most of that look, but the characters will dress the same nonetheless. Environments are well designed, and actually rather beautiful...the interiors that is. The world that you're in, is empty, lifeless, and generally boring. It's unappealing to walk around anywhere outside, but the interiors feel like something you'd want to be in. Again I'm conflicted here.\n\nAudioFinally, something I can totally recommend without hesitation. The opening music is one of the best songs I've heard in a long time. The voice-acting is top-notch. Every aspect of the sound is golden and really sells the feeling of the game. I'm just sad we can't buy the soundtrack on Steam yet, because I'd happily buy that in a heartbeat.\n\nSummaryWell this is an interesting game to say the least. It has really good ideas for gameplay, an amazing story, a unique visual style and creative puzzles as well. However my experience in the game has not been without its share of frustrations, and I think it is important to consider those issues as well. I'm going to recommend the game based on the story and music only. The world did not appeal to me whatsoever and the countless bugs/glitches really took me for a ride.\n\nSo now, if you as a buyer can appreciate the fine selling point this game has, and you are willing to deal with less than fluid gameplay, then you'll have an enjoyable experience playing Contrast. If not, this game probably isn't for you.\n\n6.5/10 - Good ideas, flawed execution.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Apart from the one feature that makes this game unique (Shadow-Shifting), Contrast is your basic 3D platforming game. The best way I can describe it would be for you to take the gameplay mechanics of Alice: Madness Returns and mix it with the atmosphere from that of the movie Barlesque. That's actually the perfect example of what we have here.\n\nTo start, there's some things this game does extremely well, the storyline for one, is fairly captivating. Contrast's story revolves not on the main character but actually a young girl who you accompany throughout the game. The emotion of the story takes hold of you from the very beginning, leaving for no disconnection for the 3 and a half hour journey.\n\nThe art style is very nice. It's almost a cel-shading effect, but the game lacks visual settings and options for use if anti-aliasing, fov, and other things that could have really enhanced the visual experience quite a bit. Still, not at all a bad looking game. Despite it lacking anything technically deep, there were times where I looked at a setting and said "Wow... this is simple but just so beautiful in that simple yet effective kind of way." After awhile, you learn the hard way that even though only some walls are fun to shift into to. Some others make you scratch your head and think "What was the point of this? Why am I able to shift on an object that causes me to spaz out" things of that nature. These small detection errors can cause puzzles to be frustrating at times but still, when it's done right, it works and it's fun.\n\nThere's some things this game does extremely well, the storyline for one, is fairly captivating.

I was expecting something more and a lot harder. The larger puzzles still only take a few minutes to solve. If you're looking for a real puzzle game, you will be dissapointed.\nHowever, the atmosphere of the game is great: the puzzles tie in nicely with the story, the collectibles (documents and photos) are actually worth collecting, as they add some background to the story and the story is quite funny at times.\n\n\nIf you're looking for a challenge, this game probably isn't for you. If you're looking for a nice story with a bit of player interaction, you'll most likely enjoy this. However, I'd suggest you wait 'til the game is on sale, as you'll easily play through it in under 4 hours.\n\nIn short: Are you looking for a good story? Get this when it's on sale, it's very enjoyable but too short! Are you mainly interested in puzzles? Better look for a more dedicated puzzle game.","October 29, 2014","true","3.8"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

I recently bought the game while it was on special and have been very, very disappointed with it. Let me explain:\n\nThe game, overall, has immense potential. The plot was quite interesting (for an 70's/80's setting), but you keep waiting for that 'oomph' factor that never arrives. Instead, you're reduced to a puppet who follows the instructions of a little girl who ultimately, towards the end, becomes very annoying.\n\nYour character learns some valuable skills, which you will probably never need to use ever again. Its just disappointing. Certain skills (like dash) you might need later on, depending on how you play really.\n\nThe controls are absolute ♥♥♥♥♥. ABSOLUTE. ♥♥♥♥♥. You think I'm joking? Go ahead and play this game and then join me in saying its ♥♥♥♥♥, because it is. I don't know about those who used a controller, but for anyone using a keyboard, I'm so sorry. I can imagine what you may have gone through because of this game.\n\nThe camera IS WORSE. Its terrible. Absolutely terrible. I can rarely turn a corner WITHOUT the camera making a 360 around me. I honestly need to pause and regather my surroundings before moving on.\n\nTHE SHIFTING. OMFG. The shifting in this game is an absolutely wonderful concept but you'll rarely need it for any good purpose. You only need to shift to move objects, solve puzzles, and very rarely, to attain items. THAT IS ALL. To make matters worse, sometimes you will get stuck as soon as you shift, unable to move at all, OR you'll suddenly be thrown out of your shift (this is often not going to be your fault).\n\nThe game is set in a very surreal map that's sloppily done. You can easily glance through walls, end up in several hundred glitches, die making a very small jump, think you have discovered a secret area where you might find an item only to discover that its a dead end that the developers left to screw with you. Haha. Screw this ♥♥♥♥.\n\nIn all faireness, Contrast is an exceptionally interesting puzzle game which I would have highly recommended, however, as it stands, I'm afraid I cannot. Like many others have mentioned, if you do find this game on sale (75 - 95 percent off) then grab it and give it a try, otherwise, you're better off saving that cash for something else.","September 7, 2015","false","4.9"," 30 of 48 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","30","48","2","0"

It's a stylized, animated style which summons up a surreal Jazz Age Paris (?). It's affecting and evocative and surprisingly detailed.\n\nThe game's shadow-shifting mechanic is novel, and the puzzles I've encountered thus far are unusual, but not frustratingly so. The story's the thing here, in the end, and the traversal puzzles and the jumping are just what you do while moving through -- and moviing forward -- the plot.\n\nUltimately, this is a game which tells a story. It's told mostly through cutscenes, but the voice acting is generally superior, and the writing is solid, which keeps it all interesting. As has been said, there's a vaguely Bioshock feeling to the storytelling -- there's a mystery unfolding, and a faint air of tragedy or melancholy surrounding events, as if something sad is about to occur, unless it can be outrun or outthought.\n\nYou play as the shadow-shifting "imaginary friend" of a little girl named DiDi, whose parents are on the edge of serious trouble. The game doesn't fully explain itself at the start. and certain events make you wonder if the often surreal landscape you move through is simply reality colored by a young girl's imagination or something ... else ... yet to be discovered.\n\nThe game isn't perfect, of course. The shadow-shifting mechanic doesn't always activate as intended, forcing retries of a jump puzzle sequence. Also, for Steam PC users, the controls for this game were clearly designed for consoles, so if you have a USB game controller hooked to your PC, you'll almost certainly have a better time using that.\n\nAnd again, the puzzles and the narrative style of Contrast will not appeal to every gamer, but if you're intrigued, I'd say take a look.\n\nContrast may well be a flawed gem, in some ways, but it's still a gem. Gamers often say they want "something different" in their gaming. Here it is. Recommended.\n","October 17, 2014","true","4.4"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","17","24","0","2"

This meant that the entire chapter had to be replayed, including the collection of the luminaries. Many puzzles were far too easy, and often seemed as if the solution was directly given to the player. The game seemed choppy and could have had much more fluidity. Contrast was fun when there were no bugs interfering with my playthrough, but rarely was I fully immersed in the game.","November 17, 2013","false","5.2"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","17","24","0","0"

Puzzles may take some people a long time, but for the most part they were easy and entertaining (in my opinion). I would not buy Contrast for the base price, however at a discounted price, of course I would, no doubt.\n\nThe storyline is quite deep and a complete analysis of what's going on/has gone on/will happen will take forever because of the unexpected plot twists. Again, like some Indie games, the focus was on Dawn, the supporting character you play. Technically the main character is Didi as she is the one you're helping.\n\nI still have many questions and am quite frustrated because my questions cannot be answered. I would love to have some sort of a sequel of this pleasant Indie game which focusses more on Dawn and Dawn's predecessor (Aurora). I want to know more about the Shadow World and how it works, along with information about Didi's interactions, and why no one in the 'Shadow World' can interact with Dawn while she is a Shadow etc. But a good game, just like a good book. leaves the player with unanswered questions that you feel a burning need to get answered...\n\nI hope the new game that Compulsion is developing will focus on the Shadow World.

Manipulating light sources to move shadows around is intuitive and adds some complexity to the puzzles.  Transitioning in and out of shadow is fluid and also fits well with the rest of the platforming.  That being said, the clunky physics will frequently and unexpectedly push you out of shadows, often times due to a poorly designed obstacle location.\n\nThe highlight of the game is clearly its fantastic art design.  The surreal Parisian-noire tone is presented well, covering everything from the lighting to the architecture.  Once you've accustomed yourself to the art design however, there isn't much more to the game.  The story is charming but rather predictable, the environments are small and sparse, and the puzzles are short and straightforward (complicated only by the aforementioned shadow physics).  Most irritating for me were the constant fade-to-black mini-cutscenes, which take away control from the player and ruin the game's pacing.\n\nThe pop culture geek in me got a kick from the various movie easter eggs (Casablanca!

The premise is neat - you control Dawn who can literally "shrink into the shadows." However, the execution is poor; the controls are clunky; the story is cliche; the writing is atrocious; and the voice acting is grating.\n\nThe game is broken (intentional pun) into three acts and tells the story of Didi who is the only one that sees Dawn. While you can shrink into the shadows, the lights only light up in the areas where there is a puzzle. Everywhere else, there are no shadows. Given some of the platform jumping needed for the puzzles, the controls are wonky. They are extremely loose and the camera wanders which makes the POV confusing. Sometimes you will do a puzzle and the camera is in one location. The next time (because you fell) it is located differently and can't be moved to a better location because it is stuck or something.\n\nThere are collectables in the game that are easy to collect. They are usually in your path and have blue sparkles swirling around them. In addition, there are several luminaires in the level. These are balls of lights that can be used to power equipment. These are spread through the level - some in your path (enough to finish the level) others in harder to reach areas. However, in many cases if you don't get them you can't get them later. In order to get full completion, you have to start over. I did this several times. Frustrating...\n\nThere are no people in the game, other than Didi. Key story points are told through shadow figures. (My wife saw Didi's mom and made a comment that she wouldn't be able to stand and likely would end up on her face she was so top heavy.) This is interesting enough, but the shadows clip through the environment. Along with the voice acting, I was pressing the "Y" button to skip them. Some special swirling items activate "special" shadow show puzzles to flesh out the story.\n\nIts not all bad. Some of the puzzles are clever. Act II is pretty neat. Didi needs to fix a circus for her dad. And as I said, the idea has potential, just poorly executed in my opinion. It is hard to recommend this game, especially at full price. Wait for a sale.

They\re quite stylish, '30-'40's style, but they're also a bit dark sometimes. As a result fine details aren't sometimes clear enough. Nothing gamebreaking but a bit disappointing. And while the game makes you think the world is open there's usually only one correct path to follow. You can run around a bit and try to collect orbs or collectibles, but it's nothing fancy. Where Contrast shines, however, is the fact that it allows the main character to use shadows in order to solve puzzles. It's unique and usually works quite well, but there were a few times where the game got glitchy, getting the character stuck in the environment or switching to your 3D form while still using these shadows.\n\nThere's also a story which is actually fine, just not very well realized. There's a connection with the little, physical girl but whenever there's a shadow conversation it's hard to connect with these characters, because they're just that; shadows.\n\nThe music is actually well done, with some nice jazzy tunes in it. The voice acting is also done extremely well for a game of this caliber.\n\nThe game ended after about 3 hours, which gave me mixed feelings. I kinda wished it was longer, but, you know, bigger and better. But because it's not I was actually glad it was over. It felt a little bit too gimmicky.

In Contrast, you play Dawn, the silent 'imaginary' friend of a young girl named Didi, whose mother is a cabaret singer. Throughout the game you help her solve puzzles and get past obstacles by using Dawn's ability to 'shadow walk' in 2.5 style platforming sequences.\n\nWhile the game is not a technical marvel, Contrast oozes atmosphere. Inspired by a 1920's vaudeville style, the game features impressive if somewhat linear levels. The choice to make almost all of the characters actually shadows of themselves thrown on to a wall Dawn is platforming across is a very nice touch that allows for almost all of the story to be explained while you're playing the game, so cutscenes are down to a minimum(in fact, there are only two or three actual 3d models of characters in the entire game, one of them being Dawn, the player character) while giving you something to pay attention to in cooperation with the gameplay.\n\nGameplay wise, Contrast is fun, but is hampered somewhat by glitches and clipping issues. Some parts can be aggravating simply because Dawn clips weirdly into a shadow or hits a part of a wall that randomly ejects her from her shadow persona, usually over a bottomless pit that resets you at the start of the current section. Despite this, the shadow puzzles are well thought out and interesting, and despite hearing a lot of complaints in the reviews on the camera, I found that the developers managed to make the camera do what the player wanted(many times I found the camera 'locked' to a certain axis, which made platformer easier and highlighted spots I should be focusing on). There are many times when Dawn got caught on pieces of the level, or clipped at the edge of a shadow and simply threw me back out again, failing the puzzle. However, these issues were minor enough that there were only one or two times I truly felt the game was entirely at fault.\n\nContrast's level design is pretty solid, though very linear, with the world well conceptualized to mix between shadow movements and 3d overworld sections, which serve to move you from one section to another. Occasionally I did find sections where it wasn't clear where I was supposed to go(In one, I had to resort to a walkthrough simply because the game's lighting hadn't highlited a jump point properly)\n\nThis is not a very long game, but I think I like that(the entire game and all collectibles took a few hours at best). Not every game has to be 60 hours of content. Like a movie, this game has a story to tell and it's good at pacing itself for that story without dragging. The best description I can give for the playthrough is 'comfy'. It's not particularly hard, but a few of the puzzles make you think. And that's really Contrast's largest failing, in that the game is relatively easy for these sorts of games. I think this is by design, as it feels like some things were made simpler for a younger audience. Collectibles are sprinkled directly in paths you'll be heading anyway, and simply add little flairs to the story exposition wouldn't be able too, so I have no complaint with them.\n\nAll in all, Contrast is a pretty decent buy for the price, though some leery of its short play time might want to consider wishlisting and waiting for a steam sale.\n\nPros\nNovel idea\nInteresting Style\nChildren-friendly gameplay\n\nCons\nOccasional glitch/clipping issues\nShort play time.\nNo replay value.","June 24, 2015","true","4.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The characters aren't much "characterized", but they make their part good, thanks to the great voice acting. But there is a problem. Big problem.

Just touch a key on your keyboard or move the analog stick on your controller and you'll see the protagonist flying away with a turbo speed; this makes her hard to control, and it's the main thing since it's a platform game.

Few games can be considered a visual and audio delight such as Contrast is. It is definitely not for everyone, not action packed or with potential cliffhangers but it’s by far a star.\n\nIt’s the result mix between the 20's- 30's atmosphere, the vintage representation of the decadent circus life, the dream shards of a Parisian street, and the film-noir instrumentals. It has clever and most importantly aesthetic puzzles, playing with memories and shadows.\n\nIt does however have its disappointments: few bugs and glitches that may at times annoy the player a bit. I also heard that people have problems playing the game itself because it freezes (it happened to me as well but only on short period of times) and crashes; and of course, the biggest problem of the game is that it’s too short. I would have adored to spend more hours of gameplay; not only that but because the game is too short we have to take the characters as they are, with few information about them and we have to adjust to the ‘momentary’ feeling of the plot.\n\nIn what concerned the characters and the story telling: it’s a great plus.

But it just... is not that good. The concept, the art style, jumping between to worlds seems amazing and in fact really is but on the other hand playing is totally frustrating sometimes.\n\nThing is you start this extremely weird looking game and be like "oh god this looks awesome" and after some time you discover that you can switch between 2 worlds and you go "that is AMAZING". But after that you really play it and it is just HORRIBLE. Every 5 minutes you get into the moment when you know what to do, how to get there but the game is somehow broken and you just cant do it. Massive bugs and awful checkpoint system make it a bad game.\n\nWhen you 10 times fall from the ledge and the girl tells you for 11th time to "hahah i know what to do..." and repeat that same monolog she already did 10 times.. you just wanna throw a brick in her face.\n\nContrast has looked sooo amazing at the store page so I've bought it in sale for like 5 € and I would really regret buying this game if it was at the full price. I have had to convince myself to give the game another shot to finish the story but it was for the purpose of finishing the game and not enjoying. There is a little chance for you to enjoy the game but for me it was just a horrible experience which is a shame because i mostly love these arty, weirdo games.\n\n\n","December 14, 2014","false","2.8"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","15","25","0","0"

It's a noir-mystery that's filled with creativity, empowering messages, and gorgeous graphics. You play Dawn, a picturesque, fashionable, mute woman who can fade into the shadows, unseen by the colorful characters that walk among your partner in crime. You're there to aid Didi, a brave, optimistic, imaginative young girl trying to pick up the pieces her broken family leaves behind. The still life of everything around Didi and Dawn are metaphorical in that it makes the situation seem dark and bleak until you play through the puzzles and breathe life into everything.\n\nI would have had a problem with the length had the story not been executed as well as it was. The mechanics are unique and unlike anything I'd seen before and it seems like they've fixed all the glitches fans mentioned. I also used a controller so shifting from 2D to 3D and vice versa was done with ease. About midway, I started wondering who Dawn was and how she spawned from Didi's mind and was left with a treat in the end when all of my questions were answered.\n\nThis game has a lot to offer and if you ever get a chance to pick it up, do it.\n\n8/10","January 21, 2014","true","4.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Contrast. Lets first get some things and negative points out of the way:\n\n\n\nThe game is very short. About 3-4 hours, 4-5 if you want to get all the collectibles.\n\nI bought it during a 75% off sale, thus i cant judge well if it would be worth the full price. I would advice to wait for a sale .. like 50%-75% off :D Do keep in mind.. this is only based my normal 1 euro = 1 hour of gametime, nothing else.\n\nThough it plays fine with a keyboard and mouse and has not a single problem while using those devices, as always i would advice playing a platformer with a controller. (Game has amazing controller support btw, even switching from keyboard to controller in the middle of a tutorial text, the line will change the keys the text redirects you to)\n\n\nNow the good things:\n\nThe music is amazing. The jazzy style with some sweet vocals now and then made me finish this game quicker then expected due to being able to play longer without getting bored.\n\nThe atmosphere in the game is the other big part. It feels as if you got trown back into the past.. back to the time of the blues, gangsters and burlesque. Alot of the game being darker colored with not that much massively bright colored objects make it an amazing experience.\n\nNow the platforming. When i started playing i felt trown back into another one of my favorite games in the past years.. Alice: Madness Returns. A 3D world from third-personview with platform elements while getting you further into the story in between. Even though Contrast doesnt hold any combat, the platforming parts are quite active... it doesnt just stop with moving platforms..nooooo.. because Contrast has something else.. shadows.\nYou are able to go into the light reflecting on walls etc. and go inside of your own shadow, allowing you to go alot further then just walking on physical objects. Combine this with being able to dash and be able to become a shadow even when mid-air makes for some exciting puzzles. Its not THAT hard but i can see some people taking their time at some puzzles for sure.\n\nThe story is great. Because your own personage stays on the background, you get fully emerged in the story of the child you are taking care of. Lets just say it has some nice twists and emotions (Not as emotional as Brothers: A tale of two sons (of which im not afraid to admit is the only game in history that literally made me shed a tear for a sec) with a good plot (though it might be slightly confusing for some ;D). I wont spoil anything of the story so enough about that!\n\n\n\nNow the conclusion. Great game, nice controls, gameplay and atmosphere feel amazing and suck you in. Not supermemorable game that will change your life entirely but still a very very well-made game.\nI would rate this game 7.5-8/10.\nNot sure if i would pay full price since im a cheapass :P but at least worth looking into and certainly worth buying with any discount.\n\nIts on 75% discount till 2 December (2014) btw.","November 29, 2014","true","5.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It's based on a really interesting concept, is set in a cool environment with great art direction, and it has a killer soundtrack. It also has a fairly decent story (or at least the beginning of one).\n\nHowever, despite these things, much is left to be desired. Character animation and control is extremely stiff. Most times you'll know exactly what you need to do, but the game's temperamental controls will prevent you from actually accomplishing it. A major frustration was the game randomly deciding to pop the character out of the "shadow realm" for no apparent reason. Even running along an even surface sometimes resulted in the character popping out and falling either to her death or back to the beginning of a platforming section. Another frustration was the fact that, despite controlling a character who's supposed to be an agile acrobat, you often feel like you're controlling a much larger character who's invisible bounding-box is always bumping into things and preventing seemingly simple jumps from being accomplished.\n\nSadly, I have to go with "not recommended."

Didi wants to get her father back to her family and you have to help her. To do so, you have to fix some things and open the way where didi is not able to get through. The interresting thing here are the game mechanics. You have to move objects in front of lights sources to change the shadows on the walls. Then you can step into the walls so that you can move along these shadows. You have to take objects with you when you are a shadow on the wall, to bring them to the place where you need them. And so on. Thats quite unique and a pretty nice idea. It is really fun, to figure out which step you need to do next, to solve all these puzzles. BUT: I finished this game in about 3 hours with almost all the collectable items (I missed 2 Items somewhere) This is a bit short in my opinion and this is the reason why I would recommend, to buy this game if you can get it in a deal and not for the full price.

I feel as a player I want to know a bit of backstory when going on the big quest but I guess I can't ask that when the game is supposed to be a big odd puzzle with shadows jumping around on buildings in love.\n\nBesides the story the gameplay is really original like no other game with the unique mechanic and odd puzzles that are very hard to solve from time to time, though I really wish the story would carry the game as much as the atmosphere does. With that said, if you want to have a hard time solving puzzles (atleast I think it's a challenge), and be in the spotlight from time to time as a lurking shadow in Paris among other awesome places jumping on everything you can jump on as well as shadows, then this game is for you!

It's a platform-based puzzle game set in a surrealist, steampunk, early 20th century paris-like city. The player controls Dawn, the imaginary friend of the main character Didi, who has the titular power of being able to switch back and forth from the physical world to the shadow world. The player uses this ability to solve the many puzzles that are conviently wrapped around the story line. I don't want to delve too deep into the lore of this story, since most of its value comes from its twists (which is bad enough that I'm addressing), but it is something to witness. I wish that the game explored certain aspects that I felt needed developing, and the ending was a bit lackluster.\n\nI have two main quips about this game. The first is its glitches. Sometimes when doing certain puzzles in the shadow world, the game will inexplicably pop you back into the physical world. Puzzles like these just require trial and error, but in a game where the main goal is to challenge the player's smarts and not their patience, it has no place. The second quip I have is the length of the game. It only took me three and a half hours to finish this game, and I usually consider myself as someone who plays through games very slowly. Since I actually got this game as a gift from a very generous friend (thanks BOT Mathew :3), I'm not that mad about it. However, if you plan on buying this game, ONLY GET IT ON SALE. It is definetely not worth a full $15. Other than that, I love this game. The controls are great, the visuals are engaging, and the collectibles give an excuse to marvel at such a beautifull world.\n\nTL; DR: A very pretty game with an interesting story and even more interesting puzzles, yet can get a little buggy at times and is too much for its price considering its length. A must get game while its on sale. Can be considered one of those "art" games.\n\nOverall Score: 6.5-7","August 31, 2014","true","3.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","4"

And while I do still recommend it (to a point), the final package ended up being a tad underwhelming. But let's start at he beginning. There is a lot of good to the game, specifically the elements I just mentioned. The setting (early 20th century Paris) and art direction are very interesting, and there are lots of cool things to see throughout the journey. You play as Dawn, the acrobat "imaginary friend" of a young girl named Didi. The game revolves around Dawn's ability to transform from a 3D person into a 2D shadow. As a shadow, you can maneuver along any other shadow, as if it were a normal platform. Puzzles generally involve manipulating light sources to create navigable shadows, and then platforming your way through those shadows to reach new areas. The story, without revealing much, is just OK. It involves Didi's lounge-singer mother, her loser father, and a mysterious magician named Vincenzo. There's nothing wrong with the story, but it's also nothing mind-blowing, for the most part. And that sort of sums up the game as a whole - merely adequate. The main gameplay hook of transforming into a shadow, while cool, just isn't enough to sustain a whole game in its own. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of neat segments and cool applications of the idea. But after a while, you'll start to get the feeling of "been there done that", only in a new location. Not to mention, most of the puzzles (such as they are) are very simple anyways, there's not all that much meat on the bone in terms of challenge or completely fresh ideas. I am not sure they even could have added anything more to improve the game. As I said, it's perfectly adequate as-is, and definitely doesn't overstay its welcome. I just have this nagging feeling that there were missed opportunities for additional puzzles or ways the shadow mechanic could have been used. Maybe that's unfair, but so be it. Despite all this, I actually did enjoy and have fun with the game overall. I just feel that maybe with a bit more development time, it could have been better. But what's here is definitely an interesting experience, and worth checking out if the atmosphere or shadow mechanic intrigues you, as it did for me. The entire experience lasts around 5 hours or so, so also keep that in mind when considering your purchase. I would say hold off for a sale, unless you really feel the need to check it out right away.\n\nMy only real complaints would be for technical issues. Specifically, the game lacks many of the customization settings one would expect in PC games, such as video options and the like. Personally, I had an issue with the lack of an option for x-axis inversion for the camera controls. And while there is still no solution patched directly in game (at least as of the time of this review), for the record, I wanted to note that the developers actually responded to my request within minutes and provided a configuration file fix that could be changed manually to implement that feature. While it wasn't the ideal solution, I really appreciated their responsiveness, as it allowed me to play the game the way I wanted. So kudos to the developers for that. Which reminds me - I definitely recommend a gamepad for this one.","November 26, 2013","true","5.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

When there is a  big sale   on, something around 75% off - still think twice. The The whole game is a series of disappointinng shortfalls. Here's my story explaning why:\n\nI noticed Contrast over a year ago and the concept of the game, coupled with what I saw on the trailers and in the screenshots, had me really wanting this game. The price though was a bit steep, so I only got it on sale recently. And I'm mighty glad I waited. Without further ado, here's what's wrong with the game.\n\nFirst of all, the story feels like scribbled down on a knee five minutes before the writers had a deadline to submit it. Nothing to keep the player interested, just a generic tale of a child and her parents don't quite form a perfect family. The characters, save the protagonist, are shallow, one-dimensional and there's little reason for anyone to form any sort of emotional bond with them. The only chance of livening up the plot  when the player discovers collectibles pertaining to Dawn and Vincenzo in the last act  is merely reduced to finding some collectibles and one scene just before the credits.\n\nSecondly, the gameplay is, to put it bluntly, rubbish. Platformers in the 90's offered better game mechanics. The fantasticly promising concept of manipulating lights and shifting between shadows and the 'real' world is there just so you can jump on some platforms and move one or two boxes around. Nothing else. And one more thing here: the player character gains some skills for no apparent reason and then hardly ever uses them.\n\nThe controls are simple but even there you can find an issue, as the shifting mechanism often has a mind of its own and Dawn gets thrown off the platforms without the fault on the side of the player.\n\nGraphics. To be fair, the game looks alright. Nothing remarkable though. The models are edgy, locations deserted for the most part (I'm talking here about items, not characters - the lack of the latter is just part of the game) but the overall feeling is positive. The atmosphere in the locations is nice, kind of gloomy and decadent at the same time.\n\nOn the other hand, the animations is where the game should deliver and fails completely. The protagonist is said to be an acrobat. Therefore, her moves should be fluent, graceful and light, which they only are when the character is walking slowly or standing still and I'm not convinced that this should be the case in an action game. The animations of Dawn interacting with objects or moving stuff, as well as thhe animations of all other characters feel terribly outdated.\n\nFinally, the music, where the game promises much but delivers little. Despite what you might think having seen the trailers, there is in fact very litle music in the game. Soundtrack activates only when the player apporaches a certain location. Truth be told, the best piece of music was the one in the main menu. Character voicing is just wrong, its highlight being Dawn, who simply says nothing throughout the entire game.\n\nFortunately, Contrast is a very short game, in jusr 4 hours I manged to obtain a 100% playthrough. I say fortunately because I could not bear any more of the feeling that there's a game that could have been brilliant and turned out mediocre.\nPros:\nGreat noir setting\nFairly good graphics\nSome nice music\nGreat protagonistCons:\nLight/shadow manipulation reduced to one power\nUninteresting, unoriginal storyline\nAll other characters except the protagonist\nVery short\nAnimations from 15 years ago\nGameplay from 20 years ago\nImprecise controls\nWasted potential everywhere\nA final note: the ending hints, rather obviously, at a sequel. Unless the developers do some serious work to deliver a more complete experience with a story and gameplay to match its lovely graphics style its going to be, at least for me, a flop. So a word to the producers: Please, please do it right, because I so want the concept to be given the game it deserves.","July 1, 2015","false","4.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

And all of those things create the world of contrasts, in which our heroine, Dawn, helps her friend Didi to find out her family's mysteries.\nI really love atmoshpere of "Contrast", dark streets with neon signs, unseen colors which blossoms in the streetlights (when graphics set on "low" worls appears much more colorful; I like darker city better, but I think it's interesting to play with both settings - just to see differences and to decide which world you find suitable for this story). Little things you will find - photos, newspapers, letters, etc. will make you better understand Didi's parents and the whole concept of traveling between 2D and 3D realms.\nPuzzles are not very hard, but quite nice and sometimes rather challenging.

It cought my eye because of it's art style. After watching the trailers, I added this to my wishlist and purchased it during Winter Sale.\n\nWell I'm not sure how to rate this game. It's really well done in the visual and aural departments. The atmosphere really transports that 20s France feeling. But there are some things to be improved.\n\nGraphics:\nNot much to rant about. Maybe that's because im easy to plese with graphics, as long as they just fit together. But there are some glitches, especially on movable objects (crates and balls). The puddles on the streets look more like ice than water. That's because there is no added effect if you walk through them.\n\nAudio:\nAlso nothing to really complain. The music is well done and fits the scenery. I really like the track that runs during the menu screen. The voice acting is okay except for Didi. Her lines just sound "strange" every now and then.\n\nControls:\nMy main complaint. It just feels like one of those early cheap 3D games. I often had problems judging how far I could jump. It just doesn't feel right. But I got used to it after a while.\n\nGameplay:\nYou spend a lot of time shifting into the shadows to acomplish your tasks. Sometimes the engine seems to have problems if the surface you are moving on is not even. If there is a corner, that's also a problem sometimes. But at least once the game forces you to go around a corner (which is evenly lit), so it cannot be intentional that the game throws you out of the shadow realm.\n\nSometimes there are new things to consider when solving puzzles. Unlike in many other games you are not shown that those concepts are there. Like shifting certain objects with you or moving objects using spotlights.

It cought my eye because of it's art style. After watching the trailers, I added this to my wishlist and purchased it during Winter Sale.\n\nWell I'm not sure how to rate this game. It's really well done in the visual and aural departments. The atmosphere really transports that 20s France feeling. But there are some things to be improved.\n\nGraphics:\nNot much to rant about. Maybe that's because im easy to plese with graphics, as long as they just fit together. But there are some glitches, especially on movable objects (crates and balls). The puddles on the streets look more like ice than water. That's because there is no added effect if you walk through them.\n\nAudio:\nAlso nothing to really complain. The music is well done and fits the scenery. I really like the track that runs during the menu screen. The voice acting is okay except for Didi. Her lines just sound "strange" every now and then.\n\nControls:\nMy main complaint. It just feels like one of those early cheap 3D games. I often had problems judging how far I could jump. It just doesn't feel right. But I got used to it after a while.\n\nGameplay:\nYou spend a lot of time shifting into the shadows to acomplish your tasks. Sometimes the engine seems to have problems if the surface you are moving on is not even. If there is a corner, that's also a problem sometimes. But at least once the game forces you to go around a corner (which is evenly lit), so it cannot be intentional that the game throws you out of the shadow realm.\n\nSometimes there are new things to consider when solving puzzles. Unlike in many other games you are not shown that those concepts are there. Like shifting certain objects with you or moving objects using spotlights. I'm not really sure if this is a good thing or not. But I really liked finding those things out by myself. Maybe some optional hints would solve this "problem" for both sides.\n\nStory:\nTo make it short: No epicness, no world rescue, no over the top characters, no "only he/she can do it". But nothing that special either... but as there hasn't been a story one could call "groundbreaking" or "has never been done before" in the recent past, I really like that simplicity.\n\nConclusion:\nAn artistically nice game with a few control hiccups that doesn't do handholding and is solvable without the use of walkthroughs or FAQs.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jragghen/recommended/224460/","Jragghen","Jragghen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jragghen/","965 products in account","This is a solid puzzle platformer, if a little short and rough around the edges. Primary mechanics feature the protagonist moving into and back from the wall, as a shadow. There is an interesting motif associated with this which ties into the story of the game which I'll leave for the user to find out, but it's done in a way that I've not seen in a game before.\n\nThe controls are a *little* loose, and there seems to be a little edge detection problems when it comes to the shadow movement. However, it's rarely overly frustrating. I will say that (with one or two exceptions), the puzzles seem rather straightforward, and even devolve into box puzzles despite the short length of the game - so some folks might find that a little disappointing.\n\nThe one thing that the player should probably be aware of going in, though, is that the story is rather weighty, dealing with some rather serious topics (abandonment issues, deadbeat parents, etc). When I first booted up the game I was looking for something a little more whimsical, so it caught me off guard. Please note that this is not a mark against the game - simply something that I was not expecting, and which other players might want to know going in.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend it for folks who are looking for a short, stylistic puzzle platformer.","February 15, 2014","true","3.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The artwork of Contrast depicts a Tim Burton movie with sex appeal; a seductive world of light and darkness. Contrast adds a unique feature that allows one to shift between the striking 3D fantasy world and the mysterious 2D shadowscape. I was intrigued...\n\nPositive:\n+ Amazing artwork accompanied with amazing voice acting\n+ The story compliments the artwork with a jazzy soundtrack that is a pleasure to experience\n+ Fun puzzles that are challenging but not impossible, fun for everyone\n+ Shifting between 2D and 3D is a fun new feature introduced to platformers\n\nCons:\n- Too Short\n- Story seems rushed\n- Awkward save features\n- A little too linear\n\n(a lot of the negative reviews are from 2013-2014 and complain about bugs, most if not all seem to be fixed)\n\nI purchased this game in a bundle and really enjoy it. I don't think I would pay $14.99 for it because of the length of the game, but if you can get it in a sale or bundle, it's a must try. Simply put, Contrast is a simple, yet poetic game of shadows and light.\n\n8/10","January 30","true","7.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But you will also see an adult world through the eyes of Didi as she tries to understand grown-up problems and tries desperately to get her parents back together. You will need to slip in and out of the shadows to complete objectives and you will often find the need to move light sources such as stage lamps or three-dimensional objects to cast the shadows, which Dawn can then navigate in 2D and progress with Didi. Controls are simple and intuitive and dying does not impose any penalties, (I played with 360 controller) experimentation is encouraged.\n\nDefinately worth the asking price.

Beautifully designed, this is an excellent showcase of developer talent and I hope to see more from Compulsion Games.\n\nContrast follows Dawn, a mysterious woman with the ability to meld into shadows, as she accompanies Didi, a bright young girl who won't give up, on an adventure through the abstract and shadowy reflection of the 1920s. The game itself is short, I completed it in 5 hours but many of you might take less time. As with any game with a similar length, one can't talk about the plot without giving anything away and playing the game for any amount of time will plunge you straight in.\n\nThe main mechanic of this puzzle platformer is the ability to shift into two dimensions and move along the shadows as though they are solid objects. Perspective puzzles are a favorite of this game, as are weighing down switches with boxes. Admittedly the controls, while mostly solid, are sometimes fickle. One puzzle towards the end took me much longer than the others; not because it was hard to figure out but because it was difficult to wrestle the object into place. one aspect of the game I felt could be done better is the collection of Iluminaries, objects used to power the machines in the game. while there are a surplus of them in each level, the game has a nasty habit of locking doors behind you. So in theory, if you failed to collect enough of these things when you had the chance then progression becomes impossible; though this was not the case for me, be sure to follow your instincts and deal with the main objective last.\n\nAt the end of the day I think this game has a lot of ambition behind it and, despite a few hiccups here and there, was very tight and well designed. The game does feel a little bare bones but as with the hiccups I'm expecting that the next game by the Compulsion will solve these issues. I can definitely recommend this game and others from this up and coming developer.","January 17, 2015","true","5.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Is a bad game? No.  If you like light (no pun intended) puzzle games with an Ok narrative an good music and art direction you are going to enjoy this. Is short, the mechanics are pretty clear aside of one puzzle, with an easy solution if you just ignore what the game is teaching you up to that moment  (what is doing is introducing a new mechanic), but is nothing really horrible in the grand scheme of things, the collectibles are pretty easy to spot (some are tied to the story of the game wich is something that i really don´t like in games but in this case it kind of didn´t matter really much) and you are not gonna be heavily challenged by it.  If you are not in that side of the playing field,  this game is not for you\nOn the other hand, when i finished i couldn´t shake the feeling that this game somehow loses the opportunitty of being something really special, because it has a lot of potential, puzzles could be more interesting and the story coud have  packed a lot more punch in the emotional side.  I know that is a little unfair to punish a game for what it could have been an it isn´t, but some games show hints of what could have been an amazing experience and you can avoid that kind of sourness in your mouth,  but, like i said, if you like this kind of games and have little time in your hands to play or you want some palate cleanser between more intense experiences this is a game you should enjoy, i certainly did it, but damn, it could have been really good","October 16, 2014","true","4.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The general premise of the game, both story-wise (Didi and parents) and gimmick/mechanics-wise (using shadows to navigate and solve puzzles), was interesting enough for me to give the game a shot in the first place. I also enjoy the noir style and going back almost a century ago to a different type of world.\n\nHowever, the game really let me down. There's just too many issues that all stack up against it, and the quality of the game seems to bounce back and forth as you play. The story starts off without much information, though I did get into it once I started picking up what was happening. But there are a lot of weird background details that are never explained at all, and nothing much seems to fit together. I also did not think there was much of a climax, and the ending of the game felt very cheap.\n\nThere is no real environment to the game, as the world is weirdly disconnected and with missing areas and emptiness. Basically, there is no "life" to it, is a better phrasing. You just go through hollow areas to get to the next mini-cutscene, and then solve a puzzle. While the visual art style of the game great, and some places look very beautiful, the lack of anything actually inhabiting the areas ruins it. And though the game's gimmick, as I mentioned before, is dealing with shadows, I didn't enjoy every character except you and Didi being shown as shadows. It just felt cheap and as if the developers didn't want to do that design. It only furthers the lack of "life" in the game. And the dialog and sound of the game also was nothing special. Nobody gave any performance that was great, and I think a good few scenes actually lacked any good emotion.\n\nThen you have the mechanical problems, showing that the game wasn't fine-tuned or even tested that well. Your character's movement is pretty far from good, and I often found myself glitching around, especially when you are in the shadows. One of the things about the shadows is that if certain moving shadows are about you crush you, then the game pops you out of the shadows, which is understandable; however, I found myself popping out of the shadows at random points without anything touching me, causing me to fall down and making me start parts of puzzles over and over again.\n\nWhen it comes to Didi, who you are following around, they were very lazy in her movement as well. I would often see her animations entirely stop, so she would "walk" without any motion. She doesn't move her mouth when talking, at least as far as I saw. And half the time you were supposed to find her somewhere, I would walk into the room or area and see her in "generic 3D model" form, standing in place with arms and legs rigidly stretched out as if someone is in the middle of editing her design.\n\nAnd in terms of actually playing, it seemed like "Saving" didn't actually mean the game was saving, whenever it popped up. At least twice, I exited the game to stop playing after it had finished saving, and I came back each time to find that the game jumped back at least 10-15 minutes, so I would have to redo some section. For instance, it did this in one of the carnival areas after I completed it and then quit the game.\n\nFinally, the length of the game - it is way too short, and with all of the issues, it all made it even worse. I don't know if the developer just didn't have enough money at the time, or they just chose not to clean things up or test enough, but the game is very lacking in pretty much every area. It could have been a really great game if they had put in more work.","April 15","false","5.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

I was looking for something different and this filled the spot. I love the jazz and laid back feel of the game. The artwork is very nice too, all the posters and what not. Some people claim the storyline is 'too bland" but I found it very intersting, more so the whole setting of the game than the dialog. I don't want to ruin it but even watching the trailer you will wanting to know what this "shadow world" and how this little girl is coexsisting in each world. The puzzles were good, not too hard, not too easy. I'm not an "artsy" person but I loved the artistic feel of this game.\nMy only complaints are\n1. I wish there were more graphics settings like MSAA, not a must though.\n2. The little girl's dialog sometimes was sporadic and didn't flow.\n3. Controls aren't perfect, a little stiff.\nSome people are complaining it's a short story but I spent 5 hours collecting luminaries and collectables. For $15 it lines up fine with $60 games that have 12-15 hour campaigns (or generally less it seems now days).\nBottomine: Buy it.","December 10, 2013","true","4.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The concept of the overall storyline is interesting with the main character, Dawn, jumping between a shadow world and a 3D world. However, the game mechanics are sloppy and sometimes so bugged that it can ruin the game. At one point, the little girl, was a static figure and simply slid across the screen for an entire Chapter. Other times, Dawn seemed to hit this invisible wall when doing different jumping puzzles, making some jumps almost impossible to do smoothly on a first run.\n\nThe puzzles themselves were interesting and sometimes frustrating - which is always good. However, they sometimes would get so buggy...\n\nMy other main issue with the game was the general graphics of the shadow people. They were exceptionally blocky and I felt that the developers had gotten really lazy. I could see seams on forearms and their mouths never moved even if they were deep in conversation. I felt like they were more like puppets than people.\n\nI also realized, after game completion, that there were significant plot holes surrounding some characters. I have no intention of spoilers, but it is really frustrating when a game feels incomplete in their storyline.\n\nFor the full price, it is not worth the four hours of gameplay. I highly recommend that you wait for a sale and buy it on a whim. I loved the concept, the voice acting (Jensen from Deus Ex anyone?), and the film noir style of both music and setting. However, between the bugs, the blocky animation, and the weak ending, I really felt cheated.","July 20, 2014","false","3.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RemyLabue/recommended/224460/","RemyLabue","RemyLabue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RemyLabue/","394 products in account","Contrast is a 3D puzzle\platformer that takes place in a world full of magic, cabaret singers, and burlesque shows. It utilizes a 1920's 'French Noir Film' art style that is unlike any other game I've played. The character design is beautiful, the voice acting is amazing, and the jazzy soundtrack fits the world perfectly. I can't stress enough how much I love the look and feel of this game. Yet, I can't recommend it, which is particularly disappointing considering how much there is to like here.\n\nYou play as Dawn, a woman trapped between the worlds of light and darkness, and who cannot be seen by anyone except for a little girl named Didi. Didi's parents have broken up, and with the father out of the picture, her mother works at a nightclub to pay the bills. This, of course, means nobody is watching the little demon-spawn and it's up to Dawn to keep her out of trouble. Easier said than done, since she insists on roaming around the city at all hours of the night, refusing to listen to reason, and all you can do is enable her.\n\nThe entire game revolves around a shift mechanic that allows you to become a shadow, an ability you will need to solve puzzles and progress through the game. Adjusting light sources to cast shadows to interact with is this game's bread and butter, and you'll be doing a lot of it.\n\nThe problems with Contrast start almost immediately. While the puzzle mechanics are unique and interesting, they are a bit buggy, and simple platforming can be difficult with controls that don't feel tight or responsive. Dawn has a tendency to get stuck in the environment and other shadows as well. There are even a couple of places where dropping an object in the wrong spot could result in the player not being able to progress further, forcing them to load the last checkpoint.\n\nOnce the game defines the parameters on the first couple of puzzles, it doesn't change them up much and they can become repetitive fast, which really shouldn't happen in a game this short. Which brings me to the biggest issue Contrast faces. The entire game can be completed in under 3 hours, and the ending is exceedingly abrupt. All of these issues combined leaves me with a feeling that the game is unfinished. Almost as if Compulsion Games ran out of money for the title half-way through development. Obviously, I do not have firsthand knowledge that this is the case, but I can't shake the feeling that I'm playing an Early Access game, and not a full release.\n\nAltogether, Contrast is a game that should have been a one-of-a-kind, beautiful experience. When a bad idea becomes a bad game, it's expected, but when something that starts off this amazing falls flat, it's all the more frustrating. I expected better, as did most gamers, and in the future I hope Compulsion learns from their mistakes, and releases games that shows us all what they're really capable of.","November 18, 2014","false","6.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The 3 hours of gameplay doesn't allow enough time for this idea to evolve. Most "puzzles" end up being nothing more than jump - shift - jump - shift. To make matters worse, platforming is a bit clunky. I felt like my character was alittle too big for the world. Missing an easy jump and falling to your death is infuriating, but the game is really forgiving, almost always reloading near the last jump. The main plot, although nothing more than a mellowdrama, hid behind it the more interesting subplot of the player's identity. This, sadly, is only hinted at in clues in the environment and pointless 'collectables'. Then the game ends, not really concluding anything, even the main plot.  I really wanted to like Contrast, but there isn't enough of a game here to recommend to anyone.","November 12, 2014","false","3.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The setting and tone of 1920's noir is brilliant and it shines through in every area; it feels like a mixture between the Sierra Madre and Bioshock's Rapture with the unique lighting, it is one of the best looking worlds ever seen in a game. Additionally, the voice acting is pretty solid and its interesting how you never see the side character, but you see their over the top body language in their shadows, which is quite entertaining in a Vaudville/Groucho Marx way. On top of all of this, the story is pretty good and surprisingly charming.\n\nHowever, that's really the end of the good stuff. Like Limbo, contrast has a really good idea, but fails to do anything interesting with it past the very first puzzle.\nAlmost every puzzle is a varitaion of pressing a button to make something in the room move, which creates a shadow ramp.\nUnfortunatley, there are two big problems with the shadow platforming, which is supposed to be the star of the show.\nThe first problem is that you will periodically stop being a shadow. You'll be standing somewhere and if you hit something (because shadows act like solid objects) you might instantly get out of shadow mode.\nThe second problem is that the platforming is pretty shotty with landing detection and there are times where it looks like you should be able to make it, only to clip through the shadow, meaning you have to start all over. This is especially problematic during the second act, where you have to climb a massive building using the shadows of a carrosel to climb a large rotunda. If the platform detection messes up at all, you have to start all over.\nAdditionally, there's an entire section of this game that is a direct "homage" to Limbo. A section in which you run away in a dark shadowy world from a giant spider. This amounts to about 1/10 of the whole experience, which really shows that the developers were running out of ideas at this time.\n\nBecause of its incredible short length of about 3-4 hours, its boring and repetative puzzles, and its buggy gameplay I can't reccomend this as a game, but I can recommend it for its story and style","June 16, 2015","false","4.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

But ultimately rewarding.\n\nThe pros?  Where to begin!  Absolutely top-rate storytelling (this could almost be a film), sometimes ingeniously clever puzzles (though none so hard that one just throws in the towel), gorgeous graphics, wonderful sound, and a genuine sense of child-like wonder which seamlessly blends with the harsher realities of the adult world.  Think Tomb Raider meets Limbo (that is to say, both 3D and 2D platforming elements, effortlessly combined), with a story and direction worthy of Tim Burton (the earlier one, that one that made the good films before he became such a predictable hack).  Oh, and it's nowhere near as painfully LLLOOOOONNNGG as all games seem to feel the obligation to be these days (or in other words, it doesn't "overstay its welcome").\n\nNow the cons.  Some of the platforming elements are PAINFULLY pedantic...one teeny, tiny miscalculation in where you place a lighting rig (this game is all about shadows), and you could very well waste the next forty seconds running and jumping to a point just to realise you ain't gonna make that final jump.  And then it's ALL the way back to the start of the puzzle again.  And there's some reflex-based moments of timing which become frustrating thanks to the sometimes ill-responsive controls, though fortunately, these bits of the game are at least few and far between.\n\nHonestly, though, none of what I've just said would be all THAT much to grumble about, if it weren't for the POSITIVELY DIABOLICAL SAVE SYSTEM.  Why does nearly every modern game have to insist that if someone switches it on, they'd better be ready to sit there non-stop for HOURS?  Do they not know that some of us have JOBS?  LIVES?!  That we CAN'T necessarily invest two hours at a time into conquering A WHOLE FREAKING CHAPTER before switching off and going to bloody BED???\n\nBut as I said earlier...sigh...at least this is one recent game which doesn't feel the need to give us a non-linear plot full of extreme repetition, constant backtracking, and an "open world" which takes 180+ hours to explore.  Short, and on the whole, very sweet.  But man oh man, do these game designers EVER test their own games, or better yet...give them to NORMAL people to try out before commercial release?  It's a good thing I don't have a "life" to spend precious time on, or I'd just about give away this whole "gaming" lark altogether!\n\nVerdict: 9/10.","November 28, 2013","true","9.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Few days ago I finally decided to check it out and the game charmed me. It has really amazing cabaret/noir style atmoshpere and awesome matching music. Gameplay itself is pretty innovative too. You need to switch between 3D and 2D mode platformer. It is very interesting that in the 2D mode, you can move only on the "shadows" on the walls and flat objects. Shadows can be created by yourself through interaction with various objects in 3D mode. You need to use appropriate arrangement of their relation to one another and to light sources, so in the result you can move on them in the 2D mode.\n\nThe biggest downside is the length of the game - finishing it in almost 100% takes only 3-4h. Also, the "puzzles" are fairly simple. It's a pity that the authors failed to further develop the aforementioned theme, because the game had great potential.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfrevo/recommended/224460/","wolfrevo","Wolf Revo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfrevo/","346 products in account","On paper Contrast seems like a really cool game: a puzzle platformer where you can switch between being a physical person and being a shadow on the wall, using the shadows of other objects to get where you need to go. Couple that with a jazzy nightlife setting, and you can't go wrong, right?\n\nUnfortunately that is not the case. The platforming was often really frustrating and the game was fairly buggy. I found a few places where I could melt with a wall or I would have to jump three or four times to make it onto a ledge that was well within reach.\n\nThe story was alright. You play as Dawn, the imaginary friend of a little girl named Didi. Didi's parents are separated and she sneaks out in the night on a regular basis to watch her mother sing at a club. Dawn helps Didi to progress past obstacles and fix things, and hopefully eventually to reunite her family. Dawn and Didi are the only ones who appear as three dimensional people in the world; everyone else appear as shadows on the walls, and are often parts of the platforming that the player has to perform.\n\nIn a lot of ways I am glad that the game only took three hours. I wish I could recommend Contrast because it has the makings of a cool, unique indie game. But it just wasn't made well at all.

Though I often eschew platformer games myself, the story makes the platforming components an engaging part of the game rather than something leaving me dissatisfied.  The story so far is sort of haunting and certainly engaging, if predictable at times.  Though sometimes the shadow/reality transitions can be tough to gague properly, the game doesn't punish you overmuch for it, which is a definite boon to those short of patience.","December 6, 2013","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With more work, this could have been a great game.\n\nContrast is a game with a novel mechanic: the player moves between a 3D normal world and a 2D "shadow world" to solve platform puzzles. It makes for some really challenging puzzles, but unfortunately, this system can be buggy and unwieldy at times, making some of the puzzles much more difficult than necessary.\n\nThe game took me three hours to finish. It's not a long game, and I feel that is its biggest weakness. It lacks the depth of a truly immersive story. At the end of the game, I was left wanting more. More backstory. More plot. More explanation. More puzzles to solve. I feel like so much more could have been done with this game to give the player a really good story.\n\nThe story is set in a beautifully-crafted, dark, intriguing noir-20's/30's world with heavy steampunk accents. The level modeling and art are excellent, but the character modeling and voice acting leaves something to be desired. The actors are rather unpassionate and unconvincing.\n\nContrast is a fun little game, and I definitely recommend it. However, I think it could have been so much more, and ultimately I was disappointed by its lack of depth.","March 5, 2015","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As soon as the first title screen comes up and you hear the stylings of 1920's blues, you know you're in for something different. Contrast takes place in an atmospheric France, 1923. You're a mute acrobat that can merge with shadows and you're followed by a little girl named Didi. Didi is the star of the game, her perfectly casted voice actor and her adorable lines will have you thinking "Who the hell is Ellie?". The noir aesthetic is reminiscent of Dishonored meets Bioshock meets Boardwalk Empire. The acting, story and scenery feel authentic to the era. The gameplay is perfectly simple, though the puzzle aren't much of a challenge. The past three years have been landmark years for the downloadble/indie game scene. The quality of absolutely great and relatively cheap titles rivals that of their AAA counterparts. Contrast is, without a doubt, a legend among it's peers; Bastion, Braid, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, Castle Crashers, Guacamelee, Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet, Journey, Magicka, Mega Man 9, rain, Shadow Complex, Skullgirls, Stacking, Super Meat Boy, Terraria, Torchlight II, Trine and more. In my opinion, the game tops most of those. There isn't much to say about the game's flaws. It's unfairly short; I collected every collectible, completed all of the achievements and still clocked in at 4 hours. A gem like this deserves to be a lengthened experience. Aside from the game's length, there is a clear lack of polish. Had Compulsion Games taking more time to test the game, we wouldn't have to be putting up with invisible walls or floors. While they weren't too frequent, they were uncomfortably noticable. At one point I left a building, turned around to go back into the open door and couldn't because of an invisible wall. I walked forward a bit and came back and was able to go back into the building. Though I am convinced these blemishes are related to an overbearing publisher wanting to rush their investment out,  small details like these and the game's length are the only thing that keep it from being a perfect game in my book. Anyone looking for a unique experience, pick Contrast up. It will definitely continue to go on sale, so do yourself a favor when you see it marked below it's normal price of $15.99. Games like this, from independent developers are on the rise, and as gamers it's up to us to support their new ideas in an effort to show the multi-million dollar publishers/developers that bigger isn't always better.

Unfortunately too short and expensive (when not on sale) considering the amount of content it offers.\n\nFull review:\nA short (REALLY short, finished it with 100% of the achievements in under 3 hours) platforming game which in a way reminds me of the Portal games since, as one of the game's achievements references to by name, rather than thinking with portals here you are "Thinking with Shadows". Can't reach your objective in the 3d perspective environment? time to start looking for a way to make the shadow of objects, buildings or "people" (even tho they are invisible to your eyes) help you, so that you can then shift into the walls and do 2d perspective platforming with the shadows. The fluidity in which you do this change between the 3d world and the 2d shadows is very smooth. Yes you will run into a few "buggy" spots but they are few and don't really break the gameplay.\n\nStory-wise, it is a charm. You could consider it 2 stories, one of the young girl Didi's desire to be with her parents and to make them be happy, which is the focus point for most of the game's lenght, and a more subtle one which springs up near the end related to Dawn, the character you control, about who exactly is she and why she has the powers she has. Mind you, its not the best story ever but it works well for the game and the way it is presented is pretty good.\n\nAgain, short game and expensive considering the amount of playtime it can offer (I'd recommend buying it when it is on sale with a 60-ish or more % discount) but what little you get is in my opinion quality content worth checking out. Hopefully we see a similar premise, or maybe even a proper game sequel, in the future from this developer.","June 17, 2015","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With more work, this could have been a great game.\n\nContrast is a game with a novel mechanic: the player moves between a 3D normal world and a 2D "shadow world" to solve platform puzzles. It makes for some really challenging puzzles, but unfortunately, this system can be buggy and unwieldy at times, making some of the puzzles much more difficult than necessary.\n\nThe game took me three hours to finish. It's not a long game, and I feel that is its biggest weakness. It lacks the depth of a truly immersive story. At the end of the game, I was left wanting more. More backstory. More plot. More explanation. More puzzles to solve. I feel like so much more could have been done with this game to give the player a really good story.\n\nThe story is set in a beautifully-crafted, dark, intriguing noir-20's/30's world with heavy steampunk accents. The level modeling and art are excellent, but the character modeling and voice acting leaves something to be desired. The actors are rather unpassionate and unconvincing.\n\nContrast is a fun little game, and I definitely recommend it.

It has a lot of unused potential.\n\nI liked the setting, art style, music, and most of all, the shadow-shifting mechanics. However, the entire thing feels like it needs a lot more polish to make it feel complete.\n\nThe story is kind of simplistic, character development is... weird (like that one scene where one character changes their mind by 180°)... You get hints of a back story in the form of collectibles, but they don't really reveal any coherent whole.\n\nThen there are luminaries, which are still a mystery to me – you have to use two or three of them in each act to activate some kind of switch or whatever, but you can find a lot more of them throughout the game (like three times the amount you actually need). It feels like they were supposed to be used for something else that then got cut out of the game or something. And I still have no idea what they are at all.\n\nThere are a bunch of references to parallel universes, both in the final cut-scenes, and in some collectibles, but they don't really converge on any conclusion. They feel more like a cheap excuse for the existence of the main game mechanic, just slapped on the game without trying very hard to give it actual meaning.\n\nSame with Dawn, the character you control – there are a couple of hints about her back story, with a “shocking” revelation at the end, but it fails miserably at making sense. Thinking about it, even her name is only mentioned a couple-three times throughout the entire game. That's about as much as you'll learn about her.\n\nAs for the actual gameplay, it wasn't terrible, but not breathtakingly good either. As I said earlier, shadow-shifting has a lot of potential for interesting and challenging puzzles, and there were a few of them too, but sometimes, you shift out of the shadow due to a glitch, or because the “dashing” ability is too random, forcing you to restart the same puzzle again and again.\n\nThe lighting, around which a major part of the game revolves, also seems to be made somewhat sloppily. It makes sense that detailed lighting and shading is disabled in areas far away from the playable character, but it gets reenabled too late – after you get into the area, suddenly, a light source appears just like that, with all the shadows. And the shadows themselves are quite glitchy as well – sometimes, your shadow on the floor doesn't match the wall at all, sometimes, your shadow gets stretched into the void... It's not that it doesn't work, but it only works well enough to make the game playable.\n\nOther half-baked gameplay elements include grabbing ledges, which only works on a select few of them (and has a weird animation where Dawn's hands are a few centimeters away from the surface she's hanging onto), using objects inside shadows (especially moving them by moving the light source), or using the same awkward “interact” animation everywhere.\n\nAll in all, the game feels like an exciting demo of a potentially wonderful game. I don't think it's worth its full price, but go get it when it's 75% off. If I were to put this into numbers, I'd say 6/10.","May 15, 2015","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is rather mature and deals with many adult situations from day to day life. Set in a noir mid 1900's city, the ambient is that of night clubs, bars and cabarets. Most of the story events are told through the silhouettes of the secondary characters sometimes having the player be prompted to intervene.\n\nAll gameplay revolves around Dawns abilities.

Unfortunately too short and expensive (when not on sale) considering the amount of content it offers.\n\nFull review:\nA short (REALLY short, finished it with 100% of the achievements in under 3 hours) platforming game which in a way reminds me of the Portal games since, as one of the game's achievements references to by name, rather than thinking with portals here you are "Thinking with Shadows". Can't reach your objective in the 3d perspective environment? time to start looking for a way to make the shadow of objects, buildings or "people" (even tho they are invisible to your eyes) help you, so that you can then shift into the walls and do 2d perspective platforming with the shadows. The fluidity in which you do this change between the 3d world and the 2d shadows is very smooth. Yes you will run into a few "buggy" spots but they are few and don't really break the gameplay.\n\nStory-wise, it is a charm. You could consider it 2 stories, one of the young girl Didi's desire to be with her parents and to make them be happy, which is the focus point for most of the game's lenght, and a more subtle one which springs up near the end related to Dawn, the character you control, about who exactly is she and why she has the powers she has. Mind you, its not the best story ever but it works well for the game and the way it is presented is pretty good.\n\nAgain, short game and expensive considering the amount of playtime it can offer (I'd recommend buying it when it is on sale with a 60-ish or more % discount) but what little you get is in my opinion quality content worth checking out.

The premise is simple enough, but the game, while being worth just 2-3 hours of platforming and puzzle solving, is able to offer you a decent but fair challenge, introducing new mechanics and gimmicks as the story progresses that manage to keep you on your toes. Furthermore, failing a jump or anything of the kind won't inconvenence you at all, given you have pretty much infinite lives/tries\nThe  strongest points of Contrast are a very charming art style, which heavily borrows from the 20s and jazz music, and an interesting story, which is able to engage the player even if not exactly long or overcomplex. As mentioned above, there are some collectables to be found, but hunting them doesn't extend the game's lenght substantially\nIt's also worth mentioning that Didi, the young protagonist, is one of the most berable, cute and useful child I've ever met in a videogame","January 1, 2014","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The premise is simple enough, but the game, while being worth just 2-3 hours of platforming and puzzle solving, is able to offer you a decent but fair challenge, introducing new mechanics and gimmicks as the story progresses that manage to keep you on your toes. Furthermore, failing a jump or anything of the kind won't inconvenence you at all, given you have pretty much infinite lives/tries\nThe  strongest points of Contrast are a very charming art style, which heavily borrows from the 20s and jazz music, and an interesting story, which is able to engage the player even if not exactly long or overcomplex. As mentioned above, there are some collectables to be found, but hunting them doesn't extend the game's lenght substantially\nIt's also worth mentioning that Didi, the young protagonist, is one of the most berable, cute and useful child I've ever met in a videogame","January 1, 2014","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Cute only because of the secondary main character and her naivity.\n\nAs a 3D platformer, it is very short, but boasts a wonderful art style that is also creepy in a Tim Burton kind of way.\n\nYou play as Dawn, an 'imaginary' friend to Didi, the daughter of Kat and Vincenzo. Didi's adoptive father is actually this guy named Johnny who's trying to make a name for himself. The overall story has overtones of mafia involvement, magic, illuisions, etc. It has a very early 1900's feel to it but the world is so surreal with the city that the game takes place being on floating islands. And the clockwork systems and other stuff.\n\nThe standout element is the ability to shift from the real world to the shadow world, similar to, I think it's Paper Mario where he can stick and travel on the walls. Or one of the Legend of Zelda's where Link actually does transform into a shadow of sorts. Well, it's like that. Dawn has that ability basically.\n\nI guess my only complaints would be the lack of ambient sounds and the length of the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/recommended/224460/","gdnighthawk","Nighthawk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/","206 products in account","Presentation\nContrast is one of those games that's unique and memorable at the same time, as it drags you into a shadow world in the 1920s Paris in the role of Dawn, young Didi's best friend who possesses the ability of shifting between the 3D material world and the 2D shadow world, making Contrast one of most ideas-filled titles of this year. Didi is also the only person who can see Dawn, but the actions you perform around the city will have an impact on the real world that is seen as shadows from Dawn's eyes as well. Even though Dawn is an interesting character on her own that you'd definitely become interested in as the game goes, this is the story of Didi's parents, who are constantly arguing after Didi's father left and her mother is too busy working at night, leaving her unattended - a perfect opportunity for her to sneak out and fix things around the city with Dawn's help. The bad thing about Contrast is that it will end too soon, rushing through the events of the story just to get to the ending, and even though following the plot is satisfying as it is, there are lots of moments that could've been detailed more, making the game longer and the lasting experience more satisfying in the end. Without doubt Contrast nails its presentation, having a simple menu that will almost instantly take you into the action, while still offering you plenty of options to manage things such as collectibles or taking a look over your stats. Starting with the purely astonishing art work and the detailed characters and moving on to the shadows that have an important role in the gameplay, but offer an incredible visual effect as well, the game is constantly reminding you how awesome its core idea truly is. The problem with that idea however is that it hasn't reached its full potential, as the moment when you get most comfortable with the control and the idea of the game is the same moment the game will reach its denouement. There are so many ideas that are simply rushed inside the game, such as walking up the shadows of Didi's parents in order to reach a location and listening to their speech while doing so; those are the kind of moments that make Contrast feel unique and make you desire more out of this game.\nRating: 9.5\n\nGameplay\nThe idea of shifting between the real 3D world and the world of shadows is without doubt one of the most unique and innovating ideas of this year and Contrast takes great advantage of this idea, creating some amazing puzzles that will leave you satisfied each time you complete one and move in to the next area, but the best thing about those puzzles is their deductibility, forcing you to analyse each one of them, but offering the solution if you stare at them long enough as it is sometimes more than obvious. Each new location you visit will introduce new puzzle concepts, some trickier than others, but same as the story those are rushed, never taking full advantage of their potential, as the game will quickly move from one concept to another, leaving abilities such as the shadow dash to be used only a few times in the entire game. There are the occasional glitches that will stop you from making a move in your first try, but there isn't any sort of time pressure on the gameplay so you have all the time in the world to find your way around a puzzle and reach your destination. The 3D world puzzles are enjoyable and the shadow puzzles even more, but the real magic begins when the game combines those elements to create some amazing areas that you will have to scout first, try different approaches and only then decide on a final solution that will take you to your destination, but all this time spent looking around an area is well spent as you will constantly be excited about where one thing should go or how the positioning of some objects will help you reach a higher point. Walking up the shadows of Didi's parents is an amazing concept as you get to listen to a part of the story while you're slowly making your way to a location that's related to that story, constantly keeping you on the edge about what's gonna happen next as you climb higher and higher and eventually reach a location that will unlock further mysteries. There is a lot of great stuff in here and because it is so great it leaves you with a thirst for more and unfortunately there isn't anything else.\nRating: 8.5\n\nGraphics\nContrast on the PlayStation 4 looks amazing, making the city of Paris come to life at night with the use of those same shadows that make the gameplay so enjoyable, as the little bit of light that is available in an area will reflect objects in the precise direction, something that affects the gameplay as well as the overall beauty of this title. Even if you only get to see Dawn and Didi as full characters, as the rest of the cast is seen as shadows, they are both incredibly detailed and fit into the world perfectly. The visual effects are okay, with a few things that could use some work, but what is really impressive is the reflection of certain things on the pavement of the street as it is wet and seeing that no matter where you go is impressive.\nRating: 9\n\nAudio\nThe voice acting is top notch, as the entire cast including Didi, her parents and Vincenzo take advantage of some amazing voice work that truly helps sell the story and the emotional road it takes once you get to know Didi better. The sound effects are just as good, making the world come to life and give Dawn's powers a great background; the best thing however, comes in the soundtrack, as from the start of the game you will be greeted with a noire classic, a perfect fit for the city of Paris in the early '20s, and the list goes on and on as you progress through the game.\nRating: 10\n\nExtras\nUnfortunately, the main campaign is the only thing that the game provides and that will be over in less than 6 hours, depending on how much time you take to solve each puzzle, and even though the game has collectibles you can find those easily in your first playthrough if you just look around, so unless you wanna replay the game a few weeks after just to relive the awesomeness, there isn't anything else to keep you around.\nRating: 4\n\nVerdict\nContrast is one of the best experiences you can have this year, not only because it is unique, but because it works wonders, providing some great puzzles, amazing exploration and a story worth hearing, unfortunately that will only last a few hours, so if you were looking for something to keep you around your PS4 a lot more, this will come as a disappointment, but either way Contrast is a game worth playing at some point, even if it isn't your priority for the new console.\nRating: 8.2\n\nCheck out the full review and a lot more about Contrast at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=38&t=330","April 10, 2015","true","3.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

When you see the trailers and read about it your in awe of an act where you can influence the stage. An act by the great Vincenzo, a casted illusion of a large scape platform game. The game is horridly too linear, pretty straight foward you just need like 4 lumis and the game progresses for a short time before suddenly coming to the ending. I was saddened as I was expecting more depth, more platforms and more plot. The game is visually appealing and did have an amazing idea,just failed to execute on it unfortunately. If your looking for a good long enjoyable game I would reconmend not buying, its not even worth its discounted price(and I bought the Collector Edition).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atruejedi/recommended/224460/","atruejedi","Jamison","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atruejedi/","364 products in account","Disclaimer: I have mostly good things to say about Contrast, but the lack of polish on this game makes it so I simply cannot recommend it, no matter how much I wish I could. A post-release patch could easily fix all the issues I describe below, but two years after release and these are still problems; hence, thumbs down, albeit reluctantly. I was tempted to grab this game when it was first released, but I'm glad I waited. I completed the game in about 3.5 hours, so do the math and figure out what amount of money you'd be willing to pay. I would instead recommend a game like Papo & Yo, which also centers around a child with family issues and is of similar length with equally unique but different qualities. So, without further ado:\n\nContrast is a platformer where you shift between the 3D "real world" and the 2D "shadow world" to solve puzzles. The controls are clunky/sloppy and you cannot remap your keys. This game was released in 2013 and the player can't remap keybinds? Hell, keybind remapping should be required; it's nearly an industry standard, and Contrast loses big points for lacking this "feature." This issue, combined with the dreadful controls, made it extremely frustrating at times. Near the end of the game, I died about a dozen consecutive times trying to jump a small gap. Was it my fault? I can't imagine so. I was very close to rage-quitting, but I knew I was in the home stretch. Fortunately, dying is pretty painless in Contrast, as you just respawn at some predetermined location in the game-world, and quickly at that... but even then, the developers barely put any thought into it. Sometimes to complete a puzzle it's easier to just jump into a pit than go back the way you came! I felt like I cheated during a few portions of the game, but considering how frustrated I was with the game by those points, I didn't mind. Ugh.\n\nBy Act III I just wanted to get it over with... but not because I didn't enjoy the characters, visuals, style, noire atmosphere, or music, all of which are excellent (especially the songs performed by Laura Ellis on vocals!). The story is good as well, but nothing to rave about. Gameplay just became a chore, partially because there's zero hand-holding in the game. Now, I'm not saying I needed hints to complete the puzzles; honestly, they're all pretty easy. But near the end of the game, I assumed the puzzle I was completing had to be much harder than it really was... so I spent about 15 minutes trying to move spotlights to solve this imagined quandry when all I actually had to do was jump up a ledge I didn't know I could jump up. Oh, and one time I screwed up a puzzle and had to restart from my last save... but since you can't save manually and the game doesn't tell you when it auto-saves, it made me replay a chunk of the game. Sigh. Come on.\n\nOne final nit-pick that really irks me: in Act II of III, there's a carosel puzzle, and once you complete it you can retrieve an item on top of the building... but if you don't grab the item when you're up there, you cannot go back and retrieve it, ever. I realize it's a small issue, but man... combining that with the lack of remapping and no real saving function and it's just too much. The developers could have created a wonderful experience for the player, but with the previous issues and the awful controls, Contrast is simply a shadow of what it could have been.\n\n...get it?","September 27, 2015","false","3.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Also, I'm in love with Dawn even thought not much is said about her.\nBUT (and here comes the ugly part) how could they develop her character when they couldn't even properly tell the whole game story? Let me be clear: the story has a beginning and an ending (which I adore because I hate when they leave you puzzled) but it's told in such a rush you won't really find yourself connected with anyone. This game is short (or better: it would be but as I'm gonna explain next, it will gain longevity thanks to all the times you're gonna uncontrollably fail).\nThere is something really wrong with the controls, I played with a controller and Dawn's movements were very uncomfortable. I tried using mouse and keyboard and it was kinda better but still, weird physics. It's not very reactive and considering you have to jump a lot and switch while rushing and jumping, that's a big no no for me.\nIt got on my nerves, I fell so many times and had to run back and forth so much that I almost threw away the controller.\nGotta be honest, I insulted Dawn so much that if she were real, she would have come find me and punch me.","March 10","false","15.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","2"

You would think that in a puzzle platformer the platforming would be really fleshed out and feel good, but in reality it's super clunky. Even the 2d bits once you enter the shadows feel bad and bugy. The dashing ability makes no sense. Why would the players character be able to do that. Maybe if it was just for platforming and mobility, but you are braking fences with that ability. It's just silly. Same goes for the players ability to carry big boxes like they are made of cardboard. As game mechanics they are fine, but they don't feel right in the games world.\nConsidering the length of the game I think it could have benefited form just flushing out the basic platforming and shadow stuff and leaving out all the other tiny mechanics. In my mind having a solid platformer with a shadow gimmick would be much better,  than a clunky platformer with a bunch of flimsy mechanics that are used only handful of moments in the game. Moving objects to manipulate shadows was very interesting, but again, it was used only two times in the game and wasn't all that sophisticated.

It bugs out constantly, leading to unfair deaths or do-overs. Some puzzles, like Vincenzo's workshop, are absolutely agonizing because of this.\n\nThe setting is nothing more than an idea: Cabaret. That's it. Nothing more.\n\nThe developers seemed to have desperately built everything in this game on those two ideas, turning them into nothing more than gimmicks. The story is nonsense--a mash-up of heart-felt cliches and sexist family drama the player will not care about, with random (--wrong--) references to Einstein and generic ideas of science floating in the background. I guess it's meant to add depth to the universe they're creating, but it doesn't help when a handful of the world-building collectables are called nothing more than "Science Drawing" and are literally just nonsense symbols and images.\n\nThe story also just gets in the way: I can't count the number of times I'd move a few feet and have control taken away from me, so the camera can do a stilted, early PS2-era swoop over the surroundings, complete with lots of janky start-stop moments. Speaking of, the controls--movement and camera--also feel like the platformers (e.g., MDK 2) of the early '00s.\n\nWhatever. Everything wrong with this game comes from its creation. It's clear the general ideas of the shadow mechanic and gimmicky cabaret setting were steps 1-10, and everything else was an afterthought.","September 5, 2015","false","2.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Unfortunately, the type of Contrast presented here appears to have rewritten the definition to fit its drab and dreary canvas. As if someone took the worst parts of the Psychonauts and completely desaturated the visuals, turning bleak a very uniquely bright and eclectic art style.\n\nContrast is filled with wasted potential and, from the get go, riddled with visual and mechanical glitches. The shadow mechanics are often inconsistent and ham-fisted, causing many a sigh of frustration. If I fail to react accordingly I will often be forced to sit through the same piece of dialogue, waiting for that small window of opportunity to open, only to be forced out of the shadows because I gently touched the wrong thing at the wrong time. I feel my character is too large and agile for such a small set piece, it becomes quite claustrophobic at times.\n\nMy main issue isn't the poorly implemented mechanics, but the lack of care I have for the characters within the story and the absence of any exposition that isn't told through the numerous collectibles found in the game. Thankfully Contrast is a very short game as it starts to overstay its welcome by the middle of the second chapter. How many puzzles must be solved by standing on the head of a person's shadow?

There is something else going on in the world than just convienent lighting, as other humans are invisible except for their shadows, only Dororthy can recognize the acrobat and their are strange anomalies in the world, such as a giant chasm of space seperating a road to a town cinema. Unfortunately, I didn't get far enough to see the end as I grew fustrated with the gameplay - so I will probably watch a playthrough. Thankfully, this game is nowhere near as pretentious as Papo y Yo.\n\nFrustrations\nThis is a floaty platformer, much like Trine or Limbo, though there were many times I either missed jumps or fell during platforming because the "Rush" move didn't work or over shot my jump. The game gives an impression of a simple indie platformer, and for the most part it is, but there were so many instant-death moments in the game that wore thin after the 20th time. I got to a point where I had to save "Fred the Knight" in a "shadow story telling" sequence and the game straight up crashed when the dragon's fire hit Fred. I'm not sure if it was supposed to Kill Fred or activate some sequence or cutscene, but the game immediately locked up my PC for a solid 15 seconds (I was sure to need a Hard reboot soon), then Windows came back up and shown that I was disconnected from Steam. Again, I don't know if that disconnect triggered some sort of glitch (maybe it was about to register an achievement, but I was offline and the game crashed),  but thanks to the irritating checkpoint system, the game took me back to the start of the level, requiring me to walk all the way back to the area and replay the entire sequence again. Mind you, there were two other story telling sequences I had to complete before then. Plus, earlier in the game, I got stuck in level geometry and had to restart from my last save. To my surprise, it damn near restarted the whole level and lost all my progress in the part of the circus that I was trying to repair. The death at the dragon was the final straw for me and I lost all interest in playing this.\n\nConclusionI'm sure other, less demanding gamers can get enjoyment out of this, and honestly, I want to see more of the story, so I will watch the remainder on Youtube. Unless you absolutely adore what is going on here, I suggest you do the same. Value your time and money. I bought this on a deep discount for $3.74, but I could have done without doing so.","November 4, 2014","false","1.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The voice acting is full of emotions in both the English and French translations of the game. The voice acting is well recorded and well cut. 5/5\n\nThe visuals in Contrast are some of the best to come out of Greenlight. This near unique art style really gives the game some flavor. Contrast has top quality visuals both in it's 3D, and 2D worlds. I have yet to encounter fuzzy or broken models/textures. 5/5\n\nThe story is brilliant and the execution is just as wonderful. Though many complain that the story is "too short" we need to remember that length does not dictate the quality of the story. Contrast's story is about bringing a broken family back together. The story has all elements of a story, a great intro, tense climax, and an interesting conclusion. Watching the world change as the story progresses is simply fantastic. 4.5/5\n\nMechanically, Contrast has a few issues- though the game does contain a brilliant feature where the character has to work through both 2D and 3D worlds, this proves to cause some of the major problems in the game. In the shadow(2D) world, the gameplay is relatively choppy- whether the character will execute commands correctly in this state is hit or miss. We can regularly see the character pop out of the shadow world for no apparent reason what so ever. This is not game breaking, but does cause some frustration when attempting more complex or multi-step puzzles. 3.5/5\n\nI believe that this game could also use some optimization with the keyboard/mouse. For me, it was a little tasking making the settings work with my hardware. This has no impact on the final rating.\n\nFinal rating – 18/20 or 90%   - I would suggest getting this game.","January 16, 2014","true","5.0"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","2"

The story follows a young girl named Didi, and so do we. We step into the shoes of a mysterious young woman called Dawn, who assists Didi on her quest to mend her broken home. The story is generally well executed and the art style and music help sell it beautifully. Steeped in early 20th century vaudeville aesthetics, the game's mood is warm and magical, but the over-the-top theatricality often seeps into the dialogue, at times causing it to come of as trite rather than impactful.\n\nThe main conceit of the game is that Dawn exists in a sort of parallel world, and her only connection to the real world are Didi, who seems to exists in both worlds, and the shadows. Dawn has the ability to literally become a shadow on the wall, and most of the gameplay revolves around using this mechanic to solve puzzles and execute jumping challenges. Shadows are also the only way in which Dawn can see people besides Didi, and the game's most inspired moments combine moments of shadow-puppet storytelling with actual gameplay. Unfortunately, these moments are far and few between, and most of the challenges are fairly mediocre, with the shadow-shift mechanic adding little but a bit of flavor. My biggest disappointment is how often the game interrupts the flow of gameplay with little cutscenes, sometimes wresting away control of your character simply to execute a camera pan and deliver a line from Didi.\n\nThe game shows great potential, but falls short in execution. Aside from the issues already discussed, there are the occasional technical issues, such as graphical glitches, erratic collision detection and at times wonky controls.

Throughout the game, you must help Didi help her father put on a good show.\n\nYou morph in and out of the 3D world and 2D world of shadows, helping Didi by solving various puzzles. The gameplay was okay, there is a little bit of weirdness with the camera, but it wasn't too bad. It's a lot of parkour but the puzzles were pretty simple. The majority of what makes this game so good are the music, art and it's story. If anything, it's what makes the game worthwhile.

Shadows can sometimes be manipulated by moving light sources.  It's neat!\n• Story:  The story isn't masterfully told, but it is an interesting one, and I'm glad I stuck around to see it through to the end.\n• Art:  Contrast is beautiful to admire and its music is always a pleasant companion.\n• It's Indie!:  Support your local indie game developer!  Especially when they're doing awesome work like this!\n\nTHE BAD:\n• Game Feel:  As cool as traversing the shadows as a platformer is, Contrast has a tendency to be real finicky.  On some puzzles, I would get so frustrated falling out of the shadows, I would question if I was performing the task correctly; in every case, I was.  It becomes easy to slip out from the 2D world and fall to your death, and not even be sure why it happened.  I managed to finish every puzzle, but I would have had a lot more fun if the mechanics had been fine-tuned a bit more.\n• Acting:  The voice acting could've been a little more convincing, but--  Ehh!

If you run into something, or if you're crushed by something, you'll shift out of the walls and you'll have to try again or you just might die altogether. Not only that, but it's very easy to miss jumps when you're trying to jump over certain gaps (most are easy to scale, but there are a few that are just mind boggling). And there are also some puzzles in which you have to reach a platform in a small amount of time - and those kinds of challenges in games are always maddening.\n\nI'll play and I'll be mesmerized by the details and I'll want to find out what happens next in the story but then I reach a roadblock of a challenge and - after being pushed out of the walls, failing to jump over gaps and dying repeatedly - I get increasingly frustrated and then it's not about the story or the gameplay anymore, all the focus has shifted to that one piece that just doesn't seem to give if you don't get it just right. And after all is said and done and I can move on, I just can't relax and enjoy the game anymore and have to shut it off. A game is something that you should be able to enjoy and crave, but if it's frustrating - there's no point in trying; and that's a real shame.\n\nIt's a good game if you're a big fan of challenging puzzles; but if you're looking for a fun game with a sense of ease and flow, you might want to find something else to try.","July 10, 2014","false","5.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Instead, it tries to keep you in 3D (without the shadow puppet stuff) most of the time.\n\nThe intriguing part of the game, using the shadows to move around, seemed like a lot of fun. Unfortunately, the main part of the gameplay seems to consist of moving lights or boxes to create those shadows where you want (without much in the way of real solving). The actual platforming across them, is only difficult by it being nearly broken. A lot of the time, I wasn't sure if I had glitched my way through, or solved the "puzzle". Really, the only puzzle is that you have to place the box so that it's shadow forms a super easy platform jump. This is made harder because the "targetting" system makes it hard to actual lock onto the object you want to carry. When there is any actual puzzle that isn't an immediate solve, it's only really difficult because of the trial and error of moving the light as well as shadow generators. But there isn't really any lateral thinking about it, just move a few things around.\n\nThe platforming, as a I mentioned is nearly trivial, made difficult only by the 3D controls being near broken, and the 2D having awkward physics (made worse by the fact that modern analog controls don't adapt well to it).\n\nWhen not in the shadows (which is most of the game) it is all the broken camera and awkward controls (made worse when the camera suddenly changes the perspective forcing a control direction correction) of poor late 90's platformers. You are always wasting time either because the controls messed you up and you need to recover, or because you need to keep running back to the objects to manipulate into position yet again.\n\nIt is a shame, because the moments when you are using shadows made by things other than your own dragging boxes around (such as a sequence early on where characters are having an animated conversation, movbing their limbs all over the place), it is a hell of a lot of fun. If the game had been entirely this, moving from shadow to shadow as the scene plays out around you, I would have really enjoyed it.","March 27, 2014","false","1.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You start off as an unnamed woman walking around in a little girl's bedroom, and it is quickly conveyed that all living creatures (with the exception of one special little girl) appear only as shadows and you are invisible to one-another.\n\nUnfortunately, after establishing that you are this little girl's friend (by way of picking up a drawing she made with you in it), that's all the reason you are given to follow her off on a boring adventure of interacting with objects, collecting objects, and being pestered to do things and go places in order to watch cutscenes. It really feels like it's being forced upon me when I don't even want to follow this little stranger and watch her parents fight; I want to explore the world and be given my own reason for doing things instead - not because a child tells me to.\nSo that was storytelling ruined within the first 5 minutes.\n\nThen there was the shadow mechanic - it seems cool in theory, but you end up using it to do very rudimentary platforming straight off the bat. Exciting stuff. Maybe throwing a few shadow balls would be nice, or knocking over a bottle, or knocking over a bottle's shadow using a ball's shadow! The first few minutes are where you really have to give OOMPH to this new mechanic, and sadly it's used only to run up shadow ramps (some of which are inaccessible until you have tagged along with your new friend so she can push a simple object for you and progress the story). Again - I'm feeling like this is off to a bad start. I hear the game eventually progresses to pushing boxes around, but manipulating an object to reach a high place is hardly an innovative improvement.\n\nAnd finally there's my last gripe - atmosphere. At one point within the first 5 minutes you also walk into a cabaret restaurant which is completely devoid of people and life. "BUT WAIT," you say, "people are invisible and appear as shadows!" Well yes, this is true, but there is nothing to make this restaurant feel LIVELY. There are glasses of alcohol on tables and cigars smouldering away in ashtrays, and there is ambient audience music playing, but there is nothing to make it feel ALIVE. No swaying and sliding of chairs, no sloshing of alcohol, no strange poltergeist-esque atmosphere replete with drinks trays floating around the room; bartenders shaking tumblers and pouring them out, no cats in alleyways knocking over trashcans and yowling, certain conversations that dim and fall as you wander the room - there is nothing - and that is where this game really falls flat on its face. You walk into a dead room and your only objective is to interact with the flashing objects scattered around the room so you can progress the plot because an invisible woman keeps nagging you to turn on the lights.\n\nI'm sorry, I wanted to like this game, but it took 5 minutes to convince me that I hated it - all because there was nothing to try and persuade me into staying a while, looking around and really enjoying myself.\n\nMaybe somebody somewhere else will do it better one day - because this game isn't there by a long shot.","January 17, 2014","false","0.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emuholic/recommended/224460/","emuholic","emuholic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emuholic/","1742 products in account","Contrast is a puzzle platformer in a 1920’s themed setting, featuring a young girl named Didi and her friend Dawn.The game starts with Didi sneaking out of bed and into a nightclub where she finds that her family life is not quite as perfect as she hoped. You play as Didi’s mysterious friend Dawn, and must help with her journey to repair her broken family and get her parents back together.\n\nFrom the title screen, the scene is set wonderfully with a jazz soundtrack and noir design looks great. I have always loved the style in games such as Bioshock and the individual locations ooze of it, from jazz clubs, to cinemas and hotels, they all look the part.\n\nYour character, Dawn, can move between three-dimensional reality and into the shadows where the game becomes almost like a 2D platform game as she is limited by the shadows on the walls. Light sources create shadows and can found placed in areas to reach a platform that is too high to reach. So for example, if Dawn needed to get to an outside balcony in reality, she could enter the shadows, and now reach it by traversing shadows of a nearby café tables and chairs. that are on the wall.\n\nIt is a clever idea and on the whole it does work very well but I found that despite learning new abilities along the way such as being able to dash through shadows, the gameplay mechanics start to feel samey and predictable. It usually involves reaching an area which is inaccessible in reality, reach it in the shadows, and then activating a switch or cutscene to progress. One puzzle which stood out was the final level which involved some great use of lighting and platform/puzzle elements that offered a bit of thought. There were one or two occasions where I was not even sure I completed the puzzles as the developers intended, as it felt to me like I had taken a shortcut to completing what I imagined a more difficult puzzle.\n\nThe story is told well and without spoiling it, the game follows Didi’s mother and her troubles with her husband. The husband gets himself mixed up with the mob, and while his intentions are good, things do not go well for him and he lands himself in to more trouble the harder he tries to fix things. If you explore the world a little, you can find snippets of story which act as mini-puzzles while you listen and in ways interact with as you jump over the shadows of the characters or events.\n\nThe gameplay can be a little clunky at times. I was reviewing the PC version and played the game with both keyboard and controller. The controller felt very sensitive to small amounts of input and it occasionally made me fall off platforms or do something I did not want to do. The camera can occasionally give you trouble but it is free-aiming and can be fixed. The most annoying aspect is that I managed to get stuck in walls and scenery on a few occasions, with no option other than to restart from the last save position.\n\nThe length of the game should also be put into question. It took me just over three hours to complete the game which I found was very short. There are collectible items to find over the course of the game but you will find many of them on your first playthrough. There is little to keep you coming back after completing the game. I would have liked some more puzzles or side quests to add some lifespan and replayability.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I enjoyed the game a lot. The characters are likeable, especially Didi who reminds me of Clementine from The Walking Dead game. The story is interesting to watch unfold and interact with. But there was simply not enough puzzle content to get really stuck in to. It is worth pointing out that Contrast is free on PlayStation+ and in this case it is a must play. If you are a fan of the era or platform/puzzle games then you will enjoy the game, I would wait for a sale otherwise as it is a little too pricey.\n\nGameplay - 7/10\nClever use of reality 3D and shadowy 2D platform elements, but is let down by occasional clunky controls and finding yourself stuck in walls.\nGraphics - 8/10\nLovely 1920's noir style locations and design set the scene perfectly.\nSound - 8/10\nThe main theme tune is perfect for the game but there is not much else to listen to that is memorable. Character dialogue is done well.\nFinal Score - 7/10","November 27, 2013","true","4.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The graphics and sound are excellent and the story is interesting, but the challenges are not over the top. I play games other than platform/puzzles, like RPGs, survival, action, shooters, etc, but the look and story of Contrast intrigued me so I got it and finished it (only took 3.5 hours) and it was a great experience.

I normally detest games with 'collectibles' and will usually ignore such in games, but in Contrast the collectibles were easy to come across and, towards the end, they really open the story and shed some light (pun!) on the background of the character you are playing, Dawn.\n\n\nOverall I would rate this game pretty high, say 8 out of 10.

The art style, the concept, the characters, the storyline, the soundtrack; everything is phenomenal. I was drawn in instantly. Unfortunately, I found it a bit difficult to stay immersed at times. The gameplay is quite buggy. I'll admit, it has gotten better than it was the month after release, but I still feel like it could be better. Interacting with items is difficult to initiate and rather imprecise once you do, making some puzzles a bit more difficult, not to mention frustrating, than they otherwise would be. Another minorly infuriating aspect was the save system. You cannot manually save. The game saves automatically after solving certain puzzles or reaching a crucial plot point. The problem is, you never know which puzzles it saves after unless you're paying close attention to the corner of your screen. I was so fed up with having to do certain parts over that I abandoned the game for weeks at a time several times. All of that being said, I still truly enjoyed the game. The positives definitely outweigh the minor glitches and I am recommending this game to everyone. And who knows, they may fix the save system and wonky item interaction at a later point.","June 5, 2014","true","15.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Instead, it tries to keep you in 3D (without the shadow puppet stuff) most of the time.\n\nThe intriguing part of the game, using the shadows to move around, seemed like a lot of fun. Unfortunately, the main part of the gameplay seems to consist of moving lights or boxes to create those shadows where you want (without much in the way of real solving). The actual platforming across them, is only difficult by it being nearly broken. A lot of the time, I wasn't sure if I had glitched my way through, or solved the "puzzle". Really, the only puzzle is that you have to place the box so that it's shadow forms a super easy platform jump. This is made harder because the "targetting" system makes it hard to actual lock onto the object you want to carry. When there is any actual puzzle that isn't an immediate solve, it's only really difficult because of the trial and error of moving the light as well as shadow generators. But there isn't really any lateral thinking about it, just move a few things around.\n\nThe platforming, as a I mentioned is nearly trivial, made difficult only by the 3D controls being near broken, and the 2D having awkward physics (made worse by the fact that modern analog controls don't adapt well to it).\n\nWhen not in the shadows (which is most of the game) it is all the broken camera and awkward controls (made worse when the camera suddenly changes the perspective forcing a control direction correction) of poor late 90's platformers. You are always wasting time either because the controls messed you up and you need to recover, or because you need to keep running back to the objects to manipulate into position yet again.\n\nIt is a shame, because the moments when you are using shadows made by things other than your own dragging boxes around (such as a sequence early on where characters are having an animated conversation, movbing their limbs all over the place), it is a hell of a lot of fun. If the game had been entirely this, moving from shadow to shadow as the scene plays out around you, I would have really enjoyed it.","March 27, 2014","false","1.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You start off as an unnamed woman walking around in a little girl's bedroom, and it is quickly conveyed that all living creatures (with the exception of one special little girl) appear only as shadows and you are invisible to one-another.\n\nUnfortunately, after establishing that you are this little girl's friend (by way of picking up a drawing she made with you in it), that's all the reason you are given to follow her off on a boring adventure of interacting with objects, collecting objects, and being pestered to do things and go places in order to watch cutscenes. It really feels like it's being forced upon me when I don't even want to follow this little stranger and watch her parents fight; I want to explore the world and be given my own reason for doing things instead - not because a child tells me to.\nSo that was storytelling ruined within the first 5 minutes.\n\nThen there was the shadow mechanic - it seems cool in theory, but you end up using it to do very rudimentary platforming straight off the bat. Exciting stuff. Maybe throwing a few shadow balls would be nice, or knocking over a bottle, or knocking over a bottle's shadow using a ball's shadow! The first few minutes are where you really have to give OOMPH to this new mechanic, and sadly it's used only to run up shadow ramps (some of which are inaccessible until you have tagged along with your new friend so she can push a simple object for you and progress the story). Again - I'm feeling like this is off to a bad start. I hear the game eventually progresses to pushing boxes around, but manipulating an object to reach a high place is hardly an innovative improvement.\n\nAnd finally there's my last gripe - atmosphere. At one point within the first 5 minutes you also walk into a cabaret restaurant which is completely devoid of people and life. "BUT WAIT," you say, "people are invisible and appear as shadows!" Well yes, this is true, but there is nothing to make this restaurant feel LIVELY. There are glasses of alcohol on tables and cigars smouldering away in ashtrays, and there is ambient audience music playing, but there is nothing to make it feel ALIVE. No swaying and sliding of chairs, no sloshing of alcohol, no strange poltergeist-esque atmosphere replete with drinks trays floating around the room; bartenders shaking tumblers and pouring them out, no cats in alleyways knocking over trashcans and yowling, certain conversations that dim and fall as you wander the room - there is nothing - and that is where this game really falls flat on its face. You walk into a dead room and your only objective is to interact with the flashing objects scattered around the room so you can progress the plot because an invisible woman keeps nagging you to turn on the lights.\n\nI'm sorry, I wanted to like this game, but it took 5 minutes to convince me that I hated it - all because there was nothing to try and persuade me into staying a while, looking around and really enjoying myself.\n\nMaybe somebody somewhere else will do it better one day - because this game isn't there by a long shot.","January 17, 2014","false","0.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

What looked like a fascinating premise in a fantasical world intermixed with an amazing sound selection turned out to be only one of those things. Being a shadow becomes very boring very quickly, as the puzzles all end up revolving around a convulted system of controls that will leave you very very frustrasted. You will be afraid to enter walls. You will be afraid of messing up a button press. And you will be very afraid when you realize this puzzle will just continue to drag on with more complicated situations that faulty controls will only make worst. The only puzzle game I can think of right now that followed the same tune as Contrast is Braid, and by Jove does Braid make this game look like a joke. In Braid you can rely on your platforming abilities to carry you through a series of increasing difficult puzzles, which will truly reward the player for their abilities to think intuitively as well as perform proper platforming practices. In Contrast, you will struggle about a world with frustrating controls, little variation in puzzles, and little reward from solving the them. Little reward as in you will not care at all about the story because your willful suspension of disbelief will begin right at the start. The game takes place in France, and it makes a point to say so. What it doesn't explain, unless I understood world history entirely incorrectly, is that the world is floating in a vacuum of space. No explanation ever. No explanation as to why Didi, the girl you are escorting most of the game, sees the pit once but never comments on it again, as well as no one else commenting on it. Hell, in my opinion, the characters stopping to talk about the fact they live in a void would be more interesting than any plot point presented in this game. The story is weak, from the first moment of blackmail to the ending scene. The ending won't make you feel anything. You will be annoyed by Didi. You will hate every character that pops their ugly mug in this game. So what do you have so far? A messy universe with messy controls, a cast of completely unlikable characters, a character that is a young annoying child most of the game (Trust me, Didi is no Clementine, and you will go back to hating video game children after playing this,) in a story that is riddled in plot holes and does nothing to keep you interested in it. Oh, but the music is pretty at parts. I think I heard some of it over my continued groans over having to do another jump dash puzzle that would randomly throw me out of the wall to my death.

The biggest challenges lie in the 2D platformers, whilst the 3D part feels underexploited (and the keyboard controls clunky - this was clearly designed for a controller). The 3D world just serves as an aid to model the 2D world, or as a link to reach the next 2D surface. At some moments, you feel like it's almost there and regret what the game could have become if the 2D and 3D had been made to blend in a bit more crazily.\n\nSome of the puzzles are brilliant, some of them just about mediocre, but it all ends too soon. The game is extremely short (only 3 levels, count about an hour each). WIth no extra difficulty or challenge, with all collectible lying out in plain sight of the linear path, the replay value relies on just one thing: the really compelling atmosphere, characters, and the excellent voice acting.","May 5, 2014","true","5.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

(The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","Contrast is the differences seen when two sources of light come together. Similarly, Contrast (the game) blends its ligher and darker tones into a short, immersive experience with differences of quality that feel worthy of the price of admission, yet lacking in other ways.\n\nIf anything is holding Contrast back from feeling complete, it's not just the gameplay itself but also the technical issues and the final act.\n\nThis game will ultimately feel like it was two-thirds of the way done but never half-baked.\n\nDancing in the Dark\nContrast is by no means a difficult game. Your average playthrough, depending on how many collectibles you go for, will take you somewhere from two to four hours.\n\n(I would strongly recommend going for the luminaries as they use the shadow-swapping mechanic a lot, which is the main attraction for this game.)\n\nGames like these with a narrative focus are fine. Sometimes games with little to no challenge other than my wits are relaxing, which this game never struck me as being overly complicated.\n\nHowever, the inclusion of replay value would have been appreciated as well besides tying up the loose ends of the plot.\n\nIn Contrast, you play as an imaginary friend of the main character of the story, Didi. As you are a make-believe creation of hers, you are a surreal character to the mature events unfolding around you.\n\nThis also means you are given supernatural abilities: The ability to swap in and out of shadows and the real world, the acrobatic fitness to traverse the environments, and a few other abilities (a dash mechanic and  the ability to use light orbs). The main focus is always put on the shadow-swap mechanic, which I think is its best quality.\n\nYou aren't simply finding the well-lit areas to enter and leave new entrances. You are moving light-sources to shape the shadows on the environment, enlargening them and scaling them down, and you sometimes have to use the shadows' terrain to move real objects.\n\nSometimes the technical limitations rear themselves into this mechanic, such as when you are going around corners and you might teleport out of the wall because of not rotating the camera. Or when you enter a wall with the camera on the other side of the wall. For the most part, this mechanic is well-thoughout and only at some parts of the game feels buggy.\n\nUnfortunately, the other gameplay aspects either feeled tacked on simply because other platformers have them or they are there because of the game's light/dark theme.\n\nThe acrobatics shown on the first trailer on Steam are nowhere to be found in this game. (I watched it after I finished the game, and I felt that was worth mentioning because of how misleading they were.) I think the game could have benefited from more twitchy swapping sections lacking in the final game without making the game have a sudden difficulty spike. It would've also made the open-areas more expansive and well-worth finding the collectibles.\n\nThe luminaries only feel necessary when the plot demands it, and there are more than enough within the area you are locked in to never worry about finding any more. In the end, I felt these were pointless other than for achievement purposes.\n\nThe Shadows on the Walls Tell All\nThe one thing Contrast nails almost flawlessly is its narrative format told through gameplay. Although the game deviated from what my inital expectations were--of a subconscious friend being there to aid the protagonist--I still appreciate the manner of the story told that is not too dark for kids and not too forced for adults.\n\nDo not write this game off as another tale of the loss of innocence. That's not what the game is about; it's about seeing the adult world through a child's eyes with an imaginary friend.\n\nThe adult themes of vice, regrets, misfortunes and personal mistakes make the world intimidating while hiding away the faces and other details that would make things more clear.\n\nCharacters other than Didi and Dawn are represented by silohouettes with distinctive voices and models. The side-cast are executed well, and the implementation of their cutscenes as platforming "puzzles" is an interesting way to keep the pace of a game going. This is a case where a limitation on the budget ultimately proved to be a great outlet for storytelling purposes, and it doesn't stand out with the rest of the game.\n\nSadly, the one character you will be hearing a lot of is not the best actor, Didi. Dawn never speaks, and Didi will give you instructions on what to do and where to go at every point in the game.\n\nDidi is not the only obstruction from the otherwise fun, creative gameplay. Forced cutscenes showing key-parts of the room are triggered way too much to let the player figure out the puzzle, and the constant text-prompts for objectives are not necessary either.\n\nBoth of these take the player out of the experience and they are not necessary. You won't get lost as the game is very linear and the areas are never that big.\n\nThe story is split between three acts. Act 1 and 2 go hand-in-hand in terms of the game's simple, yet clever difficulty as well as the narrative tying in together. Act 3, however, intrudes upon an otherwise surreal story with realistic explainations and a twist ending that ends abruptly for no good reason other than to end the story there.\n\nThe twist and darker elements within Act 3 are not a problem because they don't make sense. In fact, like with The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, they might make too much sense for my liking.\n\nMy problem is how they feel ultimately rushed into the game to give it a deeper meaning, and once I reached that point of the game I knew my early expectations were wrong. (It's a shame because I think having the PLAYER be an imaginary friend is the perfect explanation for a video-game.)\n\nThe devs stated they wanted to keep the ending short and brief to leave the game open-ended. While I am fine with games that have ambigious endings on purpose, like LISA, I don't think Contrast left an ending satisfying enough for the player to be left thinking about.\n\nExcept for what might have been in the story instead.\n\nA Flawed, But Ultimately Charming Game\nI wouldn't recommend Contrast for full-asking price as there is not enough content to warrant it (nor replay value). Nor is the game as finely polished to be liked by everyone. But Contrast is still a good game, which sees through with its ideas giving all its got while being in the spotlight.\n\nIt's a game that won't make you cry in the end because of the emotional attachment you experience; it's a game that will make you cry because you don't want the curtain-call to be over so soon.","November 1, 2015","true","3.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The art style, music and time setting are right up my street and the whole game takes place in a slightly surreal 'Alice In Wonderland' style. I'll explain. The world seems to be made of of floating islands floating in a night sky, it looks lovely but detracts the game from normality, that being said playing as an imaginary friend who can jump in and out of shadows ins't exactly normal so this floating island surreal-ness actually adds to the game, pushing it away from normal and closer to dream-like.\n\nAs I have said the music is also fantastic if you enjoy cabaret style music. There are also some lovely other tracks later in the game, one of my favorite plays during the carousel puzzle.\n\nThe whole jumping between shadows and normal world is an awesome mechanic. Not exactly new but it is still nicely done and it creates some interesting and genuinely challenging puzzles that stumped me for an embarissingly long time. One thing I will say is that it can be a bit trickey at times. The switching between the shadow and real worlds is tricky especially when jumping. If you don't time it right when jumping you will land half above, half in the shadow which gives you another 50/50 chance of clipping onto the shadow or being forced back into the real world which will probably spawn you into a death pit. After 6 or more times this gets annoying. The run animation is also odd too and the main character moves like she has a rocket attached to her back and strides like the Striders from Half Life 2.\n\nAside from those 2 tiny nit picks the story is good, visuals great and soundtrack fantastic. Pick it up, play it and you'll be glad you did.\n\nCheck out my youtbe channel for lets plays and commentary every Monday and Friday\nhttp://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2l1zwMcpJm_hJq4owO3nHg","December 4, 2014","true","6.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You play Dawn a woman with the power   to shift from the 3D world into the 2D shadow world. Also Dawn can only be seen by her young friend Didi who also happens to be the only person Dawn can see as everyone else can only be seen as a shadow.\n\nThe game is a pretty decent puzzle platformer, with a mix of 3D platforming and 2D when you shift into the shadows. This mechanic makes for some good puzzle sections as you need to shift in and out of the shadows to complete them. The visual style of the game is great as well with a sort of 30's noir vibe to the world Dawn and Didi inhabit, as well as a decent soundtrack to match.\n\nThe biggest problem with this game is it's criminally short. I was left wanting more at the end and it really lets the game down.\n\nThe Good:\n- intersting mechanic of shifting from 3d to 2d to complete puzzles\n- this game looks pretty good with a 30's Paris look to it\n-a good jazzy soundtrack that really adds to the feel of the game.\n\nThe Bad:\n- Very short and i was left wanting more\n-Little replay value\n\nOverall this is a pretty good game which i enjoyed but it really is too short to justify paying full price. If it's reduced on offer and you like puzzle platformer pick it up. 6.5/10","September 13, 2014","true","3.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It has some strong points, as well as some lesser ones. I'll see if I can post it without one to get around that pickle.\n\nThe strong points sort of sells itself on the store: the visuals and the ideas. Oh, and the voice-acting and the audio.\n\nTheme-wise, this is a wonderful film noir kind of feel with the old stylish drama and some genuinely fitting soundtracks that perfectly fit the gameplay mechanics. Climbing the shadow of the musicians or the voice actors while they are acting their part is original to say the least. As well as having the far majority of the cast consist merely of shadows (which gives the game a strange atmosphere).\n\nUnfortunately, while the gameplay is certainly fitting with the theme, the switching between 3rd person adventuring and 2d 'shadow' platforming doesn't quite mix that well. Despite the contrast in lighting, you sometimes have to guess where you can fade in the shadows, and sometimes you almost randomly drop out again. And rearranging lights in a 3D plane is a lot harder to properly 'aim' than in a 2D one (for those who are familiar with A shadow's tale: control was much tighter there).\n\nI'm not so sure what to think of the plot. While the atmosphere, voices and visuals are all in place, I wasn't drawn into the game much. I partly blame the clunky controls and some glaring bugs (I encountered numerous invisible walls and pass-through walls), and partly because the far majority of the game you're just a nanny for Didi ("let's fix this! let's fix that!"), while your own role isn't explained until nearly the end (which is a shame. How am I supposed to care for the characters if I don't know what my own role in the play is to begin with?).\n\nWhile contrast also has some platforming and puzzle segments, the only real meat is the storyline. It has those things, and they sort of work, but you'll push on through to get the next cutscene. And with that in mind, it should at the very least be labeled at "not bad at all". Awesome would be giving it too much credit, but it's certainly decent.\nI just wish more was put into it. Bug testing. The conversations. Perhaps some extra thought for lip syncing (there is only one character who has all the monologues, but her lips seem to say something competely different).\n\nBut all in all, I'd say this is the sort of game I would give a 6.5 - 7. It's a good game. Not a great one. All in my opinion, of course. :-)","October 16, 2014","true","3.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While it's mainly linear, some areas allow you to create your own path of shadows to walk on. Storytelling is cute and enjoyable, and on top of that, it's often a direct part of the game because - once again - of the shadows.\n\nI liked it despite the port being quite poor - almost no proper options in the menu. It's an Unreal Engine game, so the standard ContrastEngine.ini tweaks and some driver-forced AA will fix most of the bad looks and make it the superior version of the game. Of course, it would be nice to have these in the menu, as the game clearly supports them, but it's an indie developer and the game is enjoyable enough that I am willing to forgive them.\n\nAll in all, well worth 5€.","October 10, 2014","true","4.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It could be because I played them first, or because I found the 3D to 2D in Contrast imprecise at times, which made some of the jumps pretty frustrating. It was also sometimes unclear how to set up the environment to successfully get yourself where you need to go, but I actually enjoyed how freeform these parts were and would have liked to see more of them, with a bit more polish.\n\nI really did like the atmosphere and setting, though I don't think the whole shadow idea meshed well with the rest of the game, and the locations felt more like they were pieced together based on how interesting they would be to play through instead of being used to create a cohesive narrative. Despite this, it was a very charming game with some interesting puzzles, and is worth picking up on sale to satisfy your curiosity.","October 30, 2014","true","4.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I love all of the character designs and the game itself is fun to play. The female character is such a delight to play. I really enjoy the concept of this game and I would suggest it if you're looking for something unique.\n\nSome down sides about the game is that it's not quite as polished as I would have thought it to be as far as game play and the "solidity" of the enviornment goes. A few times I would end up getting caught between a wall and whatever object was there. It was frustrating at some parts just trying to solve a puzzle or move through the levels. It's also quite a short game. You could finish it in one sitting if you wanted to. There isn't a lot of character interation except only between you and Didi. I wish there were more characters wondering around as well. I think this game has so much potential and a lot to offer. I really hope that the developers will update the game with better control and articulate movement and interaction.\n\nThis game however reminds me of something Double Fine would make ala Psychonauts. The environments and the silouhettes of the characters along with the geometrical shapes. Still, I recommend this game if you want something new to look at, at least. It's just a shame that it was a bit rushed but not so bad it's not worth looking into. But if you can tolerate it, I say give it a go. Maybe you can find the beauty in this game under all its flaws.\n\nPros:\n-Unique concept\n-Great protaginist\n-Wonderful visuals\n-Shadow moving is cleverly worked in with the storyline\n-Storyline is pretty well written and I do love how it weaves together\n\nCons:\n-Too short\n-Not very polished\n-Not a very open world compared to the scenery\n-Lack of music and sound in general\n-Heavy clipping issues\n-Bad articulation","November 28, 2013","true","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game play is unique with you playing a character that moves in and out of shadows and helps a little girl find her way in the world.

I am sick to death of fighting games, so a game with no fighting at all that was still fun, interesting, and different was a very pleasant change of pace.

There are equasions which Mathematicians and Physicists say put a smile of delight on their faces and which they describe as beautiful. That may seem odd, but they understand the complexities of these acadamic arts and therefore percieve how hard it is to produce something simple yet powerful. For anyone who has an interest in game design - you will have the same reaction to Contrast.\n\nThe game is elegant in design, form and presentation. Simple in concept yet profound in its scope and it is a genuine shame that the idea of moving into a world of shadows and back out again hasn't really been explored much in any form of media; be it literiture, movie or gaming. If there was ever a game that deserved a sequel it would be this one. We're talking about the kind of simplicity and genius as when someone said; Lets make a game about wormholes and using them to solve puzzles. Contrast is as unique and creative as Portal without any shadow of a doubt, if you'll excuse the pun.\n\nAt it's core it's about puzzle solving, but there is a bit of a storyline in there as well. Although it isn't fleshed out much. The setting itself is the very distinctive Paris of the 1920's but with a weird blend of 20's America as well. I won't ruin the surprize but you'll start to understand that something isn't quite right with the world when you start wandering around the streets. As for the level of difficulty, it isn't too taxing. But the variety of gameplay and novel use of moving into shadows is constantly compelling. This is a short, but perfectly polished gem of a game which is well worth a look.\n\nAs an aside, the game can be played with either a pad or the keyboard and mouse. I would suggest using a pad because when using the keyboard there is a weird 'floaty' feel about movement which feels wrong. This may in fact cause frustration, as a number of more tricky platforming sections of the game would be made unpleasently awkward if you use the keyboard and mouse. Once you use a pad however, the controls are rock solid and precise.","September 5, 2015","true","4.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As the story develops your emotions run with it a bit, and it makes it that much more fun and interesting.\n\nThe collectibles bring extra elements to the story you wouldn't have known otherwise, so even if there wasn't achievements for finding them, they tie into this story extremely well and answer questions you wouldn't have even thought to ask. In fact, in Act III my mind was basically blown because the ending wouldn't have made any sense if I hadn't found every collectible, and after the first collectible, I wanted to know more so I made sure I grabbed every single one before the end of the last Act.\n\nThe ending makes you want more! I won't tell you any of it, but I personally was blown away and left awaiting a sequel.\n\nBut for those who worry about how the game handles, Its controller compatible and easy to pick up, and for those dedicated to the key board and mouse it can't be very hard to manage. It ran smooth and I didn't have to change any settings for it to work and faster. I was very satisfied in that regard\n\nThis group does an amazing job, I not lay in wait for a sequel, but for their other projects as well.

The gameplay is unique and interesting given that the game allows you traverse between the real realm and the shadow realm which greatly changes how the player would interact within the world compared to a game which is just in the third dimension or just in the second dimension. While the puzzles are integrated nicely within the world you are placed in, the game is rather short taking me just under four hours to complete the entire game.\n\nThe aesthetics and charm of this game brings back the feeling of a platformer back from the Playstation One era, however the game often has issues explaining the story and world to the player which is mainly due to the game being so short. However if the player is keen on collectable hunting, collecting as many as possible can give some very interesting and subtle insight onto details the story does not wish to make obvious.\n\nThe voice acting feels stiff sometimes and often repeats itself, more often than not having the child explain to you where to go despite you already knowing where you have to go. However the voice actors in themselves are believable and well done, each reflecting the character nicely.\n\nDespite being a short game, 15USD is not a steep asking price for what this game offers if you are looking into a unique platformer. That being said, I would recommend waiting until a sale since 15USD can buy games with a lot more gameplay.","November 25, 2013","true","3.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/janosrock/recommended/224460/","janosrock","Janos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/janosrock/","81 products in account","Long story short: This game is awesome. I, as a player, had a great time playing it. i enjoyed it, and don't regret for a single moment to have bought it. However for the purpouse of enlighting prospective buyers i will list the pros and cons:\n\nPROS:\n\n- AWESOME VISUALS i can't understate this enough. The kind of visuals that Tim Burton pioneered before he became a parody of himself. The music is the best the period has to offer. The world is abstract and yet historically accurate. The game portrays the feeling of the 20's like i've never seen before in fiction but also strangely a familiar, timeless story, perfectly relatable to the average player.\n-The story is extremely engaging, interesting and believable despite the fantastic aspects of the game. You will love the characters, you will care and worry about them if they fall, and will feel a legitimately warm, fuzzy feeling if they succeed. The voice acting is also great, for all the characters wich are written in a way that, again, will make you remember them for a long time. Of special note is Didi: avoiding spoilers i can say that while children are hard to portray in fiction, both in building character and acting, they tend to be hit or miss (think Anakin Skywalker), she is not only very well acted but also very well written, being believable, helpful, and never annoying.\n- The gameplay is great fun, engaging, the game mechanics are well developed, explained and exploited, making it fun and original, ESPECIALLY if you're a fan of old school plataformers.\n\nCONS:\n\n-THE GAME IS SHORT. Is that simple. The collectables, tell a great story and are really cool, but they are easy to find in a single playthrough. The world is beautiful and intriguing but the game has a short lifespan, with no replay value whatsoever.\n-On the gameplay point of view, the save system is kinda arbitrary. There are checkpoints wich work also as autosaves but there's no way of manually save the game, so it can be annoying if you wanna leave inmediatly and you're in the middle of a puzzle, but it is barely noticeable.\n\nVeredict:\n\nTOTALLY WORTH PLAYING, that being said, if you're strict on your wallet, and wanna make every single cent in it count, it would be wiser to wait until its lower than full price (a 25% discount would be spot on). But considering that is an indie game, made by a developer that is obviously on a budget i think the game deserves the price tag.\n\nI hope this review has been useful :D","October 16, 2014","true","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Soundtrack is amazing and voice acting is great.\n\nHowever, the gameplay itself was lacking. Puzzles are extremely simple and it is only the execution which is difficult, which can be quite the challenge in itself given poor movement and controls. An extremely short game, with my run-through clocking in at only 4.1 hours. Not that there was much point to finishing, the story was predictable and dull.\n\nI played through to the end because of the beautiful graphics and the hope of some more wonderful music.

Consistantly testing your perspective of lighting and which dimension you should be within. The game adds an interesting 3D world aswell as a constant 2D platformer which you have to vary between in order to complete puzzles. Having the power to slip between the open 3D world to hopping from shadow to shadow in 2D at your own will opens up some very clever puzzling possibilities.\n\nThroughout the game there's a gripping emotional story line in which follows the main little girl, Didi. As she is always trying to help out her close-to-useless father, having to deal with various mobsters, aswell as an illusionist puzzle master. As Didi’s imaginary friend, you can only see the shadows and hear the voices of the real people within the 3D world, in which Didi interacts with. But again within the 2D world there is great interaction of the real people's shadows and a fulfilling sense of achievment once you complete a puzzle.\n\nAs with all medium to low budget puzzle games there are a few bugs/glitches but nothing you can't turn your head at. Some of the puzzels can be very cliche: move a box over a button = door opens. But there was a few interesting ones you'll have to think twice about.\n\nOverall gameplay was enjoyable and certainly made you want to finish the game, yet only being 3-5 hours long depending on collectables and the narrations. It’s hard to say whether Contrast looks better while playing as one of the minimalist silhouettes or running around in full 3D. The graphics are a key aspect of the game, being set in such a hearty destination the overly cartoon design looks great and is consistant throughout.\n\n8/10\n\n","September 18, 2015","true","18.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","0","3","2","0"

I played it some time back so I cannot write out an exhaustive review, but suffice to say the setting, story, soundtrack and voice-acting were all decent here. The artstyle especially was unique though. The game mechanics are interesting, but they were never fully fleshed out. The puzzles are mostly of moderate difficulty, but one or two of the later ones might frustrate you for a while.\n\nThe game is a bit rough around the edges with texture pop-ins, some wonky animations and some other minor control bugs. The ending felt a bit rushed for the story. Length wise, it is pretty short at 3 hours or so, and you should be able to 100% the game in around 4 hours.\n\nIf you go in with your expectations in check and manage to get this game on a discount, I'd be pretty certain you'll come away liking it.

I found the environment, story and gameplay very intriguing from the get-go. As the game progresses the puzzles get more difficult and challenging, in mind as well as execution, just the way I like it. One could argue it was borderline too short, but fit me and my current schedule well enough. As for something negative I believe they could have elaborated the ending. If finding the all collectables, finds throughout the game giving hints and details to the story, you are able to realise the big mystery and thus get the ending. But I feel like the developers relied to heavily on finding the collectables being the "big giveaway" and surprise factor that the ending just felt a bit anticlimactic. It was a shame as the game had been bold and exciting up until that point. Either way it's a game I truly recommend. If you have a thing for puzzles, are fascinated by the 20's and/or like good soundtracks I believe you should give it a go.","January 4, 2015","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The genre is very intrguing and does very well for being a game where the player does not commit violence. The shadowplay is incredible, the voice acting great, and overall, this game deserves more than 5 our of 10 if it weren't for...\n\nThe controls and movement. Buggy at best, infuriating at its worst. The player character lurches when changing directions which sends you sailing into the abyss more often than not. Switching from a 3D control style to a 2D control style lends a natural use of the W key for jump but this is not the default mapping.\n\nIt is a complete world unto itself but does not lend itself to immersion. It is clear that Didi ("diddy", if you prefer, since she's always looking for her real "diddy) is going through her memories either with the help of a friend, an imaginary friend, or as an adult hoping to fix her issues and this surreal landscape lends itself well to that. However, beyond that it is clear that it is a "bubble" world that doesn't really hold you. There's enough missing from the environment and gameplay and world that you constantly realize that this is a game with a story of a dysfunctional set of actors.\n\nThe puzzles start off very easy and tend to stay that way until the end of the game when an entirely new mechanic with jumps and shadow-merges at a difficulty level previously unencountered is introduced. When going into the lighthouse, you are expected to understand this mechanic and how to use it with no instruction or hints. For a hardcore gamer, this will likely be fine but the gameplay lends itself more to a casual style so this sudden leap in difficulty is jarring and frustrating in and of itself. Once you figure out the difficulty of the new mechanics, however, it becomes little easier to understand. It is not reasonable to use hints that previously indicated an object to interact with as hints for some other part of the mechanic of the puzzle. Changing the rules like that makes the hint system unaffective and almost useless.\n\nThat said, the storytelling is indeed superb.\n\nAnd finally, this game is far too short and the idea of shadowplay is not explored as well as it should have been. If you want a casual game that requires no real commitment and one or maybe two days play, this game is for you. As a matter of comparison, I played casually and only logged 4 hours on it. I think, however, that gamers of today will be disappointed with the lack of content and linear gameplay. This game feels more like a proof of concept than a finished idea however polished the end product is. This game is worth purchasing but if you pay full price, you're paying too much unless you just want a short distraction and aren't paying attention to cost.","January 28, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is well done, the character design is well done, and the setting and graphics are gorgeous. Adding a bit of surrealism with the edges of some of the levels was a cool touch as well. I do have a few problems, though, and they all boil down to: the game didn't quite feel finished. Whether it was wonky controls, weird collision detection, or arbitrary invisible walls, there were a lot of things that seemed rushed. It would have been a much better game if it had a bit more polish on it, and if some of the invisiblle walls were a bit less obvious (one springs to mind where I ran into an invisible wall about 2 feet away from an actual wall). Still, if you can pick this game up on sale, I would recommend it. I got the version with the soundtrack, which was an extra bonus.\n\nUpdate: Not much replay value, either.

This at first seems like simply an odd quirk, until the ending draws attention to it and refuses to actually offer explanation.\n\nThe controls are good, if a little more responsive on the camera than I expected. The shadow-merging mechanic could use a little more polish - I often found myself popping out of the wall without being able to figure out why, and occasionally ended up across the room from where I had been a moment prior.\n\nThe story is simple, which simply leaves more room to showcase the central mechanic and the world. Most characters (seen via projected shadows) talk with their hands a lot, presumably so you can tell who's talking as lips' shadows are very small.","December 30, 2014","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You could do alot with the game but it didn't really last long enough to really amaze me with a whole lot.  Phasing into the shadows is fun but its annoying getting kicked out of the shadows when it seems like you should be fine.  At one point during the Merry-go-round, there was clearly open space that kept kicking me out of the shadows for no reason, and after going around and taking another route, it stopped doing it.  There's far more that could be done than simply putting boxes into the shadows, then moving the spotlight around.  Outside of getting kicked out of the shadows at random sometimes, the puzzles aren't overall too difficult to figure out once you pick out every option at your disposal.  The last stage introduces the idea to focus the spotlight but you cant keep it focused and is only used to raise a box higher and its only used once.  Its fairly useless to introduce something out of nowhere just to solve one puzzle, especially since you need to tell the player the controls so you're basically telling them what to do\n\nOn top of getting forced out of the shadows at odd times, the models for the shadows are clearly screwed up.  Johnny's hat is often floating half off of his head, the character's limbs seem to disconnect, and you can see glitches like this even with Dawn in the shadows.  It was most noticable when you had to float down on an umbrella and it disappeared whenever I faced a specific direction.\n\nThe game overall seemed a bit like Vincenzo's act in the end.  His act seemed cool but I could only see the shadows of it, and it was also over very quickly.  In fact, he seems to hint that there may be monsters in the Shadows that could prove to be an obstacle for Dawn but its never followed up on cause all thats left to do in the game is follow Didi then its over.  The game was very interesting, especially for the concept, but again, it only took 2 hours to complete.  Judging from the other reviews, it seems I may have gotten it down quickly, but in order to get 10 hours of gameplay, you would have to be looking for every luminary and every collectable, or have played through the game multiple times.  The game does have some good music and a good story, but its far too short and gameplay wise, not interesting enough to be worth the $17 (canadian) it costs normally.  I got it during a sale but even then, there's other games you could spend your money on instead","December 30, 2014","false","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But it does have issues, sort of like you would expect an infinite possibility sandbox environment to have issues.  It uses the dynamic shadows cast by the graphics engine as part of the gameplay, and sometimes that isn't going to work out right as there's just too many possible shadows that can be created.  I imagine it's damn near impossible to test properly as shadows can be different in a thousand ways.\n\nThe shadow play can be a bit annoying as you fall out of the shadows and back into the 3D world a little too easily.  And once (spoiler!) I shifted an item with me into the shadows and managed to lose it completely somewhere.. take care of your precious metal balls! :)\n\nBut anyway, the game is short and sweet, play it if you like unusual games.\n","December 31, 2014","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a beautiful game, with great writing, solid ideal mechanics and a fun asthetic. But the coding is so bad. This game is not a puzzle game, often times you will figure out the puzzle then retry it 10-30 times because it's actually a near pixle perfect platformer, has completely unreliable physics which is what makes it maddening. I want to get involved with this story I dont want to try a jump 20 times in a row where it takes 10 times to figure out exactly when I have to jump to not drop out of shadow then another 10 to figure out what rotating object I have to get on that will get to the top.

A beutifully designed game, with an engaging and sad little story about a young girl. Filled with economical issues, romantic affairs, mafia-involvement and drama.  With heavy elements of film noir, and with a graphic style that in many ways resembles a german expressionist silent film, with a touch of Tim Burton-esque quirkiness as the beutiful cherry on top. The humoristic elements such as hidden mature jokes really made me happy and sometimes I even laughed out loud. The puzzles are interesting, all though not that hard if you're used to puzzle-solving in games. But I still feel this game brought something new to the puzzle-genre. The gameplay mechanics are very well scripted and you quickly forget what buttons you have to click and just do it on impulse, immersed in the quirky little world that the game takes place in.

It's a game that I'm dying to love, and while I completed it and did enjoy parts of it... it's hard to say I loved it. But it might be worth your time and money. Read on...\n\nOn its surface, the game has a lot going for it: the art style is superb, the "phase shift" gimmick is really neat, and the storyline is decently interesting. The game, for a short experience, builds a nice little world and it does a solid job of make you invested in the characters. Also, the music is fantastic.\n\nHowever, a couple minor issues and one major issue gum up the experience. First, the game took me just over three hours (which included a few chunks of paused game) to complete, in its entirety. That means every achievement. I think I spend more time hunting down Easter eggs in Gone Home, frankly.\n\nSecondly, while the story segments are good, there's seemingly as much or more of them than gameplay. Especially early on, when the story is trying to establish itself, you walk ten feet and cutscene. Walk ten more, cutscene. Walk outside, another cutscene. I wanna play!\n\nAlso, and this may just be me, but the "phase shift" gimmick was never used to its full potential. There are a few moments where you do something really cool, and everything falls in place, and it feels great. But those moments are more rare than they ought to be. Most of the puzzles or silly in their simplicity, which some of the tougher ones being more about fighting the way shadows work rather than being brain benders.\n\nAnd lastly, this is the big one. The controls... aren't great. If you're in shadow and run out of a space, you pop out. But it doesn't always work consistently. And collision detection is off at times. Also, I died a number of times when I didn't phase in like it was supposed to.\n\nAt a couple of the later puzzles (the rotating wall in particular), I felt like I spent more time fighting the controls and shadow detection, as opposed to the puzzles. And felt myself pulled out of the story due to frustration.\n\nNow I know, that's a laundry list of problems. But most of them are because the premise and setting were so good... I wanted more. I wanted more puzzles, more areas to explore and more stuff to do. I got it on sale for just a couple bucks, and frankly am glad I'd waited. For a few bucks, it was a nice diversion over the weekend that left me ultimately satisfied.\n\nBut for full price, for those easily frustrated or for those expecting a long, polished experience. Maybe watch a Let's Play and pass. So as stated above, I give this one a very cautious thumbs up, with a big ol' asterisk next to it.","October 11, 2014","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Many times while moving in the shadows I was pushed out with no reason, like when passing over a semi-column in the lab; in many sections you can catch Didi in a T-pose, and even Dawn's position when using the umbrella is clearly a T-pose with an umbrella, and that really ruined the atmosphere.\nBut the game itself, especially for being a small production, is really good and enjoyable. The story is fascinating and, even if not the most suspence-filled noir plot, keeps you playing even just to know what's gonna happen. Deep characters and very nice voice-acting, the light-shadow system has it's flaws but its overall is quite good and fun. I bought the collector edition and I'm happy I did so, because the OST is very very nice. Finally, the way the game slowly shifts in a surrealist note is, at least for me, simply beautyful.\nMaybe €15 are too many, but I recommend this game.

For me a game can get away with average gameplay and a great story, but this game does well in both aspects, great story and great gameplay. Add to that the great artwork, a noir atmosphere, some sad jazz tunes, and you have a game worth keeping.\nI'm still about halfway through (I suppose). But I've been hooked onto this game. You get to play a silent protagonist who can shift from the real world and into shadows. Shifting into a shadow makes you able to use shadows as a 2D platforms to traverse otherwise impossible to cross areas. You can use shadows as bridges or a sort of transportation device. In the real world (or should I say 3D), you get around just like any 3D platforming game. While in 3D mode you can move objects or light sources to arrange shadows in a way that could help you through some obstacles. The combination of 3D and 2D platforming make for interesting puzzles and a unique gameplay.\nDefinitely, a game worth buying, sale or no sale.\n","October 13, 2014","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Brilliant concept backed up by some really nice graphics. The storyline is so engaging that I found it hard to put down. The puzzles were often a touch of genius.

Jumping could be frustrating at times because it's a little to sensitive to collisions and it would have been nice to be able to customize the key mapping but that's about it.\nIt's a short game but one I will remember for a long time.

Holy Crap i love this game. The story is pretty straight forward, you are helping a little girl fix her fathers problems. In an attempt to get your family back together. There are some wholes in the story  that never get answered, but i don't think that this detracts from the game, unless you are purely here for the story and not the ability to jump in and out of shadows. Yes there is a lot left to be wanted on the story side, expecially in the ending, I was actually angry with how they cut it off. The game is still a great story.\n\nOnto my favorite part of this game, its biggest attraction, shadow jumping (not what the game calls it). This is so much fun and its also just fun jumping in and out of shadows, using shadows as ramps. It is sad that the only real puzzles come up with focus mainly on the shadow world, yes you will have to manipulate things in the 3d world but everything boils down to how to move the shadows into the right place. I would have  liked it if there had been more need for puzzle solving in just the 2d world of the shadows and the 3d world, along with the ones that rely on both world. I feel that would have given me a more intimate experience with the world that the devs created.\n\nI recommend this game, its short and sweet and has left me wanting more from this little universe that has so much personality in it.

Contrast has a patchwerk story, which is incredibly unfortunate given the potential of the lore (it's visibly rushed despite a very interesting world).

Contrast cleverly utilises intricate 3D world objects to affect the 2D world (to use a basic example that doesn't spoil the puzzles, dragging an item closer to the light to make the shadow on the wall bigger).  It has a 'cute' companion character and touches on some of the deeper issues surrounding families, but it only lasts about 2-3 hours on a slow playthrough.

If you're used to this kind of game it might take even less, so maybe some people will probably think the game is too short.  Except for collectibles and achievements you probably won't play it more than once... However I see it as reading a short novel in a very interactive way. So if I'd pay for a book that would maybe take me 8 or 9 hours to read (and that I wouldn't read again too soon), why not pay for a game as fun as this one? I loved the story and how it unfolded.\nThe puzzles in the beginning are very easy, but later start getting harder. Since it's a short game I definitely don't recommend reading/watching walkthroughs. The feeling of accomplishment in a game like this one is important and puzzles ARE reasonable.\nThe only time I watched a walkthrough was in a part when I was sure there had to be a way to move a light beam and that that would help me find the solution, but I wasn't able to move it. I confirmed that that was the case and figured out by myself that I had to use the mouse (as when moving the camera) because of some probable incompatibility with the controller.\nSo, two hints (no spoilers) you might need that for me were not that obvious and got me stuck for a long while:\n- Sometimes you have to get very near something to interact with it.\n- If you use a controller, you might still need to use the mouse every now and then to move the camera and light beams.\nOther than that, I got no issues with the game.

Might be worth waiting for the next Steam Sale. Nevertheless, Contrast is what I call "art". The game is sparkling with creativity. The initial idea of switching from 3D "surreal reality" to 2D where you become a shadow and walk on shadows is clever and fun. This is what the game is mostly about: solving riddles and tasks by making use of light and shadow, mixed with a lovely story. The world of Contrast is beautiful and very atmospheric and a bit bizarre at the same time. It's pretty much like a dream. The art design, both graphics and sound, is just wonderful, and I very much enjoyed my trip through this game. A short adventure, but clearly one to remember.","August 10, 2014","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Worth supporting the developers even if just on sale)\n\nI'll be honest - I went in prepared to love the sshit out of this game. The artwork was sublime, the music was orjazzmic and the concept was brilliant. Venturebeat had me at "It's as if Limbo and Bioshock Infinite had a baby while watching Pan's Labyrinth" - given that I'd just finished Limbo, and, well, I'm sure my avatar tells you all you need to know about Infinite.\n\nUnfortunately, however, Contrast is not without its flaws, like the characters the game adeptly depicts. The story was well paced and engaging and there were some genuinely clever puzzles in the piece, but an overuse of cut-scenes and needlessly fiddly gameplay detracted from the overall satisfactory experience.\n\nYou play as Dawn, nine-year-old Didi's imaginary friend. Dawn helps Didi solve puzzles and navigate a troubled maze of family relationships by manipulating light and shadow in a sometimes third-person 3D puzzly, sometimes 2D-ish platformy, surreal depiction of the interwar era. The game marries the music of the Jazz Age with high-contrast film noir aesthetics and archetypes, and largely makes this work. It just looks and sounds beautiful, and the voice acting is realistic and moving, especially Didi.\n\nThere were lots of things the designers managed to get right - little things I really appreciated, like colour-coding the on-screen button prompts (Call me crap, but I'm still SO confused with the XBox buttons because they're the wrong way around from Super Nintendo!) or making it optional to collect everything, but easy to go back; this goes for Luminaries and collectibles. The final puzzles were immensely satisfying; I successfully put to use everything the game had taught me, which meant the learning curve was well thought out. Another thing was the inclusion of the soundtrack and a PDF of the collector's booklet.\n\nAnd now for the whinge. The plot was engrossing, but I got sick to death of being interrupted by cut-scenes every few nanoseconds. The developers, again, got things right by making these skippable, but I felt I couldn't skip them anyway because I didn't want to miss the story. This and the way the camera kept getting yanked out of my control while trying to solve puzzles were some of the irritating aspects of the game: these interruptions kept breaking the flow so that things never really settled into a decent rhythm.\n\nThe consequence was that, when it came time to jump around, some of the puzzle-solving was quite hard to execute. I opted for a controller over keyboard and mouse, but wasn't entirely satisfied with either option. Shadow-world play is really fiddly; the camera doesn't neatly snap to a 2D view for this mode and I was forever accidentally leaping off into space and having to try again because of this. A lack of micro-save exacerbated the problem.\n\nWhen not in shadow mode, the camera was at times so far up Dawn's bum it was nigh-on impossible to have a good look round for problem-solving, and at other times I'd solved the puzzle mentally but found the solution needlessly difficult to perform... Why have little bumps on the wall just to break you out of shadow mode and make it more difficult? For other puzzles, there was no intermediate feedback to show when the player was on the right track; the light had to be in exactly the right spot or things didn't work, and I had no idea whether I was right in theory or just all wrong. The game's physics also seemed inconsistent; there were loads of times when it looked like Dawn could easily make a certain jump, but wouldn't. I found all this incredibly frustrating to the point of controller-biting and rage-quitting, actually...\n\nBut Contrast wasn't all bad. As infuriating as the negatives were, the narrative was sustaining with its emphasis on family and dysfunctional relationships. I enjoyed the fact that the characters, though archetypal, were flawed individuals making the best of their respective situations -  a contemporary theme that will resonate with any mature, thinking player.\n\nAdd it to your wishlist and grab it next time it pops up on sale; you'll enjoy the cheap quickie.","August 10, 2014","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a game that I'm dying to love, and while I completed it and did enjoy parts of it... it's hard to say I loved it. But it might be worth your time and money. Read on...\n\nOn its surface, the game has a lot going for it: the art style is superb, the "phase shift" gimmick is really neat, and the storyline is decently interesting. The game, for a short experience, builds a nice little world and it does a solid job of make you invested in the characters. Also, the music is fantastic.\n\nHowever, a couple minor issues and one major issue gum up the experience. First, the game took me just over three hours (which included a few chunks of paused game) to complete, in its entirety. That means every achievement. I think I spend more time hunting down Easter eggs in Gone Home, frankly.\n\nSecondly, while the story segments are good, there's seemingly as much or more of them than gameplay. Especially early on, when the story is trying to establish itself, you walk ten feet and cutscene. Walk ten more, cutscene. Walk outside, another cutscene. I wanna play!\n\nAlso, and this may just be me, but the "phase shift" gimmick was never used to its full potential. There are a few moments where you do something really cool, and everything falls in place, and it feels great. But those moments are more rare than they ought to be. Most of the puzzles or silly in their simplicity, which some of the tougher ones being more about fighting the way shadows work rather than being brain benders.\n\nAnd lastly, this is the big one. The controls... aren't great. If you're in shadow and run out of a space, you pop out. But it doesn't always work consistently. And collision detection is off at times. Also, I died a number of times when I didn't phase in like it was supposed to.\n\nAt a couple of the later puzzles (the rotating wall in particular), I felt like I spent more time fighting the controls and shadow detection, as opposed to the puzzles. And felt myself pulled out of the story due to frustration.\n\nNow I know, that's a laundry list of problems. But most of them are because the premise and setting were so good... I wanted more. I wanted more puzzles, more areas to explore and more stuff to do. I got it on sale for just a couple bucks, and frankly am glad I'd waited. For a few bucks, it was a nice diversion over the weekend that left me ultimately satisfied.\n\nBut for full price, for those easily frustrated or for those expecting a long, polished experience. Maybe watch a Let's Play and pass. So as stated above, I give this one a very cautious thumbs up, with a big ol' asterisk next to it.","October 11, 2014","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Contrast.\n\nThe short version is this: great soundtrack, decent game, decent story, way too short and the ending is a bit rushed and predictable.\n\nThe longer version is this: I personally really enjoyed the game.  The style of the game was really well done.  Some of the mechanics were interesting, such as using the shadows of people in conversation to reach a new location.  That said, the ending really did feel a bit rushed, and, assuming you find a few of the (extremely easy to find) collectibles, extremely easy to predict.  Would I recommend it?  For $15, definitely; I think I paid $20 for the pre-order + soundtrack, which I'm still okay with, considering I'm a sucker for this style of music and atmosphere.\n\nAnyway, if you've got $15 to spare, support some indie devs and give it a shot.","November 25, 2013","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd always ask 'why everyone are shadows? why the city is like that?' and getting to the end all these answers start to show up and there comes the plot twist, what made Contrast one of my favorite games. I'm really impressed with the story. The gameplay is okay, jumping around and solving puzzles has its fun and boring parts but still enjoyable. However, the game looks a bit unfinished.

It falls into the puzzle genre, but utilizes first-person character control and does require a bit of speed.\n\nLike all games, Contrast has its merits and pitfalls. Some things I really liked about the game are:\n- A very well-thought-out and touching story\n- Beautiful soundtrack (especially "Kat's Song". Youtube it!)\n- A unique gameplay mechanic\n- Some decently challenging puzzles\n- Beautifully done art. Many noir games and movies nowadays are just creepy and Sin City-like. This is a much more refreshing take on the noir theme.\n\nAnd some things that weren't so great:\n- I don't know anyone who has clocked more than 10 hours to beat this\n- Some minor bugs\n- a reference to Albert Einstein in an earlier time period (learn your history, people!)\n\nSimply put, Contrast is very well-done and a must-buy for any Indie fan. People who liked story-intensive games such as Bastion will definitely enjoy Contrast more than most. Of course $15 for a game this short may pinch wallets, so do wait for a sale.

Although the approach is different and the gameplay is not perfect the effect and emotions portrayed by the character and the abstract realism make this game shine. The voice actors did a remarkable job with the script they were given as well. While the creators could have shown the world from our view, using dawns perspective allowed for them to cut the out all of the extras that would have dragged the game down such as rendering multiple characters and dressing them differently. The artistic use of a disintegrating world aspect allowed for the playable area to be clearly marked while still aesthetically pleasing. The only downfall that is apparent is the length of the game.

The story of the game largely revolves around a broken family trying to piece itself together and is at its best when it focuses on their trials and tribulations. (It takes a weird turn near the end trying to answer questions I never asked about the broken shadow dimension that protagonist Dawn inhabits that just end up raising even more questions, but that treads into spoiler territory.) Manipulating shadows so that Dawn can become a shadow and platform across them proved to be an interesting challenge that had me scratching my head more than a few times, and they were never afraid of introducing new elements (even if some of those elements involved box-switch puzzles seen in many games before). The game is definitely a bit on the short side, however, and the only thing that kept me from clearing it 100% on my first run was a few collectibles and one item that was only available for a short time frame and ended up being lost forever. It's also very story-focused, and relies heavily on cutscenes to tell its tale. Overall, it's definitely flawed (probably rushed a bit to be a PS4 launch title), but it's an enjoyable game that should be tried.","December 22, 2013","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I stuck with the game for its amazing setting, lovely soundtrack and to see the end of the story, rather than staying for its 3D-to-2D shifting gameplay. The shortness of the game means that the puzzle mechanics are never given the time to fully grow. Mix this up with some questionable glitches and you’re left with a game that isn’t as well constructed as one would like.\n\nContrast is a curious, fair attempt at a puzzle platformer with some neat ideas that make it somewhat enjoyable, but is a slightly frustrating experience that in the end won’t be remembered for its gameplay, but more for its world, visuals and sound.","December 26, 2013","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Contrast has a patchwerk story, which is incredibly unfortunate given the potential of the lore (it's visibly rushed despite a very interesting world).  I love the art style, and particularly love the 2D/3D platforming crossovers.  Contrast cleverly utilises intricate 3D world objects to affect the 2D world (to use a basic example that doesn't spoil the puzzles, dragging an item closer to the light to make the shadow on the wall bigger).  It has a 'cute' companion character and touches on some of the deeper issues surrounding families, but it only lasts about 2-3 hours on a slow playthrough.  I would say about 20-30 minutes of that focuses on the story, and the majority is spent trying to figure out the tricks for the puzzles.  Once you work them out, you could probably play from start to finish in less than an hour, without skipping.\n\nThere are two types of collectibles.  One type of collectible comes from exploring and overcoming optional puzzles, and is essentially useless outside of the few occasions you need them to progress (When you need them to progress, they're very easy to find).  The other works to build up the lore, and it's quite expansive.  These collectibles flesh out the story in much greater detail than the main storyline, but mostly they serve to highlight just how unfortunate it is that Contrast was cut short.\n\nThe pros:\nAn old-fashioned setting with a great accompanying visual style\nCool dynamics between 2D and 3D elements\nSome deep themes around family\nClever use of mechanics in puzzles\nInteresting lore\n\nThe cons:\nShallow and disjointed story, with a very rushed ending.\nThe majority of playtime and difficulty comes from initially working out puzzle styles\nAn irrelevant collection system (not referring to the lore collectibles)\n\nThe verdict:\nPick it up if you enjoy games with a sense of uniqueness, or the potential for depth (rather than depth itself).  Contrast will test your lateral thinking (though only on a few occasions), and it touches on some pretty cool concepts.","October 17, 2014","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There was actually a lot that erked me. For example, the game screwed with my mouse sensitivity in game, so i had to tweak it so the camera wasn't making me dizzy. Also, it was a bit more demanding on my pc then i thought it would (but my pc is old. Any up to date pc should do fine). Fixed camera angles when interecting with objects can also be a bit obnoxious.\n\nHowever... for the flaws, this game was really enjoyable. It's a bit of soul food, makes you think and ask questions. It feels substantial as far as the story and the world is concerned (Some say gameplay is lacking challange, but for me it lacked a lot of the frustration that can come with some puzzle games with obtuse solutions. For example, the secret star solutions in Braid, one of which requires you to do nothing but wait for nearly 40 minutes or so). The art is fantastic, definitely different from what i've played recently. The Music and overal sound design is wonderful, though the voice acting isn't the best.\n\nContrast is one of those examples of "Games are Art" while still being a game, as opposed to a tour with some narration over top. If you don't mind a short, but fufilling experiance or some so so gameplay, and you want a great story, world, and overall aesthetic then pick up contrast. If you want something challanging, lengthy, and a bit shallower (i.e. good dumb fun such as Painkiller) then look elsewhere. A game for when you're in the mood, and a damn good one if you end up playing it in that mood.","December 3, 2013","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was worth it.\nFirst, the whole game was translated to brazilian portuguese, with the exception of the audio (which would've been really costly). Although I have no problem understanding english, this was a nice touch, specially when most people at my country don't have easy access to english lessons. Second, the game is beautiful, entertaining and interesting. I almost gasped at the final revelation: something I thought to be just an aesthetic choice, in the end, had much more meaning within the story.\nThe puzzles were difficult enough to keep me interested, not hard to the point of making me want to give up nor easy to the point of leaving me bored. I once or twice thought of looking through a walkthrough, 'cause I'm lazy and always craving for more pieces of information surrounding a game's story, but I'd always close the window and decide to solve the puzzle myself. I loved when you activated some sort of "memory" and interacted with the shadows.\nThere were glitches and bugs, like getting stuck between shadow-world and "real-world", but nothing really troubling.\nThe controls were a bit weird at the beginning, I felt like Dawn walked too fast or something, but I got used to it quickly.  I could complain that the game is short. It is, really, but I honestly think it's worth it. It's an engaging experience and I think it lasts enough.  My only true complaint is that sometimes the cut-scenes would break the pace of the game. You'd walk a bit or solve one short puzzle and have a cut-scene right after it in a way that felt a tiny bit out of place. In the beginning of the game I felt there were too many short cut-scenes happening all the time.\nStill, it's not something that takes anything out of this wonderful game. This is a game you can show your non-gamer friends and family members too and I think would grab their attention. If you are open to it, you could ask them to help solving some puzzles, to make them engage more with the game.\nVisuals are lovely, gameplay is nice and the story is interesting.\nI'd recommend it for sure.\n","November 24, 2013","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I first opened the game while hearing the song over the menu, really, that was an awesome sensation. It was literally music to my ears and this high level of soundtrack keeps going during all the game.\n\nI don't know if it is kind of a spoiler but at first I was like in doubt in the first scene where Didi is in her room and her mom appears through the shadows, but that makes sense over the ending.\n\nOnly a few issues with my controller that would not jump in certain occasions that would soon enough become normal.(I think the problem really is in my controller not really how the game adapted it, but...)\n\nOnly a few bugs with the character and the scenario, nothing like would destroy the game, because it doesn't even affect the gameplay (like the carousel would spin and the character stands still).\n\nThe studio created their own style, of course people will compare it limbo (black and white through the shadows) and I still don't know why but gave me a déjà vu of bioshock infinite like the theory from multiverse and portals used between shadows, people will say that somehow the appearance of Dawn remembers Elizabeth and the city is in the sky?(That's what it looks like to me).\n\nCongratulations for the studio and keep the hard work to develop others great pieces of art like these. (And let me know about it, I would love to play again any other creation).","July 5, 2014","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First, a skilled player can probably complete it, achievements and all, in about two hours. In this day and age of hundred hour rpgs and unlimited online play, some may feel this affects the value. Secondly, there were times when I really felt that the controls didn't work as they should and I found it very frustrating. I'm not the best at platformers by a long shot, but I feel like their were times I missed jumps and it really wasn't my fault.\nOverall, I would say this game is like a short art film. It oozes style and tells a sweet, albeit simple story. Wonderful to experience, I think anyone who made it so far as reading this review should pick it up, because the factors that likely drew them to this point are all there and in spades.","July 6, 2014","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It falls into the puzzle genre, but utilizes first-person character control and does require a bit of speed.\n\nLike all games, Contrast has its merits and pitfalls. Some things I really liked about the game are:\n- A very well-thought-out and touching story\n- Beautiful soundtrack (especially "Kat's Song". Youtube it!)\n- A unique gameplay mechanic\n- Some decently challenging puzzles\n- Beautifully done art. Many noir games and movies nowadays are just creepy and Sin City-like. This is a much more refreshing take on the noir theme.\n\nAnd some things that weren't so great:\n- I don't know anyone who has clocked more than 10 hours to beat this\n- Some minor bugs\n- a reference to Albert Einstein in an earlier time period (learn your history, people!)\n\nSimply put, Contrast is very well-done and a must-buy for any Indie fan. People who liked story-intensive games such as Bastion will definitely enjoy Contrast more than most. Of course $15 for a game this short may pinch wallets, so do wait for a sale. And of course, we hope to hear of a second game from Compulsion Studios soon. =D","July 7, 2014","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The idea of the game is simple, complete the objective. Although the approach is different and the gameplay is not perfect the effect and emotions portrayed by the character and the abstract realism make this game shine. The voice actors did a remarkable job with the script they were given as well. While the creators could have shown the world from our view, using dawns perspective allowed for them to cut the out all of the extras that would have dragged the game down such as rendering multiple characters and dressing them differently. The artistic use of a disintegrating world aspect allowed for the playable area to be clearly marked while still aesthetically pleasing. The only downfall that is apparent is the length of the game.

It's not a perfect mechanic, however, as I've sometimes found myself trapped in little nooks, crannies, and corners.  It can also be a bit glitchy/frustrating when a jump or action looks perfectly feasible, and your timing and positioning are perfect, but the game just doesn't want to register it correctly.\n\nThese are pretty minor concerns, and detract little from the game overall.  The story is fantastic, as are the characters.  The music is top-notch, and the visuals in general are very rich and atmospheric, setting the mood very well.\n\nMy only other complaint is the game's length, as it is too short.

Seeing as the game is pretty cheap and even a bit longer than other clever puzzle games like Portal, if they patched it to run a little less buggy, I could whole heartedly recommend it.

The technical approach is good in how you can shift in an our of shadows, but the problem is that the areas you can do this in are very limited and separated from each other, making each puzzle its own microcosm.   The puzzles that use this aren't that difficult as well, with the most difficult ones being where you can either move objects to change shadows or the location of the light source. Again, with the puzzles being separate entities, these are one-stop problems as opposed to part of a larger difficult mechanism to figure out.\n\nThe story is interesting but it's hard to get into and leaves some questions on getting into the characters. Whether this is a fantasy, a dream, or something else isn't clear, and whether it is a flashback or the like.  As such, the game quickly devolves into just moving from puzzle to puzzle with story getting in the way.\n\nIt is still a decent game, but it's one I'd wait for a sale for, getting about 3 hrs of playtime from it.","March 2, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles have been challenging, varied, and entertaining. My one complaint is the platforming bits. Many of them are timed based on a spot of dialogue that is playing, which means that everytime you make a mistake, you basically have to listen to a whole cutscene over again. This wouldn't be so bad if not for the fact that the shadow puppets you are walking on sometimes move in ways that "throw" you off of them, which is very difficult to predict. So part of these challenges becomes memorization, and trial and error. Which coupled with the replaying dialogue, makes a really interesting, innovative, and gorgeous blend of story and gameplay somewhat tiresome to replay until you get it right.\n\nI'd definitely recommend it, since it is otherwise very, very good so far.","February 13, 2014","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can classify its gameplay as a platformermer/puzzle game, thoug its puzzle are not hard (unless it bugs). The game charachters are really nice, especially Dawn, but they could be a bit deeper. I think the innovative mechanics could be more explored, and the charachters could gain more depht. The game is really short (it took me 6 hours to beat it and i'm usually slow) and buggy. There are bugs everywhere, some parts of the game are not hard, but you can't complete them because something bugs and makes it more difficult than it should be (stuck on a wall, gone through it, etc).

I really like what they did with the game; the graphics are amazing (for anyone who appreciates abstract, almost creepy, beauty); the characters were very well created, the puzzles are challenging, and overall a good game. However, I feel like the story line lacks a little bit. Gameplay is roughly 5.5 hours (even going through slowly and doing all the "extra" stuff), and consists of a girl basically reuniting her parents. There is so much potential the producers could have done with this game, and that's my only complaint. I really wish they would have done more with it because this game was so great! Even though the size of the map doesn't compare to that of Rust (for those of you who are familiar with that), it was so beautifully and artistically created. Very glad I invested in this game and I would definitely play it again to get the collectables I didn't find ;) Plus, if you purchase the collectors edition, you will get a bunch of artwork including details of the making of the characters and other such things, as well as 15 jazz songs that you can save right to your iTunes library :)","February 20, 2014","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you have any liking for French jazz culture, this is the game for you. It is all about using light in creative ways to solve puzzles, most of which are platforming.\n\nMy favorite pieces are the music which was put together with care. The vocalist they hired to sing a couple songs has the perfect voice for this type of jazz. All of the voice acting is quite solid. The other piece that drew me in was the use of shadows to represent characters rather than physical beings. I think that is explained through collectibles, but I haven't spent much time with it. Contrast also manages to portray a sense of innocence surrounding Didi while giving some very adult conflicts when she's not around.\n\nThe only real issue I had was with either the controls or the design, I'm not sure. Sometimes when something seemed easy to accomplish, like a jump, you'd be force off the wall for some reason and have to start over. Basically I think some of the shadows in the environment were unintentional and created surprise blocks for you to avoid. It could also just be I'm not very practiced at platformers. The puzzles seem well designed and not too challenging to figure out. After figuring out what needs to be done, you may still need to take a few tries at it before succeeding, but it isn't usually too frustrating.\n\nIt is quite a short game if you figure out the puzzles quickly, it took me maybe 6 hours. So I probably wouldn't buy it for full price just because of the length, but I would definitely buy it on sale. Also, the soundtrack is a great jazz compilation.\n\nOne last note: at I believe the end of the first act, there are two endings depending on if you just stand and watch, or actively do something (I don't want to give spoilers) If you don't do anything, you'll fail the level and be put back to the beginning of the dialogue, so I recommend just listening first, then actually doing what you're supposed to.","February 12, 2014","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game simply doesn’t work at what it is trying to do and, as such, is utterly unrecommendable.\n\nIt starts… bad, and only gets worse. The game has no rebindable keys, the mouse cursor doesn’t work in every menu (like restarting a checkpoint or leaving the game), but it does offer very lacklustre graphic options. Although I like the style of the game, I really disliked its graphics quality. The textures aren’t pretty, and there is nothing to distract from them, as the environments are lifeless and empty. Even the music doesn’t help, as it is barely even present while you are exploring or solving puzzles. Worse, one of the main mechanics of the game requires you to play with shadows, but even they are barebones at best. In the days of soft focus shadows, that’s a big no-no if your main mechanic revolves around them. All the cutscenes and story bits are shown through the shadows too, so you get to experience bad graphics on top of very stick figure-like animations, not even remotely human. Not that it really matters as the story holds no water, but I will get to that in a minute.\nBut alright, let’s give it the benefit of the doubt, what else is there? Any other nitpicks? Well, even though I’m a native French speaker, I preferred the English dub, but the collectibles, with press articles and other, supposedly, world building information extracts, aren’t fully translated! That’s disappointing.\n\nWhat about the gameplay? Well, the controls aren’t rebindable, the camera is atrocious, -which doesn’t help-, and the animation of the character is stiff and “mechanic”. Clunky really, fast and yet without precision. When the camera switches mode, between locked in 2D shadow world and free 3D exploration, it is feels horrible: during the transitions, it is either too quick or too slow, but feels unnatural either way, jarring. You don’t feel in control, you are at the mercy of the game’s whims.\nSo let me get this straight. It is a puzzle platformer with bad controls and bad camera, where you have to jump on platforms made from poorly rendered shadows, from which you will end up sliding off for the smallest offense. This will lead to some frustration since… well, you character doesn’t move like you want it to or the game just refuses to acknowledge your input, for whatever reason, and getting sacked for it, unfairly, is rather infuriating. It is actually so bad, I landed in a secret area one time, one I hadn’t neither seen nor planned on jumping into. Thanks for that I guess, but it isn’t gonna make up for all the bad jump related deaths.\n\nAs said before, even the story didn’t hold my attention. In all honesty, I had a hard time sympathizing with the dad figure. Because he was trying, although he put his family in harm’s way, that makes every alright? When you stand in the rain, you get wet. Don’t. Stand. In. The. Rain. Or least, don’t ask for my sympathy when you complain about getting drenched. The story didn’t resonate with me.\n\nThe nail in the coffin was one particular moment that is reminiscent of Limbo. Except, you know, Limbo kind of works. So now I have a better game in my mind that I could be playing on top of all this nonsense. Anyway, it was too obvious, with the spider and all… You haven’t earned that game, the right to make an ‘homage’ like that. And even if you did, you have a game that is three hours short (and thank god for that! I wouldn’t have been able to play any more of it), and you basically have so little to put in it that you lift levels from another game. That doesn’t come across as very endearing to me.\n\nThere is definitely an interesting concept at the core of the game, with the change between 3D and 2D platformer, and that’s where the puzzles are I suppose, if you can call them that. It is a proof of concept, sure, but that’s not enough for a good game. And it is actually possible to break the puzzles, making them impossible to solve, forcing you to reload if you aren’t careful enough, which you can’t be because of the horrendous controls! At times, it does feel like an endless cycle of displeasure. Certainly, that concept deserved better. As it stands, the game is a demo I would present to my boss in order to get funding for a project based around the shown concept, not a final product I would charge money for.\n\nAll in all, what I am seeing here is a game that had a great gameplay concept, and a great art style, but failed to get to the finish line with them. The game feels rushed, empty in a lot of aspect, barely functional sometimes, without any form of polish whatsoever, and it makes it all the more disappointing when the game does finally decide to work, when, very rarely, there are some “sparks” and it clicks. From time to time, things work out alright, and the puzzles and their solutions aren’t hampered by the flaws of the game, but those shining moments, where the transition from an open world to one of shadows stimulates your brain and gives you the satisfaction of actually solving a problem in a clever way, without the frustration of dealing with force outside your reach, are far too few to justify any consideration of purchase, no matter the price.","June 21, 2015","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles have been challenging, varied, and entertaining. My one complaint is the platforming bits. Many of them are timed based on a spot of dialogue that is playing, which means that everytime you make a mistake, you basically have to listen to a whole cutscene over again. This wouldn't be so bad if not for the fact that the shadow puppets you are walking on sometimes move in ways that "throw" you off of them, which is very difficult to predict. So part of these challenges becomes memorization, and trial and error. Which coupled with the replaying dialogue, makes a really interesting, innovative, and gorgeous blend of story and gameplay somewhat tiresome to replay until you get it right.\n\nI'd definitely recommend it, since it is otherwise very, very good so far.","February 13, 2014","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can classify its gameplay as a platformermer/puzzle game, thoug its puzzle are not hard (unless it bugs). The game charachters are really nice, especially Dawn, but they could be a bit deeper. I think the innovative mechanics could be more explored, and the charachters could gain more depht. The game is really short (it took me 6 hours to beat it and i'm usually slow) and buggy. There are bugs everywhere, some parts of the game are not hard, but you can't complete them because something bugs and makes it more difficult than it should be (stuck on a wall, gone through it, etc).

As a game its nothing special; it would even be fair to say its gameplay is just bad. I often felt as though I tricked trough some levels by takng advantage of the hit-and-miss gameplay like making jumps that would avoid the puzzles. The stories execution is equally questionable, with a protagonist who serves to guide you through the game without any real finesse. And by that I don't mean your character; you seem to serve more as a tool for her tasks but that is the point.\n\nTO THE GOOD!\n\nThis game had a very specific feel about it which I felt made it worth playing. The art style and music marry so well together that I forgave the shaky gameplay (at least for the most part). Depite its dodgy execution, I got what it was trying to show and it made for an enjoyable experience. The story wasn't as linear as what I've come to expect; whether thats a good or bad thing, im not entirely sure. Its fair to say Didi (the young girl) was a bit 'pushy' in trying to force you into the story, but I didnt really mind as my character is there to help her and the interactions of the character felt right for the situation.\n\nTheres plenty to find out beyond the game through exploration. I actually think these bits were what made the game as it added another level of story beyond Didi's life to something more personal for the character Dawn (who never speaks IIRC), also - great name without being something cheesy. I would throughly recommend you endevour to find the 20(I think?) hidden media snippets! It reminded me of Bioshock in that the information you find explains the situation youre in; but in a modest way.\n\nThis game however is by no means difficult! I did the entire story in a single 2 hour sitting and found everything in that time. This wasn't even deliberately to finish it, I just felt like the game never lost traction and felt so, almost, calm to play that I kept casually playing. This isnt to say the story was good; it was weak with the hidden snippets making it interesting but it was solid enough in terms of character and situation.\n\nOverall, as someone who does try to game as much as possible, I can't honestly say its a great game. But for me, it was incredibly playable and I will revisit it again gladly. It was like listening to music, I did indeed just easily loose track of time and do it. I found it quite charming if I'm being honest.\n\nI played it with a controller if that means anything? You wont need the precision or focus of a kb+m but thats just my preference for this game. I would also say if youre on the fence about it, its probably best you wait till a sale comes around. I don't think I paid full price and despite enjoying it, don't know if its worth it. Definately feels like it should be £6.99 or similarly priced. Wouldn't be upset if I did pay retail though.","May 8, 2014","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you have any liking for French jazz culture, this is the game for you. It is all about using light in creative ways to solve puzzles, most of which are platforming.\n\nMy favorite pieces are the music which was put together with care. The vocalist they hired to sing a couple songs has the perfect voice for this type of jazz. All of the voice acting is quite solid. The other piece that drew me in was the use of shadows to represent characters rather than physical beings. I think that is explained through collectibles, but I haven't spent much time with it. Contrast also manages to portray a sense of innocence surrounding Didi while giving some very adult conflicts when she's not around.\n\nThe only real issue I had was with either the controls or the design, I'm not sure. Sometimes when something seemed easy to accomplish, like a jump, you'd be force off the wall for some reason and have to start over. Basically I think some of the shadows in the environment were unintentional and created surprise blocks for you to avoid. It could also just be I'm not very practiced at platformers. The puzzles seem well designed and not too challenging to figure out. After figuring out what needs to be done, you may still need to take a few tries at it before succeeding, but it isn't usually too frustrating.\n\nIt is quite a short game if you figure out the puzzles quickly, it took me maybe 6 hours. So I probably wouldn't buy it for full price just because of the length, but I would definitely buy it on sale. Also, the soundtrack is a great jazz compilation.\n\nOne last note: at I believe the end of the first act, there are two endings depending on if you just stand and watch, or actively do something (I don't want to give spoilers) If you don't do anything, you'll fail the level and be put back to the beginning of the dialogue, so I recommend just listening first, then actually doing what you're supposed to.","February 12, 2014","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Altough it is not a game that fills up alot of your time to complete, the artwork is fantastic and the story really puls you in. The few bucks that it cost to buy this game is money well spend.\nI am really looking forward to an expention or a second part of the game!!","February 13, 2014","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arachin/recommended/224460/","arachin","Arachin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arachin/","253 products in account","A clever but underachieving adventure / puzzle game elevated at times by an interesting setting and story.\nFor those of you that don't know, your character can blend between 3d person and 2d projected platforming by stepping into the light projected onto walls. Shadows become walls, floors and even lifts to new areas. At its best it feels like a mix of fez and portal, but at its worst the shadow stepping can be awkward and unreliable.\nThe pacing is acceptable and there seem to be multiple ways to approach some puzzles, but there's no serious challenge here.\nThe setting falls somewhere between Bugsy Malone and Alice in Wonderland, but doesn't fully deliver on either. The noir story is a nice touch, but not gritty enough for my tastes, and whilst the worlds warp and float like a fever dream this fact is entirely ignored by the characters. I would not have been shocked to see: "But it was all a dream. The End"\nThere were some beautiful moments towards the end of the game where a deeper meaning is hinted, but it arrived a little late.\n\nIf you're curious, pick it up on a good sale day, but you're looking for puzzle, platforming or story, this game hits under average on all accounts.
