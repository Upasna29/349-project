The sun has gone missing, and with the people of Earth becoming distressed as the light disappears, you the moon have taken it upon yourself to heed their plight and discover where the sun has gone off to.\n\nThe writing, shockingly, actually wound up being my biggest issue with the game. Not so much because the narrative is flimsy and only the last handful of lines actually matter, but because it continually tries to fit in a rather odd, ambiguous meaning to the experience that never surfaces, and instead just floats around in the spectrum of weird space occupied by discarded poems and first drafts of better works.\n\nIf you disregard the story entirely though, 6180 is a rather delicious little platformer with an interesting (if basic and one note) mechanic of continual motion through the top and bottom of the screen. Falling through the ground pops you back out the top, and its with this in mind that platforms and obstacles are setup to require you to manipulate gravity and momentum to get past. The level designs are fairly simple and the difficulty consistently low (save a few frustrating spikes, pun not intended), but it's engaging and relaxing in a way that kept me interested in playing at least for the 40 or so minutes it took to complete the game.\n\nSimilarly, the modest but pleasant aesthetics and sleepy soundtrack fit in right along with an experience that seems designed to be played on a raining afternoon, sipping a cup of tea or cocoa without requiring you to process much more than a single button and the position of a few odd platformers. It's not deep, it's not innovative, and I likely won't remember it for very long, but I don't at all regret the time I spent with the moon and find it easy to recommend as a small snack of a game.","October 3, 2014","true","2.0"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","2"

The fact that the top of the screen wraps around with the bottom is quite cool. The goal is to get to the Sun and ask him some questions. Then after you do that, to go back to your place by Earth.\n\nThe Moon level set does a good job of making you understand the main mechanic of jumping through the screen.\n\nThe Earth level set gives you another interesting mechanic: a box which launches you in the opposite direction from where you hit it (up or down). It also plays a note that goes along with the background music which is a really nice touch.\n\nThe Venus level set has the most nicest music in my opinion. It also introduces a sort of power-up which allows you to pause your upwards jump or downwards fall, stopping you in the air completely before gravity kicks in and pulls you downwards again. This allows you to avoid hitting spikes on the ceiling or to make longer jumps.\n\nUnfortunately another mechanic is introduced which is boring and rather frusterating. It's a timed wall that appears for two seconds and vanishes for two seconds. There's nothing really cool or fun about it, but it does add to the difficulty and challenge of the game.\n\nAfter the Venus levels, the game becomes a drag. It doesn't take too long to complete. While rushing, it took me about 1 hour 20 minutes. There are also achievements. These were fun to do. They add to the game if you want some extra, non-required challenge.\n\nOverall, it was a fun game for a while. AND IT'S ONLY $4. It's definitely worth buying the soundtrack with it. I like my Venus music.\n\n","November 5, 2015","true","8.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/skeithg/recommended/299660/","skeithg","Skeith","http://steamcommunity.com/id/skeithg/","107 products in account","This is an absolutely mind benidng platformer with mixed elements that you have never seen before, all packed with a fairly good and quite calming soundtrack.\nWalking into this game you must toss aside most of your traditional platforming wisdom. The game takes a completely new take on platforming mechanics and executes a great 2-3 hour experience with it. In this game, falling off to the bottom or jumping through the top (or in the later half of the game, the opposite!) will instead loop you around to the other side, as though your jump went across a cylinder. On top of that, you can't control how long your jump is, making for even more careful (not torturous) platforming. It's completely wild and in the same kind of way that portal does, it just absolutely bends your mind for nearly the entirety of the game.\nThe soundtrack of the game is zen-like in its nature and even if a level would otherwise be particularly hard and mildly rage inducing, I even found myself just saying "Damn." calmly after multiple failures at just the first part of one level. In fact, I have yet to be actually mad from this game just from it's soundtrack. Your experience may vary, but it is still a great feature.\nThe only unfortunate thing about this game is that its story is completely lost in translation. You can certainly understand what's being said if you mix and replace some words, but the story is extremely minimal and unless you are someone who plays games almost exclusively for a story then this shouldn't be an issue and may even further lighten the mood because of some silly translations.\n\nOverall, I would recommend the game, espeically for its price point. It knows exactly what it's worth, so if you're interested, give it a whirl.","September 22, 2014","true","8.7"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

The danger here is that the challenges presented might have about as much thought put into them as the presentation. 6180 the moon might give that impression at first glance, but it turned out far more clever and engrossing than I expected.\n\nYou play the moon, on a quest to find its eternal buddy, the sun. This journey takes you across fifty levels divided into five regions of the solar system, broken up by adorable little cutscenes with other heavenly bodies. The game's gimmick is that the screen wraps around the top, so if you plunge off the bottom you'll drop back in above. That means no bottomless pits to worry about, but the numerous spikes are more than happy to take their place. Your jump sends you a full screen height and change so there's nowhere on the screen that's unreachable, giving you very pleasant freedom of movement.\n\nLevel gimmicks include spikes, moving platforms, breakaway blocks, spikes, switches and gates, spikes, and a few other not-spike features. Once you wrap your brain around wrapping around the screen the game goes quite smoothly, and you'll likely complete your sojourn to the sun in 30-40 minutes. This unlocks a new mode where you play through the levels in reverse, with gravity flipped, and this one little change blew my mind. The vast majority of the levels are completely unchanged, but become far move difficult because of their genius dual design. Playing through the first time was a subdued, relaxing experience, but playing through the second was a distinct pleasure.\n\nThe whole game will take you just over an hour to complete, and there are no additional modes or corner-case achievents to chase, so it'll all be over before you know it. But the clever puzzles are truly a delight, accompanied with an excellent piano soundtrack and the aforementioned cutscenes that just ooze charm. It's a bite-sized puzzle platformer, but you're sure to relish it more than a lot of larger offerings.","February 21","true","0.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Recommended for a very low price, if you've got nothing better to be doing.\n\nThe music and overall aesthetic are simple but good, and create a calm ambiance that mostly does not get in the way of the game, and does appear to enhance it.\n\nHowever, the writting falls flat, with spelling mistakes, particularly poor characterisation for all characters, and a mystery plot for which the final reveal is unsatisfying due to being logically inconsistent. It attempts to tell many different aesops, which for the most part are poorly constructed and are universally poorly delivered, and ends up feeling like it doesn't know what message it wants to give. The cutscenes are unskippable and get in the way of the game.\n\nThe level design is hit-and-miss, with necessary mechanic explanation levels, exploratory levels, and interesting challenges mixed in with levels which made me question how well the designer really understood their gameplay mechanics. Some almost unavoidable bugs, especially regarding the screen-wrapping mechanic, mostly do not get in the way of enjoying the game.\n\nIt is an exceptionatly short game, with my completion time (no extras or replays) sitting at 0.7 hours, and the "Moon Rising" mode adding an extra 0.3 hours. It also has very little replay value due to being a puzzle game.\n\nI would not recommend this game for anything over $5.

This effectively eliminates fall deaths, and makes jumping/falling a more interesting prospect. The story has players taking control of the moon in search of the missing sun.\n\nThis is probably the most relaxed platformer I’ve played. Minimalist graphics and an amazing soundtrack make even the most intense moments seem relaxing. The story feels like a children’s book. Not in a bad way, though. It’s a straightforward plot involving celestial bodies. The moon goes looking for the sun and meets some planets along the way. Each heavenly body has a distinct personality and reaction to the moon’s quest. When the moon finally does find the sun, he learns the truth about himself and the sun’s disappearance. I don’t usually care for 2D platformers, but this one is worth checking out.\n\nVerdict: Buy it. Its unique mechanic, amazing soundtrack, and low price make this a game worth trying.\n","February 20, 2015","true","1.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You can think of it as level-wide Portals connecting the top and bottom :)\n\nAs you progress in the story, a few more elements are introduced such as "bounce" blocks which pop as you hit them and bounce you away at high speeds, blocks which blink in and out, and "power-ups" which give you the ability to instantly arrest your vertical momentum. There are no enemies, and the only way to die are the ubiquitous spikes.\n\nThis game is quite short though, and if you're any good at platformers you'll likely get all the achievements by the time the last Trading Card drops.","October 5, 2014","true","4.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Main mechanic of the game is that there are no borders; screen just wraps around. Whereas in other games falling into the abyss would kill you, here you just emerge from the top of the screen. New things are introduced when you progress throughout the game such as spikes, breaking blocks and moving platforms. Game has 50 levels which are distributed into 5 areas in solar system; when you finish them in order to complete the story you need to go through them once more, this time in reverse. Gravity is also changed to keep the game less repeating, it takes a small time getting used to falling upward.\n\nThere is a small story presented and consists of moon chatting with some planets and the Sun itself. Dialog is nicely written, you can easily imagine planets as real persons. It reminds me of Thomas Was Alone in this regard, too bad there isn't more of it.

It's basically just the simplest ever platformer with minimal graphics, and the only real gimmick is that the screen wraps vertically.  That's just not enough to save it, IMO.  VVVVVV uses the same mechanic for a few screens, and it's kind of novel.  When you make an entire game out of it, it falls flat.\n\nThe music is not bad, but very generic.  I'm not sure if it was repeating a short tune for the whole game, or if it just sounded similar enough all the way through that I didn't notice.\n\nThe minimal graphics can't really be too bad, since they're just basic monochrome shapes  (though I did notice a lot of screen tearing)\n\nAnything resembling a puzzle or platforming challenge was an illusion.  Yeah you might occasionally time something wrong and hit the spikes, but it was always immediately obvious what to do, and generally not at all challenging to pull it off.\n\nI did all the achievements in the game in 114min, and that included a lot of time that I left the game sitting while I was AFK.  I'm guessing actual playtime was somewhere around an hour or slightly over.\n\nI really don't understand the great reviews, to me this was pretty much a non-game.  just a very short grind, with no payoff.","March 14, 2015","false","1.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

One such game is 6180 the moon, a platforming game developed by first-time developer Turtle Cream Studios.\n\nThe gameplay of 6180 the moon is as simple as its story. You play as The Moon, who rolls through the various levels of the game in pursuit of the Sun, who has recently disappeared - the Moon has made it its goal to find the Sun and work out what has gone wrong. The mechanic that makes 6180 the moon unique is the fact that the top and bottom of ther level are connected - falling down causes you to reappear at the top, and jumping through the top causes you to rise from below, which makes for some rather interesting gameplay, which slowly develops over the course of the game's five areas with other mechanics, for instance blocks which explode, pushing the Moon upwards or downwards. Some of these mechanics, particularly the connected ceiling and floor and one mechanic where pressing a button causes some blocks to disappear, remind me of the old indie game Karoshi 2.0, which had some similar mechanics.\n\nThe game starts off easy and pretty much continues being generally easy throughout, though not so much so as to be boring - There is the slightest hint of challenge to keep you interested as you play through. That said, it is also a very short game, so don't expect to complete ther main game in over an hour; it took me about 45 minutes. But despite its short length, 6180 the moon is still an enjoyable experience with its interesting mechanics and the simple art style and soundtrack, which reminds me in part of some of the old WiiWare games for Nintendo Wii.\n\nOverall, I'd reccommend 6180 the moon. Short but sweet, it's a cute little platformer with a unique little style, ideal for when you feel like a quick one-hour game.\n","March 1, 2015","true","2.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Its a fun  little  Challenge, has a simple and fun core mechanic (kinda has that vvvvvv feel to it, but its still very unique), and has a wonderful soundtrack. From the difficulty its definetly no "Super Meat Boy" or "I wanna be the guy" but it has quiet a bunch of moments where you have to think more then once or twice in order to progress. The downside is, the is game pretty short, and i beat the whole thing in 2h (on my first run)  forwards and backwards  , but looking the at price (3,99€ in germany) the length is forgivable.\n\nSo tl,dr:  If you have 5 bucks laying around, and are looking for a pleasent gaming experience, or maybe want a rather easy entrance into "frustration plattformers"  (i'm not sure if thats the right term, but you get what i mean)  , then i recommend you this game. c:","October 31, 2014","true","2.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

If the problems had been worked out, it could have been interesting. As it stands, it is a couple short hours of at best a mind-bending and fairly forgiving physics gimmick game, and at worst intense frustration, glitches and shamefully awful writing.\n\nTL;DR: Music is excellent, but writing is abysmal, glitches abound, and when you reach the half-way point, the game reverses your physics and expects you to redo the levels backwards, while pressing the up arrow to jump down.\n\nGood:    Music - This game comes with a buyable soundtrack and there's no mystery why. The music is atmospheric, floaty and zen, which blends in well with the simple aesthetic the designers were clearly going for.\nMenus and UI - This might not normally be worth mentioning, but the menus introduce the game and its theme well. They fit the aesthetic and are intuitive and easy to navigate.\nFloating - This game makes use of a fixed jump height with a floaty arc as the base of its jumping physics, and admittedly it feels great and free just clearing a bank of spikes with a long, lazy, beautiful arc.\n\nBad:    Writing - So bad that it is noticeably the worst thing about this game. Each of the planets is depicted as a dry, one-dimensional stereotype that seems like it's trying to give a Sunday special moral lesson that in many cases isn't even true. The game would be improved greatly by removing the dialogue moments entirely.\nGlitches - Above dialogue moments often show text popping in at one size and then immediately popping down to another font size. Sometimes two text entries appear on top of one another, rendering both unreadable. There's a negative space that you move through in between the moment you disappear off the bottom of the screen and the moment you emerge from the top of it, and while in that space you phase through moving platforms; it seems like they go through more negative space than you do. There are also a couple of glitches that can make you hit the wrong side of a bounce block, or freeze in place.\nPhase Walls - One of the introduced mechanics are walls that appear, fade, and disappear. This is a platforming staple, but in this game, I found it hard to get a feel for how long they would spend in each phase. More distinct or more fluid visual cues might have helped here.\nSymmetry - Given how much time you spend bouncing from the top to the bottom of the screen and back again at times, it can feel awkward how different falling down feels compared to rising up.\nHowever, the symmetry of controls becomes more important once you have reached the sun and are tasked with going back through all the levels in reverse - in this mode, you "jump" down (by pressing the up key, no less), "fall" up and stick to the bottoms of platforms, which is extremely unintuitive. Having come back to this game and completed the reverse levels, I can attest that many of the earliest levels are in fact designed to be much more challenging backwards, but nevertheless, the difficulty curve on the return is highly erratic rather than smooth.","April 3, 2015","false","2.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I was expecting movement more like low-gravity-style, or at least the possibility of doing this regardless of environment, which is not the case.\n\nConclusion:\nI did not dislike this game, but I didn't feel it either. Still...considering the extremely short playtime, I clearly can not recommend buying this for full price of 3.99€.","August 14, 2015","false","1.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I expected a game that I'd be able to suggest to friends, both casual and hardcore "gamers". Sadly what I encountered was a bright idea tangled in a total mess.\n\n\n+The game has a really clever twist on platforming.\n+The idea of being the Moon, traversing Milky Way is really unique.\n+The music has an eery, empty space feeling.\n+It looks really unique.\n\n-Extremely lacking in content (finished it in 80 minutes). After beating it, it unlocks a mode where you can play the stages the other way around (last->first). No time trials, or user generated content to keep you interested.\n-Occasional lack of response to my keystrokes, or response to keystrokes that never were.\n-Twice I got stuck in thin air and once more somewhere I could not see me.\n-For some reason the "W" key decided to stop working halfway through, forcing me to switch to arrows, 3 levels after thinking it was a deliberate game mechanic.\n-Infuriating platforming and extremely lacking on the "puzzle" part. Some extremely unforgiving levels, which felt unfair. I almost ragequit 3-4 times and would have if this game wasn't so short.\n-Stupid timed puzzles, completely out of sync with the music, making timed jumps a massive pain. These were some the most infuriating levels.\n-The music loops too much, becoming boring really fast and annoying even faster.\n-I had constant screen-tearing, no clue why, my PC is more than capable of running this game. Combined with some extremely fast changes from "black with white spots" to "really bright dark", I currently have a  headache.\n\n\nOverall, this game is a personal disappointment and feels, above all, like a wasted oportunity. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, unless (s)he's really interested and it's on sale.","November 3, 2014","false","2.2"," 8 of 24 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","8","24","0","0"

The main mechanic the game runs around makes it very confusing to wrap your head around at first, but once you get into the mindset of it, it becomes a lot of fun. I wouldn't even call this a true platformer, because the way you play this is so vastly different than a regular platformer.\n\nThe mechanics require you to think non-linearly, up can become down, and down becomes up, the way to complete a level more often than not is not the most obvious way, which I love. The sound design is amazing and fits perfectly for the game, anything else would just make it frustrating. The game is fairly short, i've only played about 1 hour of it and i'm almost to the sun stages (that's what I assume, might be wrong), but you can spend a lot of time replaying levels because there are a few ways of doing a certain run differently.

A bit short, not much of a story line, it kinda had a child bedtime story like quality to it. Calming music in the background, and despite how simple it was, im sitting here cussing at it lol! Tis a puzzle based game where you have to take into account how high you jump, and you WILL jump through the top of the screen and reappear at the bottom. Think of this as a very easy version of portal,...portal for kids lol. I bought this game cause i thought it would be similar to 140. (140 is another puzzle game, I love 140 and its much more difficult than 6180) Took me no more than 2 hours to earn all achievements for this game, and I honestly wasnt trying to get them, just trying to finish the game. Most achievements are, "Oh, you progressed, achievement!". "Oh, you jumped X amount of time, achievement!" Right now this game is on sale for like a buck or two, I recommend it. However, take into consideration that this game really is easy, so if you like challenges, I wouldnt suggest this game. Get 140 and/or portal instead. But if you just want a simple puzzle game, a game for your kids to play, another game with trading cards, or a game that you can easily earn all achieves for a perfect game on your account, than this game is for you. However, not much of a reason to replay it after you've finished.\n\nSo, the tldr version:\nPros: Trading cards, cute, kids can play\n\nCons: A bit too easy, no reason to replay\n\nOther: Rage inducing despite the calm music/how easy it really it.

The main mechanic the game runs around makes it very confusing to wrap your head around at first, but once you get into the mindset of it, it becomes a lot of fun. I wouldn't even call this a true platformer, because the way you play this is so vastly different than a regular platformer.\n\nThe mechanics require you to think non-linearly, up can become down, and down becomes up, the way to complete a level more often than not is not the most obvious way, which I love. The sound design is amazing and fits perfectly for the game, anything else would just make it frustrating. The game is fairly short, i've only played about 1 hour of it and i'm almost to the sun stages (that's what I assume, might be wrong), but you can spend a lot of time replaying levels because there are a few ways of doing a certain run differently.

For that reason, I tend to gravitate to games that are about 3 hours long or so on average.\n\nHowever, even though I like short games, 6180 The Moon was a little too short, clocking in at nearly dead on one hour in length. The mechanic and look of the game are both excellent, but it does end up feeling a little like a demo, rather than something which has been developed into a fully realised idea.\n\nThat said, I would still recommend it, but primarily because I paid less than $1 for it. If it is on sale for about 2 bucks, I would recommend that you pick it up. Otherwise, it's not a good value proposition. Just go and play one of your 500 other Steam games instead\n\n6/10","July 20, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gimmick in this game is that the screen is warped so going off of the top will bring you up from the bottom. However, the gravity is still in effect so the puzzles become intersting as timing comes into play. This mechanic pretty much provdes the main basis of the game and it is very enjoyable. The levels are a bit easy but they are pretty fun to play.\n\nThe game is pretty short (1.5-2 hours) which is a unfortanute bceause I would have played more of it. However, the game is fairly priced at 4 bucks and I would say it is worth it. The length does have some adverse effects as some of the powerups are not fleshed out and I felt like there could have been more.\n\nOverall, if you like the genre or are looking to get into the genere, play it.

I often turn off music in games, but in this one, it was incredibly calming, which was good because I got frustrated a lot by the levels, mostly because I wasn't great at the controls.\n\nHOWEVER, if you're looking for an interesting story, skip this. It has a tedious and boring story, but is honestly worth it for the gameplay.","January 13","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The movement mechanics became almost natural with surprising speed, and such a great idea to have wraparound! The story was amazing for such a short game, and was rather touching.  The music is amazing, and really adds to the atmosphere, what little there is in space! ;)  Everyone should play this, you will never look at a platformer the same way again.\nBottom Line:  Totally worth the money!","May 11","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was able to complete 100% in about 2 hours, and that was without even actually seriously trying. The most defining feature for me was the soundtrack. It was so relaxing and fantastic. Worth every penny.\nAs usual, get it on sale!","May 21","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This can be a challenge as I find you don't immediately think in the right mindset to deal with this, but once you get used to it it can provide a nice challenge.\n\nIt tells a story about space, but I don't really think there's much to that other than the cutscenes.\n\nThe game is pretty short, but it does offer extra levels once you beat the game (but these are just the same, in reverse).","May 24","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
