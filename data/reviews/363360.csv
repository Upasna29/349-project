I played a lot of Starmade early on, and poked around Space Engineers, both were fun in their own respects but lacked something I desperately wanted from a space sim.\n\nBuidling your own ship, station or anything is something I love, but the limits of the game are what ultimately define the experience.  Starmade allowed for fantastically large ships, almost mindbogglingly so and definitely a huge use of time to really get the interior looking good.  Space Engineers really is great if you like the more serious and realistic approach, I wouldn't call it gritty, but ships being torn apart is pretty cool.\n\nYet neither game really hit that classic space sim feel, sure they simualated some blocky universe of space, or some distant somewhat plausible future, the ships are even quite impressive, with Starmades mining laser crafts eating through asteroids and Space Engineers giant tissue paper cruisers.\n\nI'm not saying Interstellar Rift at this moment does either, surely at it's present state without combat or really anything other to do than fly around a bit and build or stare at non-functioning parts and wonder what the final mechanic will look like.\n\nBut in those moments in passing, when you're busily walking through your freshly designed ship, built up with a decent editor(that could use some tweaking and refinement of course) that has more resemblance to a Sims game than it does to Space Engineer's or Starmade's editor, and you stop to notice the Jukebox you had absent mindedly placed for fluff, and you walk up to it.  The screen fades in, and a selection shows up, you hit classical and look out the window.  An asteroid tumbles by silently in the void.\n\nIt feels like home.","July 1, 2015","true","111.7"," 147 of 156 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","147","156","5","8"

Yes, I know, you're money helps fund the game- I get that. But the developers of this game need to make it more stable- and need to provide far more tutorials to help players understand how this game works. There's lots of info- but it's mostly all prior to a major revision of the power system- so all useless.\n\nThe main issue is that the game is NOT playable in solo; you can't use the extractors or any equipment to learn how the game works. You can build- yes, and that helps learn, but your ship can't function: you get low oxygen alerts, and you can load oxygen or hydrogen as the Solo is nothing more than a build check game.\n\nBut the real issues occur when you go to a live server; the crashes are numerous. And when you crash- the game becomes litterally un-reenterable; you can get back in with out a runtime error. Crash- Crash- Crash.\n\nThe game is NOT ready for early release.\n\nThat said- this game has serious potential as long as they do not turn it into an EVE Online PVP fest. I plan to follow it for now and hope fo the best. I really do believe that the game has great potential- but right now, its a frustrating but pretty  mess, and the dev's need to address these issues now, else it will just get worse.\n\nNeeded: Real updated FULLY explained Tutorials\nBest Part: Well concieved- fun ship building effort\nHope: that there will be planets to walk around on\nBlocker: it crashes and its horrificably unstatble and unreliavbel\nWorst Part: Learning curve that could easilly be overcome by better tutorials (hence why needed)\n\nWatch this one for sure: but hold you money for now.\n\nI will update this when they fix the issues.","July 20, 2015","false","22.0"," 109 of 152 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","109","152","4","17"

Here's what you can do RIGHT NOW:\n\n1.  You can design and NAME your OWN ship.  You lay out your ships in cubed blocks.  You can have multiple levels and multiple rooms on each level.\n\nYou have to add a power source.  I like to use a combination of hydrogen generators and solar panels.  You have to add power storage.  I like to use a combination of hydrogen tanks and back-up batteries.\n\nYou add doors, lights, a helm/bridge. gun turrets (limited and not working yet, but on the roadmap).  You add stairs and elevators, windows and walkways.\n\nYou have to add a teleporter.  You have to add life-support (an oxygen processor, and then ventilation in all rooms).\n\nYou add furniture, storage cabinets, computer terminals and quite a lot more.\n\n2.  Then you build your ship.  To build your ship, you need multiple resources.  To be those resources, you have to use an "extractor" to capture asteroids and mine them for iron, copper, water (which can be refined into hydrogen and oxygen), and silicon (though I understand that more elements may be on the way).\n\nYou then refine the raw resources, add the resources to your "vault" and build a ship.  To get silicon, you currently have to build a small ship with its own extractor and go to ANOTHER distant asteroid field, mine it, and return to the station.\n\n3.  You then equip your ship.  You mine water for oxygen and teleport it to the cargo pads on your ship (where you can grab it, slide it into the oxygen processor on your ship, and load it into the system).  You mine water for hydrogen and teleport it right into the hydrogen fuel tanks on your ship.\n\n4.  You can then teleport to your ship.  You can walk around.  All the doors work.  The extractors, refineries, cargo teleporters, cargo pads ... those ALL work.  More things I'M SURE will come later.  Just walking around, in first person view, in a ship I created, is a real joy.\n\n5.  You can FLY your ship.  The bigger the ship, the more engines you need.  My ships don't turn very well.  Not sure why.  But it's a joy to set course and fly.\n\nJust messing around with the editor is hours of fun, but having adventures in space, playing as captain of my own ship, BEING my own Han Solo or Malcolm Reynolds in a ship I designed and named ... awesome.\n\nI can't WAIT to see what this game will become.  What it lacks in "flash", it MORE than makes up for in gameplay.","July 5, 2015","true","134.6"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","28","32","2","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ViperZeroOne/recommended/363360/","ViperZeroOne","ViperZeroOne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ViperZeroOne/","274 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe game is Interstellar Rift, and the game is quite literally as cool as its name.  In its present state there is little more to do than design and pilot your ships (or stations) and do resource harvesting, but even that is really impressive when you factor in how immersive this game is.  Absolutely everything, even the menu access, is done through consoles both on your person and at the various equipment.  Want to adjust the engines?  Forget quick keys, sit in the pilot seat and look at the console to your left.  Want to convert raw materials?  Load them into the refinery and use the console to produce your resources.\n\nIf I had to pick a gripe with this game it would be the (current) lack of a tutorial.  That said, there is a lot of content yet to be added to the game so adding a tutorial at this phase wouldn’t really be practical.  After all, you can’t make a tutorial on combat when there currently is none.  It only took me about 15 minutes to figure things out on my own, so for the moment I’m not actually considering the lack of a tutorial a “bad thing”.  Just make sure when you beam to your newly crafted ship you bring along some oxygen for air and hydrogen for fuel (both refined from water) or you're totally screwed.  Also, check out the information kiosk because it'll help you too.\n\nI’ve heard that multiplayer can be buggy, but I have yet to do any multiplayer so I can’t say for sure.  I know there have been a lot of patches, and will continue to be a lot of patches, so patience is a virtue in this case.\n\nAll in all I’m extremely impressed with the state of Interstellar Rift.  Taking into account all of the things promised for the future (NPC’s, Combat, Exploration, Vast Universe, Economy, etc.) recommending this game is a no-brainer.  And hey, if you’re a little nervous about getting involved with a game that’s early access, there’s always the ability to place it on your “Wish List” so you can keep an eye on it.","September 25, 2015","true","7.8"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","0"

If this game is done right, it will be the future of all space games.\n\nPros:\n- Graphics are pretty dam amazing. When talking about the interior designs and animations of a game, this game is very high quality! The exterior could use some work though....\n- Gameplay is smooth and great fun! Yes, there are not many features BUT I STILL FIND MYSELF HAVING A BLAST! If the game this fun at its bare bones then I cannot wait until it is fully implemented\n- Ship editor system is on point. Yes, it could use some fine tuning and I would love a way to look at a 3d model of the inside of the ship before having to build it and then scrap it if one part is made incorrectly. OTher than that it is responsive and very detailed.\n- Mining done right! YOU FEEL PRODUCTIVE IN THIS GAME! A lot of games have you chopping trees for hours or collecting food. Which is fine, but this game the mining and refining are done in a very interactive and fun way! Keeps you moving and on your feet without it feeling like a drag.\n- One of the most immersive space games I've played. You actually are in a station, you have a mining station, you can choose what music plays, and you can walk around your own ship and interact with machines and systems. IT ISNT JUST RANDOM BLOCKS! THEY HAVE MEANING!\n- Updates are frequent with hotfixes all the time\n\nCONS\n- Resource collecting and ship building and flying are about the only things to do BUT THEY ARE FUN!\n- Exterior graphics of the ships are just simply dissapointing...\n- Flying mechanics could be improved and more responsive\n- Population is low but the game is very early access so it is understandable\n\nOverall, the game is a great game and if done right could easily be a game changer with the graphics and immersiveness they have going. Don't be fooled by my hours in the game. I have been playing this game since before it came to steam! And yes I was one of the lucky few who got the game for free since I started out so early! Got to give love to developers who care for and reward people who help them.","June 30, 2015","true","17.0"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","0"

If you're anti-social, go ahead and get your refund and uninstall this game. This game borders MMO interaction with players requiring player-to-player cooperation.  Yes there is a single-player mode but trying to manage a ship all on your own will become so tedious by yourself you'll quickly get burned out right on the 10 hour mark.\n\nThis is not Space Engineers.  This is not StarMade.  This is not Empyrion.  If I had to put my finger on what two games this game melds with it would be: Sims 3 (Building mechanics) and Elite Dangerous (ship flying/combat/mission/faction mechanics).\n\nStarting out, you now have some great things to get you started, though there isn't much documentation or tutorials yet so new players will have a significant learning curve to really get started in this game.  Hopefully this review can help a little.\n\nFirstly choose the Hurles Co Faction (the miners), if not you're going to find yourself stuck, or you're going to need to know how to find a perfect balance of hydrogen and oxygen to get you to a mining station.  If you're new, trust me, chose Hurles Co.\n\nThere is currently no way to reset your faction and starting style per Dedicated Server so if you don't listen to me, and decide to be a hard-head and pick some other faction you feel comfortable role-playing as, you'll likely rage-quit the game becuase you'll find yourself stuck.  Again, choose Hurls Co.\n\nBring FRINEDS!  This is not a solo game as I said.  You'll have a LOT more fun if you bring friends and you all work together in a fleet to build, explore, and fight. Bringing friends is certainly not a requirement, but the alternative is you'll likely find yourself crewing a stranger's ship hoping you get paid more than just "thanks" if you don't.\n\nREAD THE GUIDES - I've created a couple of guides myself to help guide newbies through the game.  Once you figure out what servers you should chose and once you figure out how you should get started the game will become a ton of fun.  If you get off on the wrong foot, I imagine you'll be demanding a refund.  So doing your research before playing this game like many other space-based MMO's like EVE or Elite Dangerous, is paramount to getting the full effect of this game.\n\nThe game patches nearly daily, the only patch quality that I have seen that exceeds this game is Ark: Survival Evolved and that's saying something.  This is a real EA game that is constantly improving the way the players want it to improve within the scope of a multi-player multi-crew star-ship simulator.\n\nAll in all, once you pass the learning curve, maintain some resolve through that learning curve and figure out how to actually work on, pilot, or manage a starship, you'll find my scoring of the game is spot on with a 9/10.  If you're ADHD, easily distracted, or come in trying to play this game with expectations of soloing, you'll be asking for a hasty refund and you'll think this review is a lie.","February 26","true","545.4"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

Definitely worth the low price.\n\nKey Points:\nPolished and tested updates every two weeks. The bugs that do make it in are minor and quickly fixed.\nResponsive to community feedback and requests.\nOne man cannot rule them all. Bigger ships require/benefit from additional (player) crew. You can do it alone, but it's tough.\nWalk around inside ships. interact with different items, while someone's piloting. You don't get thrown around \o/\nProbably the nicest in-game interfaces for interacting with items you've ever used.\nYou don't build ships while playing. You do it in an editor, and build the ship whole.\nVery impressive interiors, overall visuals are outstanding.\nMuch more detailed and technical ship construction, including grouping items onto different power grids, weapon groups into ammunition loaders, etc.\nWhat's the down side?\nContent is a little limited at the time of writing. This is set to change, with small updates every fortnight.\nLow player numbers, probably due to the above. If you're content with Single Player, this won't be a problem for you!\nInterstellar Rift is a little gem that has been sitting in my steam library for quite some time. It's one of those games that you pop back to every now and then just to see how it's coming along. Every so often there's a good update that gets me back into it for a while, which is exactly how I got started with Space Engineers.\n\n\nAt the moment Interstellar Rift appears to be in an awkward phase. Some people want to buy it but haven't because they're waiting to see what happens, and others have it but don't play online because nobody else is playing it online right now (!). There's no denying that it's a good game - the basics are all there, what I think a lot of people are waiting for is a big feature or update to come out that really offers something new and interesting to play with. It doesn't take long to get through the content that's offered already, which itself is worth the low price tag. But the combat is somewhat limited at the moment, and the number of toys to tinker with could use expanding. Some of this is in progress or planned already.\n\nWith first person combat (planned), ship boarding (planned), resource scarcity (planned), official servers (currently a test server), a bunch of new toys and gameplay mechanics (planned), this will be a hit.\n\nWith two updates/month though, don't expect all this tomorrow; But at least you won't be eternally tripping over bugs and crashes when this stuff arrives (I'm looking at YOU, Space Engineers!).","May 3","true","171.1"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","1"

It combines ideas from other space games (i.e. Space Engineers, Starmade, Flagship) and does so much more with it. It's a beautiful game in itself, and the whole thing just seems to make sense. Admittedly there isn't much to do except build, fly and collect resources, but even then it's a heck of a lot of fun. This game has already beaten most other space games in my books even this early on.\n\nThis is what space simulators should strive to be. I'm immediately immersed in my environment and feel connected to my ship as I fix problems, fuel it, and fill it with oxygen. I'm impressed! I don't usually say this sort of stuff for games! The GRIP tool is also an amazing idea, it allows you to individually power small machines (i.e a door) during power failures, change permissions, view ship stats, enable/disable individual machines, and pretty much anything else you can think of. Integrated flawlessly into the game, it makes for a very nice addition and really completes the experiance.\n\nPROS\n- Beautiful graphics\n- Intuitive ship designer, one of the best I've ever seen\n- You command and can access every bit of the ship. Every bit is also functional\n- Lots and lots of Blocks and System parts\n- Regular updates every few weeks\n- Flight feels almost natural\n- Not a whole lot of lag at all, even for low end computers\n- Every Block in your ship has a function and you're expected to maintain it and not just fly it\n- G.R.I.P. Tool is a Genius idea\n\nCONS\n- Not a lot to do in the game. But it's being updated regularly so that's fast becoming less of a problem\n- No enemies or combat system (But devs have said that and shields are coming out soon)\n- Flying could still use a lot of work\n- Not a lot of people playing the game\n- Exterior Ship design is... uhh... Lacking... Not very good.\n\nAll in all, Interstellar Rift is what modern space simulators should strive to be like. I'm looking forward to seeing it progress. 7/10 for now, once gameplay is expanded that will easily go up very quickly.\n\nI definitely recommend! Space engineers has nothing on it graphics wise, and lags sooo much more than Interstellar Rift.","July 3, 2015","true","30.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

For those of you who are like me, and enjoy roleplay, you must be able to see the potential this game being excellent for roleplay. But, like any good roleplaying game, it requires variety: and right now there is not much of it - but i have a lot of faith in these developers.

I feel that in the future there will be a large amount of content sufficient for creating exciting roleplaying servers.\n\nThe one thing that is not lacking in variety are space ships. Not only are there space stations to explore when you first pop into a server, there are space ships! But these spaceships are not made by the game (some of them are), they are made by you the player! The spaceship designer is incredibly detailed and easy to use. A long standing server could have unique ships flying all over the galaxy - each with a different purpose! You decide what your ship's purpose is, and if you get tired of designing ships, go ahead and make a space station: heck, you could even make something like the death star!\n\nOverall this game has great potential, and i cannot wait to see what they bring out next. I just hope that they realize that there is more to a co-op space game then just blowing up ships and stealing from one another.\n\n\nLonger Review\n\n\n"The 'Verse"\n\nThe universe, or just "'Verse" if you're a Firefly fan, is...i don't know! I have not ever had enough fuel to explore to the edge of the map: and that is only if there is one. All it says in on the Steam page is "A vast open universe".\n\nThis universe, untouched by the player, is filled with a few stations (each belonging to different companies with different purposes), and a lot of asteroid fields. In the future they want to include "Stellar phenomena, derelict stations and more". For now though i feel that asteroid fields and stations are sufficient because you can easily populate the world with ships and stations of your own design!\n\nAsteroid fields are not just floating conglomerates of rock: they are where you gather you mine your resources - and the process that the developers have in game is entertaining! To mine you first need a mining unit. These are placeable in the ship editor, or you can find them already on mining stations. From here you scroll through a screen showing all of the asteroids within a certain distance of the mining unit, and the resources they have inside of them. When you find one you like, you click on it, and then press "mine" (or whatever the button is!). You will see it brought inside of a square glass room where it is stripped apart by machines, and placed onto a platform next to you. It's freakin' cool to watch!\n\nThe list of current raw resources are as follows:\n\n- Iron\n- Copper\n- Silicon\n- Water/Ice\n- Zinc\n- Nitrogen\n- Carbon\n\nFrom here you can refine these resources into fuel, different types of metal, weapons/ammunition, and oxygen (the biggie). The process for refinement is also pretty cool to watch!\n\nThat about covers it for The 'Verse in my opinion, but if you have any questions, i'm sure someone would be more then happy to answer you!\n\n\nSpaceships\n\nI've noticed that not too many games get the management of spaceships right - but i feel that Interstellar Rift does, and the road it is taking to further develop the management process, is absolutely fantastic!\n\nThere is a long list of items and machinery that you can place inside a ship to make it both luxurious, and "alive". By alive i of course mean that it moves, provides power, doesn't slowly devoid you of oxygen...\n\nYou can really make spaceships as big as you want - but will you be able to move them? You really need to think about that. It may be a huge moving space station (essentially), but it will be nothing more then a station if you don't have the power necessary to move it. You need to be smart about how you build your ships. You need to make sure that it has the purpose you want it to have, the rooms/sections required, and also be workeable for your crew.\n\nA basic ship design requires the following: engines, batteries, shields (optional), a life support system, places to access the systems of your ship other then the cockpit, data cores, cargo space, a teleporter and a cockpit. But if you're anything like me, and you want to make a cool environment where people can roleplay, you will optionally include: bathrooms, med-bays, cafeterias/clubs/lounges, indoor forests, libraries, bedrooms, kitchens, work rooms, gun stations, ammunition rooms, observatories ect.\n\n(I've missed a few things here like sensors, beacons, ect.)\n\nRemember though, you will need to think logically about how you design your ship and everything it includes.\n\n\nCombat\n\nCombat right now is pretty simplistic. Once you are able to smash through a ship's/station's shields it's just about hitting it until you deplete it's armor. There are also only two types of weapons. Gun turrets, and mounted turrets (fired from the cockpit).\n\nRight now there is also no player-to-player combat: only ship-to-ship. What i mean by that is you can't board someone's ship and shoot them with a gun. Right now, if someone manages to get into your ship, you cannot stop them from stealing everything you have.\n\nThere are fun NPCs to kill though! In some Asteroid fields there are sentinels that will automatically engage your ship until you are out of range of the asteroid field, or if your ship is destroyed.\n\nThough the combat is pretty simplistic (at the moment), it is rather enjoyable. Depending on what section of the ship the bullets are hitting, you may know very well that you are being attacked, or you may just continue to enjoy your relaxation time on the toilets. You'll need to do a bit of running around (if it is just you), or you will have to make sure your engineers are keeping the power levels up, and that your gunners are doing what they need to be doing (saving your ♥♥♥♥!).\n\nInteractions\n\nInteractions with players is pretty decent right now. I stated in my overview that they have shown interest in roleplaying in game, and that is almost exclusively shown through the dialogue options. They have in place a global chat, a ship chat, and a whisper chat. They also have an emoting system in place! The only thing they really need now is a proximity chat!\n\n\nConclusion\nMy review is obviously limited to what i have actually done in game - and i am sure that I've missed out on some components of the game that are more important to other people. Simply understand that there is more to the game then what i have stated in my review!\n\nI greatly enjoy this game, and i cannot wait for the developers to take development further and show us what they can do. I hope that they give the roleplaying aspects love - because this game would be absolutely amazing for it!\n\nIt's still lacking in a lot of places, and not all of the components have a purpose yet, but the developers have assured us that they will soon.\n\nNot too good with ratings, but for what i enjoy in the game, i give this an 8/10!\n\n\nScreenshots\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=660490952\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=660614730\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=660696375\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=660614824","April 7","true","52.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Seriously, it's damn beautiful. Aside from it's visual appeal, the gameplay and mechanics are very solid too.They are complex enough to feel challenging and like I am actually building a spaceship, but not so overy complex that it's a pain to build anything.\nThe building in this game is unlike anything I have ever played before: it's amazing. There are many things that still need to be added, like light speed and warp speed, because trying to cross a galaxy takes a little while at sub light speed. At the time of this review, weapons and tools have not yet been implemented, but I hope they will live up to the rest of the content so far. There are many other ship devices and blocks planned as well.\nAs I have said before, the building looks and feels amazing, the best I've seen in any space game. It is extremely immersive and the non-pausing menu systems make me feel like I'm actually flying through the void of space, mining asteroids while my jukebox plays classical music in the cockpit upstairs.\n\nPros:\nAmazing ship editor\nExtremely immersive\nInteresting and unique menu systems\nAwesome mining, power, ventilation, and flight system\nMultiplayer and Singleplayer\nVery responsive and informative dev team\nConstant content and gameplay updates\nBeautiful graphics and art design\nCool and diverse music selection to play\nJukeboxes\n\nCons:\nNo first person combat (yet)\nI can't be a frikin space pirate!!! (yet)\nSometimes crashes during teleportation (maybe 1 out of 10 times)\nA somewhat steep learning curve (could be a pro, depending on what you like in games)\n\nIf you enjoy beautiful, immersive space games, buy this game right now. The combat is a little lack luster, but future updates should add to and refine it. I'd give this game a 9 out of 10. I've spent hours just building ships, mining asteroids, and sometimes just sitting at the window, watching as an asteroid tumbles silently past me though the vast emptiness of space.","January 31","true","29.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Now I have played space games, but this is my first time trying a game with quite an interesting yet complex ship editing system and a very expansive universe to set my ship into. If you play solo survival, or any of the online servers its a little bit of a rough start, especially when your realise that the ships you want to craft require silicon, so make sure your first ship doesn't contain silicon because you won't be able to get any in the starting area. Once you get a ship going, the rest of the journey is easy. Bugs in the game aren't ground breaking which is a good start, but there are bugs here and there, I mean what do you expect, its a early access game. Community is generally very friendly and the developers of the game are very supportive and try to help as much as they can to make your gameplay enjoyable. Now do I recommend you to buy this game at its pricetag...\nAbsolutely, it's honestly such a fun game to play, even if its on your own or with friends and I can see so much potential for this game to develop in the future.\nHope to see you guys in game!\n","February 3","true","153.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheOrangeZebraGaming/recommended/363360/","TheOrangeZebraGaming","TheOrangeZebra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheOrangeZebraGaming/","15 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n'Do you recommend this game' YES!!!! HOLY MOTHER OF GOD YES!!!! This is one of the most innovative and *slightly* addicting game I have ever played... I don't even care that Split Polygon hasn't released a Modding API yet. They don't even need to to keep me playing. The only really major downside to this game has nothing to do with the game's design... It's publicity, practically no-one has even heard of Interstellar Rift. But... I bet that as soon as this game gets the attention it deserves, it will be one of the most popular games of all time. This game is so good that I'd say that anyone who gives this game a bad review is probably just being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for no valid reason.\nThis game, no matter how awesome, is lacking a few features. Nothing deal breaking, but some I've got some tips for SplitPolygon (which I'll refer to as 'SP'):\n\nMore Workshop Support:\n\nThe game has workshop support already, but you know what I mean; Mods. Modding is something that IR needs, badly. Almost all the other features I'm going to present could be added by the community ourselves. I understand why SP won't release a Modding API, as IR is in Early Access, but KSH, the devs of Space Engineers took the risk, and it payed off MASSIVLY. Mods my from time to time lose compatiblity for the latest version of IR, but just do what SE did, have the mods semi-server-side, have the server owner add the mods to his/her server, and the server will cashe the list of those mods and semi-download them for each player. It would probably work beautifully.\n\nEscape pods and shuttles:\n\nEscape pods; the first version of an escape pod block (or maybe a first tier) could be just the pre-weapon update turret, before it had the gun pods. Implementing a docking system would be needed, and then make these act like small ships. These could also serve as one-person shuttle crafts, and in the editor, it would probably be in two parts: 'tier 1 shuttle craft port', and 'tier 1 escape pod', or something along those lines.\n\nDocking:\n\nAs I stated in the previous section, a docking system would be a great addition, as it would help make hangers to coordinate with the rest of your fleet; no more need to stop the entire fleet when one member has to log-off just so he knows where the rest of the fleet is. Just dock up, and your ship is with the rest of the fleet when you log back on. This could also make in-ship combat more plausible, as the best way to get resources is to board the ship, not destroy it. The current way to combat this boarding system is simple, yet impossible to counteract; turn off the teleporter. If docking became a thing, you could attach docking ports, and force the other door open. Docking could also help with trade, as servers with a lot of ships does bad things to TPs, such as failure to teleport, super delayed teleport, and game crashes. Docking could fix this by, instead of unloading and reloading nearby ships, it just semi-locks to ship meshes together, like the SE connector block, and thus making the transition between two ship seemless while still making a forced disconnection possible (as in ripping the two docking ports apart while the doors aren't sealed depressurizing both ships, and sucking out players killing them instantly, making a glitch-EVA impossible. I say that because I know SP wants IR to be interior focused, not exterior).\n\nThe smaller option:\n\nWhat I mean by that is the ability to make smaller ships. Take the A-Wing replica, for example: It's absolutly massive, being nowhere near its actual size. I'm talking ships having the interior be the cockpit, and nothing else. This would also mean hangers. The kind where it depressurizes, the doors open, the ship comes in, the doors close, the hanger repressurizes, and the pilot of the ship get out and goes and gets some coffee out of the Mr. Coffee while more ships are being tracked by Mr. Radar, waiting for landing clearance. The addition of smaller blocks for 'cockpit interior' ships would allow actual fighters, not the 'fighters' that are in reality larger than Homeworld corvettes.\n\nVoice Communications:\n\nVoice Communications, or VOIP, would be an essential feature to implement into IR. It would make fleet operations possible, and player-based trade easier. It could help player-based diplomacy easier, by, for a small-scale example, allowing you to quickly utter a life-prolonging 'wait, don't shoot!' right before a soldier/hitman/disgruntled player pops you in the head with a pulse pistol.\n\nFTL:\n\nA system of 'Faster Than Light', or FTL, travel, would be a vital addition to IR, as, as of now, you can only go 1000 m/s (which is acually quite easy to achieve, just go solar!) However, even at 1000 m/s, it took me over five minutes to get to the Sentinel Security Systems Trade hub from the Hurles Co. Starting Station. A Hyperdrive, Wormhole Drive, or Warp Drive system would cut down a 1263.9Km trip from two hours in an average ship to two seconds. Of course, you would need the XYZ Coordinants to jump, otherwise you would be 'blind jumping'. Wait... That actually sounds like a good idea, not remembering the coords of your base, and having to manule-override the FTL controls to make a blind jump, not knowing where you'll end up. Of course, I used inspiration from Sliders (anyone remember that old ♥♥♥ TV show?) for that bit.\n\nIn-Ship Combat:\n\nI know this is already planned, but I have a few recommendations/suggestions for some handheld (and some not) weapons and tools, having to 3D print the guns and explosives or buy them from an S3 (S3 would be the best canitate to buy these from) kiosk, and the hacking/robots from a logicorp (as logicorp is the more techy megacorp) kiosk. These would be used to board and capture (and some destroy) the ships of an apposing faction/fleet and elimenate or capture their crews; multiple different rifles and pistols would be needed, being in multiple tiers, each tier being more expensive in both resources to make yourself, and credits to buy from S3 than the last. Explosives and charges would also be needed (for instance to, as I refered to in 'Docking' 'forcing open the other door' to breach 'Access Denied' doors, docking port doors. These weapons would obviously be in the 'Item' inventory bar, as SP probably wouldn't add a second toolbar just for cartriges (although it saves a lot of 'pain in the ♥♥♥' moments). Another suggestion for in-ship combat weapons/tools would be RCCVs (Remote Controlled Combat Vehicles) that wouldn't have any weapons that a player wouldn't, but would instead carry a player weapon/tool (you would need to add a 'robot assembly station' or something similar to assemble 3D printed parts and deploy them). These RCCVs could be appointed to hack something (as I'm sure that SP plans to add a player-held hacking tool that would connect to the target like the device manager but would take some time to finish hacking), torch open a door (if a welding/cutting torch is added), or just blast away at enemy combatants with an LMG, however, the armour needed to protect the electronics would weigh them down, and thus slow them down. These RCCVs could also be used for resource transportation (in which case they would stand for Remote Controlled Carrying Vehicles), and those Civie models would be much faster than a player, cheaper, but unarmoured, unable to carry a weapon (well, technically they could CARRY a weapon, but it would be in a box), and could only carry one box at a time.\n\nThat's all for now, but I'll edit this to add more when I think of some that need to be added.","March 24","true","46.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

I am impressed.\nA game I continue to recommend you get now.\n\nI have not tried online mode again since last review, honestly just having fun creating better ships and learning the editing tools to have an awesome ship by the time the game allows for more things to do like goals and missions. Creative mode is fun to explore and go crazy without worrying too much about resources.\n\nOne thing, building big ships if you dont use multiple small rooms, it can affect FPS and can cause game to briefly lag during editor mode, so stay away from creating one single gigantic room for entire ship.\n\nGood Game, TONS OF BUGS. (edit: okay it seems to get better)\n\nBug List:\nGame crashes on exit.\nExtreme lag on the servers oftenly\nLag causes resources to disappear while in the middle of transferring them. Sometimes Lag causes extra resources to be picked up. For example I kept clicking on a block of carbon and got back 10 blocks by the time the lag was done\n\nBiggest con: Not enough stable servers\n\n\nPros:\n\nGame runs good when it does, very fun, its nice to just build, mine and explore. Unfortunately I haven't found a way to build a vault on the ship. And unfortunately there is not a whole lot to do once you build a ship with everything on it, you can mine and sell resources or build another ship, but that's all just busy work, not really fun.","December 3, 2015","true","50.7"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","2"

You build ships, stations, and mine.  Right now the world is huge, but lightly populated (around 100km).  The only limit to building is your imagination and patience.  There is a learning curve for most things and balancing, weight, power, engergy use, etc. can be a challenge in itself.  Sure you can make a beautiful looking ship, but it may never go over 10m/s or worse, not even move.  Also damage is a thing, however its in a very early state and can only happen by bad flying with and without shields.\n\nOn the downside though, there are several bugs that do harm the total experience, crashing, and even save deleting ones (although somewhat rare).\n\nThere are plans to add a lot more to this game and I will add to the review as they do.  There will be trading, world (universe) will have more in it, combat, NPCs, etc.\n\nShould you get this game??  Well that depends, do you like to build stuff?  If so then you will probably enjoy this game.  If you are looking for more (like combat, trading, exploring) then I would say wait.\n\nAlso the devs are very active in the forums and answer most questions...\n\n0.1.4a Review....\n\nGame is just getting better, now the world spawn are unlimited, no more 100k limit.  Also some random station spawn too, much nicer now..\n\n0.1.5\nThe game is getting better and better with the newer updates.  They seem to be getting quite a few of the bugs fixed.  The addition of upgrade parts, more things to mine, enemies (although AI is basic and really deadly if your not careful) around supposed good asteriod fields is a nice touch.  The trading is basic and upgrade units can only be made or found.  So far they cannot be sold, only stored in lockers or thrown out in space (trading station selling is coming).\n\nI would still hold off on the game for most people, still lots of work to be done, online is still a little touch and go with griefers (all games have that when PVP gets into them).\n\nThe building is pretty good, although with some updates you may have to rebuild some parts of your ship because of changes, functions change or part changes.","August 2, 2015","false","289.8"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","13","22","0","7"

Then, I gave it a try... and I don't regret I did it. The game is still in alpha, but it is awesome and full of potential. For the ones who remember, this game resembles "Battlecruiser Millenium", where you had to manage a ship, fly it, engage in combats, etc. The difference: at that game, everything was too complicated and too full of numbers; here at Interstellar Rift, things are way easier and - best of all - first person.\n\nYou build your ship (in an editor, not in real time) and run it. The game lets you build your ship from scratch or edit a pre-existing model, and the building scheme is NOT voxel-based, just look like it. It seems a bit boring at first glance, but when you notice you are building a custom ship which you will be piloting, you become involved in a quest for the excellent ship for your needs.\n\nAfter that, you gather ingame resources by operating machines (a miner - called extractor - and a refinery to smelt the ores) in your starting space station to build your ship. The amount varies according to the mass (the size) of your ship, with each component included in ship's design adding to the total. In case you are not prepared for this, you can simply purchase an initial ship with your initial U-nits (ingame currency) and begin piloting immediately.\n\nDepending on the size of your ship, the game becomes better played with a crew. Player Community seems to be a bit shy at the moment, since we can't easily find a crew, but as I said, you can fly your ship alone. In fact, it seems the game is still growing and that everyone wants his own ship, so that's why we still need some time to let things settle down.\n\nThe game is enjoyable in its current state. The staff is present in forums and due to game updates we can see they are working hard to make a great game, fixing bugs and including content. Despite of the ships "blocky appearence", the graphics are very good (in fact, only ships are blocky, ship interiors are very detailed). The price is great for an early development title.

You design a ship in the designer with countless amount of interior and exterior blocks. The game is currently using solar and hydrogen power along with batteries, power cells and power banks which all have their own way of storing and discharging power. You can manage power systems to make networks that are independent. Let's say you want to connec the oxygen generator to solar panels and make it independent of fuel, you can do that. There are different kinds of generators and shields and you can even hack ships and boost your oen ship with cartridges. You can disable an enemy's life support or gain access to the ship.\nThere are alot of ores in the game which you can trade and use to make stuff. The ability to destroy stations with weapons is nice. It will also decrease your reputation with that company and increase your reputation with another.","March 19","true","55.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's extremely well made. My Only gripe is sometimes the servers are not up 24/7 and the ones that are have serious lag problems - that's NOT the game's fault tho - it runs fine on the Official Split Polygon Servers (which is usually up *almost* around the clock). Additionally Recent Patches have added in-game ship-to-ship hacking and have further polished the beginner's experience. This game was good when it first came on Early Access. It's getting better every patch - and while the patches sometimes bring their own bugs the devs respond quickly to bug reports and the like. They clearly care about their game as much as I do.\n\n*END EDIT*\n\nThis review was written the day the 1.2 Alpha Patch Came out.\n\nAlthough this game is largely incomplete, I for one, can see enormous potential in this one. To those of you who dream of making a life aboard a ship in the middle of a sea of stars this could be a game with good potential. It is different than some games that deal with Space Sandboxism, instead of being an astronaut on some jetpack ride or a pilot who sees solely through the eyes of his cockpit, this game has chosen to create somewhat of an inbetween. The game (currently) doesn't support EVA; I don't think this is planned either; HOWEVER - what it does deliver is the ability to completely walk around (and if promises are worth anything eventually have combat in, among other things) inside ships and stations and pilot them from a Truly 1st Person perspective. Normally I don't like First Person Games, I like to see my character moving around; however this game might well be another to the exception list (which currently includes PlanetSide 2, and no real other games); The Computer Screens are almost worth buying the game alone for, they interface directly from a 1st Person pespective, and are touch-sensitive(ie clickable inside the screen for different options) to the mouse. The Game's resource system is crude at the moment but also holds a great deal of potential. Seeing as it's in early alpha the devs have choosen to release it at a reduced price until they feel it reaches a suitable developmental level to call for a higher price. With the way Kerbal Space Program, Space Engineers, and other games have raised their prices over-time as they became more developed, I see this as an investment oppurtunity - the ability to buy it now and see what happens; So at the current time the game does lack a great deal of features. Just of this patch the damage and shield systems were installed on ship-based level. Weapons I assume are a forthcoming project but you can now lose your ships to collisions. Additionally the sense of immersion is very high in this game, you can see out the windows on foot to the ships outside, and you can see from a perspective that changes based on your ships rotation (for those saying these are exterior map rooms I say Hah! - that ain't no off map room; if it is it might as well be linked on every level to the interior from the exterior which if I say so myself is alot more work than just creating a floating room in space itself; they may look like they're seperate maps to some people but largely they are one and the same, just one "room" is travelling through the other) But yeah they even have collision hud shakes now, that's awesome considering for the last few patches pretty much the only thing that could kill you was oxygen. My Advice? Even if you don't want to play this game in it's current state go ahead and buy a copy now while the price is low and hold on to it until the game is closer to completion. This one has real potential people; let's see if it can fulfill it.","July 22, 2015","true","185.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

I would not say it is anywhere close to beta yet. Directions on gameplay are scant, and it took me a while to realize that not only is it a keyboard and mouse only game, but that excludes trackballs as well if it doesn't have a scroll wheel. Without the scroll wheel, you can't rotate the ship you're building. I would change that "feature". Something else I would change is adding in gamepad support. Also, when I run a game in solo galaxy mode with the admin feature on, I couldn't get my ship to power up for nothing. Without admin faeture on, I can power my ship, but I spent my whole time keeping hydrogen in the mining station tanks to keep the teleporters working. So maintaining a couple space stations is not practical for solo mode. Probably a great thing for multiplayer. I would change that too. Make it so that stations auto mine and process water, then send the hydrogen to the tanks. Maybe adding in some in-game explanations of objects and what they do would be helpful.","July 9, 2015","true","4.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game is not feature rich yet.  But the current release is capable of keeping you glued for at least 40 hours, if not more.  The first thing you will notice about the game is its polish.  Graphics are crisp.  Every component is graphically rich.  Additionally, nearly everything in the game has visual feedback.  Great sounds.  And you only need a very limited number of keyboard controls.  Which makes playing the game extremely easy to navigate and use.\n\nThe game is similar to other build games such as Homebrew which doesn't use a sanbox-style building process.  This has its advantages because the game runs extremely smooth; even on *slightly lower than recomended* machines.  However, keeping in mind that it is still early and the game content, and power requirements may/will increase.\n\nOne aspect of the game that I personally like is that it allows you to control the electrical system for ships you create (as well as oxygen system and weapons system).  But, the electrical system aspect of the game is still in infancy and controlling the electrical system can have very adverse affects.   Additionally, There's *magic* in the game for certain things right now, such as lights, they don't require power to be ON but machinery does.   The components used within the electrical system allows you to configure build extremes at both ends of the spectrum: hydrogen vs solar.  Or a combination thereof.\n\nThe building aspects are not very complex.  You build the ship from pre-built components, called props.  Although they require refined ore material to build, the build system is at a high-level: it will not provide any physical building aspects or build-states.  This means that any changes to anything on the ship, such as removing 1 block, requires a complete re-building of the ship.  This has advantages since you get a pretty optimized ship for use and the salvager is smart enough to store your cargo.  Certain components can be placed multiple times into a single block which provides a huge savings of space.  You are encouraged to scale-up rather than accross.\n\nIn terms of the building aspect of the exterior, the number of blocks available is fantastic and you can create very nice looking exteriors.  The editor adds exterior blocks automatically, which can be slightly strange to get used to at first.  Especially since those automatically added blocks are not identified differently from your own blocks.  The game does force you (in an immersive way) to manage your galaxy.  Perform basic design considerations, manage oxygen, fuel, mining, refining and storing of resources.  Lastly, The game does not suffer from too many stability issues.  You will get an occassional crash when using the Ship Editor.  As a warning to newcomers, try to use the Ship Editor separate from your game galaxy to avoid adverse affects.  However, the game now provides automatic backup of your game galaxy in case a crash wipes your save (which it did to me with 80 hours worth of refined ore).\n\nShip flight feels very good.  Due to the game being set under a first person view, the immersion associated with flight is quite unique.  You *feel* like you are actually traveling/flying.  The ship controls are natural, easy to use, has a *freeflight* mode which removes having to use UDLR keyboard buttons.

The interior design is very well done even at this early access stage, allowing great customisation and huge ships. The interior design allows for various colour schemes, furniture, necessary systems, different rooms, multiple floors and more. It would be nice to see more furniture options, more walls, lights etc.\n\nThe exterior design is not nearly as in-depth as the interior however. The exterior has one colour, and looks very blocky, even when smoothing by using various block types to create a nice flowing exterior design. It would be nice to see varying aesthetic designs for colours or insignias on the exterior.\n\nCurrently, there is not much to do outside of building ships and testing them. There are no tutorials ingame, and the tutorials online seem to miss out some vital aspects, such as power distribution. I'd recommend the game if you're willing to go into it ready for trial and error.\n\nThere is a LOT of potential, and this game can only get better and better.","September 20, 2015","true","19.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There is many different props to add so you can have a good looking ship or space station which i want to intend to build. They also have looting crates, teleporters, advanced doors, elivators, chairs, plants, powerplants - which also need another generator to reciewe the power and many other kind of windows and wall & lightning, systems for air and health so we can breath and much more. Keep in mind that they aswell have a buttom so you can check where and how much light you have all over the place. Besides this, you can aswell colour everything.

Or just lack having a great deal of friends that are all going to jump onto a game like this and play... Minecraft was a huge win but only becuase the vastness of the exploration details were on cue from the moment the game came to fruition. I tend to stay true to this game but its nothing more than a grindfest so that you can build the ship you made. Thats it, nothing more. I have played with maybe 3 or 4 of my friends on this game but we can't keep consistent. Its sadly like many of the others in this genere, going to most likley hit a point where develeopment can't advance the game becuase there is a lack in dynamics from the beginning.\n\nIt has no solo play capability beyond the ship building and NPC AI isn't going to give back to that much at all. I am a huge fan of these types of games but no one has really hit the mark. They all just copy themselves and do a poor job while they are at it.\n\n\nWould I get a refund if I could? Yes...

I like a game where you go out and fly, not have to order fuel and oxyegn every single time out. The game is slow, they think in space you have to travel at car speeds, like 100+ MPH to get somewhere, silly at best. The engines they use gobble fuel, even idling, so you cant conserve even when sitting mining...if you ever get that far. Building your ship? Its done 1 room at a time, and the ship itself needs every single piece of technology from lifesupport to floors, ceilings and fans before its done. I dont have thnd of patience, so I donated my money to help the devs buy pizza while they try and understand why this game isnt as popular as they ahd hoped.

None of which are implemented yet.  According to the devs they have no real roadmap for development yet, they are waiting for community imput.  I would really wait for a year to see if this game is not just another EA cash grab, that is what it feels like right now.","June 27, 2015","false","2.6"," 17 of 47 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","17","47","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SergalianGeneral/recommended/363360/","SergalianGeneral","True Sergal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SergalianGeneral/","74 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBEFORE YOU PULL THE AGE-OLD 'THIS GUY HAS NO GAME TIME', I GOT THIS GAME BEFORE THE DEVS DECIDED TO SHILL IT OUT FOR WHATEVER AMOUNT THEY DECIDED. I DON'T FEEL LIKE CHECKING IT. I HAVE PLAYED THIS GAME SINCE 2014 AND HAVE KEPT UP WITH IT'S DEVELOPEMENT SINCE LATE 2013. I HAVE THE RIGHT TO WRITE A REVIEW.\n\nEver since I played this back in 2014, it feels like nothing has changed in an agreeable length of time. In one year, all that's been added are pip-boy knockoffs. You can't go down to the planet, you can't go to another planet, you're basically limited to a giant box and I don't see them changing engines to allow an infinite play-space. Even Centration has a faster (Albeit released onto Early Access WAY too early) dev team. Pulsar: Lost Colony has a faster dev team. I'd almost be alright with saying that even Star Citizen has a faster dev team. Don't tell me I can't use other games and devs in relation to this.\n\nSecond, pricing. Is this game really worth whatever no-doubt plenty of people spent? A game that has little to no replayability, regardless of 'Early Access'? I don't care if it's subject to change, you're not talking months, you're pointing at a potentially indefinite 'From now until the end of it's early access'. These guys haven't even coded in a flashlight. In a space game. With dark, pitch-black-at-some-points maintenance hallways. In Unity 5. That HAS A PRE-MADE FLASHLIGHT, FOR FREE. They won't change anything, they're not going to fix the 6-months-and-counting bug involving the storage boxes floating, or the asteroids flying through the ship, or the ship going absolutely-batshit-crazy when you put >250 pieces onto a ship. And don't get me started on the fact the door UI was removed right after they released this 'game' on early access. Or the elevators being entirely removed, for that matter.\n\nDon't call me a troll because you dislike my message, don't downvote me over the fact I disagree with you. You only prove how biased you are towards a game I cannot like because the devs want to reach for a more financial incentive when they can't even code in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ flashlight, or even BASIC PHYSICS for BASIC ASTEROIDS.\n\nWhy is it Early Access allows these things? These games that have maybe 4 months of actual coding work done in nearly 3-4 years of development? A logo shouldn't be better than the game itself. A game shouldn't remove features it already has when there is literally nothing wrong with them.\n\nI'm done. And this review isn't going to get changed.","June 30, 2015","false","0.1"," 30 of 80 people (38%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","38","30","80","8","8"

Game starts and throws u on a ship with no idea what to do. If you have patience enough to watch youtube videos and spend a couple hours figuring out the ship editor then you will most likely enjoy it. I just think its kinda lazy to release a game with no manual and/or tutorial. I should not have to go on youtube if I paid 15 bucks for your game","August 28, 2015","false","0.3"," 5 of 24 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","5","24","0","12"
