It was such a lovely adventure, I wish it was at least twice as long! The dialogue never stops being funny, and you'll want to say "Awhh, Robeeeert"...and pat little Robert on the head every time his clueless behaviour makes you chuckle. And you will laugh. A lot. Puzzles are not incredibly hard, and the hint system provides you with enough info if, for example, you're actually missing an object (oh, pixel hunting :) ). The story is good, the characters are hilarious with great voice-acting, and Robert... well, he's just a sweet little boy who goes on an adventure! I'm hoping for a sequel actually, only cause I loved the main character so very much!\n\nPlus, you can sing with your nose!\n","February 2, 2015","true","6.1"," 38 of 41 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","38","41","2","0"

Phenomenal voice acting, cute characters, charming dialogue, good puzzles, and just an overall fun experience watching the characters try to save their people.\n\nWe begin with Robert, an orphaned boy who is being raised by a man named Conroy. Conroy is the ruler of this little world of Asposia, and right away, as you can in all animated tales, we realize that Conroy isn't the nicest of fellows. In fact, he seems like a downright meanie. :P One day while Robert is playing his flute nose (yes, I said flute nose) for Conroy in his favorite 1 note tune, a pigeon that Robert has been playing with as one of his only friends comes in and steals Conroy's necklace and flies off. Robert, being the ever dutiful 'son' goes after it and finds himself down in the city of Asposia with all the peasants for the first time outside the walls of Conroy's castle. His adventure is ready to begin...\n\nRobert soon meets residents of Asposia and quickly starts to realize that Conroy may not be the great hero that he was raised to believe he was. Most importantly he meets Laura. A wanted thief, general troublemaker, obvious anti-establishment hero, and the girl of Robert's dreams. Robert is incredibly naive, but falls in love with Laura at first site. She is more worldy and they play off one another fantastically as she teases him and he shows his innocence again and again as a kind and generous boy. Their conversations are great, and Robert is pretty funny no matter how innocent he is.\n\nI didn't find any issues with the game UI, or the puzzle mechanics. They are the standard hover over the bottom of the screen to pop up the item menu, with options to drag them to world objects, combine them, etc. Some of the puzzles are a bit strange and take some trial and error of jsut screwing aroudn finding what items interact with things, but overalll they aren't too illogical most of the time. The game has a few loading screens between areas that on my medium level PC took about 3 seconds to load wasn't a problem for me.\n\nI had no bugs in the game that I can recall. Certainly nothing that made me stop, although the save system is not one that is the type to be friendly for Achievement hunters. The game can be saved manually, or using auto-saves, BUT you don't have a choice about where you save other than picking a slot for your current game. So you have one save and if it auto-saves and you miss an Achievement you will have to start the game over. So...if 100% Achievements is your goal then you better take a look at some Achievements guides BEFORE starting. There are a few that are full game achievements and a couple of them contradict. One side is really easy and can be gotten with a quick restart early on, but the other requires the full game to be played a certain way so you want to make sure you understand these early on before finding out halfway through you will have to play all the way through again.\n\nGame is probalby anywhere from 6-10 hours long. My playtime is longer because I left the game on for 12 hours one day. :)\n\nIf you are a fan of point and click adventure games, love games such as the ones made by Daedelic, love cute and adorable characters with phenomenal voice acting, then The Inner World is a fantastic game for you. While this is an Indie studio, and this is their first major game, I consider this adventure game to be as good as any of the Daedelic games I have played. It definitely could be considered as comparable in quality to those. I highly recommend it to any adventure fan. I loved the characters and would love to see more from this studio.\n\nBringing me to this...\n\nNOTE: While looking at videos for The Inner World on Youtube I noticed this trailer from 2013 that suggested there might be an animated cartoon coming called 'The Inner World', but I ahve found no other news about it. I would have definitely watched, but it gives you a pretty good idea about the voice acting in the game as it is similar to this cartoon. If anyone knows anything else about this animated series I would be interested. :)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STsqPrG8L7E","August 31, 2015","true","24.6"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","31","33","4","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/251430/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Big things can sometimes come in unassuming packages, and not all adventures have to feature innovative control schemes or frightening scare tactics. There is still plenty of room for traditional point-and-click games that impress by doing what’s been done so often before, but doing it very well. The Inner World is that kind of game: a classic adventure whose hand-drawn, cartoony art style will appeal to young gamers, but whose humor, story, and puzzles will keep even veterans of the genre entertained as well. In short, it’s a game that the entire family can truly enjoy together.\n\nSpeaking of big things in small packages, little Robert is a novice at the Wind Temple of Asposia and court musician to Abbott Conroy, its resident wind monk. Robert has spent his whole life sheltered under the watchful eye of Conroy, unaware of the dire straits his world finds itself in. You see, Asposia is a world within a world, surrounded on all sides by rock. Wind inexplicably entering through the three wind fountains has become the hidden world’s life force; without it there's no light, and industry, trade, even Asposia’s very existence would come to a grinding halt.\n\nAnd wind is exactly what’s running out. Years ago, the Basylians – angry wind gods who control the wind fountains – became displeased with the Asposians, and since then they’ve been on a rampage, petrifying all they gaze upon while the wind fountains slowly dry up. Robert isn’t the kind of hero to set out on a grand quest to save his world. Rather, he begins merely by chasing a thieving pigeon into a dirty, trash-choked back alley. Before long, he meets the charismatic Laura, a girl searching for her missing father. Following the cryptic clues he left behind for her, Laura not only believes that her father is still alive somewhere, but that he holds the key to discovering a secret wind fountain. Initially an unwilling participant, Robert is pulled into a tale of civil unrest in his own coming-of-age adventure. And if he plays his cards right, he just might learn how to save the world and impress the girl in the process.\n\nStudio Fizbin, newcomer to the adventure scene, has crafted a charming, player-friendly experience. The game sports high presentation values, chiefly in its hand-drawn animation resembling Saturday morning TV cartoons. It eschews realism for a stylized fantasy world filled with creatures that draw their inspiration straight from a child’s storybook. Most resemble crosses between two animals, like the tumble mice that look like miniature-sized sheep, or the monkey-like wooloofs. Even the Asposians themselves sport an imaginative look, their distinguishing feature a striped, pointed nose – all but Robert, whose nose is plain and lined with holes, allowing him to play it like a flute. Playing as Robert, you’ll have a chance to explore the throne room of Conroy’s castle, brave the dangers of  a trap-laden root forest, find an underground laboratory, and uncover the secret of the lost wind fountain.\n\nAlong with the clean, colorful art style comes painless navigation and an easy-to-use inventory system. Mousing over an object brings up clickable options, generally things like “Look”, “Take” or “Talk to”. The inventory, popping up when the cursor approaches the bottom of the screen, is unobtrusive; click and drag an item where you’d like to use it, or onto another object to combine them. Items in your inventory, as well as possible dialog options during conversations, are visually represented by button-like picture icons. Holding the mouse button down will cause all on-screen hotspots to appear, avoiding the need for pixel hunting and making it a snap to find any vital items you may have missed previously.\n\nThe audio is equally pleasant, with a catchy title theme that perfectly fits the fantastical world, followed by equally good music throughout the game. Voice acting, however, is more of a mixed bag. Most characters sound fine, like Abbott Conroy’s gruff, authoritative baritone and the plucky, rebellious attitude of Laura, Robert's partner in stirring up civil unrest – wanted for such crimes as chewing gum in public. Several minor characters also work flawlessly, and the narrator’s smooth solemnity was a great choice. On the other hand, a few characters get decidedly too much game-time, their voices grating on the nerves, like Detze, a little boy with the painfully obvious adult male falsetto. The most unfortunate voiceover comes from Robert himself; while his flaccid, wispy lack of authority seems fitting at first, it quickly becomes tedious as even describing objects in the environment sounds like an overwhelming task for him.\n\nPerhaps one of the only turn-offs of the game is the sheer amount of dialog to slog through. Not that there are walls of text, but most dialog options require upwards of three or four separate clicks to exhaust completely. Most of these conversations deliver a bit of comedy, fill in some backstory, or simply offer some light-hearted flavor. But anyone who would like to get to the point without starting the same conversation four separate times may get impatient.\n\nThe Inner World's gameplay does not attempt any innovation, relying instead on the tried-and-true, point-and-click formula. However, the complexity of the inventory puzzles ramps up quite significantly after the first chapter or two, providing a gentle learning curve early on but keeping things challenging in later chapters. Even with their increased difficulty, the puzzles remain logical, and can always be solved with a minimum of trial and error.\n\nI quite enjoyed the creativity the designers employed in implementing the puzzles. In one scene it becomes clear that Robert needs to bake something. A recipe is easily procured, but finding an oven, making it work, and gathering suitable ingredients proves to be quite a bit more challenging, involving a solution spread out over various screens, gathering and using other items in unconventional ways in order to finally succeed. Of course, without staples such as flour or sugar, one truly has to think outside the box to make this work.\n\nThough each chapter consists of no more than a handful of locations, there are a surprising number of tasks in each segment that must be accomplished before proceeding. Each area typically has a clear goal to accomplish, apparent from the beginning of the chapter, whether unlocking a specific door, retrieving a valuable item, or stopping a piece of machinery. Very few situations, however, have a quick solution. If anything, it feels overwhelming on occasion trying to figure out where to begin sorting through the mess of tasks at hand; sometimes simply discovering what obstacle I was supposed to overcome was enough to set me on the path to resolving it. This was the only time I was ever forced to resort to the hint system.\n\nOverall, The Inner World is a stylish old-school, point-and-click adventure, and savoring the world and all its little details should provide plenty of play time. It doesn’t break any new ground – nor does it ever seek to – but what it does it does well. Puzzles are a highlight, advancing in complexity from simple to vexing, and the world itself is sure to become a favorite locale to many who visit it. Warm and colorful, the characters have a way of growing on you, and even some spotty voice acting proves more of an annoyance than a game breaker. If games steeped in darkness and shadows are your thing, or if you’re looking for a fast-paced thrill ride, you'll have to look elsewhere. But if a leisurely coming-of-age tale with a bit of humor for the whole family sounds good, you may well want to take the trip to Asposia. You're very likely to enjoy your stay, and that's not just a lot of hot air.","January 11","true","15.0"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","24","25","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/recommended/251430/","noibn","noibn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/","1756 products in account","As modern point and click adventure games go, this one is fairly decent. It's not a mind-blowing experience by any means, but it's definitely not bad either. You play as a guy named Robert who finds himself thrust into a quest to save the world (naturally). Robert is a very naive and unassuming sort of fella, so a lot of the plot and humor centers around his clueless innocence. The story and dialogue is fairly good for the most part, in turns charming, funny and dark. The voice acting is hit or miss, though - mostly it is decent, but a few lines here and there are inexplicably bad (wrong pronunciations, improper emphasis of words, etc). Mechanically, the game also has its ups and downs. Being a point and click game, you would think that the pointing and clicking would be spot-on, but that's not always the case. Sometimes you can't click on things that you should be able to click (though it usually fixes itself in a second or two). Additionally, half of the achievements don't seem to be working properly. However, the developers have started to release patches to fix some of these problems, so a lot of these things may not be issues in the future. Regardless, none of these faults are deal breakers by any means, anyways.\n\nThe puzzles are fairly standard in adventure game terms. You basically just go around talking to people, picking up objects, and using those objects (or combinations thereof) to solve puzzles and progress further. Thankfully, none of the solutions are overly ridiculous or unintuitive (as is the case with many adventure games), though you will need to really think some stuff through from time to time. Apparently there is also a help system in place if you need it (which I didn't even realize until after finishing the game), so you probably won't ever get stuck for long, if you even get stuck at all. The game is divided into 5 chapters, each of which consists of a self-contained series of puzzles that take place on 3 or 4 "screens". Playtime is probably around 7-8 hours or so, give or take. So keep that in mind in terms of how much you are willing to pay. All in all, the game is pretty good. As I said earlier, it is nothing mind-blowing for the genre, but it's a nice experience while it lasts. Probably the worst thing I could say about it (aside from the minor glitches noted above) is that the pacing is very slow. The dialogue in particular seems like it takes foreeeeeeeever sometimes, especially with a main character who is so low-key and slow. The pace may test your patience at times. But if you don't mind that and are into classic adventure games, this is probably worth a look at some point. I would probably recommend waiting for a sale, though, unless you are hardcore into adventure games and need something new to play now.","October 11, 2013","true","7.4"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","24","29","0","0"

This one might be a little long, sorry guys!\n\nI tend to be very on or off with point and clicks, It doesn't happen very often that i get into a game of this genre, don't get bored half way through, and actually manage to get to the end of it.\n\nThe tendency with this genre for me is that if they don't flow well enough, if i get stuck on obscure item combinations (which happens a lot with point and clicks) or if it's just not interesting enough, i'll give up and not bother going back to it. This is one point and click game however that i am happy to say that not only could i actually bare to get through it, but it's actually a really good game. It's been the best point and click game i have played since the Deponia series, which i adored.\n\nIn ways, this game reminded me a little of that series. I guess in just style and art. I was actually somewhat convinced whilst playing that it might be by Daedalic Entertainment, but alas it's not!\n\nAdmittedly when i first started playing this, i thought it was quite slow (maybe i was just in a particularly impatient mood that day?). The dialog seemed like it was paced too slowly and i was generally dreading the trek ahead to completing this game. Although I'm glad to say i changed my mind very quickly with that one.\n\nThe story is very inventive and i found it quite interesting. The game was fun to play through and the ending was definitely not disappointing. I think i can safely say that it's not the plot twist of the century, but it's not entirely predictable either. Either way it was great to see things unfold and i loved the creativity and humor involved.\n\nIn terms of characters, I love them. There are some very lovable characters in this game. Including our main star Robert. A well mannered, polite, silly and somewhat naive little Asposian.\n\nThe graphics are nice. It's very soft, light and nice on the eyes. A light-hearted, hand-drawn and cartoon-like style. With that said, i did have a few problems with crashing/freezing. Sometimes the loading screen between chapters just wouldn't load. It was usually fine because the game tends to autosave before the "end of chapter" cutscene. So you don't really lose anything, but it's still a minor annoyance having to reboot the game.\nI found that if you tended to not move or click anything whilst the cutscene was playing or it was trying to load, it'd usually load fine. If you pressed buttons and clicked your mouse, that's when it tended to have a hard time and freeze.\n\nThat being the only negative thing out of the way, back to the positive stuff!\nThe help system in this  is quite good. I usually try not to use hints whenever i can, but being stuck on something for a long while gets a bit frustrating. I was quite impressed with the hint system, I wanted to see how many hints it would give you and how obvious they'd be. It gives you a few little nudges in the right direction before just spelling it out to you. Plus, you still don't get it? It'll spell it out to you even more blatantly. Literally to the point of "Go pick this thing up over there, and use it on this".\n\nLastly, achievements!\nThis one is pretty easy to complete 100% and i think my method for doing so was a decent way of doing it.\nI basically started a game file (it allows you up to 3), I played through a chapter, then went back to the main menu and started a second game for missed achievements throughout each chapter. Every time i would complete a chapter in my main save, i'd go back to the secondary save to complete it again whilst getting any missed achievements.\nThe chapters aren't too long and once you know what you are doing going back and getting the missables in a second game file isn't as tedious as it sounds.\nThere is one lonesome guide for this game that details "missable achievements" you can either read the names/descriptions and try to figure yourself how to get them, or you could just use the guide to know what to do. (In my opinion it's fairly easy to figure out how to get them just from reading the title or description)\nAlso, there are a few achievements that having two saves actually makes it easier. For example, there is one achievement for not using the guide at all and one for using the guide frequently. So either way really, you'd have to play it twice.\n\nAll in all i really loved this game and i'm glad i decided to have a go with it. If you're a fan of the genre i would definitely recommend it to you.\n\n\nTL;DR :  It's great, seriously. The story is inventive, it's fun and humorous. If you are a fan of the genre then definitely try it.\n","January 13","true","8.5"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","2"

Unfortunately my heart was broken not too long after.\n\nThe good: main character is lovable and a great vehicle for humor; great artwork; original, quirky setting; adorable critters with criminally too little screentime, like Peck, and the Gorfs have a welcome Adams-esque touch; the voicework solid and the music very nice, although the wind theme is oddly reminiscent of Oldboy's waltz (not complaining); the built-in hint system is extensive (luckily!).\n\nThe bad: I'd be hard pressed to name another recent adventure game so badly affected by moon logic: the gameplay hardly ever takes off, probably an attempt to squeeze length out of the assets. It's a mobile port, mostly workable, but leaving a room/location brings up a loading screen which is unbelievably slow, like the transitions in the UI. The story is functional at best, giving most characters some sort of motive, but is ultimately weak. Playing as Laura, in Chapter 2, she's just so whingy! The animations are far from smooth and the cutscenes often are lacking in detail. The translation, by virtue of being generally of good quality, makes the dozen or so non sequiturs stand out.\n\nRecommended? tough call. On one side, it would have maybe worked better as a short animated film, for (too) much of my playing time I just wished I had watched a Let's Play instead.

It is the kind of point ‘n’ click adventure that doesn’t shy away from ludicrous puzzles, but gives you a really unique storytelling experience in return.\n\nIt takes place inside a world where natural laws differ greatly from ours. An alien planet which seems quite “human” in some respects, but different enough to leave the door open for creativity, imagination, and overall good writing.\nYou play a very naïve, shy hero, whose day starts off with a seemingly small accident, but he soon finds himself in a revolution against an oppressing religious dictator for the control of the most precious commodity: air. Don’t expect the usual story development though, because the plot has a few clever tricks along the way.\nThe cast is quite small, but even the supporting members are enjoyably memorable. The voice actors do a decent job, but nothing spectacular.\n\nAs an adventure game, it is moderately difficult. The item usage follows a really weird and twisted logic, but it is not completely impossible. (Plus it has a step-by-step hint system as backup.) Thanks to this, the play time can easily be pushed over 6-7 hours, which is fairly decent for this price category.","July 6, 2015","true","8.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It's just a shame it's so damn short compared to the titles I remember from the older days.\n\nHighlights\nThe writing, characters, world and art-style are all important things for Point & Clicks, and The Inner World gets all of them right. Due to the short length of the game the characters don't really develop, but they mostly have enough backstory and care of writing to have more than one dimension. They all have reasons for doing what they're doing and even short interactions like helping the character involve a motivation of some kind that you don't see written into too many games these days.\nThe world is rich and interesting and again, thought and care and good writing have gone hand in hand to create a diverse landscape with enough character to feel immersive. The art-style is friendly but layered enough to add time and history, and importance where it's due.\n\nMistakes and Annoyances\nMy biggest complaint with The Inner World is the short length and lack of content. Although it's well written and shines as an upbeat story, with only 3 memorable characters and a couple of protagonists and a handful of areas it just doesn't have enough content to explore and ultimately feels rather shallow. As a result it's good value for money when on sale, but is hard to recommend at full price because of the low level of content to explore.\n\nSome may find this far too easy, and at times I think it feels a little too casual, as though you're merely exploring an interactive artbook rather than solving puzzles and furthering the story with gameplay, but these moments are sparse and unless you have a hard time investing in the story or characters, or don't enjoy the writing then you'll find plenty of joy in just exploring what's here, nevermind solving the puzzles.\n\nOther than that The Inner World really doesn't have anything to criticise. There are a couple of sections where it's not particularly intuitive on how to progress, and the age old Point-and-Click problem of disjointed solutions becomes apparant, but these are mitigated by the wonderful hint system and become easy to overlook.\nPerhaps you could complain the small extra content game unlocked after playing isn't fun and essentially pointless, but that's hardly a compelling reason against buying the game.\n\nRecommendations\nPriced on Steam at £11.99/$14.99/13.99€, The Inner World clocks in at a typical 7-8 hours of gameplay, and has enough charm and dimensions to warrant an additional playthrough or two down the line. It's very fairly priced if you don't mind the short length and goes on sale for up to 85% off, which is a bloody bargain.\n\n* An animated series based on the game is/was planned, a demo of which is available here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STsqPrG8L7E\n* Funding for a sequel, The Inner World 2 - The last Windmonk, seems to have been approved in 2015 as mentioned in this German press release[innovation.mfg.de]","May 5","true","9.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Astrobia/recommended/251430/","Astrobia","Astrobia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Astrobia/","1518 products in account","Played through twice. Once to complete and once again to get the achievements I'd missed. Second playthrough took about an hour and a half with me skipping all dialogue and cutscenes, the rest of the time was spent going through puzzles and watching loading screens. Actually that made me notice a lot of the puzzles had a lot of wandering back and forth between locations but that's a minor criticism. Otherwise the short playtime is to be expected when you already know the solutions to all the puzzles, so it shows there is a decent amount of content there. I'd estimate 6 to 10 hours depending on how quick you are on the uptake.\n\nFirst playthrough I completed with know guides or help from the hint system. I did scratch my head occasionally but it's not an exceptionally hard point and click adventure. The majority of the puzzles make logical sense and most the time you know what you want to do and the challenge is more in finding the right items to do it. If you are stuck it usually means you need to go back and talk to someone now you know more or you just missed and item in another area. Holding down the left mouse button shows all the hot spots for objects you can interact with on the screen so thankfully pixel hunting is not a barrier like the old days of P&C. If you do get stuck there's an in game help system that tells you what your goals are and can get successively more detailed hints on what to do next from, so you still wont need a guide to help you complete it.\n\nThe art style is styalised as you can see from the screenshots above. Appeal comes down to personal opinion. The quality of the art assets is adequate for what they are trying to convey. I didn't find myself not knowing what something was when I looked at it.\n\nSound wise the voice acting is decent enough, soundFX are adequate to indicate what they are and the music sets the mood without been noteworthy enough to get in the way of your attention. In otherwords it all serves it's purpose.\n\nThe story is well written and very original. There's a decent amount of lore to give depth to this unique universe and it is delivered with good pacing to keep the mysteries unfolding all the way to the end. Characters are well designed, you like and contempt them as appropriate and as such feel satisfied when they get what they deserve (good or bad). Dialogue is amusing whenever it's not supposed moving. I would say it's laugh out loud funny but I went through most the game with a bemused smile.\n\nThe emotional drama isn't exactly gripping, in spite of it's content it doesn't feel super dark and gripping or a tear jerker like some other games in the genre (try some deadalic titles like chains of satinav of whispered world for that). It's interesting, it walks a tight right where you do feel sympathy for the characters without been devastated by the tragedy constantly befalling them. In other worlds it's pretty light hearted if still a little grim at times.\n\nLoading times aside (they are short but still noticeable enough to annoy you when you realise you have to backtrack because you forgot something) my biggest criticism would have to be stability. Very occasionally the cut scene animations didn't play correctly when completing a puzzle (no impact on gameplay you just miss out on the visual) and the game would periodically crash, I'd say you can expect it to do so 3-5 times between the begging of the game and completion. Thankfully the game autosaves after literally everything you do so you never lose any progress. Another example of how it's not super polish but enough work was put in to make sure things are good enough to preform to resonable expectations.\n\nIn summary this is a solid addition to the genre and at the end of the day the game left me hoping for a sequel to be released in the future, which in my book is as solid a recommendation as any.","July 24, 2015","true","8.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/liderc/recommended/251430/","liderc","Aurinko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/liderc/","465 products in account","Beautifully drawn, puzzle-heavy, cartoonish adventure game with sympathetic cast, intriguing story and quite unique mythos.\n\nThe gameplay is standard point'n'clicking: You can either inspect (a magnifying glass), pick up (a hand), or interact (gears) with hotspots. Left-clicking brings up a "radial menu" with the inspect option on left and either interact or pick up option on right. This seems a bit clunky and wasteful considering right-clicking serves no purpose. You open the inventory by moving the cursor to the lower end of the screen and use items via the radial menu or dragging'n'dropping.\n\nGraphics of the milieus in this game are top-notch. For some reason the developer decided to put less effort into character art, and they generally look like they were drawn in MS Paint. After the initial shock this didn't bother me personally, but as someone rightfully pointed out it makes the characters seem a bit disconnected from the surroundings. Animation is satisfactory.\n\nSound is good, and the naivety of the protagonist is quite cutely presented by the voice actor. Rest of the cast is up to par as well. There was one character in the game whose voice I couldn't bear, but it sort of suited him anyhow. Music is mostly ambient and forgettable.\n\nThe story and atmosphere are moody. Don't let the cute exterior fool you, there are some dark elements in the story and characters. Some of it felt borderline psychotic and rather morbid, which I enjoyed. Predictably, attempts at humor are made, but I only found myself chuckling a few times, so it was mostly a miss in my case. Dialogue was for most part pretty standard stuff compared to other point'n'click adventures, at times good, and on a few occasions a bit too lengthy. The world is imaginative and the game has a lot of personality, and the characters were generally likeable and/or relatable on some level. Writing felt a bit rushed toward the end, but I felt the story came to a closure.\n\nPuzzles are of varying quality. They mostly felt logical, and some of them were quite clever, but sometimes I felt like things were set up badly and I needed to do things in some arbitrary order or fashion to achieve the end result although I had already figured out a/the logic. There is a help system if you get stuck.\n\nThe game spans five chapters and progression happens within constraints of a handful of [scrollable] screens at a time, restricting problem-solving to a rather narrow area and assets. This means less exploration and more fiddling with objects and talking to characters.\n\nTechnically, the game had one small annoyance: Sometimes when you'd interact with an object or trigger an event there is a noticeable pause before the character responds, similar to how older games used to stall for a few seconds to load an audio file from CD-ROM. It is annoying enough to warrant a mention here, but doesn't come close to affecting my opinion of the game on the whole.\n\nThe main complaint - as often is the case with these games - is that I wish the game was lengthier. I could have gone on for full 10 chapters at a slightly slower tempo or (preferably) with a more branching storyline. In any case, if there ever is a sequel I will definitely be getting it to see what more is going on in Asposia.\n","November 4, 2014","true","3.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

This one might be a little long, sorry guys!\n\nI tend to be very on or off with point and clicks, It doesn't happen very often that i get into a game of this genre, don't get bored half way through, and actually manage to get to the end of it.\n\nThe tendency with this genre for me is that if they don't flow well enough, if i get stuck on obscure item combinations (which happens a lot with point and clicks) or if it's just not interesting enough, i'll give up and not bother going back to it. This is one point and click game however that i am happy to say that not only could i actually bare to get through it, but it's actually a really good game. It's been the best point and click game i have played since the Deponia series, which i adored.\n\nIn ways, this game reminded me a little of that series. I guess in just style and art. I was actually somewhat convinced whilst playing that it might be by Daedalic Entertainment, but alas it's not!\n\nAdmittedly when i first started playing this, i thought it was quite slow (maybe i was just in a particularly impatient mood that day?). The dialog seemed like it was paced too slowly and i was generally dreading the trek ahead to completing this game. Although I'm glad to say i changed my mind very quickly with that one.\n\nThe story is very inventive and i found it quite interesting. The game was fun to play through and the ending was definitely not disappointing. I think i can safely say that it's not the plot twist of the century, but it's not entirely predictable either. Either way it was great to see things unfold and i loved the creativity and humor involved.\n\nIn terms of characters, I love them. There are some very lovable characters in this game. Including our main star Robert. A well mannered, polite, silly and somewhat naive little Asposian.\n\nThe graphics are nice. It's very soft, light and nice on the eyes. A light-hearted, hand-drawn and cartoon-like style. With that said, i did have a few problems with crashing/freezing. Sometimes the loading screen between chapters just wouldn't load. It was usually fine because the game tends to autosave before the "end of chapter" cutscene. So you don't really lose anything, but it's still a minor annoyance having to reboot the game.\nI found that if you tended to not move or click anything whilst the cutscene was playing or it was trying to load, it'd usually load fine. If you pressed buttons and clicked your mouse, that's when it tended to have a hard time and freeze.\n\nThat being the only negative thing out of the way, back to the positive stuff!\nThe help system in this is quite good. I usually try not to use hints whenever i can, but being stuck on something for a long while gets a bit frustrating. I was quite impressed with the hint system, I wanted to see how many hints it would give you and how obvious they'd be. It gives you a few little nudges in the right direction before just spelling it out to you. Plus, you still don't get it? It'll spell it out to you even more blatantly. Literally to the point of "Go pick this thing up over there, and use it on this".\n\nLastly, achievements!\nThis one is pretty easy to complete 100% and i think my method for doing so was a decent way of doing it.\nI basically started a game file (it allows you up to 3), I played through a chapter, then went back to the main menu and started a second game for missed achievements throughout each chapter. Every time i would complete a chapter in my main save, i'd go back to the secondary save to complete it again whilst getting any missed achievements.\nThe chapters aren't too long and once you know what you are doing going back and getting the missables in a second game file isn't as tedious as it sounds.\nThere is one lonesome guide for this game that details "missable achievements" you can either read the names/descriptions and try to figure yourself how to get them, or you could just use the guide to know what to do. (In my opinion it's fairly easy to figure out how to get them just from reading the title or description)\nAlso, there are a few achievements that having two saves actually makes it easier. For example, there is one achievement for not using the guide at all and one for using the guide frequently. So either way really, you'd have to play it twice.\n\nAll in all i really loved this game and i'm glad i decided to have a go with it. If you're a fan of the genre i would definitely recommend it to you.","January 16","true","5.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The main character is an absolute dimwit making it impossible to connect with him. The dialog is badly written which is making the voice acting cringe-worthy to listen to.\n\nThe puzzles are utterly ridiculous - they are super random, often defy (even adventure-)logic and some cannot even be solved by doing the right thing on the "wrong" screen (yes, I'm talking about you, theatre stage conroy mod); or they require you to have completed only loosely connected dialog trees with random NPCs before working. Ontop of this, items can sometimes be combined in the wrong way, which is making things unnecessarily confusing.\n\nOverall, this game was not a pleasant experience. I completed only the first chapter (which took me a good two hours), had everyone flee my twitch stream in panic and would rather shoot myself in the foot than continue playing.\n\nSomeone please hire Studio Fizbin's artist and pair him up with people who actually care about their work.","February 29","false","2.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The story is motivating, puzzles are fun solving, and characters are as lively as they can get. The intensity level of the game, however, is the only factor that can hold this game back. Due to the sluggish nature of point-and-click games, it’s easy for players to get diverted from the intensity of the story. Having said that, compared to all of the chapters, the end of the game feels rather shortened and contradicted.

I guess the developers wanted it to be a charming puzzle game, but i can't se how this is any charming at all..\n\n- The dialogs are so tedious and poorly written. Too much dialog, that is not funny or relevant to the gameplay.\n- The puzzles are not hard, but random and strange.\n- Voice overs could have been much more fitting, especially Robert.\n\nI have tried to give it an honest try several times, with the same outcome every time; after 10 minutes i'm bored playing (or irritated)..

After all the inner world is a short game, but one you'll probably remember.\n\nThe story is simple, and perhaps it could work better with a different pace, but it has enough charm and humour to keep you going all the way and even want a little more, Asposia is a curious place after all.\n\nThe sceneries and characters are well drawn, and the soundtrack fits the game like a glove, but to be honest what really caught my eye were all the details put into the menus and interaction options. Everything is clean and simple while still adding a lot to the world. Nothing seems out of place.

The main character leaves his home as the naive protagonist and must work his way up to becoming the hero, along with the help of his friend Laura and her pet pigeon.\n\nThis is one of those adventure games where it's got a few cute, unique elements, but also it's more like a comic book you can play through. The puzzles are set up in a usual adventure game style, where you have to find and combine some items to make them work.\n\nI'll warn you that it's a bit dialog heavy. You have to talk to a lot of characters, so if you're not in the mood to sit through quite a bit of worldbuilding-through-chatting, I'd wait to play this game until you feel more patient.\n\nIt's not a revolutionary game, but it is fun. I'm happy to have it in my library. The only bad thing is there was one, single puzzle that was impossible for me to solve, because I had already tried that combination of things, but not at the right exact time. Regular adventure game frustrations, you know? It could really have been fixed, I think, but it doesn't ruin the entire game. The thing is, once you talk to someone and they give you all the information they can, or they have said all there is to say in a conversation, that button gets grayed out. You can click it again, but throughout the entire game the character would just repeat the same thing over if you did so. That caused a problem with one of the puzzles.\n\nOther than that minor issue, I enjoyed playing this, I found the characters cute (if not a little cliche), and it had some lovely art and a nice world.","December 29, 2013","true","14.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Then find the time/money to get this game, period.\n\nThe Inner World combines a beautiful and intriguing graphical style with some wonderfully off the wall design, such as a world built on the inside of a sphere, not the outside like ours. This is all backed with a melodic and inquisitive musical score that binds it all together (I could happily listen to the opening menu music for quite some time). The human-like inhabitants all have stripey arms, legs and nose, apart from the main character Robert, who seems different from everyone else with his flute nose.\n\nThe adventure starts with Robert going on a quick errand to rescue a necklace stolen by a pesky pigeon but he quickly finds himself being sucked into an adventure to discover the many secrets of the Inner World; which is a lot as he's never left the castle before!\n\nThrough his journey you meet a wealth of very original characters and combined with the delightfully naive Robert lead to some great writing with a nice dry sense of humour. The voice acting and translation in itself is superb considering that the game was written in German and any slip ups are almost unnoticeable.\n\nThe mandatory puzzles are also top class, encouraging you to explore and use that point-n-click crazy logic to allow you to progress. Many of these give Robert and the other characters a great opportunity to make you smile, particularly Laura the female lead. There is also a robust hint system for those that find this kind of game a bit too much of a challenge so you never feel held back from enjoying the story.\n\nCompleted this in 7 or 8 hours or so but enjoyed every second. A wonderful world with great characters to fall in love with.","October 27, 2013","true","9.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Voice acting in the English version is mostly decent, albeit with a few pronunciation inconsistencies and lack of emotion in certain scenes. While a few puzzles are too bizarre even considering the game logic, the overall gameplay is casual.

Also the grafix, yeah grafix with an X! Well it is drawn quite well the background are pretty nice but the sequenzes just come of very chopy the musik always stops and it comes always out of paste and it happens way to often.

But it's not a particularly good game either honestably.  Some of the puzzles were just sort of weird but that's a complaint that i think ranges from the puzzle solving ability from person to person.  Things that I can say for sure were not great was the voice acting, some bugs and technical issues, and the story.  The voice acting is the most obvious flaw, with the actors frequently delivering their lines somewhat emotionlessly, and with strange awkward gaps of silence as they speak.  There are some slightly frustrating bugs, sometimes I just couldnt click on anything for a moment, and the load times are not god awful, but games work like movies, where their point is usually to try and draw you into whats unfolding on the screen, to suspend your disbelief and engage in the story, and the loading periods were long enough that it was sort of jarring in that sense.  The world was creative and interesting, the story showed promise in the beginning, but it played out with far too many lame cliches and flat characterizations.  The interaction with Gorfelina and Laura was just so tiring and tedious especially.  The art was cool, the premise was interesting, but right after the game took its first step it was just a strangely boring slow motion fall right onto its face.\n\nI'd give it a 6/10","October 3, 2015","false","10.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I made it to chapter 2 and then had to Alt+F4 it to end this misery.\n\nI bought this game because people said it would be funny and cleverly written and just an all over nice Adventure Game. Now, after forcing myself through about 2 hours of this game, I sit here and can't believe I wasted a money on something that is rated positive.\n\nI don't even know where to start.\n\nLet's begin with the positives\n\n+ Nice graphics with a vector style look\n+ Good voice actors were used in the making of this thing. The game sounds quite great.\n\nThat's it. I can not say anything else positive. It may find a few moments as the game continues, but I can not see myself sitting there getting more and more annoyed.\n\nNow, what are my issues with this:\n\n- First and foremost the Game is still buggy. It came out in September 2013 and it still has problems. The first time I played it, I was stuck the same moment I entered the game. So I had to uninstall and re-install the game to get it to work. Once I got to chapter two, the game was stuck in loading screen and I had to restart it again.\n\n- Funny? People keep saying the game is funny. How is this game funny? I can't decide what's worse. The flat jokes or the incredible boring dialogues as well as sexist jokes along the way which are probably funny if you are 12 years old. Pseudo-funny sidecharacters make it even more unbearable.\n\n- The dialogues are not only not funny but also unnecessarily long and unimportant as well as non informative.\n\n- The main character is so annoyingly stupid that it makes me want to beat him.\n\n- Granted I did not see many puzzles and the ones I saw were okay. I guess some of them can be quite tricky, but it's not all too bad if you are used to adventure and puzzle games.\n\n- Random non-fitting noises. I don't know how it is in the rest of the game, but in the first chapter I was already bugged out by asking myself... WHY is there a continous "page turning" sound in the middle of the street where nobody reads a book or does something with books and WYH is there a register checkout sound near the jail?!\n\n- The story seems to be incredible weak. It has no tension, nothing exciting and even when it is supposed to have a adventorous turn, it ends in a boring loading screen which is so annoyingly long, that I ended up watching a video while waiting. The script of this Game is just as boring as the jokes...\n\nI watched one of the most popular German Streamers play this game and even then I could not find the humor in it. Where he was laughing, I was continously facepalming myself and forwarding because even watching it was unbearable.\n\nI think if you are around an age class (real age or mental age) of 8-15 you might find this game funny.","March 25, 2015","false","2.4"," 11 of 27 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","11","27","0","1"

There weren't any major flaws, but most things in the game felt very average.\n\nThe graphic style is probably the best thing about the game. The backgrounds are very detailed, but the same can't be said about the characters. The characters don't quite seem to fit in the world. But that's a very minor thing compared to the other issues the game has.\n\nThe main character, Robert, is an apprentice to a wind monk. He is quite naïve and goofy. The other character you get to play as is Laura, who is a thief. She seemed quite grumpy and had this "whatever" attitude. So they're not the most likable characters.\n\nThe game starts with some backstory of the world and events that lead to it's current state. After that Robert is seen polishing his master's amulet, which then gets stolen by pigeon called Peck. Peck escapes through a trash chute and Robert follows with the intention of catching Peck and getting the amulet back. The story then develops into a pretty normal point-and-click story about saving the world. After the first chapter I already knew what was going to happen in the end, because I'm pretty sure I've played game or watched a movie with a very similar plot. And it was really obvious how to story would go on after chapter 1.\n\nThe store page lists screamingly funny dialogues as a feature in the game, but I didn't find the dialogue funny. It was quite boring to be honest. Could be that the funny dialogue was lost in translation, since this is a German game and I played it in English. The dialogue certainly wasn't helped by the voice acting, which ranged from bad to decent. In the end there was this "emotional" part in the story and the voice acting seemed like the actors were just reading their lines out loud. There was no emotion whatsoever.\n\nThe puzzles in this game are also a mixed bag. Some were fairly easy to figure out while some were pretty illogical and basically required trying all possible items in order to solve them. Some items, that seemed fairly logical for solving the puzzles, didn't work and the item needed to solve the puzzle didn't always seem like they'd be a natural choice. The puzzles also required a bit of guessing. There is a hint system in the game, but it's optional and I didn't use it on my playthrough.\n\nI had a couple of weird glitches where the character would just walk to where I pointed him/her and stop and not complete the action he/she was supposed to do. After waiting for a minute or so, the character would finally do what it was supposed to do. On a second playthrough I did to get all the achievements I missed the game also crashed to desktop twice.\n\nTo sum it up, The Inner World is an average point-and-click adventure with not much going for it. I beat the game in 5-6 hours, so it isn't very long. Some of the puzzles are quite frustrating and require some guesswork. The story wasn't anything special or new either to make me recommend the game. Unless you're a big fan of point-and-clicks, I don't recommend playing this one, since there are better point-and-clicks out there.","December 4, 2013","false","7.8"," 15 of 37 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","15","37","0","0"

I can, without a shred of doubt, say that this was truly a pleasant experience, you grow fond of and connect with the characters ingame, even with the NPCs for whom you do tasks to progress, well at least I grew fond of them ^^. I have listened to each and every line of dialogue in the game and didnt once feel bored.\n\nArt style and humor are subjective, but if you want my opinion on them, and considering you're reading this, you probably do, I found the art style charming and caught myself grinning/giggling (and even a couple of genuine laughs a couple of times) quite often.\n\nGameplay is... point&click-y, but what do you expect ? It's a point&click game, so are the puzzles, cuz they are puzzles imo, any good ? It'd say they fit nicely into the whole world that the game creates and are no push-over so they will pose a fair challenge. (not all of them, of course, but you get my "drift")\n\nAll in all it's a very pleasant game to sink a couple of hours into with likable/interesting characters, interesting world, fun dialogue, enjoyable puzzles (yes, enjoyable!).

Sure, I wouldn't say it's on par with the likes of Secret of Monkey Island, but I think it is fun to play all the way through (not stretched out), great humor, fine music and graphics and the puzzles are not outright evil, and if you get stuck there's a nice incremental hint system, that can be used instead of switching back and forth between the game and a browser every once in a while for someone who plays the game more for story than figuring out every single puzzle.\n\nI am a bit tired of the "humorous" sexism though (humour is a typical excuse for discrimination), mainly directed at Laura, not the least when you play as her. Many of the characters she interacts with objectify her, one insisting she must be a maid and unintelligent too and another one focused only on sexual interest. Robert doesn't respect her either. At one point in the game there's also a kiss between a woman and a man that happens that's basically sexual assault, and the kisser is even confronted with it, and her rejection was basically disregarded and he even says he doesn't regret doing it. Not cool, Headup Games & Studio Fizbin!\n\nThe other irritating problem I found was that the game crashed or got stuck on me every once in a while (maybe 7 times when I played through the entire game including all possible dialogue), but nothing that ruined the save, so it's not terrible. What does make this issue somewhat scary is that the game only creates a single save, so if it was hypothetically corrupted, there'd be no option but to start all over. I think a good solution for this problem - other than fixing the bugs - would be to create a save at the start of each chapter besides the current save which saves during a chapter too. This way one wouldn't have to start all over, and furthermore these saves will make getting all the achievements less of a pain.\n\nFinally there's generally always two actions you can perform in the game, which for some reason are both mapped to a submenu when left-clicking, instead of mapping one to the left and right mouse button, which is a simple change that would definitely improve the UX in my opinion.\n\nTo sum up I definitely recommend this (mostly) very charming game!","August 17, 2014","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not cool, Headup Games & Studio Fizbin!\n\nThe other irritating problem I found was that the game crashed or got stuck on me every once in a while (maybe 7 times when I played through the entire game including all possible dialogue), but nothing that ruined the save, so it's not terrible. What does make this issue somewhat scary is that the game only creates a single save, so if it was hypothetically corrupted, there'd be no option but to start all over. I think a good solution for this problem - other than fixing the bugs - would be to create a save at the start of each chapter besides the current save which saves during a chapter too. This way one wouldn't have to start all over, and furthermore these saves will make getting all the achievements less of a pain.\n\nFinally there's generally always two actions you can perform in the game, which for some reason are both mapped to a submenu when left-clicking, instead of mapping one to the left and right mouse button, which is a simple change that would definitely improve the UX in my opinion.\n\nTo sum up I definitely recommend this (mostly) very charming game!","August 17, 2014","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/killerkoyd/recommended/251430/","killerkoyd","fisH","http://steamcommunity.com/id/killerkoyd/","1285 products in account","This is a Spolier Free review.\n\nThe Inner world takes place in Asposia, an inverted world of kind with the air and light being brought in by Wind Fountain and Fosfos's respectfully. In this new world we meet Robert, the adopted son of the Wind Monk to the last remaining Wind Fountain. In this world, the Basylians, wind gods, are angry with the people of Asposia and have begun to rampage and turn people into stone. Conroy, the last active wind monk, is the pope like figure in control over all of Asposia trying to save the people of this world by pleasing the Basylians to not turn the citezens into stone.  The story starts off by Robert polishing Conroy's most precious medallion, a stray pidgeon appears and Robert befriends the pidgeon but shoo's the pidgeon away as Conroy finishes his speach. Robert fearful of Conroy hands him his medallion only for the medallion to get stolen by the pidgeon. Robert wanting to please Conroy chases after the pidgeon. This is where we meet Laura, the owner of the pidgeon and wanted by the state for a multitude of crime. Laura catches Robert trying to steal the pidgeon, which belongs to her, and she grabs the pidgeon, whos name is now known as Peck, and runs off. Thus beginning the story of The Inner World.\n\nThroughout the rest of the game you will meet interesting new characters each with thier own set of witty and humorous dialoges as well as an immensive world with many secrets to behold. Robert, being sheltered all his life enters this world much like the player giving a shared viewpoint through Robert. Robert, a very shy and honest character, has a magnetic personality that I found myself easily attaching myself to. His interactions with the world around him create humor at every corner.\n\nThe humor in this game goes beyond character to character interactions, the game does not take itself seriously. In a later part of the game there is a cooking book called "Cooking for Posers by Gor Dun Ramsee", when I found this book I nearly fell to the floor laughing due to the call back to reality the game pulled on me. The world is filled with hints and nods to pop culture and the game itself is highly meta in its own rights.\n\nWhile the story itself is nothing necessarily 'original' in story arc and plot points, the story is creative enough to work. The pacing of the story starts off very slow, but it gradually speeds up over time with some portions being slower than they should be. But the explosion of the storyline fits into the story arc of the game. Though the pacing fluxuated at certain points I was still enjoying the game due to the great story and the world of Asposia making me want more. The end of the story left me wanting more of this fantasy world that I fell in love with and I hope that in the future there could be a sequal or a storyline expansion to quench my thirst for more Asposia.\n\nTo add onto this amazing and humorous storyline and characters, the world itself is a beauty to look at. The animations are well crafted, though I did have some issues but that was only due to hardware problems, and it ties all of the story telling elements in to create an amazing fanasty world.\n\nI highly enjoyed playing through this entire game and I would play through it again to find the parts of the side story that I missed in my first playthrough. My only complaint is the games issues with AMD GPU's but that can be fixed by installing Adobe AIR. All in all this game is a very well rounded with an incredible story with meta humor splurged throughout the extraordinary world that is Asposia.\n\nIndividual Ratings\n\nStory:                                   8/10\nArtwork:                              10/10\nGameplay:                          10/10\nMechanics:                           8/10\nBang for your buck:            10/10\n\nOverall Score                 92/100\n\nGame In A Sentence:\nPoint and Click adventure with a creative and humorous story complimented by amazing artwork.","May 3, 2015","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you've enjoyed Machinarium and The Dream Machine, you will definetely like this one! While it's slightly easier than both of them, I've still found myself stuck couple of times and going to their help system, which is great at giving hints without uncovering everything at once. The art is great, the sound is great and probably it's the most relaxing point and click I've ever played. Even comparing to Botanicula.\n\nWhat could be possibly improved:\n1) Although I think that highlighting interactive spots makes game much less challenging and should be presented as an option of "easy" mode. Same goes for detailed hints, which are absolutely great, but knowing you have them makes you use them :)\n2) Animations of combining things are almost useless, and probably should be presented as an option in settings.\n3) What upset me the most after I completed the game - there's absolutely no way to start a separate chapter, so if you want to get all of the achievements you'll need to do it in the first run or play it again from the beginning just making to the points where you know you'll get achievements (they are rather obvious when you complete the game).\n\nAnd while I liked this game a lot, I wouldn't recommend buying it at full price, though I can understand how much effort had been put in making it. If you absolutely want point-n-click for 10 bucks, I would recommend "The Dream Machine" instead.

This kind of gameplay can get frustrating when you cannot work out the insane combinations of items required to solve the puzzle but this game gets round this by a very nice hints system. Unlike the hints systems in some of the Telltale games which gives you hints that only make sense if you know the solution, this hint system gives you loads of little hints and if you keep clicking it eventually just tells you what to do. This is a really nice system as you just use it till you get the bit of information you need to make all the clues click together into place without having to go away and look up a full walkthrough.

With the help of a new founded friend named Laura, they will discover what happended to the wind's disappearance from the three wind fountains, and the secrets behind (most) of the characters.\n\nThere are some twists to this game, and their... ok. I've seen this type of story done many, many times before, and while it does get old seeing it done over and over again, I feel like it was done fairly well here. Most things make sense twords the end, avoiding a happy ending with a more bitter sweet one.\n\nThe game can take about 6 hours to complete on your first playthough, all while being enjoyable. A second playthrough can take a couple hours if you care about seeing things you missed/getting achievements, which might I add, are all fairly easy if you enjoy completing a game. Though despite that, the game's replayablility isn't incredibly high. It took me 9.7 hours to complete the entirety of the game and see everything, due to some things I'll get to in a bit. Though the experience that was brought in those 9.7 hours were enjoyable and amusing.\n\nThe characters featured in the game are enjoyable and entertaining to follow. Our main character Robert, while awkward at times, can be fun to play as to see how he reacts to the world around him. As he was sheltered at a young age, being thrown in a new world can make for some good humor. Mostly every character in this game is memorable in some way or another. Wheather it be a character in the main story, or a side character used mainly for puzzles.\n\nAs the trailer shows, my favorite thing about this game is the art style. Made in non-stereoscopic handmade 2D,  The Inner World  stands up to most visuals found in games nowadays. The colors make the world a gloomy, yet a lively place to explore, mixed with the cartoony style of characters, makes  The Inner World  "a breath of fresh air".\n\nThe soundtrack is, good. It isn't as upbeat and in-your-face as other games, but it isn't "gone with the wind" as well. If you're looking for a good track featuring  relaxing, low tone instruments mixed with soft bird music, then you'll most likely love this track.\n\nFor gameplay, it's a point and click game, there's not much more you can add to it. The game features puzzles, mainly the "find all the things and put them together to make something else" ones. Some are fun and well done, while others not so much. And this leads into one of my main problems with the game.\n\nIf you want a slow-paced puzzle game, I highly recomend this. But if you're looking for something to get through quickly in about 30 minutes, then this game can be a challenge. And when I say 30 minutes, I mean speedruning the game afterwards to finish everything you missed. On your first playthough, it can take about 6 hours with the walkthrough only when you need it. And since the game isn't that big (there's only 4 areas total, not counding the ending), once you know the solution to the puzzle and you can finish it in about 5-10 minutes, the game can bug out a little. Example being (spoiler)  the theater puzzle with the control board. Most times when I try to change the scene to get a different scene of that slide, it lets me change it, but the scene doesn't change. Meaning I have to exit the control pannel, come back, and try again for the scene to show. It isn't the most enraging thing, but it can cause a hassle on your first playthough when you think you solved the puzzle, but it didn't register it.\n\nAnd though that's a bug in a normal playthrough, remember when I said speedruning the game in 30 minutes can be a challenge. That's because the game can crash and softblock while trying to do that. My second playthough, I had to reset as (spoiler)  when I was making the "cookie" key durring Steve's area, I put the crystal shards in the mixing bowl. Then while that was happening, I took out the flowers, and after I was sure it was done with the shards, I put the flowers in next, but it didn't cound me puting them in, but took them anyways. So it took the flowers withough counting them, making it softblock the game, forcing a reset.  And while that was a softblock glitch, my first playthough of the game made me have to Alt+F4 once, and go back to the main menu twice. On my second playthough (speedrun) I had to main menu at least two or three times, (I think) Alt+F4 once, and one crash, along with somehow duplicating items while crafting.\n\n\nFor me,  The Inner World  is a charming and visualy interesting game. The characters are fun, the art style is beautiful with a soundtrack and story that are ok, and appart from some glitches, the puzzles where enjoyable and challenging. If you are looking for a good, slowpaced 2D point and click adventure game, I'd recomend  The Inner World.\n\nOh yeah, and the minigame on the main menu is neat as well.\n\nFinal Score: 8.5 / 10\nEnjoyable experience","March 26","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So I would suggest to not RAPIDLY click through dialogue, combine items or use items on objects in an impatient manner.\n\nI would recommend this game to those who enjoy humorous dialogues or unique plot.","February 25","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am still not sure what to think of it yet. Because the minute we (me and my partner) started playing it, we realized we need a smoke to really get into it. It helped. The hilarity of the whole thing. The main hero thought speaks as if he was stoned himself and it made me fall asleep. That happened three evenings in a row with this game. My partner took care of most of the progress, because I was too stoned to think, but watching it is pretty awesome. Sleepy though. So... yeah. Inner World. Nothing makes sense in a nice way and I like that kind of things.","March 15","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As I went through the puzzles I discovered that some of them were really hard to work out, for instance, I would never thought of using mushrooms to be earplugs.....( I hope this would not annoy people who haven't played the game yet...) And sometimes when I went like "Oh I know how to solve the problem!" and the tools also fit the puzzles then I would happen to know that I used the wrong method :) What a surprise.. It's like that's something the game put in to fool you around :) But I like it really XD\n\nIn addition, the music and the voice actor casting are really GREAT. I also love the hand-drawn style artwork. Thanks you a lot for providing us with such a fantastic audio-visual art experience!\n\n世界观简单，故事线清晰，谜题不算很难，不过也不容易想。消磨时间利器，就冲画风也值得一玩：）","March 21","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This kind of gameplay can get frustrating when you cannot work out the insane combinations of items required to solve the puzzle but this game gets round this by a very nice hints system. Unlike the hints systems in some of the Telltale games which gives you hints that only make sense if you know the solution, this hint system gives you loads of little hints and if you keep clicking it eventually just tells you what to do. This is a really nice system as you just use it till you get the bit of information you need to make all the clues click together into place without having to go away and look up a full walkthrough. Aside from that is has a cool world with likeable characters and a good story which is really what you are looking for in a point and click game.","January 24","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While it is polished enough to be worth your time, it hasn't enough charm or substance in the storytelling to keep you engrossed.\n\nA first stab at the adventure genre by the developers, they've told a story of a little boy who is a member of an underground civilization plagued by a number of problems, first are all these wind gods turning people into stone and the second being the absence of wind.  The world is foreign and interesting enough with its own history, culture, and physics that keep you guessing and interested in what is happening and what led up to the present sequence of events.  The story is, boy gets caught up in problem, meets anarchist girl, ends up in revolution, discovers past, bad stuff happens, uses past to save the world, live happily ever after.  The story is adventure game fodder and is not done exceptional enough to make it seem new or like something I haven't played already.\n\nThe dialogue was translated from German and it was done well enough save for some patchy words which made it into the localization, misnamed objects, odd sentences and the like.  As far as that goes, there is a LOT of dialogue.  Your mileage may vary if you consider this a good or bad thing.  It provides a lot of exposition, character development, and world building.  It also starts falling into the land of monotonous walls of text.  If you are having any issues with a dialogue puzzle, you can expect to see the same lines repeated several times.\n\nThe art is done to give the game its own style.  It's cartoony, imaginative, and contributes to the development of the story and world.  The only issue I had with it was it had so much drab and brown, but that's for my own tastes.\n\nThe puzzles, dialogue and inventory, are done well and help the pacing, which is all I can ask of puzzles in an adventure game.  They are well-made and don't require the use of LOL logic to figure out.  Their difficulty improves gradually over the game and helps immersion and pacing.  If you have problems, the game has an interactive hint book which can help push you in the right direction.  There's nothing really bad I can say about them other than the repetition you may face if you have issues with a dialogue puzzle.\n\nIn all, the game is ok and I had no real problems with it.  The only problem is, it exists in a genre swamped with better games and other games no better than this one.  If you are an adventure game fan, you can play this for something new.  Otherwise, look for something else.","February 12","false","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story and the puzzles were fun. There were some really big performance issues with this game however.\n1. The loading times between each area was longer than one would expect (10+ seconds maybe)?\n2. Some delay between clicking and the text popping up / sound playing (probably a loading issue)\n3. Black screens... this happened to me at least 3 times. Going from one 'area' to another caused a complete blackout - only a restart bypassed it. This may have had to do with cutscenes not playing properly. I'm not sure why.\n\nIn terms of size, this game felt really small... as each act only had about 3-4 areas were you could explore. Additionally, the number of characters you could interact with were a small handful as well. This meant that most of the dialog in each act were from only one or two characters. I felt having so few characters was a terrible decision as it meant characters would literally drone on and on monotonously.\n\nUnfortunately for all of this. This is only a 6.5/10 for me. The story was fun, puzzles were fun, but the performance issues  and the design choice of having few areas + few characters really made the game slow.","January 17","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music and sound effects are just perfect, and the characters are relatable, evocative, funny and even adorable. At times the puzzles are a little obscure, but for the most part their solutions are more easily deduced than many games of this type because practical creative problem solving - given the clues and tools at hand - does the trick.
