"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/recommended/374060/","AestheticGamer","AestheticGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/","3602 products in account","Stairs features a man named Adams entering into a factory to investigate the murder of a young woman named Valerie, who may have been victim to two men, all three who went missing over three years ago, but Valerie's body suddenly turns up in said factory. Adams is here to snap some pictures for his own personal scoop, but soon gets trapped in the factory and begins to descend a series of stairs...\n\nThe game mostly has you exploring the environments, locating and snapping pictures of scenes, solving some light puzzles, and later in, occasionally sneaking past some monsters & some misc activities. And the game does well with it... During the 2-4 hour course, the game provides a surprising amount of variety, in locations, objectives, and paces itself nicely. While the short length will turn some people off, they don't pad it out to artificially fill time, and though a slower experience, do good in building up atmosphere and scenes.\n\nThe atmosphere in general is quite good, with moody lighting and some well-done audio to capture you in specific moments, but it isn't an overly scary game. There's a few moments here and there, and I did get unnerved sometimes, but it isn't trying to litter itself with cheap jumpscares or be overly oppressive. If anything, the type of horror it portrays is more... "Thinking," horror, and a few mindscrew elements. Things like something changing you may subtly notice, or the path you just treaded suddenly being different, or little details in the environment and notes that get you thinking.\n\nThe story, meanwhile, is going to be a like/dislike scene among people. What starts off as a rather straight-forward story, about a fourth of the way into the game it begins to get stranger, and there is never really any definite 'answers' told in game, and it ends a bit abruptly. Still, I did find myself enjoying the game, and I actually liked the voice acting employed... With the exception of the main character himself, but ironically he's the one to talk the least in the game. I found myself enjoying the story, especially the individual almost stand-alone stories of each location as they were presented, but it's definitely not straight-forward.\n\nI think it's really the fly-by-fly moments that made me enjoy this game. They do a few small fun things with your camera, nothing that hasn't been done before, but not done often and was implemented nicely, and I enjoyed how some of the locations twisted and turned into each other, and allowed some exploration despite being a fairly linear game. What I found the most appealing was the stand-out moments that occurred from time to time. Some minor spoilers here, but some of the fun twists involving the mirror room earlier in, the changing wooden wall chamber with all the chairs in the mines, the forest cabin area, and the lingering camera flashes at the end, were all moments that appealed to me, as well as the trials of the roses and just some of the downtime atmosphere. It's not an overly challenging game, but I think they spiced it up nicely and kept you guessing.\n\nA solid horror game. For those too concerned with the length then it may not be worth delving into as it isn't entirely long, took me about 3 and a half hours exploring and looking for all the camera spots to snap (though didn't find all the secrets or notes yet), but definitely worth it for those who like a slow, atmospheric, and thought-provoking descent that isn't too littered with scares, but with ambiance and a variety of moments to keep things interesting.","September 29, 2015","true","5.0"," 53 of 68 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","53","68","2","1"

It's harsh, but true. Did Greylight get some things right? Most definitely yes! They had some spooky ideas and jump scares with the beginnings of an interesting story. For a student project it's pretty well done. I'd just hoped for something a bit more substantial and much less buggy. The game crashed 7 times during the 4 hours it took me to complete, and the ending leaves you with so many unanswered questions your head will hurt.\n\nIn short, I'd try another Greylight game in the future because they seem to have promise as a company. But this game needed to be tested more, and it needed more of a story to help me through it. The characters are two dimensional and vague, the sceneries are blase and copied, and the game just feels incomplete. That incompleteness leaves you feeling incomplete and unsatisfied. A sad but definite no on this one. A nice effort though.","October 7, 2015","false","4.8"," 29 of 40 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","29","40","0","0"

In your role as an investigative journalist trying to piece together the plot of a kidnapping gone fatally awry, you'll visit four main locations; an abandoned factory provides your introduction, then it's onto an underground facility, a dusty mine and a countryside holiday camp.\nIt's a 3 -4 hour game at best but unlike a lot of horror titles I've played recently, Stairs keeps its scares fresh and jump-scare free by giving each morbid wonderland you turn up at its own distinct flavour, adversaries and backstory. The camera is an overused idea in this sort of game as of late but Stairs finds some excellent ways to anchor it to the terror, at times having you use it as a nightvision camera, at others forcing its flash as a way to edge through pitch black hallways.\nHonestly one of the best horror games I've played this year. And I play so many that I probably shouldn't be allowed out any more. You can check out the fun I had with it below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGrPmCPUr7E\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfRwetHfcb8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_nqC3x54ZM","October 2, 2015","true","3.0"," 22 of 38 people (58%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","58","22","38","5","0"

With that being said, the title does come with its fair share of issues; however, do not let that deter you from one hell of a masterfully immersive horror experience.\n\nThe tone of the game starts out serene enough, the introductory area is reminiscent of The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. However, the game soon takes a sinister turn that will have the gamer questioning their very sanity. Corridors shift, rooms change, levels morph. Each of the three missing people that you set out to recover will take you on wildly different journeys, each filled with their own horrific level designs, story and atmosphere. Make no mistake, this is no key finding or walking simulator. This is also not a title that is reliant on jump scares at all.\n\nThe soundtrack plays a key role in the overall atmosphere of the game. While the level designs can range from quite open to extremely claustrophobic, the music is intense and keeps you in a state of hyper tension, dread and fear; even if no immediate danger is present... but you will never know when you're able to let your guard down until the moment passes.\n\nWhile Stairs has every element that it takes to create the ultimate psychological horror experience, the title has some unfortunate downfalls that must be taken into consideration. Quite a few times throughout my experience with this title, the game froze. The only thing that fixed it was bringing up my task manager. As well, I did encounter an unexpected game crash at the very end of the third level. When I reloaded my save file, I was met with a camera that was falling away from the level. I reloaded my checkpoint, and I was placed at the very beginning of the level and I was forced to redo everything again.\n\nAnother down note on Stairs is that it ends very abruptly at around 3-4 hours of play time. I've gathered that this game is an "unfinished student project", which is unfortunate. There is a ton of room for further story arcs and thrills. I wasn't expecting at all for the game to end when it did, and the conclusion of the story was a let down rather than a decent plot twist.\n\nNonetheless, the few flaws found in Stairs should not cause you to avoid purchasing it. The overwhelming sense of pressure and fear that you will experience, combined with level designs that cause you to truly question your mental state, are more than enough to warrant a recommendation. Take it from a true expert in horror, Stairs is one of the greatest psychological horror experiences in a number of recent years. If only it were longer...\n\nRating: 4.5/5.0 - Excellent, highly worth playing.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","November 1, 2015","true","4.1"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

I've kept an eye on this one since they released an early demo. I really hoped it was going to shape up to something spooky and fun. I was pretty dissapointed when I finalIy got my hands on the full version.\n\nLike I mentioned, it starts out really promising. Beautiful, atmospheric, it sucks you into this interesting world. It takes a weird turn about an hour into the game, but that's okay, it had some good little scares and interesting moments. After about an hour and a half? I have no idea what happened.\n\nIt feels more like 4 different games hastily cut and pasted together by the time it all ends. It just falls so flat, the narrative just makes little to no sense, and all sense of the atmospheric spookiness that envelops you when you enter the warehouse/factory in the first few minutes feels like it's light years away. It's really too bad.\n\nDo yourself a favor, get on Gamejolt and download the demo/beta version of the game. It's way more spooky than this game ended up being.

You play as a journalist attempting to cover the mysterious death of a woman.  It's simple enough and the narrative leads to some cool and legitimate points about journalism today.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is quite good and the music and stings suit it well.  This in conjunction with the clever environmental tricks put me on edge a few times.  I'm not against jump scares but I'm glad that there were very few in this game.\n\nMechanically, however, it's very clear where things had to be cut due to (I assume) the failed kickstarter.  The base mechanic of the game is the camera you use to reveal clues and open paths, but it's hardly used to it's full potential and is instead regulated to clever little moments throughout.  Its a shame because there is a lot of potential with this idea.  There are also very few areas where the player is in any actual danger, and though not a huge deal, it bothered me after a while as there is very little challenge.\n\nThe game is buggy as all hell, with save files doing VERY strange things if you decide to load.  I got achievements without actually completing them, and DIDN'T get other achievements when I had completed them, and had to redo entire areas even when the journal in game says I finished them, very strange all in all.\n\nEven after all my complaints I do still recommend "Stairs".  The atmosphere and tension are nice, and it kept me rooted in the story even with the weird bugs that went on.  I would for sure recommend it on sale.","November 7, 2015","true","3.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Story pace and game progression seem flawless thanks to good but not hard puzzles. The graphics are far from low-budget, especially the outdoor areas which are stunning to watch.\n\nMy LP:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoBxhhQIbi8\n\nOnly real letdown is the mine level which not only felt out of place, it also looked dull compared to the rest. On top of that, it's the only level that can be confusing at times, but that could have been just me. The character models of the mine monsters, though, have a rather cheap look to it.\n\nSecond big negative point is the gametime of (in my case) 3 hours. The ending took me completely by surprise due to its unexpectedness. Actually, the story doesn't even feel finished, even though its meaning is clear. But still, I think 1-2 hours more would have been advisible, especially since there's no replay value unless you're an achievement hunter.

Which events? Tell me about these events. Real life is always more frightening than films and video games. Games and movies are simply fantasy, but when someone dangles that set of keys before my eyes, promising to blur those lines… I want to experience it. I get excited about being scared.\n\nAnd then 99.9999999999% of the time, I end up disappointed with the final product. It’s either naive or foolish of me to hold onto hope like that, but some day the words “based on true events” will mean something again.\n\nBut not this day. Recently, I wrapped up the indie horror game Stairs, which was, as you probably guessed, inspired by real-life events. It tries (and fails) to tell the tale of a reporter who investigates the “grizzly mysteries behind three stories.”\n\nThe premise sounds OK and the game started off on a strong foot. Good lighting. Decent environmental models, taking photos in what should be a closed off crime scene in a remote part of the wilderness. And then it all just sort of falls apart from there.\n\nIn literature and film, stairs are always a strong source of symbolism and their usage in this game is pretty blatant. It’s a decent into madness or literally into hell. In the game they infinitely go down until you decide to stop kidding yourself and get off on a floor. But in terms of narrative structure, they’re used as duct tape to sloppily bind together 3 stories that have absolutely nothing to do with one another.\n\nNow, anthologies are nothing new to horror. Anyone can look to The Twilight Zone, or the V/H/S series or Black Mirror for great examples. But anthologies in within a single video game is rarely done. Stairs seems to attempt it, and sad to say it doesn’t succeed. The three stories told within aren’t separated with a frame story.\n\nThe protagonist calls himself Christopher Adams, freelance journalist. Instead of Adams investigating one spooky story, wrapping it up using a traditional story model, going home and discovering the next spooky story, the game just chucks Adams into a singular haunted house amusement park ride experience where all three story themes are presented to the player. It’s the equivalent of The Twilight Zone trying to jam the two episodes Little Girl Lost and Nightmare at 20,000 feet into the same experience.\n\nThe end result: Adams doesn’t feel like a character in this story, and his title of “freelance journalist” is an excuse to slap a camera in the players’ hands so there is something more to do in the game other than navigating the mazes. The game is billed as a psychological horror. But without proper story or character structure, how can it be a psychological horror game? Instead, this is a paranormal or even a monster horror game. It deals more with ghosts and spirits and supernatural creatures.\n\nSo, the game was poorly planned and kinda mis-marketed. Was there anything Stairs did right?\n\nThe developers definitely had a few good spooky ideas. But sadly they’re lost in the mess. I liked this one particular passageway as I had to slink through the little hands of these undead children in a pitch black mine. Using the camera’s night vision as your only source of light in this part of the game made me think of the popularity surge in ghost hunting shows of the recent past. Made me wonder why gaming never really tapped into that market.\n\nBut most attempts this game makes to be clever often come across as annoying. Take this valve on the floor that the protagonist is embarrassingly too weak to lift. It’s just a valve. But in order to get the valve into the proper space, you need to take a photo of where it should be seated. Yeah. That makes sense.\n\nThe voice acting is pretty terrible across the board. What’s weird is, some notes are read aloud while others are not. There are some messages that haven’t been translated into English.\n\nMost of the game is navigating gigantic, boring mazes in the dark. Not much really else to do. Just wander around aimlessly down long boring hallways until you figure out what the game wants you to do next. Sure, there’s a few monsters, but their AI and animations are pretty rudimentary.\n\nThe game is plagued with really minor obstacles that block passageways. What made it worse was, while trying to find my way through some mazes, I accidentally went over quite a few of them and trapped myself and had to reload from a LOOOOONG time ago.\n\nI’ve died in the game a number of times from invisible threats. The game’s glitches (like invisible obstacles in normal pathways) would cause me to die.\n\nGet ready to see a LOT of recycled assets. Buildings copied / pasted. 10,000 garbage cans in the hallways. Whoever brought all these garbage cans down here had to steal an entire neighborhood’s worth.\n\nThe point is… it’s a bad game. You can skip it. It’s boring. It’s not scary. It’s glitchy. If it sounds like I’m being a little harsh on an indie title, well, there’s a massive problem with that argument. Most of the scariest and revolutionary horror titles were built on a shoestring budget. Fear isn’t something that’s polished with money. It’s the art of instilling the right or, ya know… wrong messages into the mind of the viewer.  Save your money or play something else.\n","October 2, 2015","false","6.0"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

Rest assured, though, that soon enough you encounter some stairs which you can actually traverse, though possibly not enough of them in the course of the game to justify the title.\n\nWhatever the case, there's definitely no denying that there's some spooky-♥♥♥♥♥ moments in this game - even one truly inspired section involving a series of Will-o'-the-Wisps (Google it if you gotta) - though quite what these developers mean when they say "psychological horror", I have honestly no idea.

Plus it was SCARY and that's worth the money alone. :)\n\nThe only criticisms are with a part where you cross wooden bridges (falling through them was very glitchy for me before I learned the trick) and the ending was too abrupt.  I was lost as to what the story was supposed to mean at the end so if you like a good zinger its not to be found.  It felt like they planned to do more but ran out of time.  Unfortunate but forgivable given the great gameplay involved here.","October 4, 2015","true","3.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

Happy Halloween! This is Gamer Wolf (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of the latest psycholigical horror game, Stairs!\n\n(NOTE: This game was reviewed using a key provided by the Developer)\n\nVideo Review:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oJf58kVpX0\n\nThe "Too Long, Didn't Watch" Review:\n\nAtmospheric, psycholgical horror game done well. Great music, great visuals. Good immersive environment. Less reliance on jump scares, leans more on feelings of despair, being trapped, etc. Solid effort. 3.5/5. Worth it at under $10.\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nThe gameplay is VERY familiar. You are armed with your journal (for notes/hints) and your camera (for, well, taking pictures). As you take the pictures found throughout the scenes, you piece together the clues to this story. Stairs is actually inspired by real-life events (with a little fiction thrown in for good measure). The atmosphere is quite immersive, as the deeper down you go the more you become filled with anxiety and the feeling you really are trapped in some godless maze. The music definitley helps, as it is quite creepy and very well done. I love this soundtrack. While this game is not really groundbreaking in any way, it is good fun. It also seems to be quite linear, as nothing seems to be different while playing again. This may effect replayability for some, particularily those gamers that colelct ALL the hints before moving on to the next stage. All in all, it's a fine, solid effort from GreyLight Entertainment and Digital Tribe. 3.5/5and certainly worth under $10.\n\nHappy Gaming!!!","October 31, 2015","true","1.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

One the one hand, the game's stunning looks and sound design create a very thick atmosphere that will make your hair stand up on more than one occasion. On the other hand, the game's puzzles tend to be rather simplistic, and the while the developers do their best to mess with your mind in the first part of the game via illusions and similar means, these sadly are not used again safe for a very short passage near the (very abrupt) end of the game. That you'll be through the game in only about four hours doesn't help either.\n\nLong story short: If you want something creepy to play through in one evening, Stairs does a decent job of scratching that itch. If, however, you want a bit more bang for your buck, there are other horror titles that keep you occupied for much longer.","November 1, 2015","true","4.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

STAIRS is a first-person atmospheric psychological horror game that takes players through the stories of three missing people as seen through the eyes of journalist Christopher Adams. Start preparing yourself now, for to descend down these steps is to descend into madness.\n\nSTAIRS is inspired by real-life events, twisted into an original tale of terror, despair and sadness. Using a camera and journal, players set out to unravel the grizzly mysteries behind three stories - Valerie Berkley, a high school graduate; James Reed, a young businessman; and Jean Jowars Remens, a charismatic pastor. What happened to them? What do they have to do with each other? Creep down the stairs and discover the truth for yourself… if you dare. - Highly Recommended!","November 27, 2015","true","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A girl trapped in a room asks for your help so like I said before puzzles and figuring out a combination to a lock but the scene gets really creepy.

You can tell this game is very polished, and a lot of effort has been put into it. I had to replay the introduction once, and even though I knew everything that was going to happen, I was still on edge the entire time, which is incredible! You can watch my let's play below!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLElbMcLPLI&index=1&list=PLKMxTuqznyPMODHArEogwk4hgzXLSheUm\nThe graphics in the game are simply superb for an indie game. I mean, the sun in the intro was such a small detail, yet I've never seen a more realistic sun, other than in real life. The story is intriguing and captivating, which many indie games usually fail at. There are a few bugs in the game, but this is expected and in no way detrimental to the gameplay. Occasionally you’ll have white flashes in the game which somewhat kills the immersion, but the game does a great job of pulling you back in. Something else I noticed is that when you can do little jumps, even though you're not supposed to be able to, by crouching and standing back up. This allows to get you over a few obstacles, but since you're not supposed to do that you will either fall out of the map, or ruin a sequence. So don't try! And hopefully the developer will fix this in a patch!

A psychological horror game.\n\nI saw mixed reviews and so I took a shot. I haven't been let down but I expected a tiny bit more.. . Game is not long at all.\n\nPros:The game is slow to start creeping you out but it gets good.  Its tension and suspense building is great. Story is good enough to stay engaged. and the music/sounds are very creepy.\n\nCons: It has a maze-like level design, I found myself often going in circles. The voice acting isn't all great, but still passes off beliveable. The game may look like a big budget horror game from the trailers, but its more or less like Slender: The Arrival, minus the slender man.\n\nYou play as journalist Christopher Adams. Who goes investigating a story about 3 people who have disappeared; high School greaduate Valarie Berkley, James Reed, a businessman, and Jean J. Remens, a pastor.

At first, blush, it seems spooky and edgy -- you have a little girl locked up in an abandoned factory.  Much (if not most) of the game is in the dark and so there is, at least a first, a hint of horror involved.\n\nEventually, however, what becomes stalking along cautiously in the dark becomes walking through endless corridors in the dark.  The more I played the game, the more I became convinced that the term "atmopheric psychological horror" was code for "the developer either didn't want to finish the game or lost interest and so the development team had most of it take place in the dark".\n\nThe story is neither original, nor compelling.  I can't believe how quickly apathy and disinterest seized me.  The photography -- as a journalist you are supposed to snap pictures of certain views, objects, and scenes -- seem pointless and don't serve to move the story forward.  Would it have been that difficult to just put the task of taking photos on the player and then the game itself rated the "quality" of the photos?  There is at least one other game that does this and it would have been infinitely more interesting.\n\nThe puzzles, what few there are, seem as pointless as the plot.  So why exactly does this dude have a safe in the basement of the factory?  And why exactly does he have the code scattered around where he can't possibly find it?  What's that you say?  Yes, this is nothing new for a puzzler -- quite often the solutions seem unrealistic or the scenarios unbelievable.  But this just highlights the frustration with this game -- you can't even suspend the basic level of disbelief that you need to order to play a puzzler.\n\nI will continue to play this game to the end only, ONLY, because I paid for it.  It is a waste of time and money -- I'm angry that I paid $7 for it, I can't imagine how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off I would be if I paid $14 or $15.\n\nStep away from the keyboard!","January 2","false","0.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Now, psychological horror is by far my favourite kind of horror, but I’m always so skeptical when anything is labeled as a psychological horror because that’s most people’s favourite kind of horror and marketers know that. They wrongfully label media as psychological horror, when it’s really just filled with jumpscares or is just a played-out run and hide horror.\n\nThis game is, most of the time rightfully labeled. There are exactly two really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ (there’s really no other way of describing it) sections of the game, where you are kinda sneaking around and have to avoid enemies. These are by far the weakest sections of the game, not even scary, just tedious and boring. Luckily, this is just two short sections of the game, and most of the time the game is doing something interesting, either from a mechanical viewpoint or an atmospherical viewpoint and sometimes both at the same time.\n\nIt certainly borrows from other games, most notably Outlast with the camera, but it’s different enough that it definitely doesn’t feel like a clone of anything in particular. In fact, it does a LOT of things with a real dash of originality and once or twice, I felt like it was genius. Now it might just be that I haven’t played much in the horror genre, but a lot of this game was really fresh and it has it’s own identity.\n\nQuick example, at one point in the game you walk into a bathroom. Everything seems ok, but then you spot shoes underneath the stall and your stomach drops a little. You approach, open the door, and it turns out it was just, shoes. There are quite a lot of different flourishes like that in this game that really bring out a tentative smile in the player.\n\nThe game also looks pretty good, aside from the models on some of the creatures, though I did experience some screen tearing and I think three crashes. Bear in mind this was a review copy so that might not be true on release, but the performance is ok.\n\nI’ll be honest, this game really subverted my expectations, I thought this was going to be a typical jumpscare filled horror but for the most part it was an atmospheric experience that really grated on my nerves with unidentified shapes at the end of long corridors and some clever camera-work that dissociates the player from reality.\n\nAnd the real kicker? I finished this game, completely terrified. Bear in mind that I don’t really work well with horror, but I think everyone but the most hardened horror fans will feel this game is REALLY scary.\n\nAnd I think it’s probably priced reasonably too. The developers couldn’t give me anything exact, but around $10 is the ballpark, and I think that’s worth it. The game lasted about three hours for me? I think you could finish it in two if you were rushing, but I think for $10 3 hours is relatively substantial, and the quality is high too. I’ve seen much worse games priced at much higher prices.\n\nSo if you enjoy horror, I’m tempted to say this is a must play. You certainly won’t be disappointed, and if you’re like me you’ll really appreciate the atmosphere, and you end up in a few different environments which is cool too.

That isn't necessarily a bad thing but those looking for a quick jump scare are unlikely to find it. What Stairs does have is plenty of detail and palpable tension in the long, dark, hallways of this strange underground facility. When you begin the story you are just an eager reporter looking to make a name for himself. Things begin to get strange when the person you thought was dead, isn't dead at all. This begins the strange twisted tale that has you taking pictures to advance the story elements. Also there is some puzzles even though I haven't managed to reach them, yet. Sadly, Stairs is quite buggy. I found myself getting stuck in terrain quite frequently. Also the game is littered with junk laid about that brings your characters sprint to a complete halt. This feels jarring as you move about the game, you feel like a rat in a maze and can only go certain ways. This isn't helped by the fact that many spots in the game are incredibly dark and make finding your way a bleeding nightmare at times. Despite these hiccups Stairs has plenty of potential for delicious horror, the story starts off slow and feels like a freight train picking up speed. Who knows what terror awaits at the end of the game. It's possible there isn't any at all but I like to stay positive. The game is gorgeous designed(when there is light and you can see it) and soundtrack/effects are on spot. The voice acting is well done and I personally can't wait to see what is at the bottom of the Stairs. I just hope it isn't grandma.\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/3a-p8gjzDO0\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","September 28, 2015","true","0.7"," 9 of 25 people (36%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","36","9","25","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rmzfm/recommended/374060/","rmzfm","rmz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rmzfm/","259 products in account","STAIRS is a first-person atmospheric psychological horror game, that takes players through the stories of three missing people as seen through the eyes of journalist Christopher Adams. That's what it says on the storefront at least. I would call it more of a suspense walking simulator. It reminded me of Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs and Doorways, still being a bit different than the former and better than the latter.\n\nAs was said, this is a first person suspense walking simulator. There is only one instance when you have to actively avoid things more or less hunting you, several more points where you can die due to environmental hazards. Despite this the creepiness is here and a few moments, especially on the first and last levels, can raise that lingering dread feeling. Overall the game should take between 3 and 4 hours to finish.\n\nI liked:\n* the creepy atmosphere\n* the graphics\n\nI disliked:\n* the mines (every mines in them horror games are the same and boring)\n* the bugs (the game crashed on me and/or malfunctioned a few times)\n* fragmented story\n\nGet this if:\n* if you like creepy walking simulators\n\nDon't get this if:\n* you expect a scary game\n* you want to kill/outmaneuver scary monsters","January 9","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fun while it lasted, but ultimately broken and some of the puzzle 'hints' make zero sense. If you're looking at Stairs, I'd suggest just running up and down a flight of them.

I never thought that it pulled any cheap punches, none of the scares were cheap or random. The scary moments were either well deserved or you knew it was coming but didn't know when.\n\nDuring my play, I really enjoyed  both the ambient soundtrack and sound fx, but it was the silence that really surprised me. I haven't seen many games take advantage of not having any music playing, its just you and your footsteps and.....well, you'll find out. :)\n\nI recommend this. Well polished, great atmosphere. A bit short, but it wasn't that expensive of a game. I do have some technical issues that I think the developer could use to improve some instances of gameplay, but unless they contact me I won't waste anyone's time going through them here.\n\nI recommend this.

You will find creepy things, hear voices, see things that are not supposed to exist. During the whole game, you will go deeper, and deeper, hence the name Stairs. You don't spend the whole game in a stairwell, the stairs are just a mean to go deeper, and the deeper you get, the more f*cked up things will be. You are supplied with a flashlight and a camera, which will turn out the be extremely important.\n\nAbout the negative things: Nothing made sense at the end of the game, and the end itself seems pretty botched. It's like the devs didn't know how to end the game and they decided to end it abruplty without enough explanation. Either it's a really sh*tty ending, or maybe I didn't understand the subtlety of it. After all, I didn't get the achievement called "The Truth Behind the Lies", so I probably missed things!\n\nI totally recommend the game nonetheless.","June 6","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
