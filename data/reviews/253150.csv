The game looks, runs, and sounds great, with its pixel style retro look and low key, mood setting sci-fi soundtrack. Without even playing, I could tell this would be something I would enjoy on principle alone, but then I played it.\n\nThe game flow is par the course for the genre. You move, they move until one side is dead. However, in Halfway, the mechanics are the first stumble. People who've played in the genre can guess the nuances: there's cover bonuses for you and the enemy, certain weapon types perform better up close or far away, and each squad member even has unique statistics and abilities. Some can cover more ground, others can take more hits. Very quickly, however, I realized that while all the pieces and formulas for a great game are there, Halfway seems to have skewed the numbers diastrously. Spot an enemy out of cover down a hall, well within your weapon's given effective range? Expect a base 25-30% chance to hit: that's all. You can, fortunately, give up your squaddie's move for that turn in exchange for increased accuracy, but wait, it merely climbs to 50-55%, if that. Expect several turns where neither side will land a hit. Then you need to spend AP to reload, which makes firing without that accuracy bonus pointless. Oh, and now the enemy's shields are back up. Whoops, now you're out of ammo. Yes, in a game where you're at the mercy of 10-50% chances to hit, you are stuck with limited ammunition. In one mission, I spent fifteen minutes chasing two enemy units around a circular room. They couldn't hit me, but I had run out of ammo from missing my own attacks as well, so I had to resort to punching them to death.\n\nWell, perhaps my two scrubs would grow up to be gunslinging badasses. I was wrong. I pushed on, and soon my squad jumped up to five. While they all had various, interesting specializations, the game was still taking far longer than it needed too, and not just for the mechanical failings stated above. Halfway is also lacking in several minor mechanics that, when paired with its skewed mechanics, it all build up to an annoyance I can't deal with. No auto-ending turns, no auto-switching after a squaddie uses up his turn, no access to options unless you're at the title screen, very little explanation for the statistics.\n\nHalfway would be a spectacular addition to the genre. It almost seems silly to not recommend it solely because hit chances are too low, but while playing, this creates such a maddening environment that I cannot stomach  playing for more than a mission at a time. Guns are useless, and cover and tactics doesn't matter when you're chasing mutants up and down hallways to beat them to death. Playing like that shatters the mood of the game and the point of the genre, and as far as I'm concerned, that is inexcuseable.","September 25, 2014","false","5.7"," 165 of 188 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","165","188","3","0"

I couldn't find much data about Halfway; not from reviews online, not from videos on YouTube.  After he revised his review to be more positive, I decided to buy it.  I'm really glad I did.\n\nThe "complaints" about this game are doing it a grave injustice.  For 11 dollars, I have zero complaints.  The storyline is interesting, the characters each have their own personality and abilities, and I love the music.  Thematically, it reminds me of System Shock 2 or Dead Space.  What irritated me most was the complaint about characters not leveling up.  Every game nowadays seems to include xp and leveling simply to have that mechanic in the game.  It doesn't matter if it adds anything, gameplay-wise; it's just a matter of having numbers that get higher.\n\nThe way Halfway handles progression is by giving you better weapons -- plasma rifles and flak shotguns -- and it works well.  I don't feel a lack of game without experience points.\n\nIf you're on the fence and NOT expecting an AAA title, but rather a solid and fun game from an indie developer, then I strongly recommend Halfway.","July 23, 2014","true","7.2"," 182 of 216 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","182","216","0","4"

The game has amazing pixel art and a great soundtrack - my favorite since Dustforce's! However, let me bullet point why I feel Halfway is just a "Halfway" done game.\n\n1- The storyline starts off with a cool half-life type premise. Aliens invading from another dimension. And it happens when the ship jumps, its a cool concept. But the game does not tell you anything for 5 hours of play about why this is happening. For me this was just too much investment to learn so little.\n\n2- Combat starts off neat with each character you control having a passive ability and a unique ability to them. The way you increase your power is by equipping better weapons and using stims to increase stats permanently. The problem is that there is a serious lack of variety in weapons...the only thing different between the guns is their range and damage output. This gets boring very quickly as you find out that sniper rifles are the best in every situation due to their long range, ultra high damage, and mid-range magazine. There is no real reason to equip any other gun you get. The same can be said about the armors as well. The game trivializes its own item choices and hampers you with a very small inventory system so that you do not want to keep any other guns around.\n\n3- Repetition of design. This game is a linear story with static level design. There is no randomness about this. Now this is not a flaw by itself, but it becomes a flaw whenever each level is the same as the last for five hours. There is very little character interaction, story developments, and interesting combat challenges that make the levels fun. I had fun for the first two hours as I learned the game. My last three hours have been boring and repetitious. Combat is not very interesting as there is not a lot of elements to engage you to move your troops around. You basically shoot until you hit, not needing to get to better cover or use a weapon at the right time. This made me cry as a tactical gamer.\n\n4- Itembase. After each mission you get to go to the store to buy goods but you can never buy anything worthwhile, just ammo, shield, medikit, and grenade refills. This sucks! The store gives you nothing to look forward to and should be a reward mechanism in the game. This makes the store feel like an after thought...why not just cram extra refills of stuff in each mission and skip the damn store.\n\nTL DR - The storyline, combat, items, and character interaction all suffer from a lot of repetition. I love xcom, the ufo series, jagged alliance, and a lot of other story driven/tactical based games like mass effect..and even indie games that bear a lot of repetition of combat like risk of rain...but this game never does anything interesting with the game foundation it sets up.","July 27, 2014","false","5.7"," 173 of 231 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","173","231","0","17"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/recommended/253150/","kschang77","kschang77","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/","993 products in account","Halfway is a horror/survival/tactical squad combat game that is part Aliens, part XCOM lite. The plot is simple enough... You are aboard the colony ship on a journey to another planet when you were awakened in a dark ship, signs of combat everywhere, nobody around. What is going on? What happened to the crew of thousands? As you explore the ship, you encounter / rescue other survivors, each with some special abilities, and enemies that seem to have taken over the ship. Can you figure out what is going on, and find a way to get out alive?\n\nThe game is drawn in an 2D view with a complete cover system, and the somewhat low-res look is retro-ish and rather charming without overly distracting. The game lets you walk around in "real-time" until enemies are encountered, then it becomes a turn-based game where you and enemy alternate turns, all of his units vs. all of yours. You will also have to rummage through containers looking for supplies, such as health kits, shield rechargers, better weapons, and grenades. Occasionally you'll run into hypos that will enhance your stats. Each character has 3 stats: health, agility, and aim. Health is your hitpoints, agility is how far you can move per turn, and aim is how well you aim your weapon.\n\nCombat is simple: each character has 2 action points per turn. It can be spent on shooting, moving, or misc actions such as "use medpack", "reload weapon", and so on. If you have no visible target you can also set your guy to "retaliate", which means s/he will shoot at any enemies that fired on him/her during the enemy turn, but only once.  You can mix actions, like shoot then move, move then reload, and so on, or just make a long-distance dash. There is no "reaction fire" or initiative in this game, only retaliation fire, which can be somewhat frustrating to veteran players of other turn-based tactical games. But once you get used to the mechanic it works just fine.\n\nThere are multiple types of enemies as you advance through the plot, and the difficulty starts ramping up, but you also get better weapons to compensate. The simple Mk I weapons don't do that much damage, but are adequate against the weak enemies you encounter. By endgame you have to wield Mk III weapons that do much more damage. you also encounter armor that initially provide little protection, but by endgame you'll encounter Mk V or even Mk VI armor that provides tremendous protection, but enemies can do a lot of damage as well, and is heavily protected.\n\nCover mechanic is very important, as a "full cover" imposes a -30% to-hit penalty on enemy shots, and that can be significant. Half cover only gives enemy a 15% penalty.\n\nYour armor can reduce incoming damage as well as outright absorb damage with its built-in shielding. The shield automatically recharges after a few turns, and if you can't wait that long you can use a shield recharge pack to recharge it at expense of 1 action point. They come on small (5 pt), medium (10 pt) or large (20 pt) sizes. Similarly, medpacks, also comes in small / 5, medium / 10, or large /20 sizes except they heal your HP.\n\nEach character also comes with a special ability. One guy has a "radar" that can reveal all bad guys on the map (obviously that's moot the next turn, but it's good to have an idea). One can paralyze an enemy for several turns. Another can overload an enemy's shield (i.e. no shield for X turns). Yet another can teleport. To win the battle you will need to figure how how best to deploy the assets that you have, be it grenades, armor, weapons, but also the special skills of each member of the team. Usually you can only deploy 4 members out of 8, so choosing whom to bring and how to equip them is a major consideration.\n\nFortunately, as mentioned before, you are welcome to search the boxes for supplies. You can also recycle anything you no longer need (like obsolete weapons and armor) so you can use the energy to synthesize stuff that you do need. Killing bad guys also yields additional energy.\n\nThe enemies in this game have different tactics. Some dance at a distance, some rush, but all are nasty.\n\nIf one of your team members had fallen in combat, don't worry just yet. If you can defeat the current batch of enemies, the member will recover (with 1 HP) at conclusion of that combat phase. However, keep in mind that each mission can have multiple combat phases.\n\nAs you explore the ship, you can go on "side missions" which will yield additional loot, and adds to the background of each character.\n\nHaving completed the campaign, I'd say I enjoyed this game quite a bit. It is occasionally frustrating, but usually due to my poor tactical sense or lack of preparation (bringing the wrong team members or wrong equipment). If you like the tactical turn-based combat genre, you should give this game a try.","May 22, 2015","true","41.7"," 57 of 59 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","57","59","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/253150/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","I was surprised Halfway hasn't gotten more attention, what with XCOM and other turn-based squad games being so popular in recent years. The promised sci-fi stylings and tactical combat made it an easy sale purchase for me, despite the lack of buzz around it. Now that I'm nearing the end of the game I think I can understand why it flew under the radar, but I also think it deserves a little more attention for what it accomplishes.\n\nHalfway starts you off in control of Morten Lannis, a space marine-looking dude aboard a junky colony ship called the Goliath. He's come out of cryosleep way too early only to find the ship overrun with some very unfriendly types, and it's up to you to help him survive. The way you do this is very similar to how XCOM or the recent Shadowrun games operate. Outside of combat you can move around freely, talk with people, and loot containers. Combat is turn-based, with each of your characters having two (and only two) action points per turn. These points can move them around the grid maps (distance dependent on their agility stat) to find cover, attack enemies, reload weapons, use items, and so on.\n\nIt's a very familiar system with only two real stand-outs, the aiming system and the Retaliate option. Veterans of XCOM will notice that the hit percentages in Halfway are really, really low. Starting out, you're going to see a lot of 40-60% shots even from just a few squares away. The reason for this is that you can add action points to your attack to boost its accuracy. A one-point assault rifle shot may only sit at 50%, but adding your other point might kick it up to 75%. This is less important for shotguns but vitally important for sniper rifles, which have very low base percents but get a huge jump from the second point, simulating the need to set up and aim. As for Retaliate, it replaces the familiar Overwatch response with a sort of revenge, where your character returns fire only if attacked. It's not a bad idea but has very limited functionality in practice, and you're usually better off healing up or reloading if you have an extra action point to spend.\n\nAdditional characters will join you as you progress, each with their own stats and special abilities. There's plenty of gear to find, including armor (which uses Halo-style recharging shields), grenades, and stimpaks which can permanently raise character stats. You'll need to use everything you find because enemies in this game do not screw around. The campaign spans about two dozen missions, some optional, some multi-part, and all pretty harrowing. Enemies follow the same rules you do, terrible hit percentages and all, but very quickly the game starts stacking the numerical odds against you. By the mid-game you'll be facing up to a dozen foes at once, with the potential to lose a character in a single turn if you're not careful (dead characters revive at the end of combat).\n\nThis is where the game starts to grate, because not only is it a long haul through tons of enemies, there's not much variety to the enemies or the combat. For the first 5-6 hours, you're going to be blasting melee dudes and ranged dudes. Only after the halfway point of the game will you start seeing things other than dudes, but this includes things like heavily-armored turrets that only really add to the frustration. Failing a long mission after a bunch of samey combat is incredibly discouraging, and there are some missions in the middle where this is very likely. Missing three 80% shots in a row is very much a thing that can happen, and I definitely went back and forth between enjoying and raging at Halfway for a few nights, I'll admit.\n\nAfter my last bout of frustration, though, I soon found myself eager to get back to the story. For all the flaws of the combat, the story and atmosphere of Halfway is fantastic. Each of the characters is unique and they all have important relationships that play out through the plot. The banter between them is excellent, with plenty of genuinely funny moments. Even the basic "ship under siege" plot has some interesting twists to explore. All of this is told against a surprisingly deep backdrop of dystopian future society, where people are separated by classes and basic human rights have been reduced to an alarming degree.\n\nThe pixel art is top-notch, with smooth animations, cool visual effects, and fantastic little details to find on every map. Sound is up to the task as well, with some really meaty weapon and hit sounds and a somber soundtrack reminiscent of FTL or Risk of Rain. The interface suffers from some bugs, however, making it hard to click on certain option or map elements, and it's bad enough to be distracting. Between that and the combat frustrations I did consider giving up on Halfway a few times, but I'm glad I stuck it out. For the price it's a rich and engaging strategy game that'll last you 15-20 hours, provided you have the patience to push through the rough parts.","January 13","true","9.8"," 44 of 49 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","44","49","0","0"

That said, it's a really well done game about 50% the way through, and then the whole system falls apart at the end.  Really poor balance of gear and stat buffs vs. the enemies, so the only way to get through to the end is to kinda put everyone on overwatch until you can create a hallway of death your enemies will blindly charge into.  There are also several characters you have the option of bringing with you that are just huge liabilities to your team, while others are quite overpowered.

From the soundtrack, to the unique enemies and battlefields, this game always leaves me guessing. I soon choose favorites among my squad, which was a mistake. The new types of enemies made it very difficult to roll out with the same squad every battle and expect to come out ahead. Although this 8-bit game doesn't reinvent the turn-based strategy wheel, it does change things i feel are for the better. Unlike X-com, your squad doesn't level up based on combat experience. There are stims which increase attributes and weapons to be found on almost every map. No one dies, they are rendered unconscious until combat ends, (which doesn't always mean ending the level)\n\nRecently there was the addition of a map editor, which i have yet to try, but I'm very excited to dive into. I've been told that there will be a place where you can upload your own maps, and be able to play on other's.\n\nAll in all, this game was exciting (and freakin difficult) until the very end.

The game labels itself as an RPG, but there are very few, if any RPG elements. All encounters only have one flavor: Combat. And even in combat, most of the levels have very few solutions. In other words: Try to find out what the designer intended, and if you don't, restart the level. This becomes especially true later on in the game where when your team is very underpowered and enemies become abhorrently hard and come in large numbers.\n\nThe game features a save system that only allows you to save at your "home base", meaning that if you missclick and cause one of your characters to walk somewhere in combat you didn't mean to, you'll have a great chance of failing the encounter and you'll have to start over. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME, it is unfortunately abysmal in its execution. There are many better games out there if you want turn based combat, like Shadowrun (the RPG, not the FPS).

You can't predict what kind of stragey/team/equipment you need for each mission, and the whole play is mostly guess-and-fail; trying something little different and failing again... at the beginning the enemies are almost too easy and after some missions they are way too numerous. Using time to plan missions over and over again is not worth the empty  plot.

I played a LOT of XCOM on Ironman Impossible. A. LOT. I know what it means to roll on numbers. But Halfway is seriously overcalculating my shot percentages before the shot actually goes out.\n\n74% usually feels like 40% based on my experience. I raged-quit after my dedicated sniper missed 3 of those in a row, followed by a 90% shot that failed.\n\nProtip: Expect anything, ANYTHING, under 100% hit chance to miss. Also, don't assume this same rule applies to enemy. If they can hit you, they will probably hit you. Spec your characters to have a high aim chance, give them heavy weapons, and armor with damage mitigation.\n\nDodge chance and movement rage are underwhelming as stats.

Im a big fan of the Xcom games and Halfway claimed to be the next closest thing, This of course is not the case. The combat system is relatively similar to Xcom, only  there are a lot of flaws and can't help but feel that the game is broken.\n\nThe accuracy system doesnt seem to be very consistent. Some times when an enemy is round the corner from you, it will let you fire at the enemy with a very low accuaracy rating or will say the target is not visible all together when it clearly is, it is quite temperamentel. Regardless of this minor problem the system still seems flawed. A member of your team could be standing two tiles in front of an enemy with no cover an you will still only have around 30% to 40% chance of hitting them. Although you can upgrade the aim of the character with stimpacks which are rare an dont seem to do much as well as sacrificing a go to improve the accuracy, the accuracy system feels frustratingly flawed.\n\nWhen it comes to enemes, nine times out of ten they will have the advantage with improved aim, damage and movement. The enemies tend to go head on rather than flank you unless of course you wonder into an ambush. It seems the shots they take barely miss and the amount of tiles they can cover are a lot more than any of your characters regardless of upgrades.\n\nTo be fair, for all the faults, the game could have probably redeemed itself with a decent "overwatch" system. But no, disapointment is still upon us. The game uses a crappy "retaliate" system in which a player will only strike an enemy if they are fired upon while the enemy has their turn.\n\nI wanted to like this game, unfortunatley all it is is an extremely watered down Xcom game with all the flaws and none of the perks. 4/10","September 1, 2014","false","3.8"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","20","25","0","0"

It's normal to look back and remember the game fondly but I'm not going to pretend that Halfway doesn't have it's share of frustrating problems. Your enjoyment of the game is going to depend on how well you manage said frustration.\n\nFirst make sure you turn off the dialog sound as it becomes grating very quickly, follow that up by turning the footsteps volume down and make sure you are changing between your characters with your keyboard numbers. Next be prepared to accept that your going to miss a lot of shots on your enemies in the game due to the wonky percentage numbers.\n\nNow on to what you can enjoy! The game really picks up as soon as your start filling your squad out and each encounter against the enemy can be quite the tactical tug of war. If you enjoy turn based battles where you are going to have to think about the potential consequence of the moves you make then Halway is certainly for you. Said encounters can be quite slow paced at times but then that's all going to depend on your style of play and what squad members you bring on missions.\n\nSide missions will pop up from time to time as you make your way through the main quest and these will normally lead to new squad members, items such and medikits or weapons and armour. They are a decent dsitraction and it's not possible to miss them (they show up in bright yellow) should you be a completionsit like myself :)\n\nAs for the story? It's a decent enough story that deserves seeing through until the end with a bit of mystey thrown in alongside your usual space fare. The music as you can tell by the trailer is great and really captures the struggle you face against an enemy that often outnumbers you.\n\nFinally - remember to take all of your squad members in to the final mission! Makes it a lot more managable.","August 30, 2015","true","20.0"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

The further you get into the game the more often you'll find yourself with unconsious teammates waiting until the battle is over if you win. And Squad Sizes are always no more than 4 to start the mission with, even though you have 8 people to choose from. There is also a 5 level limit to how often you can safetly level up your characters, after that it will either make them stronger or alter another stat entirely for better or worse.\n\nBut then the unthinkable happened. A boss fight requiring me to play as four set people, with two other squadmates I barely used during the game. So I ended up with one person who could aim decently, two shotgun guys that couldnt get close enough to anything before they died in an open room, and another girl who I was thankful she could just shoot bullets in the enemies direction. Top that off with enemies I had to use my most powerful sniper rifles just to put a dent into and it quickly became disaster. The game throughts you for a loop as at this time your so used to only having four members on the team on mission, but it allows you to play as all eight, the mission may actually be doable now.\n\nThe music is excellent, story is decent. My only complaint is a steep challenge, but game is fun playing a couple of missions every day.","October 29, 2014","true","14.4"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","0"

The story reminds me very much of System Shock 2. The gameplay is cumbersome and very repetitive. There is a lot of dialogue to read (white on black....my eyes like that). Inventory management is gruesome. If you are full of stuff, you can't put stuff on the floor to grab and use a medkit that is in a locker. You have to for example reload your gun to open an inventory slot.\n\nThe biggest problem is, that the missions are all the same. Grab your sniper rifles (you don't need much else) and kill everything.

It seemed to have everything I like. I like indie games, I like pixel art, I like sci-fi, and the footage I saw reminded me of XCOM mashed up with Aliens (one of my favourite movies of all time), so I figured I'd give it a shot.\n\nUnfortunately, this game does not deliver. The combat is slow and grindy, the UI is clunky, the inventory management is a pain, the story is uninspired, the characters are completely flat, and the dialogue feels like it was written by a twelve year old.\n\nIt's a shame, because this game has a lot of potential. You shouldn't be able to go wrong with a game focused on XCOM-style combat, but this game manages to take that winning formula and dial it back a notch. Most notably, this game lacks an Overwatch feature, and instead has "Retaliation", which can be fine, but only if an enemy decides to target that specific soldier. This makes it difficult to plan any sort of tactical maneuvers aside from "sit in cover and shoot when it's your turn". And, unfortunately, that isn't even fun because many enemies are hit-point dumps and are tedious to fight.\n\nIn addition, the RNG feels broken - you seem to miss all of the time unless your projected hit percentage is over 80%. I don't know if this is a bug or not, but it was extremely noticeable, especially in the earlier levels.\n\nThe game's environments are beautiful and highly detailed, but beyond that, there is a marked lack of content. There are hardly any interactable objects aside from a few switches and crates, and the game is sorely lacking in enemy types. After five hours into this game, I have only fought zombies and turrets. That's it. There are no security robots, no drones, no aliens, no corporate troopers or anything that could spice up the variety at all. There are a few different zombie types but they are mostly indistinguishable aside from different colored uniforms. There aren't even any passive combat elements like traps or land mines. All you do is plug one zombie after another, in battles that can take a long time to finish.\n\nAnother strange note I feel I should mention is the music. While well composed, it felt oddly depressing for some reason. I'm not exactly sure why this is. Perhaps I just felt that slow, languid synths just didn't fit the theme of an action-horror game.\n\nI think it's quite telling that this game has been available for a year, but only 5% of people who own it have acquired the end-game achievement. Also, this game is fully Steam-workshop enabled, but there are no mods. Like, at all. One person has made a spanish language translation, but otherwise, there seems to be absolutely nothing available.\n\nI'm sad to say it, but I regret buying Halfway. I don't know if I'll finish it. I'm a real sucker for sci-fi (even bad ones), but playing this game has felt like a chore, and I'm not sure I want to dump more hours into a game that has disappointed me at every turn.\n\nBuyer beware.","August 23, 2015","false","7.6"," 27 of 42 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","27","42","0","1"

Somehow on a team of three people they've managed to provide a rich and engrossing experience.\n\nI really hope they consider expansions, or using the very nice game engine here to create new worlds.\n\nMy only gripe is the lack of a feature to automatically switch to the last available action or auto-end turns, which is really pretty standard in turn-based games and gets a little irritating to handle yourself after a while. It can screw up the pacing. But ultimately this is a rather small complaint.","July 24, 2014","true","39.5"," 36 of 59 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","36","59","0","0"

It still has a long way to go as far as balancing goes but thankfully the devs have been hard at work balancing the game over multiple patches.\n\nPrior to today's balance patch for the final missions, the game somewhat depended on RNG regarding gear drops. I wasn't too thrilled with that after playing the game twice to uncover more secrets and therefore more gear. Fortunately, that same issue has been alleviated with the patch.\n\nI would have liked to see greater variation in the character stats. It would be beneficial in my opinion to work with stats in the hundreds rather than the tens so that you could see a major difference between characters. When working with low stat pools, even with stim packs, the characters tend to become similar. The only thing left to differentiate their usefulness is with their passive and active skills.\n\nAside from a few random crashes here and there on the first day of playing, the game was good overall. I thoroughly enjoyed the challenge of the last few missions pre-patch and I'm hoping others can enjoy that too.\n\n","July 28, 2014","true","29.1"," 25 of 39 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","25","39","0","0"

As the SN is my favorite weapon, I never head out on a mission unless I have at least Sam or Jenna in my party (usually Sam for the guaranteed crit with Headshot). Little did I realize that RNG is very deceptive in this crap game.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I enjoyed the setting and story and all that. My biggest beef comes from the design of the encounters. The small fry are no problem, but in the later levels, I find myself having multiple issues with the insanely stupid hit chance. In one mission alone, I had three out of four characters miss with a 75% chance or greater in consecutive shots while enemies deal better damage and hit with better "precision" despite two conditions: my characters are in full cover and are almost on the other side of the room, far out of operational range for ranged weapons (or so I thought). Multiple times, I found myself raging hard at shots that would otherwise be hits (especially in XCOM; I've never had high hit chances miss multiple times in a row).\n\nAs for the design of levels, the only difference is the maps. Beyond that, the game conveniently has the ship jump just to spawn enemies. At one point, the game throws nothing but tough melee characters (complete with hard-as-steel shields, which waste one turn just trying to drop them on one enemy) that bullrush your party and hit like trucks in melee. Oddly enough, the damage ranges on the weapons tend to roll the lowest values in melee combat. The same can be said against the armored enemies, which have 1) tough shields, and 2) high damage reduction, which your party has no access to in any gear in the game.\n\nI really wanted to enjoy this game. But the difficulty wall slaps you in the face with an incredibly unfair RNG shot system, bullet-sponge enemies in later stages, questionable LOS system, and relatively useless characters later on (not to mention the virtual lack of any actual RPG elements in the game beyond the equipment and "special" abilities) make Halfway a promising tactical game that ran a suicide mission and ultimately failed.

It's similar to games like X-Com, though I would say probably not nearly as difficult. Character growth is entirely gear based with the exception of items called stims, which increase stats permanently. The game is fairly linear and has an intesting story, though said story is wide open for a sequel to explain things. The game will probably take around 12 hours to complete if you read and do everything, though it'll depend on your skill level.\n\nThe art style and music are nice, and definitely help the game sink deeper into the tone of the story. The game isn't really difficult unless using the "New Game Plus" mod, but unfortunately it doesn't seem like progress carries over, so it's mostly pure masochism mode as there are scores more enemies and they all have higher stats. That mod is optional, though. There are a bunch of modding tools, but there doesn't seem to be anyone making anything with them which is a shame.\n\nThe only criticisms I have are:\n\nFairly linear, with exception of single stage side missions\nLack of enemy variety\nShallower mechanics for a turn-based game\nCamera is kind of sluggish unless using WASD\nSome minor bugs, like incorrect text in tool tips, etc\nThat said, Halfway is plenty fun and doesn't drag out despite my criticisms.","October 12, 2015","true","21.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Lending more than just a cursory nod to the cult classic Laser Squad, this indie title sees you take control of a lone space marine onboard the spacecraft Goliath.  Out of control and lost in space the ship has been taken over by hostile aliens and randomly makes FTL jumps to who knows where.\n\nThe objective is to locate missing survivors, weapons and equipment in order to take back control of the ship across a single mostly linear campaign of around 30 missions.  Gameplay mostly consists of two phases; team and inventory management at a temporary base in one of the ships locations; switching to mission locations where simple objectives must be met, combat takes place and equipment can be scavenged.\n\nAlong with the management aspects combat is perhaps the game's biggest draw, making use of different firearms, grenades, unique soldier abilities, ammo conservation, healing with med-kits and a basic cover system to shield your team as they manouevre into position to flank visible enemies.  Exploration and mission set-up takes place in real-time.  Combat encounters are turn-based and are shown from a semi-isometric perspective.  Success sometimes depends on the personnel selected for the mission.\n\n\nTHE GOOD:\n+ Great setting/concept.\n+ Superb story narrative.  Well-written and perfectly conveyed through character dialogue.  No boring blocks of texts.  I loved it!\n+ Fast, fun, balanced combat mechanics.  Some depth but if you pick the right team can be easy to beat.\n+ A mix of easy and difficult levels.  There are some that are really well made and use dynamic elements such as teleporting or hidden enemies that lie in wait to ambush the team.  Adding that extra element to the challenge.\n+ Great end-boss encounter.  Difficult but fair.  A far-cry from so many other games of this type.\n+ Very slick interface that allows interchanging of items between team-mates or containers a breeze. Very similar in style to the Endless franchise of games.\n+ Team-mates dont die, they are merely incapacitated until the end of combat.\n+ Allows missions to be restarted from the beginning or the previous segment when at home-base, so you can reequip, re-arm, buy equipment from a dispenser or choose a different team.\n+ I started out thinking this would be a short game but came away thinking it was about as perfect a duration as Ive experienced in an indie game; at around 23hours.\n+ Doesnt need a state of the art PC to run.\n+ Zero problems/bugs encountered during playthrough.\n\nTHE BAD:\n- Graphics dont look so great on higher resolutions.\n- Character boosting is done using stimpacks. Making a mistake can be unforgiving.  Make sure you know which soldiers you want to use for ranged or close combat and max those out.\n- Enemies dont drop items.  They are only found in containers.  Probably the games worst feature. <sigh!>\n- Linear campaign means its not even semi-openworld.  There are seven optional mission though to allow you to gain some special items and a few extra pieces of equipment.\n- Once you visit a location grab everything because you can never re-visit it to grab anything left behind.   Would have been good to have a map mechanism to collect stuff with some sort of random event possibly occuring.\n- No undo button.  Too easy to make a wrong move resulting in getting punished.\n- Most missions allow you to collect everything from containers.  There are a few that will force you to leave before you get the chance.  So make sure that you move squad members to containers during fights when you eventually get "all" prospective team-mates.\n- Some interface issues when playing in windowed mode.  Mostly on what or where the window is centred on.\n- Cannot move soldiers into same hex as incapacitated team-mate.  So if faced with entrenched enemies and you cannot move in to engage in hand-to-hand combat, and you have no ammo - you are basically dead.\n\nAND THE ORDINARY:\n* Cutesy pixel-based graphics.  Not really my sort of thing but you may like/love them!\n* No manual saves.  Uses checkpoint saves after mission start or completion.\n* Loved the very nice (Bladerunner inspired) soundtrack that matches the pace, feel and mood of the game.  Just a pity there arent more and varied tracks.\n* Straightforward achievements makes this a possible candidate for achievement hunters but, some are missable and can require an additional playthrough to obtain.  There are a few "secret" achievements so be prepared to either "stage" them or complete them on a subsequent playthrough.\n\nVERDICT:\nFrom its Bladerunner inspired theme.  To its SF movie inspired setting.  To its Laser Squad play-style, Halfway is a superbly made and fantastically enjoyable game to play.  Even though I found a few faults with the game I absolutely loved playing it.\n\nIt is a fantastic little game with some very accomplished design and gameplay mechanics that more than aimably bring back memories of the cult Laser Squad game of yester-year.  I'd says its one of those superior indie titles you should consider if you can overlook the pixelated graphics which even I admit are well-drawn and cute.  There is a a decent amount of content for the campaign though some more would have made it a better game.\n\nOverall its an easy title to miss in the plethora of games available on Steam.  Yet it is one that Id  easily recommend if you like squad level, turn-based tactical gameplay with a decent wad of inventory management.

The most fun I've had in a game in the past many months.\n\nI purchased the game due to a friend's recommendation.  Oh my was it worth it!!\nThis is a turn-based strategy game with tactical squad-based combat.  Despite its pixel art style, the game is surprisingly atmospheric and contains a nice story that kept me interested throughout the game.\n\nThis is NOT a rouge-like game, and the level design is simply excellent.  For the 18+ hours that it took to finish the game, I did not find any repetitive elements; each mission feels unique and purposeful.  Furthermore, the story did a great job propelling me forward.\n\nIn terms of the gameplay, all characters have an active and a passive skill.  Different missions will require different team members.  However, there is no need to worry about leveling them up evenly because there is no experience system; you improve their stats by equipping them with better gears and giving them items that brings permanent stat boost.\n\nI find the experience satisfying, but if I have to find something to criticize, it will be the lack of death penalty and its limited replay value.  However, with the introduction of modding options, I am sure that there will be new reasons to boot up this game!","March 25","true","18.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","2"

It was enjoyable enough, but while playing through it I couldn't help but think it needed something more. It's fairly simple and could have used some more complexity and variety. It plays like a simplified XCOM (2012) with added inventory management. Equipment is found during missions, and there's a couple of different varieties of weapons and armor but it's mostly a case of straight upgrades. You find 8 party members, each with one unique passive and active ability, and with stats which you can upgrade using a limited number of stims you find. Most missions will only allow you to bring 4 soldiers though.\n\nTowards the end it starts to drag on a bit as you've seen all it has to offer, but soon after that the game ends so I suppose it was a good length. There's not really any replayability since it's a linear game with no random levels, although there are a few optional side-missions. The difficulty is good, fairly hard with a few spikes but managable if you're familiar with similar games. There's also a Hard mode mod you can enable if you wish.\n\nIt's a polished game, with gorgeous low resolution pixel art graphics and good, atmospheric music. The story and setting is okay but nothing special, it's fairly generic with stereotypical characters and mediocre writing. Good enough for a strategy game, I guess. The user interface is a little slow and cumbersome to use, could have been better but you get used to it.\n\nOverall it's a pretty good game for the price, it's not very complex but if you want a light turn-based strategy/tactics game it's a pretty good choice.","July 13, 2015","true","19.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Nice atmospheric music, a few choice missions (you can skip if you want).\n\nNot so good: Accuracy changes drastically your miss several times with high chance to hit, but the bad guys hit you first time. A strange overwatch system which is not very effective. Some weapons seem more powerful than others meaning you start to steer towards them for all party members.

Basic X-Com/Xenonauts with a decent story and mechanics. Cover system isn't perfect but it works. No overwatch, it's replaced with a counter-intuitive "Retaliate" option that lets you counter attack but not shoot when the alien/zombie walks in front of you.\n\nEnter ends your turn.\n1 and 2 switches between squad members.\nTab brings up some sort of troubleshooting log?\nWASD moves the map around.\nSpace bar opens up tactical menu.\nR reloads.\nX targets and then shoots at nearest enemies.\nI is inventory and character panel and should be rebound for easy access. Take some time to read the two first soldiers' special abilities, they're pretty good.\nALT highlights all objects you can interact with. VERY USEFUL.\n\nAt 1600x900 on my Razer Blade 14" it looks a bit miniaturized, I suggest playing on a lower resolution for good visuals on a laptop. No bugs so far, and mostly good teaching mechanics to get you on a very gradual learning curve. EDIT: I highly recommend 1366x768 resolution, looks much better and easier to read text on a laptop. Speaking of text, the dialogue is well done, well paced and not at all wordy. This is a combat game/simulator that's reasonably fast paced, welcome relief if you, like I, didn't enjoy the talking talking talking of otherwise very good Divinity:OS.\n\nMay be a bit overpriced but if you're a fan of turn-based or squad tactics games or games with decent story then you could do a lot worse than this, so hit up Steamalerts.com and set up an email alert to buy if the price drops to what you're willing to pay.

Its sci-fi plot and music are also extremely fitting, and the dialouge, although limited and short, matches the situation the characters are in and represents each person quite well. Resources are limited and the choices one makes within battle or preparing for one may have huge ramifications on if later levels are completed or not. However, there are a multitude of frustrations. The difficulty curve of the enemies increases extremely sharply within the last few levels, and some may even have multiple stages. While the special moves of characters are reliable, the 'soft stats' (specifically aiming) of a character are confusing and are not quite clear cut. Calculating the hit chance on a target seems to be somewhat better than chance, and don't make sense a lot of times, but this may be due to the fact that the developers attempted to balance certain gun types against each other so all gun types would be used, each for their own scenarioes. However, as a World of Tanks player, such hidden or incalcuble statistics are all too common, leaving me to mostly recognize Halfway's strengths and its synergy of setting, sound, and gameplay.","March 10, 2015","true","58.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Cover is unclear for diagnol shots,  Field of view is sometimes confusing.  So far enemies always tend to rush which makes waiting in a defensive cover the clear strategy.   Still all these issues are part of the appeal, no tutorial, just jump in because the SHTF!  The discovery process is part of the game!\n\nGreat game!  Looking forward to getting to the end\n\n","November 6, 2014","true","21.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

An open palmed "Stop, and wait a bit".\n\nThe quick of it is that Halfway is a completely solid, if a bit bare and plain, Tactics RPG with a futuristic Sci-fi setting and beautifully done Lo-fi artwork. It's completely worth playing . . . but it will be worth playing a LOT more in about a month or so.\n\nThe long of it is as follows:\n\nThe Good\n\n- A meaty little campaign that's going to clock in around 10-16 Hours over 30+ missions, which for the cost of the game is than a buck an hour. So, a pretty good value!\n- Neat little Sci-fi universe that gets more interesting as the game moves along. It's reminiscient of System Shock 2 and Dead Space, but with a growing sense of its own identity.\n- Really great 16-bit style Pixel art that looks like it's a mix between Tactics Ogre, The Chaos Engine, and Aliens. Seriously, the game looks fantastic for those who like this styling.\n- A small but excellent set of musical tracks that are very "Vangelis from Blade Runner" inspired, which is very high praise as far as I'm concerned.\n- Good ol' Turn-based Tactics gameplay! Ranged XCOM or Jagged Alliance style! Find the best angles and cover and blast away at your foes!\n- For the most part, some very good level design. Most of the stages I found to be a lot of fun and I was never bored by them.\n\nThe Bad\n\n- The core fundamentals of the Tactics gameplay are solid, but fairly basic and a bit unfocused. There's not a lot to set this game apart from its competition other than a replacement for "Overwatch" that's a bit disappointing and the game lacks it's own unique hook to the concept. It's kind of "Meat & Potatoes Tactics", and you're going to want to add pepper . . . but there's no pepper!\n- The RPG character progression elements seem stripped down enough for an XCOM game without individual characters, but this game has developing individual characters, so these elements never feel like they gel together.\n- The different weapons don't really feel all that different, other than optimal ranges, and there's an obvious "best" weapon with the sniper rifles once the game hits the halfway point.\n- The tuning/balance is very bonkers. The first third is too easy, the second third feels about right, and the last third spikes up the difficulty to often frustrating levels. On top of that, there are many strange difficulty spikes that just happen out of nowhere here and there because of inconsistent variations on turns the player has no control over.\n- In general, the game is very linear and scripted and offers little in the way of choice making for the player.\n\nThe Ugly\n\n- The last boss battle needs an overhaul.\n- The game has been fairly buggy at launch, and it's still missing promised modding tools. It really feels like the "Soft Beta Launch" situation that Early Access was meant to abolish, and that early adopters as basically acting as QA for the game.\n\nThe Betty\n\n- To be fair, the devs have been friendly and prompt about dealing with all the issues and criticisms presented to them, and the game's potential and longevity is going to skyrocket once the modding tools are released.\n- However, there are no actual Betty's in the game as of yet.\n\n","July 29, 2014","true","25.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This game has nothing of the sort, there are information and side missions to be had for gear and stimpacks with in the game by talking to your companions but nothing else. A bit of information about their backgrounds and the like and I do enjoy that part. But it also left a desire for more of a story. The Gameplay is decent as well, the importance of cover and tactics is there but I feel that some characters are far better than others.\n\nI would give it a 7/10\nI had a great time and enjoyed the story, felt it could have been done better or bigger as it where, not graphic wise I find the Graphics fun and nostalgic, music was decent.

I picked it up on a whim and ended up glued to my computer for the remainder of the day.\n\nIf you're a fan of XCOM and FTL, you'll get a kick out Halfway's gameplay mechanics and art style.  Halfway is almost entirely story driven with little replay value (I finished in 15.5 hours), containing opportunities to interact with the crew, upgrade your party's equipment, and play with a few stats.  Without spoiling anything, I would have liked to see a greater risk-reward element in the decision whether to take optional side-quests, because right now, you'd be stupid not to take all of them.\n\nOverall, the difficulty level feels just about right, with a possible exception for players that strongly prefer to equip short-range weapons--there are areas of the game that are harder to complete without an effective means to eliminate enemies at a distance.  This is a problem that XCOM circumvented by providing Assault-class soldiers with solid mobility and resiliency perks.  While Halfway's three run-and-gun characters *are* more mobile than everyone else, that mobility is arguably insufficient to make using their short-range weaponry fun and effective.\n\nIn short, Halfway is an unqualified recommendation from me (not something I find myself saying more than once every year or two), and hope to see the developers apply their abilities to similar titles in the future.","October 1, 2014","true","18.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

What if in that state if you have a specific type of neural implant you can survive this type of jump to all those who don't they either go crazy or get killed? In this game you will need to take a truly rag-tag group of individuals and somehow find a way to take control of a ship that seems to not only be in a "halfway" state, but seems to continue to jump to other "halfway" states. Halfway is the creation of the development team at Robotality.\n\nGraphically you are going to be transported back to an era dominated by pixels, and I'm talking about the games that had pixel art that looked amazing. You will have to get through many different levels, all with different layouts, there will be some of the same stuff population the levels, but overall you are going to have to keep on your strategy hat as you try to map out your actions across the levels. Every character has a different look, and they have a different personality that I think kind of shows in the way that they look. I can definitely tell you that that also applies to the enemies as well, though its more of a, "okay I can take these guys" vibe all the way to "well I better get EXTREMELY lucky if I'm going to survive these guys". I also appreciated the fact that you got to see your Home Base change throughout the game, it makes it feel more realistic, and it also is more accommodating as you gain characters through the game. The last thing I would like to point out is the map, it did exactly what it should do, it told me where I could go next and then also showed me the amount of progress that I had made by showing completed areas.\n\nAlright so the soundtrack is nice to listen to for a while, but it really starts to grate on your nerves if you are stuck fighting battles over and over again. I also really started to dread the sound of certain shots being fired at me from enemies.\n\nThe controls are pretty straight forward. This is a turn based game so the majority of the time you are going to be using just the mouse, but there are a couple of hot keys that you can use if you want to pull up inventory, or do an special action.\n\nAlright lets get right into the game, shall we. At first I was very interested in the story, the mystery of what was going on, and the different personalities as they clashed during the game. The problem was the battle mechanics. At first it was middle of the road in difficulty, you could take a couple of hits, or accidentally not be in cover, and survive, but late in the game it became OVERLY difficult. I do not understand how 4 straight times when I have a chance greater than 70% to hit a target I miss every single time. I also don't understand how I can have the best weaponry I could find and I only take away 30% of an enemies shield and they release one shot and I have no shield. I feel like the developers were looking to have a very tactical/strategy game, but forgot to take their finger off the difficulty piece. This is one of the few games where I have actually had to give up playing because I can't get any further. It takes an enemy 4 well placed shots to take down even the strongest of my party members, but it takes 15 shots to take them down. I wish I was exaggerating, but there are some enemies that if you don't hit them for max damage every time you are going to be reloading more times than they need to kill you.\n\nThere are some other mechanics in play, such as inventory management. When you have a gun that only has 4 bullets, and then you have a maximum space of 8 in your inventory you now have to factor in the fact that you are probably not going to be able to heal yourself if you want to be able to fight for then entire area. There's also the fact that the loot is randomized so there are times where I received 5 pistols in a level, I've never used a pistol the entire game, and they are much lower in every stat than what I already have equipped.\n\nAnother mechanic is the stimulant piece, this is kind of like leveling up your character in a specific attribute, be it aim, agility, or life. Funny thing though, even if you have the best aim, apparently you can still be handicapped in comparison to other players when it comes to percent chance to hit. There's also a limit of stimulants that you can apply to a single character, if you go above that number there's a chance that you could really mess up the character's stats.\n\nSo in the end I think the story is great, the art is great, the feel of desperation is real, and enhances the game, but there are too many inconsistencies, and some really bad logic behind some of the mechanics. This is why I have to say that this is a game that I hope can be fixed, or given a little make over in a couple of ways. If they do that they have ONE HELL OF A GAME, but until then they have a game that gets a 6.4 out of 10.","October 9, 2014","true","25.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

This game is absolutly amazing. Just wanted to add that this game, is one of those under-appreciated masterpieces, where you feel alone amongst many, begging to be heard, "this game is really damn genious!!! guys!! people!! people..." Btw wrote this while listening to the amazing soundtrack... inspired in BladeRunned it really really suits the game and creates the best matching vibe possible.\n\nIt brings some of the best mechanics in XCOMM together with some legit aspects of Breach n Clear // Doorkickers.\n\nThis tactical strategy game, has no useless moving turns or excessive stats to learn and memorize... It is simple and challenging.\n\nWithout saying much, you are in a massive ship, drifting in space and fighting "whats left of your crew". The story is definetly intriguing, not because of originality (yea yea deadspace) but because of the way they deliver it. With surprises and mystery, you gota ask your crew, do extra missions and what not, if you wana uncover the plot. Or just jump straight to action and shoot shoot shoot.\n\nWith 8 different characters, each with a passive and an active ability, the secret here is forming a good team for each mission. There arent many stats nor gear types, just enough to get you thinking strategically, since the game is definetly not for begginers.\n\nEncounters arent about different enemy types, but about being overwhelmed. There will always be more enemies than your crew. So you will have to bait, you will have to make risky moves.\n\nSome points that are definetly worth mentioning are:\n\n\nammo here is a thing, your chars have inventory so you gota think about the weapon magazine and how much ammo they have. A really challenging concept that breaks those monotonous turns in similar games, where all you do is entrench and shoot with 30% hit chance.\n\nThe ambient is amazing. Seriously they deliver the Space loneliness better than a handful of triple As (alien isolation im looking at you...).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/quitch/recommended/253150/","quitch","Quitch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/quitch/","378 products in account","So I'm coming towards the end of Halfway (I presume) and thought I'd talk about it. I ran through it on the hardest difficulty.\n\nIt's a simple squad TBS with RPG-lite elements, one that would work rather well on a mobile platform I think. But it doesn't feel like a mobile port, nor does it feel too simple to bother loading on your PC. Streamlined might be the term.\n\nThere's probably nothing in the combat you haven't seen before, with each character getting two actions to move or shoot and they can be combined for a single more accurate shot. You have half-cover and full cover, with corners allowing you to step out to shoot before returning to cover where enemies can't see you (corners are key to victory). Each character has a passive ability and an active ability, along with some base stats you will be given limited ability to boost over the course of the game, but generally they're going to do at the end of the game what they did at the beginning but simply better.\n\nRather than the typical overwatch you have retaliate. You don't fire on enemies as you spot them, you'll only return fire if fired upon. I thought it would be useless, and generally you'll want to spend your points, but it really helps keep the combat mobile and prevents it bogging down into two sides staring each other down.\n\nThe way ammo handled is a nice touch. Different guns have different magazine sizes, but all ammo fits all guns and a reload exhausts an entire magazine no matter how much ammo was left in your gun. That four shot sniper rifle might be powerful, but it's going to plow through ammunition.\n\nThe maps provide a nice variety in which to battle, some tight maze spaces, some a series of rooms, some long corridors, some wide open. You're given plenty of opportunities to make the terrain work for you, and like with most TBSs of this type you should be prepared to withdraw to stronger positions rather than mindlessly holding your ground and taking the best shot. When ♥♥♥♥ goes bad, it goes bad fast. Enemies do a lot of damage compared to your shield and health values at the top difficulty and with three or four hits you'll be down.\n\nEnemy variety is weak; there's shooty mobiles, close-combat mobiles and turrets. It varies the mobiles a bit by introducing shields and then later armour along with the ability to attack twice, but by this point I'm feeling that I'm ready for the game to end as I'm playing out of the same tactics book each battle. It doesn't help that the armoured enemies drag out the battle by being huge bullet sponges at the same time as the more powerful assault rifles have huge damage ranges leading to a feeling of unnecessary randomness.\n\nI found that as the game went on the usefulness of various characters changed, which I liked as it helps with introducing variety. Early on it was all Linda and her shotgun and self-healing, but as shields came into it I found I stopped using her. Likewise, other characters who I found useless became invaluable as better equipment came along. Right now I have at least three characters I would never go on a mission without. However, sometimes you're forced to because the game imposes a limit of 2-4 characters depending on mission, and some missions will have mandatory characters so you have to use pretty much everyone at one time or another, forcing you to learn how to use them and in some cases realise that ability you wrote off is actually pretty good.\n\nThe story and the characters themselves are incredibly flat. It starts out promisingly with a little mystery, but it soon moves into generic sci-fi territory. The characters themselves are dull as dishwater; you can talk to them between missions but they don't have anything interesting to say. Likewise, they will sometimes converse on missions (especially their own optional side-missions), but again it's a case of speaking a lot with nothing to say. Most frustrating is how the game actually builds up a series of relationships between all these people, but the writing isn't capable of doing anything with it.\n\nThe lack of character identification is easily the most disappointing part of the game because you don't give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about these people and their struggle, it makes it a series of TBS puzzles in a game which should deliver more.\n\nAll-in-all I think this was reasonable fun, and I'd recommend picking it up on sale if you're hankering for some squad TBS.","September 29, 2014","true","14.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The graphics, story, characters, and atmosphere of the game are all great, I've enjoyed them and look forward to finishing the game. This game has a lot of potential, but in its current state isn't fun/challenging until you are 75% of the way through the game. I can't give this a thumbs up yet, but THE GAME SHOWS TONS OF POTENTIAL.\n\nEdit 7/25/2014 : Due to active dev support to address game issues that I have brought up, I will be switching this from a 'Not recommended' stance to a 'Recommended' stance. This game is still has a lot of issues, but they are fixable, and it looks like they are actually going to take the initiative to fix them. Beware, the gameplay is still feels like I'm playing a beta, but the game is now completable and later levels are quite enjoyable.\n\nSo here are the problems:\n\nWeapon Issues:\nWeapons are poorly documented in game so you are never really sure what range a weapon is good at. Adding in visual cues on the combat squares or an effective range stat in the weapon item page  is desperately needed.  Firing outside of your weapons effective range causes accuracy to fall dramatically. This is most noticable on short range weapons since short range weapons are only effective if there is one square inbetween you and the enemy, when adjacent it just melee attacks, and every other range has horrendous hit rates until end game weapons.\nThe game has an option to use two ap points per shot to dramatically increase accuracy, but it is an easily missed feature unless you are reading every bit of the tutorial. Breaking this feature into a dialog that pops up when you click to attack an enemy to choose between a one AP quick shot and a two AP aimed shot would be a much better option.\n\nLack of documentation:\nHow cover works is confusing and needs to be explained better on how it actually functions. After 11 hours of play, I'm still not sure if I'm actually getting any bonus from being in any cover that doesn't break LOS. And how does it work? Does it subtract against the enemies hit chance or does it get multiplied against an enemies hit chance? How much does having +9 agility improve the reduction when in cover? Please add an ingame guide that is sort of like the UFOpedia in xcom. That way us the player can actually make tactical decisions. If a player doesn't understand the games mechanics, he can't make any tactical choices. No tactical choices makes for an irritating gameplay experience. Look to Fire Emblem if you are confused as how to display that information to the player. The advanced combat stat window in Fire Emblem makes it super easy for the player to figure out what is going on, and it can be toggled on and off depending on whether the player wants that information.\n\nSpecial Abilities:\nSome character special abilities are are completely overpowered and practically mandatory in end game. All the other non-op characters have abilities that could be super awesome, but since they cost one AP to execute, they serve little function inside of combat. Since these abilities already come with a cooldown penalty, having an AP requirement on many of them is just pointless.\nFor Example, If you took the AP requirement off of the Mad scientists teleport it would actually be usable, and somewhat effective in combat. Taking off the LOS requirement and just allowing the character to teleport within a fixed distance range would take it from functional to on par with Gina's Paralyse. Gina's Paralyse also needs to be balanced; turn it to 1 ap with static one turn cooldown, and reduce the paralyse to 1 enemy combat turn, and it goes from OP to just tactically useful(since a character that only has one AP left is probably rarely going to be able to hit their target)\n\nItems:\nItems are uninteresting as they are right now, and there are very, very few items. There are lots of weapons and armor, but the only difference is how much damage they do, and their accuracy. functionally they all do the same thing. It isn't like one type is good against shields, or another good against armored targets, or maybe a certain one uses only half the Action points. No, all exactly the same. Armor has little variety as well, and since health pools are so small the rounding error will probably make the difference between Tank-Mark-II and Tank-Mark-IV almost unnoticable. Damage to shields also seems not to get any bonus from armor. So shields seem to take full damage QQ\n\nCharacter Progression:\nNo character progression mechanic severely hinders player investment in the characters. The closest thing the game has to progression outside the gear it gives you, is rare stat boost item candy, but your characters can only eat five safely. After that point, they seem to overwrite eachother.\nSo if you have character you really like, but they are as weak as butter against bullets, well, sorry, no matter how much effort you put into getting them alien kills, they will always be as crappier than an OP character that you've never taken on a mission. Sorry mister hacker guy and mad scientist, I'm never taking you out cause you fall over dead 24/7. Sorry mister big human experiment guy, I love your melee passive, but you have no way to recover like linda does.\nGear progression is a poor substitute, since you can transfer gear to other characters at any time.\n\nSo it is a bunch of balancing issues, and some parts of the game need to be expanded.  The game could be really, really good with a couple mods or official patches.","July 22, 2014","true","11.3"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","4"

Changed tactics, rushed and hit the cpu with melee, and for some reason, my attacks do 1 hp dmg while the cpu does 4-6 hp per melee. Considering one of your starting chars has 12 hp total (the other having 16), this means you can literally be 2 shotted in one turn if you let the cpu touch you.

Heavily inspired by the newest Xcom game, it's a turn based strategy game featuring a 2 action point system for shooting, moving, using items, etc. Battles take place in square tile maps.\n\nIt features a great style of 2D pixel art, specially the environments, which feature a lot of small, nice details. The sountrack is amazing and heavily inspired by the works of Vangelis in Blade Runner.\n\nThe core gameplay is solid and accessible. Veteran TBS  players will find that there isn't that much depth, but it's fun nonetheless. One thing that I missed initially is that there's a stealth component where the AI actually detects your units via sound and line of sight.\n\nYou will get access to 8 playable characters, each one with different base stats and unique special abilities. While I think the character could be more unique, they are different enough.\n\nEquipment progression is in my opinion the weakest aspect of the game. It's mostly linear and there isn't much variety. The balance could also be a bit better, with sniper rifles being a bit overpowered and short range weapons being a bit underpowered. It's mostly fine though.\n\nThe campaign is mostly linear, with a couple of optional missions. The plot is nothing groundbreaking, but leaves you wanting more, specially after the ending. Looking forward to Halfway 2 if that ever happens. Oh, and after you beat it, I suggest replaying it with the NewGame+ mod. It makes the game significantly harder and fun (to me anyway).\n\nVery recommended game, specially at the low asking price.","December 31, 2015","true","51.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's no XCOM and isn't striving for that level of depth. What it is imho is very fun, turn-based tactical battles on a smaller scale and a storyline and characters interesting and cool enough to keep me entertained. :)\n\nI'll try to update this review with more details later, here's my Pros/Cons laundry list. :)\n\nPros:\n-Friendly, actively involved indy dev team who post at Steam forums frequently and put much feedback to work in the first 5 patches (not just bug fixes, but making adjustments, improvements).\n-Fun, turn-based tactical battles that don't take hours to play.\n-Large variety of mission types.\n-Varied, interesting "hand-crafted" levels\n-Every character has a unique active and passive special ability\n-Stimpacks allow selective upgrading of character stats (HP, Agility [tile movement range], Aim)\n-You eventually find the abilities can help certain characters complement each other well\n-Many optional side missions, and you can approach them in any order you like.\n-While 4 is the max # of characters on mission, frequent variety in terms of the # you take on a mission (some limit you to 2 or 3), and sometimes certain one or two characters required to go.\n-Cool, retro-pixel look (devs recommend a 1280X type rez for best enjoyment of pixelness :))\n-Hypnotic music that you might actually not mind hearing all the time while playing. :)\n-A level editor and mod tools are promised, though not yet available.\n\nCons (note: upcoming patches may change some of the below - one can hope :--)):\n-Modest hours for the campaign (maybe 10-14 hours, depending on if you pursue all side missions).\n-Limited replayability -- I'm pushing for a separate skirmish mode, perhaps with randomly generated levels.\n-Lacks the background depth of an XCOM-ish title (no base building, weapons research,\n-No Overwatch firing mode, which many XCOM fans are addicted to.\n-No character level advancement (in lieu of that, stimpacks allow a bit of stats adjustment)\n-Sniper Rifles seemed wildly overpowered at launch. Other weapons are more viable now imho, but you may still be inclined to always give a character a sniper rifle as backup :)\n-The "in-lieu-of-Overwatch" retaliation mode ("fire at you, if you fire at me") is really only useful in Melee or for your main charter (Morten) who has a nice assault rifle "% to hit" bonus. Otherwise you can rarely hit anything in that mode.\n-While it has neat characters, story etc., you get no dialogue choices and no way to impact the storyline. If they do a sequel, maybe they can look into that.\n-Lots and lots and lots of inventory fiddling, although I got used to it. :) I wouldn't mind more of a mass-squad inventory in missions vs. fiddling with each character's inventory. Only Samuel has a large enough inventory (12 slots) not to have space issues much.\n-You can't rename your characters, though given this is a storyline-based game, and dialogue is very name/character specific, I think it makes sense.\n\nNow that's a long cons list, but I love the game, make no mistake. :-) I'm rooting for it to gradually reach its full potential.\n\nI wouldn't go in expecting XCOM or, say, Wasteland 2. This isn't those. I find Halfway has many of its own charms but I'm all for being up front about what it and what it isn't. :)","August 3, 2014","true","39.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I may update this review after I do.\n\nPros\nBeautiful, lovingly hand-crafted pixel art\nInteresting story with nice character interaction between missions\nGreat soundtrack\nChallenging, yet balanced combat\nBeing actively updated by the devs on a semi-regular basis, updates are meaningful game-changesCons\nNo real character development, stims are very minor and basically necessary to succeed\nI see very little reason to replay this after I beat it, although perhaps the upcoming level editing tools will negate this point\nCombat ramps a little oddly throughout the game, see text below\n\nHalfway is an indie gem from a small team, who clealrly put a lot of love into this project. If you are a fan of turn-based tactical combat games, this should be a no-brainer purchase. Don't go in expecting FFT or Disgaea levels of complexity and you will have a fun 20-30 hours ahead of you. It's a great little package for a respectable price. If you get it on sale it's an absolute steal.\n\nA few notes though, since I see a fair number of negative reviews that seem to revolve around the combat, which makes sense since that is 90% of the game.\n\nFirst of all, this is a TACTICAL COMBAT GAME. If the combat wasn't 90% of the game it would be something totally different. Don't get me wrong, the story is solid (at least so far as I am), but it's not the "game" part of this game.\n\nSecond, as I noted in the Cons above, the combat does ramp a bit weirdly. In the beginning you will be missing a lot unless you are using melee attacks or 2AP shots. However, after trying several different tactics to clear the early missions I can tell you that there are multiple successful strategies possible. If you get stuck on a mission, don't just keep trying the same tactics. This game is simple but it does give you several options for each character on any given turn. Experiment. "Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results." - A. Einstein\n\nOnce you get up through the mid-point of the game you can expect to be hitting more often, and, depending on how you spend your stims, certain characters can be downright OP, hitting twice every single turn. PRO TIP: Give a certain sniper with a certain active ability a whole bunch of aiming stims and put her in the middle of a room full of baddies. Push one button. Win.\n\nMy only real complaint about this game is the fact that I can't really develop my characters like a true TCRPG. I do not consider this game an RPG at all, actually. You don't make character choices at all, stims aside, and as I mentioned earlier, since you basically have to use them to succeed, the only real choice is which characters you want to use. Having said that, however, what I'm complaining about was clearly not within the vision of the developers, and was not intended to be part of this game, and I respect that. Despite this shortcoming, Halfway is a solid, if simple, game.\n\nTL;DR: I hope everyone buys this game at full price so I can see what Robotality comes up with next.","August 24, 2014","true","18.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'd say more like 10 dollars. the game progresses rather nicely, but there seems to be a "wall of difficulty". ie. Once you get so far, combat becomes extremely annoying and increasingly difficult, to the point of being stupid and unfair - the first time I noticed this was doing the mission for the black dude (Sam i think) to get food from storage. You beat a wave of enemies that hit extremely hard. Your turn you can miss or waste your time moving. Then you get beat to an inch of your life, finally killing them all, only to spawn another wave of HARDER enemies. These enemies hit harder then the last wave - and you can only carry a certain number of items per character - so don't think about having tons of medikits to heal either. Not only that, you can use a medi kit to heal and get Crit or hit 2 or 3 times in a row and die right afterwards so it's pointless. But once you beat this wave, NOW you seriously are out of supplies. But ALAS, ANOTHER WAVE SPAWNS of the same caliber enemies. Although I beat that mission - it was NOT satisfying, it was extremely annoying and sapped the fun out of the entire game thus far. The game became a nuisance, repeating the same harsh combat wave after wave of enemies who usually hit harder and with more accuracy, becoming unfair and annoying. (not challenging and rewarding)\n\nFor the repetitiveness, harshness, etc. I do not recommend. But do not get me wrong you will enjoy this game ( and the price is decent, although 10 is better imo) but be prepared for when you advance in the story, it WILL get repetitive and very unfair.

I really wanted to like it. I love the art style, I love the music and sound effects but engine is so uterly broken I was unable to enjoy it. It basically boils down to restarting level a number of times until luck turns your way which is not likely. I played this game long time ago and gave up after realizing that game does not have any progression other than getting Gun X Mk.II and that's about it. Not only that, but for the first 7 hours or so game failed to explain these flashes they call jumps but kept using them as a cheap and dirty way of spawning yet more enemies who have incredible luck hitting you across the map when you consecutively struggle to hit 80%+ few tiles away.\n\nAfter seing a huge number of updates I decided to give this game another shot hoping all this RNG nonsense has been improved. While previously I went through signifficant portion of the game, this time I struggled with first level. It was mostly "bad" luck. My characters kept missing, enemy kept hitting impossible shots which ignored my shield.\n\nAm sorry, but at this state I can't recommend this game to people.

I probably could have written better material, but I didn't buy the game for the talking\n-It's not as challenging as I would like. There's no penalty for losing a team mate for some reason\n-The levels are all predictable. Go here, collect some supplies, activate this switch or retrieve this person, and inevitably encounter some monsters, kill them, go back to base to heal, repeat\n-There aren't really any ways to level up, except for stimpacks, which give minimal benefits and are extremely rare\n-There's no character creation and minimal customization. All the armors look the same, and there's no way to change any aspect of your characters' appearances.\n-The exploration in the game is very linear and feels like you're being guided. Aside from the odd side quest, there's no freedom in exploration as far as I've gotten. Could be bad for the replay value\n\nOverall, it's an entertaining little shooter/strategy game that can keep you occupied for a while. For $12.99, you're not getting ripped off. If and when this game goes on sale for $5-$8, it'll be a great addition to your collection. Nothing revolutionary, but it's a solid game and it's fun.

Here's my clincher when it comes to games like this: you need to have a cover system and implement some sort of overwatch. X-COM set the bar high in this regard. However, this game has a cover system and retaliate, which I will settle on in place of overwatch.\n\nThe art is great; I love pixelated games. Music fits the style that they are going for. Dialogue is simplistic but intriguing; it doesn't slow down the game. But the combat system is really where this game shines. Some people are complaining that there isn't character customization, but there is to a degree. You can customize using weapons, armor, and single-use stat boosts. I've also started two games so far; and the characters seemed to have different starting stats, so there may be randomness in this regard as well.\n\nI do agree that the devs should implement an exp system on this sucker, but do not let that hold you back from playing an otherwise excellent game.\n\n****\n\nUpdate: 7 hours in and still having fun. For $12, I definitely feel like I got my money's worth. It feels like X-COM and Sword of the Stars: The Pit and a baby and then threw in some plot from Dead Space. I have really high hopes for where the devs might take this game in the future.","July 24, 2014","true","13.3"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

The environment the game sets up is great and I will definitely be playing more once the mission creation tool is out.\n\nThe first 50% of the game is filled with extremely easy missions to help you learn the controls / collect characters for the game. I was pretty disappointed with this and thought it was way too easy. The later game definitely makes you think before you act. You can't brute force your way through most of the later levels. However, I was able to beat almost every level in a single attempt and no levels took more than 2 times to beat. I would really have liked a bit more of a challenge.\n\nThe concept for the game was really cool but the actual story telling was sub-par. From what I understand the game developers are German so this might just be a poor translation.\n\nThe items you pick up in the game feel extremely generic.\n\nThere are three types of weapons "Short Range", "Assault Rifle", and "Sniper Rifle" each of which works well at a particular distance from targets. There are two (maybe three) different names for each of these and then a "Mark I", "Mark II", "Mark III", etc... as they become more powerful. The amount of ammo each can hold varies and is the only thing that keeps you from simply picking the biggest weapon as they tend to have few rounds per ammo consumption. I would have liked to see more variety here.\n\nThe armor is pretty much the exact same as the weapons. There are three different types of suits: Scout, Assault, and Tank. Each provides some stats and shields. I did manage to find some "special" suits that were very different from the base ones which was nice. I'm assuming when the user created content comes out, we will see some very cool stuff.\n\nEach character has a unique set of abilities and "level up" through stim pack injections. Some people didn't like this as you are limited to 5 stims per character. But, this keeps you from simply making a single super character. I like the ability to level your characters in this way as it gives you more control over how you want to play them. Maybe you don't want to play that character as a tank: give them lots of aim so they can shoot from afar. In each level you have some required characters but then you get to choose additional characters to bring along. This was neat as you felt like you could mix / match abilities. However, most of the abilities didn't really seem to complement each other. Instead, you choose abilities for a particular mission (assuming you failed it previously).  It would have been nice to be able to replay missions with a different set of characters without having to start the entire game over (or maybe unlocking free-play after you beat the game would be nice).\n\nIn general, I really enjoyed the game and was definitely worth the price.","July 26, 2014","true","22.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

No manual for details.\n\nThe simple nature of the game makes this easily learned, though the lack of a manual to explain details means you have to figure out as you go. An annoying flaw is getting a new unit with a new ability, but have to immediately engage in combat without knowing what the ability does. Once you understand details, game play is steady series of small squad missions against increasingly strong enemies.\n\nStory arc is entirely text scripted. Some portions are lengthy to flesh out characters' personalities and interactions. Mostly this fills out mission set-up, as the briefing is entirely choosing squad and mission. Without the text, missions would be entered blind. The missions series is very fixed with few 'side quests'. Replayability, currently, looks to be low.\n\nBased on the variety in game, the potentional of this game is immense. Weapon variety is notable, units' abilities are varied already and mechanics imply a lot of subtle changes are possible.

The camera and controls were not well thought out.  The weapons and armor are very basic, as is the character design.  There are roughly 4 different types of enemies, and they all use recolors of the same skin.  Oh, but they each stand a little differently.  The writing is bland and unimaginative.  And these aren't even the biggest problems.\n\nThe two big sins of Halfway are the sub-par combat, and some of the worst RNG I've ever dealt with in a game of this type.  For the combat, the devs use a very flimsy story point to 'disguise' the fact that enemies are just dropped in to the map at will.  The only real progression in combat difficulty comes from the amount of enemies spawned, and how many waves come before a mission is finished.\n\nThere are three or four different weapon types in Halfway, but only the sniper shows any real usefulness.  Best damage, best range, best accuracy.  The other weapons in the game only differentiate themselves by having lower stats in those areas.\n\nI can't express how important it is to get the RNG right in a game like this.  And Halfway gets it very wrong.  The chance to hit is just plain ♥♥♥♥ed.  I've missed 4+ 90% or greater shots in a row, and made just as many under 50% in a row.  I eventually learned to ignore the percentages completely and take any shot I wanted.  I hit just as many sub-twenties as I did eighties and nineties.  I found that I got the most successful hits in the 30% - 36% range.  Line of sight is also incredibly unreliable, making it almost impossible to judge whether changing a character's position will leave them with a clear shot for the second half of their turn.\n\nAs a final aside, the mid-mission interludes are probably the best indicator of what kind of game to expect here.  These interludes are a chance to manage your inventory and make character selections, but they can happen anywhere in the game.  I'm not complaining about being given a rest from the tedious combat, just pointing out that returning to HQ between an apartment hallway and the apartment you are entering is a great way to destroy the flow of your narrative.  It's even more jarring when this 'rest' occurs whithout even having to change rooms.\n\nThe saddest part of all this is the fact that Halfway IS a finished, polished product.  The concept itself is great, there are no major bugs that I could find, and the textures and tiles that do exist are actually very dynamic and interesting to look at.  The bones are all there, Robotality just forgot to add the flesh and musculature that this little monster needed to be a true success.\n\nAll-in-all, I was too bored with the lack of progression/development to actually finish Halfway, leaving me with the overall feeling that Half-♥♥♥♥♥ might have been a better choice for the title.\n\n\nOh, and the "lovely atmospheric soundtrack" touted in the game's description is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke.  If you do pick up Half-♥♥♥♥♥ (on sale, I hope), make sure to play with the music on mute.  It's worse than repetetive, and I'm fairly certain it's part of the game's attempt to beat the player by driving him/her to suicide.  The sound made by the last bullet you'll ever hear would easily be a great alternative to this games soundtrack.","May 16","false","12.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It's the simple 2 Action point system where you choose to move and/or shoot. Naturally with games of this type that also means it has the auto Dice-roll system in place which determines attack & Defense (cover) stats. Even the AI plays a similar game where the difficulty curve gradually builds up from being dumb as a post, to hitting you harder and smarter in later levels.\n\nOn first impressions, the story has a Dead Space feel about it. Monsters/Zombies on a ship, the ship turning against you, you've seen it all before. But the writing appears solid enough to keep you wanting to play... Which of course is one of the most vital things in games such as these.\n\nSo you may be thinking (and groaning) that it's another pixel-art game? Whilst true, it is the attention to detail that sets it apart from being just another typical game with the same old graphical fidelity. The inside of the Goliath ship feels and looks like a spaceship. Litter and dirt is strewn amongst the lower decks, lose wiring hangs from damaged areas outside the confines of the playable area. Emergency Lighting creates a dim and hopeless atmosphere. It flcikers creating an eerie feel. Later on in the game it brightens up, adding colour to what still feels like a desolate hostile arena.\n\nEven in battle, weapons glow, shell casings fly out of guns and land on the floor, and they feel like they pack a satisfying punch. This is helped largely due to the well made sound effects that accompany this game. This leads on to the games soundtrack which is proving rather satisfying, and sets the right tone to the rest of the game.  The level of polish here would not be out of place amongst other titles developed by considerably larger teams.\n\nStill not convinced? Well the developers Robotality are not playing any games with their first Steam release. Within hours of bugs flying in, the game was patched to 1.01 addressing the most critical issues, resulting in a much more stable game right away. So it's likely such support will continue. Couple that with the promise of an editor and the inevitable Steam Workshop support, and you'll be investing in a game that will have a lot of replay value in many months to come.","July 22, 2014","true","4.2"," 12 of 28 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","12","28","0","0"

The gameplay is fairly solid, but the game itself is actually pretty easy and doesn't require much in the way of tactics to succeed, you can charge, barge and bungle your way through most battles without losing and I was rarely ever lacking for the basic three combat supplies (shields, ammo, medkits) though having to transfer items back and forth constantly to juggle your limited inventory can get to be a real pain. All in all it's a pretty good game.\n\nBut I cannot in good faith recommend this game to anyone because it was published by Chucklefish and they are truly loathsome and despicable company worthy only of our unending rancor.\n\nAnd before anyone asks, the game was gifted to me.","November 29, 2014","false","14.2"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","1"

A bit of parallaxing here and there, with some background animations would have gone a long way to selling the world. In practice, everything in the world feels very static. The fixed width "Chunky" walls and no multi-level environments means that there is a lack of truly interesting tactical environments.\n\nThese flaws could be perhaps be forgiven if the interface was a little slicker. However, I found it frustrating to interact with the game world, and the UX around character/item management feels too klunky to be enjoyable.\n\nOverall I would rate this as a worthy sale-pickup - something of a curiousity worth playing if you're a tactical+pixel art diehard.\n\nDespite not being able to reccomend this game, I do not regret buying it.

Comparisons to Fire Emblem are apt, but Fire Emblem's depth may keep people coming back to the game where this may only deserve a few playthroughs. Combat is solid, and strategy is divided well between short-ranged and long-ranged combat. This is primarily because the game has only four major player stats: Health, Shield, Agility, and Aiming. Other statistics, like Armor, only modify the rates at which these are gained or lost. The art style works for the game, but I would have liked to see better high resolution support. Sound is simplistic and functional.\n\nI would like to see a higher difficulty curve or a NG+ mode, and I'd like a bit more diversity in weapons usage, but overall the game is solid, fun to play, and tactically interesting.","July 22, 2014","true","33.3"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","4","16","0","0"

A tactical sci-fi RPG with a dark and gritty theme. The UI is intuitive enough, the retro graphics are good enough, and the gameplay elements are relatively straightforward. Initially, I was intrigued by the higher level of difficulty relative to other titles in this genre.\n\nHowever, after playing a bit more, I find myself growing increasingly irritated: While I enjoy the difficult decisions created by the level design, which force one to consider position and cover, and I am interested enough in the story to want to play on, I keep wanting to ragequit because of several factors. First, the absurd stimpack system that accounts for character's growth. It is a system based on random acquisition of items that increase one of three stats, (aim, agility, and hit points). If you don't get any "aim" stimpacks, you aren't going to hit anything.\n\nSecond, the weapons balancing in the game is atrocious. The only weapon worth anything is the sniper rifle, but only characters with enough aim can use one effectively. that means that one or two characters can hit an enemy outside of melee. The others...well they are meatshields that stand in the middle of a hallway you use as a chokepoint...the same tactic that you always use...over and over again...because you can't trade shots with the "mutated ships technicians" who somehow are better marksmen than you'll ever be....\n\nThis, combined with the randomness of the item acquisition makes it virtually impossible for the player to influence the growth of any characters in their team without some serious luck. I can handle the difficulty if i can relish the reward of forging a team of elites.....Unless you like restarting a level to get the items you want, or would be okay with missing...again and again and again....I call this one a NO.","January 11, 2015","false","16.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While I will admit that this game doesn't have the deepest combat system, it does you give you a fair number of tactical options with which you can wage war on your enemies.

There are also a decent number of armor varians, each one working a little bit differently from the others, that you can equip your survivors with.\n\nThe story is decent. It's baked well enough, although it does progress a bit slowly. The writing is good most of the time, with a little cheesiness here and there. Some missions feel a little fetch-questy.

Do you like challenging encounters? Do you enjoy characters with different personalities and an interesting story?\n\nIf you answered yes to any of those, do yourself a favor and buy this game.\n\nPeople complaining about the combat come from people who must not enjoy difficult tactical games. While I will admit that this game doesn't have the deepest combat system, it does you give you a fair number of tactical options with which you can wage war on your enemies. Numerous weapon types and abilities will aid you in your escape off the ship. There are also a decent number of armor varians, each one working a little bit differently from the others, that you can equip your survivors with.\n\nThe story is decent. It's baked well enough, although it does progress a bit slowly. The writing is good most of the time, with a little cheesiness here and there. Some missions feel a little fetch-questy. Other missions offer interesting combat scenarios. One mission might test you against a horde of enemies, another might test your teams ranged skills on an exposed platform.\n\nIn the end, the game is $13. It does tactical well enough, but be prepared for a challenge, it picks up quick. The story is interesting, I haven't beaten it yet but I certainly want to know the ending. The characters are mostly interesting, some more than others but that isn't uncommon in games. The writing is good, but a bit cheesy at times.\n\nMy final score: 8/10\n\n\n\nAlso, if you don't like it when a character missed a 85% chance shot, you really shouldn't play this kind of tactical game.

Acceptable gameplay.\n\nReally love the art direction and music on this. And when was the last time you were actually interested in dialog and story in a game?\n\nBut, as others have noted, this game can be frustrating. The AI rarely misses, and in the beginning - and sometimes even later in the game - your characters rarely hit. Sometimes it feels like you'd be better off using your guns like clubs instead of shooting. The frustration is exacerbated by the AI's ability to move three times in a turn, occassionally (1) moving into LOS, (2) firing at (and hitting) your characters, and (3) moving back out of LOS into the fog.\n\nDespite all this frustration (causing a few profane outbusts on my part -- glad I was playing it when I was alone), it all seems to work out. I only failed one mission, and completed the game with a full inventory of the best items, and 5,000 currency to spare. So if you are feeling frustrated, keep in mind that it's pretty tough to fail a mission, and even if you do it's pretty fast to replay a mission.","August 2, 2015","true","31.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, I guess unless it's an emergency and you need help. In deep space. On a derelict ship. With a bunch of your former crewmates wanting to tear you limb from limb, for some reason.\n\nThis is the very scenario presented by Robotality in its latest game Halfway. Aptly named, this title has an aesthetic halfway between System Shock 2 and XCOM; it plays halfway between a turn-based strategy game and an RPG; its charm stems halfway between its pixelated visuals reminiscent of old 90s arcade games and its modern take on combat depth and mechanics. Terrible puns aside, Halfway is a pretty interesting game that keeps you on your toes.\n\n...\n\nAt USD $12.99 on Steam, Halfway is definitely worth the cost if you're looking for a fun turn-based scifi game. With its nostalgia-inducing graphics with contemporary flare and the fast-paced tactical combat, you'll lose yourself to the cold vacuum of space pretty quickly. However if you're looking for something with in-depth RPG elements, you'll be left scratching your head. If Robotality gave gameplay and story half as much love as they give the game's visuals and engine, they'll have something even more addictive and immersive.","May 11, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From start to finish I felt like I was always against the wall – no mission was too easy and all felt like they furthered the plot along.  Let's get to the details!\n\n==Graphics==\n\nThey are simple but nothing else is really needed; the characters and enemies are all recognizable and feel unique.  Plasma Fire looks good, the 'dusting' of enemies leaves a satisfying feeling, and the levels made sense.  The medical ward, cafe, apartments – they all felt right.  Little touches were here or there to give the impression of varied life throughout the ship and I really liked the fluff 'medical bay' in the home bases you established to explain how your party recovered life in between missions.\n\n==Sound==\n\nI'm going to sound like a wimp here – but one of the home-base themes always makes me feel sad; like longing for home.  The combat music felt right – helping to keep me on the edge (the final boss music especially, was unlike the rest and definitely 'alien' as it were).  The sounds of the guns firing, screams of the mutants (or your team-mates), doors, platforms; all of these seemed perfect to me.\n\n==Story==\n\nMore than any game I've played in the past 3 years I needed to know how this was going to end.

From start to finish I felt like I was always against the wall – no mission was too easy and all felt like they furthered the plot along.  Let's get to the details!\n\n==Graphics==\n\nThey are simple but nothing else is really needed; the characters and enemies are all recognizable and feel unique.  Plasma Fire looks good, the 'dusting' of enemies leaves a satisfying feeling, and the levels made sense.  The medical ward, cafe, apartments – they all felt right.  Little touches were here or there to give the impression of varied life throughout the ship and I really liked the fluff 'medical bay' in the home bases you established to explain how your party recovered life in between missions.\n\n==Sound==\n\nI'm going to sound like a wimp here – but one of the home-base themes always makes me feel sad; like longing for home.  The combat music felt right – helping to keep me on the edge (the final boss music especially, was unlike the rest and definitely 'alien' as it were).  The sounds of the guns firing, screams of the mutants (or your team-mates), doors, platforms; all of these seemed perfect to me.\n\n==Story==\n\nMore than any game I've played in the past 3 years I needed to know how this was going to end.  I was really pulling for these survivors to make it through and escape.  I wanted to know how party conflicts were going to resolve themselves and some of the more hinted at details of the survivors.\n\nUnfortunately the game does leave off on kind of a cliff hanger; I feel as if the game story was 'halfway' completed akin to Anachronox if you ever played that game.

Well, that's all I'm really looking for.\n\nSo I did buy it, and I beat it in one weekend of heavy playing.\n\nThe game is an ultra solid tactics/strategy game, basically an indie version of XCOM. While there's nothing that's like OMG WOW AMAZING (but, honestly, if you're a veteran gamer, how often does that happen anyway?), it really is just plain fun. The RPG elements are minor - item collection & stat increase via stimpacks - but the tactics plays smoothly and the story is quite intriguing and not something I've seen before. Basically, it explores FTL travel, asking the question: What happens BETWEEN jumps? Hence the title - Halfway.\n\nThe characters themselves are nothing spectacular. The protagonist is a marine who's more cool competence than great empathy. Nevertheless, they get the job done. Because each character has a specialty, you get a sense of how they all fit in, even if there are some gaps (Nia anyone?).\n\nHonestly, if you like sci-fi and you like strategy/tactics games, you'll almost certainly like this, even if you're as jaded a gamer as I am. I will say that, in general, if you're heavily starved on gaming time, you may want to skip and focus on AAA games, but meh you know you.\n\nOne small note: If you're a tactics/strategy pro, I recommend enabling the difficulty+ mod. I beat XCOM on classic ironman (twice) and wished I had enabled it.","December 27, 2015","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I say it is else.\n\nThe main activities of Halfway are TBS fighting, running between fights and observing the linear story progression.  No options in dialogs, no choice, no consequences, like reading a book. So only fighting includes actual gameplay. To win a fight you have 2-8 units and ability to give them simple orders. In theory that is enough. But there is a problem. You see, you can't actually develop your units. Every unit has 2 predefined abilities and 4 predefined stats. Stats can be slooooowly changed with equipment. A certain piece of equipment can be found in a certain crate/locker on a certain level. No random generation. And there is no vast variety of loot, you will take from mission at best 3 new pieces which are slightly better than your current. Also on most missions you have to take fully or partially predefined team for the plot's sake. So unless you have the full game guide you can't predict and plan your unit development.\nBut who needs fancy pseudo RPG babysitting when you have tactics! Not here. Here you usually open a door and conveniently placed enemy spots your guy. Enemies as equipment are placed in certain places on certain maps, no random at all. And there is no way to predict what is waiting ahead, only try and error. Also often you get local special treatment: your guys enter certain small area, trigger cutscene, take bad positions without your control, bla-bla-bla, then enemies appear from thin air, take a turn, take good positions and only then you are given a chance to react.\nSo here you are on a pretty tight prebuilt level with predefined units wearing predefined gear standing in disadvantaged predefined positions against preplased predefined set of enemies which corner you if you run and get to point blank range if you don't within two turns at best. Under this circumstance no tactic is involved. Basicly you must perform only one specific for every battle set of actions.\nThereby Halfway genre is not RPG or TBS but point and click adventure. Don't buy Halfway if you love TBS or RPG, buy if you like quests.","August 6, 2015","false","28.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The overall structure will be familiar to anyone who has played the recent XCOM.  It's fun for a few hours, but gets a bit repetitive toward the end.  The final boss fight is somewhat tedious.\n\nThings that would have made this game better:\n\n- A decent tutorial.  If you've played XCOM, you'll understand the basics of movement and firing, but there are many details that aren't apparent.  Case in point: I read a number of reviews that stated sniper rifles are the ultimate weapon, and based on the numbers the game presents, they are.  But if you *try* an assault rifle, you'll discover that the base to-hit is much higher, so you don't have to spend an extra AP aiming.  Which means you can fire it twice in a round and generally hit both times.\n\n(Another example: you'll figure out pretty quickly that every unit MUST have a weapon and armor at all times, so if you sell off the last spare gun or suit you will be unable to swap equipment around.  But it would have been nice for a tutorial or (gasp) manual to warn you to hang on to the spares.)\n\n- A save game feature that recorded more than what level you were on.  I had to leave the game running while away from the computer for a few hours because I didn't want to lose my progress.  Most of the levels aren't terribly long, but it's not obvious where the save points are, and you don't want to re-play some of the drawn-out battles.\n\n- Better indications of cover.  If you're going to steal XCOM's full/half cover system, you should probably steal the part where you show the current cover status of the unit.\n\nNot a great game, but it's sufficiently entertaining to merit a run-through.\n","September 17, 2015","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fish_heads/recommended/253150/","fish_heads","fish_heads","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fish_heads/","142 products in account","I'm a big fan of turn-based squad tactics games - Xcom, Fallout Tactics, Shadowrun, etc. If you are also a fan of these, you'd probably find something worth liking in Halfway. Overall, it was a challenging, well-written game that I really enjoyed despite a few quirks.\n\nDifficulty\nThis is not for the faint of heart. You will probably find yourself re-playing some of the missions several times, trying to find the best mix of tactics and team cominations. Especially in later levels, when some very dangerous enemies show up, You'll probably want to (if you don't feel like it's cheating) make a habit of simply restarting the level once you've got an idea of what enemies and level layout you're dealing with. But the flipside is that FINALLY beating a mission is really rewarding.\n\nVariation\nBoth weapons, armor, and enemies seemed to have the same pattern going on - they're split up into basic "types" and then there's several "levels" within each type. Sniper rifles - Mk1, Mk2, Mk3, etc.. Armor with high shield recharge but low damage resistance...Mk1, Mk2, Mk3, etc.. Enemy with no shield but huge amount of health...easy version, medium version, toughest version. It makes for very clear-cut tactics - you're making definite decisions about what kind of weapon/armor to equip, and then you just keep upgrading it. You see certain enemies, you use specific tactics and abilities. While I do, on a base level, really appreciate that the mechanics of how these all work and fit together has been worked out and clearly signposted for me, I did feel at times that the lack of diversity and "grey area" sometimes made the game feel a bit empty.\n\nStory\nI loved the story, hands down. I liked the characters, I enjoyed seeing their interactions, and I was interested in seeing how things would play out and how the story would resolve up through the end. There are NO dialogue trees. You are essentially watching pre-determined dialogue at every "conversation" in the game, but I still enjoyed it, even in places where it was a bit cheesy.\n\nTactical playstyle\nThis game takes a page from Xcom and Shadowrun in that there's essentially two "actions" per turn per character. No points or anything like that to manage. You can move and shoot, reload and shoot, move and use an item or ability, take an aimed shot, etc. Very straightforward, very accessible. My one gripe (which I've seen others echo) is that the "retaliation" ability kinda sucks - it's basically "overwatch," but you're essentially holding onto one or both action points to fire at any enemy THAT FIRES AT YOU. Not enemies that become visible, not enemies that walk right up next to you, not enemies that fire on teammates - only the ones that shoot at the specific character who has activated "Retaliation." Be aware - using it properly can actually save a run, but not using it or overrelying on it can be devastating.\n\nNo Leveling Up\nThat's right. No leveling up your guys. You can give them "stims" which will permanently raise one or more stats, but those arerisky to use more than 5 of per character. You also should definitely be upgrading your weapons and armor as you find new stuff to use. But you absolutely, especially in late-game, need to play cautiously. If a tough enemy gets a concentrated burst of fire on you, or if a squadmate gets flanked and fired on by several enemies at once, you could go from "sitting in cover with full shields and health" to "only 2 of 4 squaddies still alive" VERY fast.\n\nBuy this game if:\n-You like squad-based tactics games\n-You don't want to have to do too much micromanaging in your Squad-tactics game\n-You want a game with a sci-fi horror kind of feel to it\n-You want a game that's challenging but rewarding\n\nDon't buy this game if:\n-You want a game that'll be easy to play through\n-You want to micromanage every aspect of your characters' stats or have lots of control over how they develop\n-You want to charge into every scenario with guns blazing, ignoring cover\n-You want a game with a rich, complicated, branching storyline\n\n","September 26, 2015","true","30.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hands down, it is an absolute marvel and joy to play, and I'm really hoping for a sequel.\nThe plot is the standard sci-fi fare, you awake from cryo-sleep on a long-haul space flight, finding that your ship is randomly hyperjumping through space, whilst all around you humanoid mutants lunge at you from the shadows.  It is down to you to find fellow survivors, salvage for spare guns and ammo, figure out whats going on and attempt to escape the nightmare.  But the way it is told deserves particular praise, with all exposition delivered piece-by-piece through character conversations and in-game encounters.  The dialogue stays fairly safe throughout but there's at least a couple of characters of note.\n\nThe gameplay, though straightforward, offers some serious amount of depth.  It's a turn-based top-down squad focused strategy game.  You spend the majority of your time being ambushed by mutants, lunging for cover, returning fire, and trying not to be overrun.  Once the smoke clears you salvage the area for weapons, ammo and medikits for future use or for conversion to credits to buy other much needed gear.  But you can't just point your guys at the enemy and expect to win.  Get ready to make strategic choices about defensive positions, weapon loadouts, which characters to bring, when to fall back and when to bring the fight to the enemy.  There are also some light RPG elements which is very nicely and uniquely implemented.  You don't gain experience per se, but rather you trawl the crates and lockers of the war-torn environments to salvage various stimpacks, each of which offer your characters an improvement to their agility, health or aiming ability.  But you can't just pump your favourite guys up to ridiculous levels, as each character can only handle 5 stimpacks before some side-effects become known, so you have to think twice about which characters get what stimpacks.\n\nThe difficulty is very well balanced.  Usual walkover for first few levels, before a slow and steady rise over the considerably long campaign to some very challenges end levels.  There are indeed plentiful levels, with a varied environment and layout, each of which you must complete in one go, but they are short enough that the few times you do die won't induce much frustration.  Between each level you get to return to your makeshift camp to reload and refit and change your squad lineup.\n\nThe aesthetics are wonderful.  Though oddly bright and colorful for a game about a grim slog through unforgiving, mutant-infested spaceship corridors, its the little details that make this game come to life.  From the gore-stained corridors, to the way your fallen foes disintegrate into ash, to the spent shell casings ejected from your varied weaponry, this game is one that draws you in and bathes you in its beautiful gloominess.\nI've only the one criticism, and maybe this was just me, but I couldn't find a way to change the text font size, so those of short sight may be in for a spot of bother.\nSo in summary, this is a game you absolutely must own, and it's available at a very reasonable price!","August 14, 2015","true","18.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Acceptable gameplay.\n\nReally love the art direction and music on this. And when was the last time you were actually interested in dialog and story in a game?\n\nBut, as others have noted, this game can be frustrating. The AI rarely misses, and in the beginning - and sometimes even later in the game - your characters rarely hit. Sometimes it feels like you'd be better off using your guns like clubs instead of shooting. The frustration is exacerbated by the AI's ability to move three times in a turn, occassionally (1) moving into LOS, (2) firing at (and hitting) your characters, and (3) moving back out of LOS into the fog.\n\nDespite all this frustration (causing a few profane outbusts on my part -- glad I was playing it when I was alone), it all seems to work out. I only failed one mission, and completed the game with a full inventory of the best items, and 5,000 currency to spare. So if you are feeling frustrated, keep in mind that it's pretty tough to fail a mission, and even if you do it's pretty fast to replay a mission.","August 2, 2015","true","31.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
