If twitch reflex is what you're after then RFLEX is an excellent choice.\n\nChasing the high-scores is incredibly challenging and motivating.  When you fail (which you will do, many, many times!) a restart takes miliseconds.  It's super easy to have 50x plays on this game in no time at all!\n\nMy initial review outlined a couple of bugs with the game which weren't game-breaking but were annoyances.  The Dev was extremely proactive and resolved both these issues within hours.  Good stuff!!\n\nWithout doubt, if you enjoy Super Hexagon you will love this.  It has a good variety of game modes, the music is cool and I can see it starting a lot of inter-friend rivalry chasing each others leaderboard times!\n\nBy the way, it looks really easy... but it's not!!","August 27, 2015","true","1.3"," 31 of 39 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","31","39","0","0"

Hehe, see what I did there? Was pretty funny right? It wasn't was it. ♥♥♥♥.\n\nBut seriously, it is a good game and well worth the lowly price. I'd equate it to Super Hexagon, as they both have the same style of gameplay and are very addicting. I'd reccommend this game for anyone looking for something to play before bedtime, lunch or on the bus.","October 1, 2015","true","3.4"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","77","17","22","11","2"

If you're a fan of super hard games like Super Hexagon you'll definitely enjoy the challenge but for some it might not be your cup of tea (sadly wasn't mine).\n\nYou have 5 different levels (+5 Drunk level modes) and each one is more challenging than the last, timing is crucial as one slip up can result in having to start the level again. All you have to do to pass a level is let your little pentagon survive for 60 seconds, which may or may not be easy depending on your reaction speed.\n\nThe sound design and music is fantastic though and is probably one of the high points I found in the game, if you can get the soundtrack I would recommend it.\n\nIs the game worth the price? I'd say yes, despite the fact I wasn't any good at it doesn't mean everyone is going to be as bad as me.\n\nIn future I'd like to see more levels added or different challenges though!","August 27, 2015","true","1.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","1"

I knew it will be much harder that it seems to be. Anyway, it took me over 600 attemps until I finished third level. I don't know why, but I simply couldn't beat it. The feel when you finally beat the level is awesome, though. Also, your heart wants to break out of your chest, don't let it! ;)\nIf you like simple but hard games like this one, don't hesitate and buy it. Totally worths it.\nWhen you're tired and annoyed, because you can't get over 60 seconds, take a break for a few minutes. I had troubles from the beginning too, but as of now, I'm in the first places in the leaderboards and still keep playing next levels.\n\n+ simple graphics, catchy colors\n+ easy to play, hard to master\n+ 5+5 levels (it's enough, trust me)\n\n+/- decent music (does not impress, but also it's not bad; I mostly play with custom music)\n+/- I couldn't get used to the controls (maybe it was my bad habit from other rage games)\n\n- I guess nothing is that bad to be here\n\nAnd look for patterns. They're there, you just won't see them right away. They will help you pretty much.\n\n8/10","December 3, 2015","true","7.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Without them, you won’t last 10 seconds.\n\nThe game consists of a few basic elements, they are ‘dodge things,’ ‘don’t let things hit you’ and ‘move damn it, that thing is going to utterly destroy you.’ You use the arrow keys or a gamepad to move your pentagon out of the way of your lifeless enemies before they reach the end of their path, ending the round if they hit you.\n\nWhen I started playing the game my first natural assumption was that the projectiles flew at my shape in a random order, but a few minutes in I realised that that was clearly not the case. There are patterns that you can predict in order to stand a chance at dodging your impending doom. It’s handy to know and has saved me several hundred times.\n\nAs you may predict based on what I have stated previously, the game is astonishingly challenging. After watching the trailer and maybe a few videos of gameplay, you may think ‘this looks pretty easy,’ but let me tell you, the game is a lot harder than it looks. There are five levels in RFLEX, they are Amusement, Challenge, Addiction, Lifestyle and Death Wish (the name scares me,) each with their own quirks and patterns and all very, very difficult.\n\nIf you would like to let everyone know you are amazing or are happy with telling the world you are terrible at the game, there are both global and friend leaderboards. Brag away!\n\nThe graphics are simple, just black on certain colours depending on what mode you have picked. Simple doesn’t mean bad though. Having the same colours every match makes it easy on the eyes as they aren’t constantly changing like in Super Hexagon (where you need the special glasses to prevent brain destroying migraines.)\n\nYou play the game to an awesome electronic soundtrack featuring ForeverBound, Valiant and RollingFacade. Oh and I couldn’t resist to mention that there is a drunk mode. It’s pretty self-explanatory and is a perfect simulation of being drunk whilst playing RFLEX.\n\nWesley is such a great guy that he has also added an epileptic friendly mode for those of you who suffer from photosensitive epilepsy and has stated that ‘if you are not satisfied with this option, and are unable to play this game, you are entitled to a refund.’\n\nAll in all, RFLEX is a great arcade game of dodge and if you have time to kill and a few dollars to spare, you should definitely check it out.\n\nRFLEX has earned 9/10 wallabies.","May 18","true","3.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Hard. Addictive. Satisfying.\nThis is how I would describe this amazing game. Simply genious, as the idea behind it is very basic and simple, but the entertainment that it has to offer is unlimited.\n\nThe game is very hard, but so rewarding. Also the adrenaline that this game gives is unbeliavable, dodging incoming obstacles has never been so fun and never gives the anxiety that this game gives.\n\nControls are simple, you can move with WASD and all you have to do is dodging rectangles, trying to stay in the game as long as possible, that is not easy and simple as it sounds.\n\nRFLEX also is immediate and very quick to move from a scene to another. There are different difficulties that you can choose from and the last red one, Dead-Wish is simply impossible, but absolutely lovable and addictive as you want to carry on and beat it, resist always more and more time. Great the musics as well.\n\nSimply genious is as I would describe it. Go for it, this will be your drug from now on.\nThe only thing I wish this game could improve is getting on mobiles as I would like to have it always with me.\n\nVideogame News, Indie Score: 9 | SUPER RECOMMENDED\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Nb3-3OLxJc","August 28, 2015","true","0.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

Thank you to them for that.\n\nWhile RFLEX reminds me alot of the Ludum Dare winner Dodge, it is much more polished and there is significantly more content. The menu layout, styling, and difficulty levels are very similiar to Super Hexagon. Basically, you use either a keyboard or gamepad to move the polygon around a 3x3 grid to dodge incoming obstacles. Its hard as nails. There are several difficulties and several 'modes' (i.e. 'drunk mode' has altered controls and a visual filter). Leaderboards really give this something more than just trying to best your own score.\n\nPros:\n+Great music\n+Overall, this takes a very simple game mechanic and makes an endless runner out of it\n+Great minimalistic design\n+There is real attention to detail with menus and stats (I especially like the progress bar during the run)\n+Its cheap\n\nCons:\n-Although it is similiar in many ways, it is not as addictive to the legendary Super Hexagon\n-I think the background 'space' is a bit underused - it could take some notes from how Sentris deals with background design (they could even be unlockables, which would further extend play)\n-I could not find an options menu (mainly I wanted full screen mode) EDIT: there is an options menu with fullscreen mode, I just missed it. See first comment below to find it if you are having trouble.\n-I love the ideas of different modes (e.g. 'drunk mode'), but I had little interest in playing with modified controls (it is hard enough without them ;) )\n\nIs this title going to redefine a genre? No. Will this be enjoyable by those who play games like Super Hexagon and Boson X? Sure.","August 26, 2015","true","1.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","2"

However, I felt while playing this game that it had on edge on Super Hexagon due to more random obstacles than the same 7 memorizable patterns. Lets head to the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\nAmazing sound design, with a unique song for each level, made by brilliant electronic composers.\n\nSimple yet deceivingly difficult gameplay that successfully fulfills the neo-arcade design, complete with customizable screen curving!\n\nMinimalist graphics that focus back on to the gameplay rather than distracting you.\n\nExtra modes that affect the regular levels for more fun!\n\nCons:\nControls were a teensy bit weird to understand at the start. Instead of permanent twitch moves you use the arrow keys to hold the hexagon in place and then release to bring it back to the center. Ultimately not a problem but it takes time to get used to. Would love to see an extra mode without it though ;)\n\nOverall, RFLEX is a really fun and addicting twitch-reflex-neo-arcade-minimalist-psychedelic experience. Like Super Hexagon I will spend quite a bit of time getting used to the controls and tricks required to survive.

Super Hexagon was actually the basis for checking out this game, as I thought they would have nice similarities. They do, but they do provide very different experiences.\n\nIs it good?\n\nIn short: Yes! This game is great. The simple visuals, controls, and great soundtrack all make for an entertaining, if frustrating, game. It's a game I think I will find myself returning to frequently either to kill time or beat an old record. While it's similar to Super Hexagon, this isn't spinnig around a hexagon at break neck pace past barriers, but more like dodgeball, if you are severely near-sighted and you're in the middle of everyone.\n\nIn long: As stated, it's a great game! Like Super Hexagon, it has simple graphics which lend themselves nicely to the style of play, give it a recognizable look, and don't confuse the player. The soundtrack is great as well, so it's nice to get on and see how long I can last just to listen to the music (perhaps I should pick up the soundtrack). The game lends itself nicely to killing a short period of time or longer play sessions (but I can see myself getting fatigued late into a session).\n\nThe controls are responsive (there are only 5 buttons the player uses anyway) and I only have one (very minor) issue in this regard. LEFT and RIGHT are no problem to hit, but Up and Down can be a rough transition as I have my finger jumping between the two, this has made me slip up when playing. Aside from practicing, the alternative is to use W for UP with my left hand (or the opposite where S would be DOWN instead), which will require its own practice but less likely to slip. The only reason I find this remotely significant is due to the fast nature of the game (because that is honestly a pretty pathetic complaint in 99% of scenarios).\n\nAlso like Super Hexagon, this appears randomized at first, however I was able to pick out patterns in the obstacles hurdling at one of your five faces. After the first level these patterns did get harder to detect and carry out, so it doesn't seem like it will get to a point where I detect the pattern and carry it out without thinking rather than relying on reflexes.\n\n*Edit: After playing through all the levels, I did come to remember and recognize all patterns. But it still isn't an issue in difficulty due to the fact that you have to actually be able to recognize it and execute it in time.\n\nIf you're looking for a fast paced, simple, retro style game with a great soundtrack, RFLEX should fill that nicely.","December 28, 2015","true","6.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While playing, you can detect patterns, each level have their own set of patterns, if you want to get the high times, you need to know what these patterens are.\n\nIt's simplicity is done in a way to where it's is addicting and doesn't bore the players, but it also doesn't make it too complex and put off players. The simplicity then carries forward to it's achievements as they are quite straight forward to achieve them.\n\nEven though my time may be small, I recommend this game to anyone who likes a challenge, and has a hour or less to loose.","January 16","true","4.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
