Its story mode may be on the short side (around 2-3 hours), but it provides good, hectic fun with another player! The co-op isn't perfect, but the competitive mode will surely provide some entertainment for a while (and perhaps ruin friendships).\n\nIn response to some negative reviews, I did not find any problems playing the game with the keyboard. If you don't like the original bindings, you can easily remap the keys. And for those curious, you do not need a controller for two players to play at once. Two people on a keyboard (one using W, A, S, D, and the other using arrow keys) worked just fine - it all just comes down to preference.\n\nFor more details and thoughts, you can read my full review here[moviepilot.com].","December 23, 2015","true","5.3"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

It may play just find on controller, but for keyboard users it quickly becomes tiresome.\n\nRefunded.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game for keyboard users.","October 9, 2015","false","0.4"," 39 of 65 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","39","65","3","2"

It has a simple gameplay (match-3) but doesn't get boring with bosses every 10 levels that slightly changes the mechanics and multiple possible combinations (materials or the tools above the blocks). If the 50 level story mode isn't enough, there is a versus mode if you have a friend or brother/sister to play with, and a survival mode where you can try to break your records.\n\nFully recommended","December 23, 2015","true","10.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"
