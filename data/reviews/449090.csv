"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NemesisSieg/recommended/449090/","NemesisSieg","Sieg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NemesisSieg/","118 products in account","Worst car park ever\nI expected very little, I got very little. Admittedly I'm a big fan of the zombie genre, so at the asking price I figured why not give it a go? Even at the low asking price, I can't recommend Zombie Parking. The main reason is evident after 10 minutes of gameplay; repetitive and dull. The novelty quickly wears off as you realise you've done 20 laps around the same parking lot and shot the same generic zombie model a hundred times already. There is little variety in the zombie models, and most times you'll see several of the same model on screen at once.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=665317063\nI guess blue vest and black shorts is in high demand in this neighbourhood.. Also, it is incredibly difficult to die, heck you're almost surprised when you get hit. The zombies inevitably form a small horde, a couple will break off from the pack because they're a little faster, and when you gun one down another will crawl out from a vent somewhere in the parking lot. The only scenario I can imagine a player genuinely getting killed is if they were to somehow get trapped in a corner or by a car by a group of zombies, but this never looked likely whilst I played. In my first session, I got 500,000 points (which is good, right...? Who knows), and unlocked 25/35 achievements before finally succumbing to boredom and switching it off. There was no skill involved whatsoever, just sheer persistence in resisting the urge to exit the game.\n\nI would argue the game actually gets worse the longer you play. The zombies don't get faster, more dangerous or more intelligent, but they do turn into bullet sponges. This made a dull game incredibly tedious as you would often run out of ammo, then have to do a lap around the parking lot before being able to collect ammo (which would drop in the same spot every 45 seconds or so). Later in the game, after collecting ammo, it was pointless firing into the horde because each pickup contains one clip, meaning you would take out just 2 or 3 zombies before having to wait for more ammo. I found it was better to pick up a few clips before taking more zombies out, increasing the chain combo and increasing the chance that they would drop ammo too. This is pretty much the only tactical decision I felt I made the entire time playing the game. I should also note that whilst the game runs fine, and there doesn't seem to be any real bugs, I felt like I was using a paint gun when bullets hit a zombie. This was way more noticable later in the game when they turn into bullet sponges.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=665311797\nAt the price, Zombie Parking could prove to be a decent purchase (if not overwhleming) if a few changes were made to make it less generic. For example, the zombies: they're either shamblers or shamblers with a little spring in ther step. Players don't really have anything to fear, or anything to be tactical about. Try mixing it up a bit!\nFat zombies: slow, bullet sponges, block the players off and does more damage\nChainsaw zombie: fast, can kill the player in just a few hits\nCrawler: fast, low health, can crawl on walls and ceiling\nYeah they're generic zombie types and we've seen them in countless games, but they would mix things up a bit and make things more challenging. There could also be some variety with the guns, shotgun short range, rifle medium range, far from inspiring. Plus the shotgun is about as useful as a water pistol later in the game. Also, I personally think health and armour should be a bit less available to players, they respawn every 45 seconds or so and as I said, it's surprising when you even get hit.\n\nOverall, even at the price, even for zombie fanatics, I just cannot recommend Zombie Parking as it is. It just simply doesn't offer enough. Plus Steam has new sales running every few days, and even at the low cost, you will be able to find something for the same price worth losing hours in.","April 14","false","2.9"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","23","27","4","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/recommended/449090/","nourl1","Two Clicks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/","547 products in account","THE DOWNLOW:\nOne player.  One map.  One mode.  Two guns and a handful of power-ups. Versus an endless horde.  Basically the premise of the game(loosely used within this review) is that you are trapped in an in-escapeable underground car park during a zombie apocalypse.  Your only aim is to kill zombies till you die... from the zombies or from boredom.  At least you get to choose.  Pick-up more ammo, a couple of power-up boosters but mainly just avoid being clawed by the undead crew about to make your day repetitive.  Very repetitive!\n\nTHE GOOD:\n+ Numerous power-ups to collect.  Two types of ammo, infinite ammo, invulnerability shield, health, armor and kill all zeds.\n+ A few hours of fun for achievement hunters to buff their game completed totals on their profile.\n+ Its cheap.  Very cheap on sale.  Should only be considered on sale imo.\n\nTHE BAD:\n- Only two guns to kill the zeds with.  No melee makes this especially bad.\n- Only one level.  Only one mode.  Zombies spawn and attack in one endless wave.  Until you die or give up.  Usually the latter.\n- Terribly balanced.  Everything is easy at the start but once your score gets to 700k you will experience lulls in what you can do as ammo dries up. As a result power-up stop becoming available and you have to grind away until you rebuild your ammo supplies.\n- No coop.  Would have made a big difference to the longevity and replayability of this game.  As it was I uninstalled after getting the last achievement.\n\nAND THE ORDINARY:\n* Pre-made graphics are nice to look at but there are only two zombie models.  Still at least they crawl, get up when shot to the floor and can have their heads & arms shot off.\n* Okay gameplay.  Its basic and somewhat fun.  Move around.  Avoid zombies. Kill zombies. Pick-up powerups, reload/switch weapons.  Rinse and repeat.\n\n\nVERDICT:\nZombie Parking is superb.  Amazing!  Spectacular!! And then its developer woke up.  Okay so Im joking.  Is it complete pants!?  Well no.  But its no Dying Light!  Therefore if you will imagine Yet Another Zombie Defense but..... without the defense or any other gameplay elements other than shoot to kill!  This is what happens when you make game development accessible to everyone with half-a-brain.  Its a tech. demo at best.  One that should have been built upon, instead of wrapped up, packaged and sold as a going concern.  That - it isnt!\n\nGameplay is monotonous and not challenging in the least.  Essentially it could be called Zombie 'kiting' simulator for those of you that know what that is.  It does have a certain charm to it and yes there is a solid base for what could have been a decent zombie survival game but it needs more of everything.  More maps, more guns, more power-ups, more zombies, more levels.  Even the explosive fuel cans that can be used to blow-up zombie hordes are limited ffs!!\n\nI know what you're thinking did I pay 80cents or only 5.... or something like that!?!  Yes I did get this on a decent discount but I expect thats what the developer was hoping for.  A quick cash-in on a good start but no follow-through.  Is it worth it!?  Maybe to some people.  I enjoyed my few hours (two games) playing it.\n\nHowever I cant recommend this game unless you are an achievement hunter looking for a quick +1 completed game on your steam profile or one that loves killing zombies in any shape or form.  If you are, dont blame me - I tried to put you off.  Otherwise all serious gamers should just save their money and put it towards a coffee, some toffee, a beer or some gear.  Or whatever else takes your fancy.","June 6","false","3.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RedbeardOfOz/recommended/449090/","RedbeardOfOz","Redbeard.wp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RedbeardOfOz/","956 products in account","Zombie Parking is small zombie killing game. Worth playing for a bit of shooting fun.\n\nYou are in a car park with a whole lot of zombies, who are constantly coming out of the vents and from under the walls.\nAt your spawn area is a row of four items - armour, health, shotgun shells, and rifle bullets - which keep on respawning (although, after you have collected them, you have to wait a while for them to respawn).\nThe entire game is played in a one-level car park, so there's not a lot of scenery to explore.\n\nThe defence weaponry consists of a shotgun and a rifle. You start with some limited ammunition, but you can get more from the spawn area and zombie drops.\nKilling zombies will cause a number of them to drop ammunition, armour, and health - as well as some rarer drops, such as double damage and infinity ammunition (the latter is poorly named, as it doesn't last forever).\n\nWhen you do a few headshots, a red bar appears, and - while it is up - this is your chance to score a lot of points with zombie kills.\n\nI thought that the hardest achievement for Zombie Parking would be to get 1,000,000 kills in one game - but it turned out that getting the armour and health achievements took longer, as - if you are playing the game properly - you hardly ever get hit by the zombies at all; not if you are careful, anyway; so, to get those two particular achievements, you basically have to allow yourself to be hit so that you can fill up again on armour and health.\nAt one point, when going for the 1,000,000 kill achievement, I was fighting zombies near a wall and somehow the game glitched, and I found myself outside of the car park building and was unable to get back in again - I was not happy. But it only happened once (mind you, I tried to keep away from the walls after that).\n\nIt took 3 hours and 10 minutes to get 100% of the achievements for this game - but you should be able to do it a lot quicker if 1) you don't walk through a wall by accident, and 2) you allow yourself to be hit a lot, so that you can keep filling up on armour and health.\n\nZombie Parking is fun little zombie killing game. It's a cheap buy, so you can expect to get what you pay for; but it's fine for what it is. Play it for a short while and then shelve it - you should get your money's worth out of it.\n\nI only have three small criticisms of the game:\n1) The setup implies that you can change the key bindings, but - as far as I could see - the bindings can't be changed (it would be preferable if they could be altered by players to suit themselves).\n2) It would have been better if it had a melee weapon, in addition to the two firearms.\n3) You can't save your game. It is quite easy to get massive scores in this game, but it's limited by how much time you want to spend playing it at any one time - so, it would be good if you could save your game and then continue it another day (as the game doesn't have levels, game saves are not highly needed, but it would be useful.\n\nOn balance, I would recommend this game.\nSure, it's based upon a small map (the car park) and it's repetitive (you just run around a lot and shoot), but for $1 you shouldn't be expecting a massive and amazing game.\nThe graphics, ambience, and gameplay look fine.\nPlay it for a bit of shooting fun - that's what it's all about.","April 15","true","3.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Honestly, I didn't expect much. But, I actually enjoyed playing it. Probably more than I should have. It's so simple to play it's ridiculous. You are in a parking garage with zombies and you shoot them with either your shotgun or automatic rifle. When they die, the zombies drop loot like health replenishers, shields and other items, some I don't even know what they are for. One actually dropped a white skull that killed all zombies when I picked it up. If it had cost more than $1 I'd have trouble recommending it but at only $1 I think it's worth it.\n\nPros:\nIt's a simple, easy to play game that doesn't take a lot of thought to play. It plays well using the Unreal engine. The longer you play, the more difficult it gets. You can shoot gas cans and blow a lot of zombies up at one time.\n\nCons:\nSince you're only killing zombies and running around a parking garage it can boring petty quickly. There are no additional levels or difficulty settings. The zombie models and movements are limited and redundant.\n\nRecommendation:\nFor only $1, or less, I'd say grab it, fire it up and let your frustrations out by the mindless killing of a few hundred zombies.\n\nHere's a video of my gameplay if you're interested:\nhttps://youtu.be/QronjlG8hag\n","April 14","true","1.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"
