Still worth checking out though and the price is pretty right in my opinion.","December 12, 2013","true","5.0"," 145 of 167 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","145","167","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bobnowhere/recommended/253130/","bobnowhere","bobnowhere","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bobnowhere/","3425 products in account","In Rescue – Everyday Heroes you play the boss of a fire station in charge of responding to emergencies of all types in the local area.  While described as a simulation, casual would be a much better characterisation.\n\nThe game takes part in two parts, the first a Sims-like fire station where you hire and fire firefighters and paramedics, assign them different jobs around the station like dispatch or maintenance or improve their skills at the lecture room or gym.  Your also have to monitor their individual moods, assign them a job they like, it goes up, if something goes wrong in their lives, favourite football team loses, it goes down and they are useless.  You can also cover the fire station in all sorts of furniture, some useful, some purely cosmetic.\n\nThe second part of the game is the actual fire fighting and treating injured citizens and transporting them to hospital.  Here you take a combination of vehicles to a locations in the city, bins on fire, plane crashes, truck crashes and the like and put out the fire and treat and transport any survivors.  Water is obviously the most important resource here, you either need to find a fire hydrant and hook up a supply hose and then the standard hoses to that or bring your own water in the form of a tanker.  As you make your way through the campaign newer vehicles will unlock, many carry their own water and even have a remote fire hose on the roof.  Eventually you'll just bring these firetrucks, someone's barbecue is on fire?  Smash down the fence with your trucks and blast that BBQ across the backyard into the neighbour's kitchen.  Fire out, job done.\n\nParamedics also play an important role in the game.  Accidents often leave injured strew across the scene and the first job is to assign a paramedic to triage each and treat them in order of most injured to least and transport them to the hospital.  Once a patient gets to the purple state you lose money from your mission score so be sure to look after the most injured first.  Do they die if you leave them too long? I don't know, it never seemed to happen.  I once thought I had finished a mission but it said there was one more patient, turned out I'd parked an Ambulance on top of him.  He was fine, probably sued the crap out of the city though.  If things get too hectic you can also hire extra ambulances, doctors and firetrucks at a cost, but you'll never run out of cash.\n\nThere are a few issues though.  Pathing is poor and clicking, selecting and giving orders is inexact at best.  Often trying to assign the second paramedic to a stretcher is an exercise in frustration as they either can't work out how to get there or the stretcher has clipped into something else.  Also why on earth can't firefighters carry stretchers?  I understand they are not trained in advanced medicine, but any clown can carry the other end.  It would give them something to do after the fire is out.  There are also no female fire fighters or paramedics.  Some mission take place indoors and here the performance can take quite a hit, chugging along for no real reason.\n\nThe campaign is not particularly long, 5-6 hours at most, though there is a free-play mode where you only have to fight fires, no base management.  I played though the campaign in one sitting but I can't recommend paying full price.  On special or from a bundle and it's good fun for a few hours.\n\n6/10","June 27, 2014","true","5.9"," 51 of 56 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","51","56","0","0"

The modeling and graphics are fit the game nicely. There are a few drawbacks though. The controls and (not sure what its called) the going through clicking buttons whatever is hard. It is not very easy to command a unit to do something, this is not good when in an emergency. The map is very limited, which makes the missions feel repetitve. There are also some minor glitches, like firemen getting stuck in firetrucks, ambulance doesn't want to got to the hospital, etc. If you think it looks interesting, buy it, I still find it very fun.\n\nALSO: Although I do recommend this game, Emergency: Fire Response is better.

You control a fire station, and as you start to get into the game it looks like it could be a nice 'time management' type strategy simulation. I could see it becoming a game were you had to get you're guys to work as a team to save people.. but as you hit the 2nd or 3rd mission that dream fades and you are left with the reality that you're playing a point and click game for teenagers working on there motor skills with a mouse. Most missions were you have multiple guys responding you quickly find they do everything so fast its easier to just pick one guy and do everything, for example the first thing you learn, connecting the support hose, then connecting an assault hose. If you attempt to use 2 guys to do this they get in each others way tripping over one another like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and by the time your first guy has laid out his 'support' hose, your 2nd guy is just tripping his way back to the truck to bust out the 'attack' hose. You quickly start asking yourself, "why did I even tell you to move, your too late". So the game becomes a resource management game, trying to save every drop of water in your truck for that pesky leaf fire in the middle of nothing that is endangering all the roaches in the area, you'd have thought the 1600 gallon tank would be more then enough, but the first one took 85% of your water. you would think there would be more 'don't use this type of extinguisher on this type of fire' going into a game based around fighting fires, but apparently education was last on there mind (unless you feel like reading all the info panels in the menu that tell you the history of fire fighting/rescue). The game died for me when i came to a fire that was down a set of stairs (you know surrounded by concrete, scaring all the ants?) and i told my 'guy' to walk down there with the attack hose and he dumbed around in a few circles then went upstairs, then apparently he ran out of hose, perhaps it was around his neck, cutting off the oxygen to his brain, and couldn't seem to figure out what a Z coordinate was. After that i promptly uninstalled and made its own heading in my steam games as 'crapgames'. it is currently the only resident of that title so far.","November 14, 2014","false","5.8"," 34 of 45 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","34","45","4","0"

Too clicky, too tedious.\n\nIn short. Get call out. Put out fires. Open broken cars. Send peeps to hospital. Build up station, get promoted and buy new trucks.\n\nIt WILL hold interest for awhile simply because of the "what will I get next" and you get to play with some new trucks.\n\nBut ahhhhhh!!!!!\n\nSome of the pathing is stupid. Truck hooked up. Traffic stopping access. Guys caught under truck when you connect up. Can't move truck because guys is connected but can't disconnect guy because he's under the truck! One incapped truck.\n\nOut of water? I have to bring fireys #1 and #2 back to the truck from the seat of the fire, disconnect their hoses before firey #3 can disconnect main hose. Why can't we just drop the damn main connector from truck!!\n\nAnd what? ONE fire extinguiser per truck?  Really?\n\nAmbos? Attend to patient with ambo #1 while ambo #2 get's stretcher. Ambo #1 has to go back to the ambulance to put the first aid kit away before he can help with the stretcher!! Unless ofc, you have a firey doing nothing while he waits for the truck to come back with more water. Except, he's holding the damn hose isn't he!?!?\n\nI found at least 1 faulty mission. Objective: Extricate victim. So  I sent heavy rescue and hey, guess what, car is empty. Mission even said victim was thrown clear!!!\n\nAlso no idea if fire scene has hydrants or not so have to take water tankers everytime anyway!\n\n..oo00oo..\n\nSUMMARY\nMost of the game logic is very, very ordinary. Shows a complete lack of bothering to test or even consider the scenarios.\n\nThis COULD be interesting if actually doing the missions wasn't so flawed and tedious.\n\nDon't.

TBH it is not surprising, BUT - one moment - when firefighter connect his attack hose to split, he needs additional command to put the flames. Damn. That`s a bit too much for me - micromanagement in all it`s glory. Other thing or things: impossible to connect attack hose directly to fire engine, split must be connected first. That`s nonsense - maybe I am enough only one hose connected to one engine. pathfinding problems already are mentioned by other people. And after some hours playing it becomes very repeating - the maps, the objectives, the fire itself, and extinguishing itself - arrive, connect, connect more, water ended, get more, finished. And put the equipment there, where you took it from. Impossible to put in on ground, need run here and there, what wastes time.

None of this sim mechanics seem utilized at all.  The game is pretty short about 20 missions, maybe 9-10 vehicles, and no police vehicles.  The missions repeat in the campaign after completing them and freeplay is sorta meh.  Since there are only fires, alot of missions have to do with a barbecue catching fire, or a tree.  Just go there point truck at fire and the fire goes out.  It is a simple game, I got bored of it in the few clocked hours I have playing this.  This game could be awesome though if the Sim features are ever utilized.

I still haven't tried the Emergency series, which I believe to the be the natural competition to this title, so my review is based on this game, as a stand-alone entity (from the perspective of being new to this genre).\n\nThe reason I chose this title over one of the others, was simply because I felt intrigued to play a rescue game with the prospect of a station management side. Between every mission you return to your station, where you can hire paramedics and firefighters, buy new vehicles, and spruce up your station with new furniture and technology. Truthfully, I love buying new vehicles and hiring new staff, but still can't understand what importance they play when assigned to certain jobs in the station... I guess I need to do more digging around to answer that one. It's also nice to have a specific budget allowance in the game, that prevents you from going crazy and buying everything too early.\n\nWhen you're happy with your vehicles and staff, then you hit the little mission light (a button in the bottom right corner), and now the game enters a phase where your staff occasionally open a dialogue with you, and where you receive incoming missions. These missions range from fairly easy house fires to massive highway pile-ups that require Heavy Rescue vehicles, Fire Engines, Paramedics and more. Even if you don't have the right vehicle, you can spend money mid-mission to call in doctors etc.\n\nThe pathfinding of your units, once you assign them a task, isn't always perfect, and several times I've had issues with Paramedics struggling to take the other end of a stretcher, when in a confined space. I've figured out a work-around for this, so it doesn't bother me so much, nor detract from the sense of urgency, nor the element of fun that playing the game provides.\n\nSo far I've played this game for about 8 hours, and I'm still very much enjoying the feel and challenge of this title. With no frame of reference to other, similar titles, I can't say how well it stacks up against the competition, however, I'm very happy with this game and would strongly recommend it to anyone that has an interest in the genre, or enjoys management and strategy games.\n\nI give it 8/10 - only revoking those extra points for the occasionally tricky path-finding.","April 12, 2014","true","13.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It's mainly about micromanaging fire fighters and paramedics. Unfortunately, few interior fires that seem exciting, and the paramedic missions are bog standard and rather boring. Towards the end of the game, you get tanker trucks that allow your firefighters to fight fires without ever leaving their trucks. It's easy, but makes the game less fun. The last new firefighting truck I'd get is the Water Carrier, as some missions are simply too far to not have water on hand. The later trucks simply make it too easy, plus the trucks are autonomous in this game, so you don't have to send a single firefighter to win.

With the added management parts, it was quite good...at first.\n\nIt slows right down when getting over a fire, although not every time.  Making the game unplayable.\n\nFirefighters get stuck under the trucks, and wont move, and you cannot move the trucks either.  This tends to happen more often than not, near the end of a rescue...adding to the annoyance.\n\nI've just gotten to the train derailment mission...and the amount of smoke made the game slow to an almost crawl...and firefighters kept getting stuck under the engine...right at the end of the mission.  And then the ambulances, although just emptied, wouldn't accept anymore patients.\n\nThe amount of clicking you have to do, because it doesn't always register that you've clicked on a unit, is a joke.\nI like how you have to set up everything...but that can get tedious and dangerous, especially if you have multiple firetrucks.  So, best way around that, don't use firetrucks for a fire, use the water tenders or foam tenders, and just send them to reload when empty.  Saves a lot of time, clicking and messing about with reloading the mission because the firefighters are stuck.\n\nExample : I had a mission, with lots of fire.  By the time I got 1 Fire engine set up, my water tender had finished putting out all the fires.\n\nAlso...I think that some kind of menu bar would've been useful.  Where it listed the units you had in the mission, so you could easily select them, instead of constantly selecting a unit you didn't want.\n\nGreat idea, but too many annoying features and bugs for me to recommend it.","June 11, 2014","false","12.3"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Like all reviews, I take them with a grain of salt as they are personal opinions. And, as such, that is exactly what I am offering with my review.\n\nAdmittedly, the "Campaign" is fairly short. I spent a few hours on a single night and pretty much ran through all of the missions that the game presented in this mode. However, I found that I enjoyed the overall game play that it offered.\n\nPros:\n\n* Wide selection of vehicles (as you progress you unlock new ones)\n*  Base management adds an interesting aspect of game play\n* While managing your base you're not rushed into an emergency situation as the game pauses time while you manage your base.\n* The ability to train and "level up" your team of firefighters and paramedics is quite nice.\n* Different situations arise due to differing personalities amongst your staff (a nice touch).\n* Some missions offer a slight challenge for those seeking it. You can always abandon the mission and repeat if you chose the wrong or inadequate equipment.\n\nCons:\n* Campaign is short (haven't tried Freeplay mode yet, will update my thoughts when I do)\n* For those seeking an incredible challenge, this game really isn't for you.\n* Some flakey physics (driving through objects, pushing guys out of the way, etc) but nothing that was a deal-breaker for me.\n\n\nThis game is a casual simulation game that is a decent mix of a business management (firehouse management) and strategy wrapped into what I call a well done shell. This game isn't meant to force you to spend hours upon hours trying to beat a single mission (I think the most times I restarted a mission was twice but that was because I was herp derping on my mouse clicks lol). I think that those who are looking for something casual to spend a few hours a night doing, this might be worth it.  Don't like the price? Wait for it to go on sale because you know Steam has tons of sales :-)\n\n* Update 4/25/2014*\nAfter trying Freeplay mode, my overall view of this game hasn't changed. Freeplay really doesn't offer a whole lot other than a way to play missions on an open map. It can be challenging at times when you get multiple missions at the same time. You are limited to 4 vehicles at any given time and you can swap them out by sending them back to base and removing them. There is no money aspect or base management aspect in freeplay mode. Just a simple choose your vehicles, choose your staff, and go do missions. I was a bit disappointed that there was no save feature for freeplay mode. You simply play till you have had enough and you get a score. Still, this game is very nice if you catch it on sale.","April 15, 2014","true","12.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

A lot of missions are available in the Campaign mode, but they are all very similar and get quite boring after a while. The 'Station Management' mode of the Campaign mode should rather be called 'Furniture Placement Simulator'.\n\n\nPositive\n- This game has some good management aspects.\n- This game is enjoyable for a while.\n- A variety of management options are available.\n- There are plenty of different vehicles available.\n\n\nNegative\n- This game has FAR too much micromanagement. You can't co-ordinate a large operation succesfully when you need to tell each person 'Ok, get out of the vehicle. Open the compartment. Get the hose. Attach it to a hydrant. Move towards the fire. Extinguish the fire. Now move on to the next fire.'\n\n- This game is not very realistic. Vehicles can drive away with nobody in them.","December 23, 2014","false","17.7"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

If you were to buy it, wait until you can get it for less then $10.00 as I did. The game is enjoyable, with both the simulation and the RTS aspects of the game working very well. You should be able to get at least 10-12 hours out of it, depening on how long it takes you to do the missions. But after that the game just ends with there being no more new missions, only the option to replay the old ones. I didn't play with the timed missions on, so maybe that changes the game signifcantly, but without a timer all the missions are extremely easy and managing the firehouse is too easy as well, with hardly any issues maintaining morale and keeping yourself in the green financially.\n\nBottom line, if you can get it cheap, then get it. If not, then wait for a sale.","April 24, 2014","true","11.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story is fun, but it is unfinished, has small bugs and glitches; some mission ending. Such as the 9th Company Game this has the same feel to it but instead of fighting the Mujis', you're fighting fires with in a simulated environment. Like 9th Company they have the same glitch with vehicles , they have clipping and no clipping moments when the vehicle you are sending in get stuck half way in the ground, leaving you to stand around with your thumb up your Bum trying to figure out just how you can put out a fire without the truck. Another mission breaking glitch is the Ambulance, when you tell it to return to base or transport a patient to the hospital, it won't go through to the return point. This includes movement of multiple vehicles at once if you select more than 2 they wont move the operation system seems to get confused. Lastly the game is unfinished, you may notice this; it is the absence of the training area, and the fact there is no helicopter on the landing pad or helicopter to purchase. I believe there is a lot to add to this game to make it better or "fixed" new missions , new vehicles & Aircarft (Rescue) & (MedVAC), maybe even a possible fire rescue boat for harbor fire missions.\nLastly, the new missions should include the following, multiple floor fire, victims in the fire, loss of fire fighters, Ladder trucks, more highway/ open area missions that require MedVAV helicopters. That would make the Rescue- Everyday Heroes a completed game. We could also always wish on, collasping buildings, search and rescue missions with helicopters: due to the fact the game has both a country setting as well as a harbor, in which fire fighters are required to have a boat crew and or helicopter rescue/ divers.  I rate the game 4/10 for "completeness", 6/10 for entertainment, 8/10 all around if it ever recieves, patches and DLC. Although it was a fun game $19.99 is asking a little much for an uncompleted game , in which it has the same effort put forth as a game that costs $4.99 through Steam. Otherwise, its a great game and fun; but needs improvement.- Good luck!","December 14, 2013","true","15.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There are a few bugs that keep it from being a great game, but if you don't mind them, go ahead and pick it up. It's fun despite the annoying bugs.\n\nGraphics:\nNot bad. Not great. Just average. The one thing that did bug me was that if your mission occured during the night, it was near impossible to see your guys. Also if there was a lot of smoke, same issue. At least for the smoke the devs could have done the blue outline they used for the same guys and vehicles when they were behind a tree. Oversall, passable.\n\nAudio:\nFirst up is the background music. All I have to say is that it didn't catch my attention, which means that it wasn't bad, but it also wasn't great. Sound effects were okay. Nothing really detracting, but the sfx of the fires crackling and the water running was nice. The vocals in the game are similar to what you would hear in an RTS. Click on a character and they respond with a 'Ready!'.\n\nGameplay:\nThe game basically has two modes. The first is the prep mode. This is where you buy stuff for your firestation, hire units, buy vehicles, assign tasks, etc. Your units have traits, moods, and skills. Only thing is, nowhere does it say what the different things you buy do to affect your units mood. The traits are random and the skills can be leveled up to make your units stronger. I didn't really notice any difference betweena  one chevron vs a three chevron unit.\n\nThe second part of the games consists of doing missions. These basically boil down to either stop a fire or save people. Sometimes missions require you to do both. The first few missions do a very good job of teaching you how to do these. By the final mission, you'll know exactly what you are doing and what you want your units to do.\n\nHere lies the problem. It get be a pain getting your units to do what you want. Frist off is the pathfinding. Sometimes it's good. But most of the time you'll be wondering why your paramedic is going around the tree that's not in the way. Second is selecting your units. It can be a pain trying to click them. Especially when they are crowded together. You end up clicking the paramedic that's treating the victim and canceling the treatment instead of clicking the free paramedic that you want to go get the stretcher. There have also be times where I can't see my guys because when you put stuff away in the vechiles, they end up hiding behind the vehicle and you have to turn the camera which wastes time. Which brings about a couple more problems. Camera and time. The camera can only pan, rotate, and zoom. No tilt. Which means that if you are in the city, it might take you awhile to find a good vantage point between all the highrise towers. Also time. There's no way to slow down time so you can find your guys. Lose track of your paramedic or firefighter holding the special tool you need, and you're gonna waste time while the victim in the cars slowly dies. The devs should have added a feature to slow down time so you can give commands, or made it so you can still view the game while paused.\n\nSo in conclusion, the game is fun. There are bugs and poor design choices. However, if you are willing to overlook those, go ahead and get the game. It's short, about 4-5 hours of you time. I recommend getting it on sale.","July 30, 2014","true","13.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I even liked Emergency 2012 better, and that was utter crap. Don't waste 15 quid on this game, go buy Emergency 4. Emergency 4 has a heavy modding community and has been active for years with many great mods to choose from. The missions are better and the freeplay is generally much more thought out than this games version. Not only that but Emergency 4 allows you to control technical and police services aswell as EMT/FD. The only thing I like about this game OVER Emergency 4 would be the way the 'campaign' worked, running a fire department rather than just having a menu and going into a mission.\n\nI think the game has real potential, but the way it was executed was just bad. I would pass up on the graphics if the rest of the above problems were sorted.\n\nI'm sorry, but after clocking atleast a 100 hours on Emergency 4, I just can't stand to play this. It's hard to play and theres no joy.

I was expecting alot more emersion, tools, apparatuses and command abilties based off of RL firefighting.\n\nHow can a you build a FF game and not have the following:\n1) A ladder (truck). - enough said. Trucks Co. are just as vitial as engine Co.\n2) Basic hand tools for forcable entry/rescue. Engine Co. do a lot more than just pour water on fire; all that is available is a short supply line with a portable hydrant which you can connect attack lines too. Does not work that way in RL. 99% of the time, one FF jumps off the engine, grabs the 5 inch hose off the back so the driver can lay in. Then the hydrant gets connected the engine in turn the other FFs grab the attack lines which are already preconnected to the engine. BTW Engines also have master stream or AKA a deck gun.\n\nThe game play gripes are as follows:\n1) FF do not lose health or get injurred.\n2) The scenarios are way too predictable and arcadish.\n3) Limited to only 4 apparatus in any scenario.\n4) No ability to call for Mutual aid if needed.\n5) Interacting with individual firefighters in scenario is very tetitous - hate having to click 5 times per FF to give orders. Each resource should have command options to direct the Co. actions upon arrival. Clicking and ordering each individual FF is way to tetitous and annoying.\n6) While in management mode - The game feels too much like SIMS.\n\nOther notes - I give an "E" for effort on this one - I do not know what the budget was for this game, but I think the devs could have added alot more. I personally think watching some FF training, RL videos, or taking a FF one course could have helped susbstancially in crafting a very intutative FF game.","December 22, 2013","false","10.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Freezeisgreat/recommended/253130/","Freezeisgreat","TheGreatSpooksby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Freezeisgreat/","23 products in account","Rescue - Everyday Heroes is a decent game, and the concept of it is quite interesting. The problem is that the game itself isn't very compelling. Allow me to explain.\n\nEvery mission you are called in to either has to deal with a fire, hurt individuals that require medical attention, or both. Occasionally, the game with throw in other scenarios such as if the player has the proper vehicles/equipment. For instance, upon getting a vehicle optimized for dealing with car crashes, severe car crash missions become available to you. That's pretty interesting, I must say! But after a while, the game becomes boring as you begin to complete every mission by simply putting out fires or aiding harmed people. It just becomes a grind of sorts to get new vehicles to unlock new missions that, at their core, are fundamentally the same.\n\nIt would be interesting if this game introduced really varied and interesting missions. Such as a gas station set ablaze by an arsonist, and you have limited time to put out fires and rescue people. Time limits could be a very interesting and challenging addition to this game! Point blank, this game could have quite a few things done to it to make it more interesting and compelling to play.\n\nLastly, and perhaps they've fixed this since the last time I've played, but it appears the AI isn't the best at times. You move your crew around by selecting the vehicle or the 'hero' if you will, and then clicking on where you want them to go, or clicking and selecting what you want them to do. Whenever you want them to move to put out a fire, for example, they will do as they're told and get out a hose. But, when they try to go to the fire, they get stuck on a simple object because their pathfinding isn't really the best in the world. So this is, of course, something else that should be improved on.\n\nIn all, I'd rate this game at a 4/10. The idea is interesting and could be quite fun to play, but there's flaws in the game design and the AI code that could be vastly improved to make it an overall better game. Honestly, I would not recommend this game to anyone who is buying it, if it is indeed in its final state, without many updates in the future.","March 27, 2014","false","1.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While the game has it's share of glitches, I was plesantly surprised by the gameplay that I've continued to return to it.\n\nThose glitches, though, are my biggest beef with this game.  As was stated previously, the collision detection on the objects is severly lacking (some maps the trucks unload the firefighters underneath them instead of next to the vehicle).  Trucks drive almost through each other (it seems like the collision web is literally the center of the truck).\n\nDespite this, the selection of vehicles and the variety of missions can keep you going for a while.  Perhaps the developers will continue to add content such as aerial ladder trucks or helos (maybe they've done the helos and I just haven't gotten there yet...would still be a nice support option if too complex to add to the actual game).\n\nThe fire station play is similar to other management simulations that I've played, and balancing your crews between different tasks while getting their skills up keeps the gameplay going in between missions.  Being able to add props to the fire house allow for a decent level of customization.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this game to those who aren't overly bothered by some glitches in a game and enjoy a relaxing bit of fun running a fire department.","December 19, 2013","true","9.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Most games of this sort are either basically puzzle games (see the Emergency series) or overly scripted such that your actions don't really matter (Fire Department series). This game doesn't fall into either the trap of becoming a puzzle or having missions that are just interactive cutscenes.\n\nThere are some minor frustrations with the UI. It is tedious to deploy fire fighters and hoses, there is no easy way to do it without a ton of clicks. There are also some points where it isn't clear what you need to do, especially with extractions from car crashes.\n\nMore of an issue however is a lack of replayablity. The missions themselves are pretty nice, I really liked that they included interior structure fires. However, after an hour or two of game time, you feel like you have seen it all. There are a lot of different callups but they all seem to play very similiar. Its basically simple medical or simple fire or simple rescue. There isn't a lot of depth to any given callup and after playing 10 or so, you aren't really interested in seeing the next one.\n\nThe price is about right for this scope but anything more then I would be unhappy with the depth.","January 3, 2014","true","3.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However , perhaps the designers could possibly add some ladder trucks to the mix.

Perhaps add a flashover timer or backdraft timer , it'll add some depth and more tension to the game. Along with the egines, addding the hydrant to fire drop would be nice. ( engine drops off a firefighter at a hydrant  and drop supply line up to house.) Forgive me, I might be getting too technical. However the fire to hydrant drop is the only drop you can do. Some stuff to think about , and perhaps more customization as well, I.E. naming your fire department, some more color schemes and unit numbers, (instead of just calling it engine one, maybe a player wants to designate it Unit 456.) Online play too, instead of calling on mutual aid via a simple press of a button, why not have another player that is also playing take part in a call that may require more than one engine.

I was expecting some sort of challenge (as was some old version emergency I played about 10 years ago), but no I played this game for about 3 hours and it's over, most of staff at highest lvl, me at lvl cap, everything bought, 100k in cash and no new missions available. There are basicly 3 things you do in this game, extinguish fire, transport injured people to hospital and extracting people from wrecks. I was expecting increase of dificulty and more sofisticated missions to become available as the new vehicles unlockes, but no. For example there are 3 types of tenders which should be used for different types of fire, but there is absolutely no difference between them. What's the point of offroad FD vehicle when the regular one can get anywhere?! And perks of your firefighters seems like important part of gameplay.... well again no effect on gameplay.\n\nIf you really, really (I mean REALLY) love firetrucks, go for it.

I read the recent patch updates and thought it had solved some of the complaints. I was surprised that I experienced some of the issues that were claimed to have been fixed.\n\nBugs I experienced:\n- I still had emergency units driving through other cars and static scenery.\n- Fire engines parking on top of fires\n- Paramedics running into their stretcher and bumping it into obstacles preventing them from picking it up, example.(Crash scene vehicles, concrete highway median).\n- Unable to send hired employees into the gym or lecture room after promotion said it was available. I have had several promotions and still unable to use these rooms.\n\nAll of the clicking it takes to complete simple tasks is a bit much. It makes it more of a memory match game for instance to respond with multiple emergency vehicles you have to remember which unit you removed the medical kit from because it has to be returned to the same unit it was removed from. Your paramedic will just stand there unless you remember. It would be nice and more realistic to be able to drop it to help load the victim instead having to walk back to each vehicle every time you want to complete a simple task.\n\nNo traffic control ability is ridiculous, vehicles sometimes drive through your accident scene while you're responding with no way to really stop them. I tried using my fire engines to block the traffic which does works but then your fire fighters get stuck trying to get to their equipment. You should be able to send police for traffic control in a one click fashion instead of everything having to be done by tediously clicking one thing at a time.\n\nI will keep playing hoping for higher levels to get much better, so far it's not that exciting.","January 6, 2014","false","6.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The units are incredbily difficult to select.  Getting their equipment is a long drawn out process.\nThere are two options to play, freeplay, and game.  I finished the "game" within 2 hours.  It then cycles through missions you have already completed while you twiddle your thumbs doing nothing new at your station.\nThe freeplay is silly.  You are only given 4 units at one time.  Since it is so hard to control your units, half the battle is getting them there and selecting the right unit to move.  Most of the time when you send your units back to the station, they just sit outside and don't refresh their supplies.  The only way to send your ambulance to the hospital is to have it do a return trip back to the scene of the accident.  So, even if you are done at a scene, you have to wait for your ambulance to return or try to catch it in route to send back to your station.\nI wouldn't recommend it even for the $5 they are selling it for.

More specifically, he could move but tethered to the point where the hose was stuck. Couldn't disconnect the hose and couldn't reach the fire, but I WAS able to exit to the desktop.\n\nIt's a good idea for a game but terribly executed. Animations are sloppy, interface is clunky, actual firefighting has more hose connecting interaction than actual fire dousing. It's mostly left-click/right-click busy work. And, the station house stuff is just low-rent Sims tedium.\n\nCan't recommend it.","June 12, 2015","false","1.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

No ability to pan camera around - HUGE defect!\nHere's some examples;\na) if there's a fire next to a large building - your view of the building is obscured, thus, in some circumstances, making it impossible to achieve the goal, of for example, putting the fire out!\nb) also, on occasions, a firefighter goes behind the fire truck and partially out of view - making in impossible to click on the firefighter (because mouse click will always select truck instead)!\n\n2. Awful controls.\nSo many clicks to achieve such small actions, such as... take out hose, couple to truck, extend, add more hose.... and the faffing factor of clicking on (or lost of times clicking near by accident) causes some serious stress. And the whole way of how you have to select personell and match up to vehicle is also confusion because on the despatch page, staff are not categorised.\n\nSeriously, if only I knew about point 1 in my list above, that would of been enough to put me off as it's not a matter of if it happens, but when. And that's a truly awful gaming experience as you have to restart sooner or later. :(","October 5, 2014","false","1.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The maps are extremely tiny, the vehicles go through one another. Sirens do not work unless you specifically click the vehicle and activate the sirens which only play for a couple seconds. Controlling the vehicles and fire fighters are not fun. Painting the vehicles are pointless because in the station they are all one color (red). These are a few reasons why I hate this game.\n\nBuy 911 First Responders available on steam for $5 dollars. It is a MUCH better value especially because you can download and easily install full conversion mods like the great Los Angeles, Boston and NYC mods for free.

You assume the role of a manager of a firestation. You are responsible for hiring firefighters and paramedics, buying and mantaining emergency vehicles, and dispatching vehicles and personel to the scene of a disaster. The game is very enjoyable to play, but there are plenty of downsides. The pathing AI of your vehicles and staff are just terrible. My ambulances constantly come running in and run over my firemen and victims. Another problem is at the beginning of each scenario, if you dispatch over 4 vehicles, you have a chance of losing additional vehicles because they stop and are stuck in the void of the map border. On just one level, I had the problem where half of my screen would go black, but I haven't seen it arise again.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/117john/recommended/253130/","117john","elegy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/117john/","165 products in account","Rescue - Everday Heros is entertaining enough as an emergency management simulator however it has some serious issues.\n\nThe most glaring problem is there is pretty much zero automation; you have to micromanage every aspect of every token on screen. If you want your firefighters to grab and connect firehoses while your paramedics start triaging the injured, you'll have to control all of them through every step (including exiting/entering vehicles). This is really annoying considering you may have 12 tokens that you have to micro manage. The only automation they offer is that you can send the ambulance to the hospital (so long as you remembered to assign a driver) and it will return.\n\nPathfinding is sometimes difficult for your tokens. They may have difficulty finding their way indoors, attaching a firehose, picking up a stretcher, driving vehicles, triaging, putting an injured person in an ambulance and generally finding their way to any area you assign them to. This is not a constant problem however it is noticable throughout the game.\n\nThis is a very short game with a low variety of missions/mission structure. There are traffic collisions, fires, medical aids and one or two different crisis missions (not mentioned for spolier control). After you respond to a few different calls the missions generally start to feel the same even though they may or may not take place on a different map.\n\nEven with the issues I found this game fun though I cannot recommend it for everyone. If you are looking for an emergency management simulator that allows you to put out fires, save lives, command a fleet of emergency vehicles and are willing to look past/work with the issues, this game is for you. If poor RTS mechanics drive you insane, avoid it.","January 29","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
