I vividly recall seeing the local game with a second television monitor mounted atop the cabinet so that the crowds of people standing around could still see the game playing even from a distance, and when *anybody* made it to the end to face off with the dragon there's was a clamor of excitement.  That was 30 years ago.  Video games were so primitve back then that not only were characters limited in visual appeal and animation but gameplay too was barely more than a joystick moving in 4 directions and tapping a button.  In that context Dragon's Lair soared above the rest with its genuine cartoon animation and even the stilted mash-buttons-and-learn-patterns gameplay wasn't too off putting.\n\nIn 2013 however Dragon's Lair has little to offer anyone who didn't fall in love with the game back then.  The gameplay is only slightly more compelling than hitting the fast forward and skip buttons on your DVD player, and there's grade school fan fiction of King Arthur that's deeper than the plot put in motion here.  The animation is very competent and Princess Daphne is a riot of laughter with her breathless exclamations and anatomy that should be poking holes in her costume.  Thankfully there are options to make the game easier to play from on-screen prompts to just watching all the sequences play automatically... a much appreciated choice because it gets really tedious playing some sequences over and over because the timing isn't split-second accurate.  There are "achievements" for playing the game in arcade hard mode (no audio or visual prompts) but that's strictly for the masochistic.\n\nFor the life of me I can't understand why the video files aren't in 1080p HD quality... it's 720p instead which makes me wonder if there's going to be yet another release somewhere down the line.  I also would have liked to get a proper freeze frame mode in order to do animation analysis, and for some reason I wasn't able to take any screengrabs while playing.  Very odd.\n\nBut, I did pay money for this and I definitely feel like I enjoyed my purchase.","October 20, 2013","true","1.4"," 67 of 72 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","67","72","0","0"

Yes, video game purists are going to probably hang me out to dry and disagree vehemently with my opinion but I am totally fine with that. While I agree video games were most definitely a lot simpler back then that does not automatically give them free passes when looked at with a more modern eye. One can after all still admire them through the historical lens that captures the passage of time even if one no longer enjoys them. Divorcing the nostalgia from the actual reality; Dragon's Lair sadly ends up not being particularly good at all where it counts the most - actual gaming. While it may have succeeded on many other levels, gaming was certainly not one of them. While I agree it had us captivated in the early eighties the distance of a few decades has shown the gameplay up for what it really is - a gimmicky trinket.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=484113281\nFrom a game culture and historical standpoint I admire Dragon's Lair more and there is no denying that Dragon's Lair had a massive impact on the then gaming landscape and was pretty much a technical marvel at the time and was a pretty dam fine showcase of what could be achieved when it came to the medium especially since the industry was going through some serious growing pains after its collapse in 1982. When I look at Dragon's Lair from this standpoint I wholeheartedly agree that the game deserves its place in video gaming history as something to be admired - not necessarily enjoyed or loved though. One has to remember that at the time video games weren't particularly pleasing to the eye as they are today and to have a game come out that looked like a moving Disney cartoon (it was animated by ex Disney employee Don Bluth who made a bit of a splash in the early eighties with movies like All Dogs Go to Heaven and An American Tail) while containing gameplay elements was unthinkable at the time. It's for this reason the game remains so popular amongst those who grew up in the era.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=484113730\nBy today's gaming standards Dragon's Lair feels a bit old hat as gameplay solely consists of quick time events that drive the narrative forward. The player will simply have to rely on a series of button prompts that interject as the tale unfolds to progress. There are no combat sequences at all which makes sense since the actual animation around the game was never programmed as such and are simply video reels that get executed based on the input the user enters at various interludes. While back in the early eighties this may have been a novel approach - today's gaming climate takes a very different view on QTE implementations in games with most of us agreeing that they truly do suck the donkeys balls and offer the player very little involvement in the action that is taking place on screen bar a few prompts to mash a button here or a button there.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=484114202\nThe objective of the game is simple enough though. You take on the role of a brave knight called Dirk the Daring on a quest to rescue the fair princess Daphne from the clutches of an evil dragon and the animation is still as lovely to watch as it was back then in the day. The port is as bare bones as they come though. Considering the signifigance of this title in the annals of history it would have been nice to have a few documentaries included in the menu to expand a bit on the experience and why the game was and still remains so popular to this day amongs us old timers. The PC version for some reason though does not play nice and proper with a gamepad (which I sadly could not get to work even though I know this game was released on both PS3 and the XBox 360) which is a bit odd given that this PC version would not allow me to select a controller as my desired input device.\n\nIf you are planning on purchasing Dragon's Lair and want to add a little bit of history to your library then I would say go for it. Just don't expect that history not to be swathed in cobwebs and decades of dust when you finally get around to installing and playing it.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","July 18, 2015","true","1.3"," 65 of 76 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","65","76","2","6"

When I purchased Dragon's Lair, I thought it was HD remake, which perhaps provided extended gameplay or extra content, a fully fleshed out experience, based on the old 1980s Arcade game; but this is not the case, it is as advertised: the 1980s Arcade game.\n\nSo, I just wanted to throw that out there in case anyone was wondering. Now, to the game. It's kind of fun, though a little repetative. The game design is essentially based around memorising a path to the princess, and getting timings just right (press Left/Right/Up/Down at precise moments or you die and restart at a checkpoint). This, back in the 80s, I'm sure was a genius idea for getting tonnes of quarters out of kids playing the Arcade machine, but as a game I don't need to plug money in to continue, it's just a little droll.\n\nI would recommend this game if you're looking for nostalgia. Maybe you played the game back in the day and never saw the end of it, or you were a Dragon's Lair champion and wanna relive your glory, you'll love it. But, if you're looking for a challenging and engaging title, with a story and interesting/creative gameplay, I would not recommend it.\n\nNilesy","June 17, 2014","true","0.5"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","24","26","0","0"

This is the game that turned me from a pinball wizard into a RPG/ video game junkie. I even own the PC release they made way back before Steam even existed.  Simple enough game, unfortunately no joystick control.  A joystick would make this game easier in my opinion.  Controls are right, left, up, down, and space bar for sword (which was a button on the arcade console).  Seems easy, but it is not.  The gamer has to pay attention to the cues on when and in which direction to move then do so on time.  From years of playing here is a hint: the scenes play first either to the right or left then in the opposite direction later in the game.  It can seem tedious I suppose, but I guess that is half the fun.  Really can you go the distance, all the way to the dragon's lair without losing track of which side (right or left) one played or losing all your lives.  Also if I remember correctly the Black Knight and the Lizard King are basically bosses somewhere about a third and three fourths of the way through the game. For me this is an absolutely must own game and I wish I had found it sooner on Steam.\n\nBest features for me in this game: is instant replay from where one left off without inserting more quarters and a full playthrough without interaction (like watching a movie).","December 22, 2015","true","2.1"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","20","21","0","0"

In the era of Pac-Man and Donkey Kong, a video game cartoon was amazing to my young eyes. Nostalgia and a Steam sale compelled me to purchase the game and relive my childhood.\n\nI enjoyed it for a bit. The game play is simple and sometimes frustrating, but that is how the classic game is played. Unfortunately, I don't consider this edition the definitive version of Dragon's Lair. I say this for several reasons:\n\n- Scenes do not seem remastered, unless they mean...\n- Animation is zoomed & cropped for widescreen (my biggest criticism).\n- It may run in 720p, but the picture quality looks like an old VHS tape.\n- No native controller support or custom key bindings.\n- Imprecise button response for a game that requires precise input.\n- Simplistic user interface. Limited Options.\n\nNever-the-less, Dragon's Lair has a special place in my gamer heart and I am not unhappy to have it in Steam. I just wish it was a better version.","October 30, 2014","false","4.2"," 60 of 91 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","60","91","0","0"

Many of us fell in love with the game and a new challenge was present in our community arcade... to beat the dragon and save the princess. I dumped way too many quarter's into this game and came back late from lunch on more than one occassion. The owner of the arcade had installed a monitor above the machine so others could watch while you played. In time I had developed quite a few followers that I think figured I was most likely to complete the game. Some would even let me play ahead of them even though they had their quarters lined up. A couple of times other people even paid for me to play the game. One afternoon, it finally happened. Amidst a small crowd of people surrounding the machine I reached the Dragon's Lair. Of course I didn't beat it the first time, but I played again and much to the enjoyment of the crowd, I defeated the dragon and we all saw the end of the game. I was very proud to have been the first person in our city to have defeated the game.\n\nThe next challenge of course was to defeat the game without dying. This challenge did not take very long at all.\n\nOf course, seeing the game on Steam meant I must purchase it for nostalgia's sake. Playing through it was not too difficult and for the most part I had no problem with the control response (I was surprised how many moves I remembered from all those years ago). I actually found the graphics to be very decent for this version.\n\nTheir are two versions of the game, Arcade and Home. I've played the Arcade version but have not tried the Home version uet. There are also two difficulty settings; Easy and Hard. I think on Hard the timing of your moves just has to be more precise and easy is a little more forgiving on pressing keys at the wrong time. You can also turn the moves indicators on or off (move indicators are not the flashes that are built into the animation but arrows and a sword icon that appear when it is time to press a button), You can also turn the move accepted sound indicator on or off. So if you really want a challenge, put it on Hard, turn the move indicators off and turn the move accepted sound off and try and complete the game without dying. :)\n\nThe game is all QTE (but it was the only way we were ever going to play an animated game 30 years ago.\n\nThere is also a mode where you can just watch the game all the way through just like watching a Saturday morning cartoon.\n\nIf you're a fan of cartoons or nostalgic for the game than I would say it is definitely worth the purchase. I know it was for me.","February 5","true","1.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

So, I'm going to list all it's good qualities and it's faults intermingled together, to try and paint a better picture than a block of negative text would.\n\n- I don't like the menus. They're horrible and clunky, and I hate having to put my name in the high scores before it lets me leave. There are some horrendously bad scores in there that it forced me to input.\n- Don Bluth. Make of it what you will. (I see it as a positive)\n- The game doesn't go  fullscreen for me. Since it's eighty percent about the visuals, having to watch it in a small window sucked out some of the fun.\n- Gameplay is simple, almost to a fault. Sometimes it's boringly easy, (I'm looking at you Lizard King!), but other times it flows well and the motions make sense for what's happening on screen.\n- Sometimes you die for next to no reason. Maybe you pushed the button too late, or didn't realize you should be doing anything, and then sometimes the game just hates you.\n- Every time you die in arcade, you're dropped into a different, random event. It helps keep away monotony.\n- This is not true for home mode. Home mode not only forces you to repeat the same section repeatedly until you beat it, it makes you repeat old stages constantly. Avoid home mode!\n-This game is crazy hard. I don't even know why there are two difficulty settings, I can't tell the difference when I play.\n-Sometimes you can feel that "Feed me your lunch money!" vibe that the more gimmicky arcade games give off. It's easy to die and you only get five lives. Infinite continues though!\n-The blood boiling difficulty can be avoided (kind of) by using the motion guide feature. I'd suggest it on your first go through, unless you really hate yourself.\n-Daphne the princess' voice acting is terrible. Thankfully she doesn't talk a whole lot, but when she does, my ears bleed.\n\nAs much as Dragon's Lair infuriates me, I can't bring myself to hate it. For all the frustration it's questionably timed movements and poor menus give me, it has an oddly charming appeal that makes me want to keep getting back on that mechanical horse and riding it straight into a wall.\n\nC+\nI'd recommend it, but only during a sale.\nAvoid entirely if you don't like quick time events!","November 1, 2014","true","2.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Back then, in the arcades where I grew up, teenagers would put ashtrays on arcade machines and smoke while guiding Dirk through the castle's myriad traps and hazards.  I'd be entranced.  This is the game that got me into gaming.\n\nIf you have a strong sense of nostalgia for Dragon's Lair and other laserdisc games, then you want buy this.  It's a perfect translation of the arcade original, and I'm glad I lived long enough to see it.  I never had enough quarters as a kid to beat it, but now I've been able to earn the Lair King achievement, a challenge I've always wanted to master.\n\nIf you're new to this game, then it might be a tough sell.  The gameplay isn't very engrossing: press a direction or the sword button at the right time to progress through the game, but if you appreciate the look and sound, then you'll enjoy playing.

It's actually more of an interactive cartoon, but definitely has a certain replayability with the ever changing randomised order of rooms and the QTEs themselves.\n\nThe game is full of QTEs {quick time events}, you don't really get to do anything else than to wait for QTEs, as in you're presented an option with a time limit and you will most likely die if you don't act quick enough. So I think it's safe to say there's constant action that requires quite a bit of hand-eye coordination in this one. It can be frustrating and very hard at times but if you don't mind the QTEs, fun is guaranteed.\n\nThe most important factor that got me into the game was the beautifully hand-drawn visuals and animation quality, not to mention the main character "Dirk" sounding like Homer Simpson. This is what they call a FMV {full motion video} game and they don't do good stuff like these anymore. Definitely a gem of a game worth trying.","May 18, 2013","true","0.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But I grew up, watching Don Bluth films, like The Land Before Time and All Dogs Go To Heaven, so I'm definitely familiar with Don Bluth. And I have a lot of fun, playing Dragon's Lair, because it makes me feel like I'm in a Don Bluth movie, and I've always been a fan of action, adventure, and fantasy, which Don Bluth has always been awesome at making movies with. The characters are awesome, too. It's very fun, playing as Dirk the Daring, fighting monsters with a sword, and saving the beautiful Princess Daphne from the dragon. I'm also glad this remastered version of the game has the option to have arrows to guide you through, because the flashing light that tells you what to do doesn't always show up, like in Dragon's Lair II. But this game is another classic revived by Steam. And I'm super excited to see a Dragon's Lair movie by Don Bluth and Gary Goldman!

I lol'ed a little at some of the deaths too. I would recomend this game, its fun. But it is a game that requires only the arrow keys and spacebar. Now for those of you who think this is like a game where you can conrol your character, sorry m8 but it aint. You dont actually get to conrol him just make the right moves and choose which way he goes. But the main reason i recommend this game is becuase its very relaxing. Its not a high stress CSGO tkae it or leave it. Its a calming action packed game, where you let the animations conrol your guy. How can i put this; Its like watching a movie that your controling, about a Knight named "Dirk" who has to make it through a deadly castle and save the princess.\n\nAnother pro: This game only took me 34 mins to beat, which is great becuase that means you can Download, play, refund. In that order. Sounds like a win win to me :)\nAnd TBH there isnt many cons if your not picky about old games. This game came out in 1983.\nI remember playing it in 2004, was top of the line then.\n\nThats all for my review.

In these zones you fight off bizarre-looking creatures, navigate traps, avoid falling debris, but above everything.. die a lot. Each zone has about 5-10 QTE's and you will rarely get through one without failing a few times. The QTE's are punishingly fast (on hard difficulty) but not overly frustrating as the humorous death scenes make you laugh and the directional cues don't change so you can be ready next time around. Unfortunately not every zone is unique; there are some where they have just flipped the cues of an old one.\n\nEven though the game only lasted me about 30 minutes and that's with failures, it was entertaining and funny. That being said I don't know if it is worth the price (think I got it one sale).","January 31, 2014","true","0.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

If you're a fan you'll have a lot of fun with this, however I can't really say much to be honest as i've already described what the entire gameplay is. If you're searching for something with a real deep and epic story I would give this a miss, but if you are interested in in QTE gameplay with wonderful art which is enjoyable, even in it's frustraition then I suggest you pick this up.","July 9, 2014","true","1.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Gameplay in this Steam version is customizable.  You can play as it was released in the arcades years ago or you can play with varying degrees of difficulty with visual and audio cues.  An excellent remake of the game and it comes with Steam Achievements to farm for.  Well done. I'd love to see "Space Ace" get green lit as well.\n\nThis game, along with it's sequel and "Space Ace" are basically old arcade laser disc games. The game would play the laser disk and your game would start. You (as the player) would have to make the correct move(s), as the laser disk played (usually an animated movie). Making an incorrect move would start an alternative movie clip that usually showed you dying. These Steam versions do a great job of recreating that feel.

The youth of today will most likely not enjoy this and complain as they do about almost everything that isn't catered towards them but this game was not re released for kids, it is a collectors item for the real gamers who invented this gaming concept and supported it from the begining.\nNow please re release Space Ace so my old school Bluth collection is complete :)\n","December 16, 2014","true","1.5"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Sigh.\n\nFirstly, a confession:  I'm old enough to remember when this game was in the arcades.  Hell, I'm old enough to remember when there WERE arcades!  And I was always fascinated by this game, as it was certainly trying to do something very, very different from what was then the norm.  The only problem was, for all it's fantastic imagination and wonderful animation...somehow...it JUST DIDN'T WORK.  Not as a game.  And it still doesn't.\n\nUnless you have spectacularly sharp reflexes and/or can somehow anticipate the "logic" of what the game wants you to do next (Lord knows I never could), you're going to find this game so insanely hard that you'll give up in no time.  Even with the option to freely "continue" that this PC version so generously offers (a luxury only the very, very rich could afford with the arcade version...I was pretty much inserting a new coin into the machine about once a minute!), I really can't imagine why anyone would have the patience to see this one through to the end...ESPECIALLY when this version allows you to just sit back and WATCH the game in its entirety, without all that incredibly, painfully pedantic split-second button-pushing which apparently qualifies as Dragon's Lair's "gameplay".\n\nDefinitely one of the great curiosities of video game history and worth a morbidly curious peek, but...I dunno, maybe just look up a Youtube video or something.  It'll be cheaper and you won't have to buy yourself a new monitor to replace the one you just put your fist through.\n\nVerdict: 4/10.","December 14, 2013","false","0.4"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","11","22","0","0"

Quicktime events? Check. Quarter-chewing continue button-mashing difficulty? Oh yeah. Unskippable cutscenes? Creepy hypersexualized damsel in distress whose primary mode of communication is breathy squeals accompanied by the presentation of her ample, barely-covered butt? Paging Princess Sideboob, your close-up awaits. Seriously, add DRM and forced multiplayer and it'd be a sweep.\n\nAnd yet...I had fun with it. Somehow QTE are less offensive when they're expected rather than jammed into what's supposed to be a completely different type of game. The art, as with pretty much everything Bluth ever put his hand to, is gorgeous. So is the character design (Princess Perkynips excepted, perhaps). Dirk the Daring is instantly painted as both stalwart and supremely doofy, setting the tone for the whole thing. And there's a great surge of satisfaction you get the first time you complete the game in a single run.\n\nThat said, I'm fully aware this is nostalgia talking. If someone came out with a game like this today I'd be shouting. So if you're of sufficiently advanced age to have memories of Dragon's Lair going in, pick it up on sale and have a go.

In my opinion a beatifully done game, artistically speaking. This game was created by Don Bluth, the man behind cartoon classics like The Secret of Nimh and  An American Tale. Most younger players will become bored with this very quickly. It really shows how far games have progressed in 30 years. I would basically recommend this to gamer's age 35 and up. They will have more appreciation for this because of nostalgia. Even as awesome as it looks it was about 30 minutes for me to beat it and now I have recaptured part of my youth and moved back on to the first person shooters and teabagging that are so prevalent in todays gaming. For $3 or so I would definitely try this out myself because I love the art work. For the average modern day gamer I would tell you to pass.

From a former design student's point of view they look horrible. Then again, it's from the 1980's so I didn't expect much. What did annoy me a bit though was that the game started lagging while in the menus option. In addition I'm not terribly fond of the whole "high scores are mandatory before you can play a new game"- thing. Though that's only if you decide to either quit the game in a fit of rage, or complete it. Otherwise you pretty much have infinite lives, and it doesn't take the game long to reload where you died the last time. (A feature I've grown to love about this game)\n\n* The gameplay is so simple it's almost boring at times, but it's made up for by the short reaction time you have in most scenes.  The animation flows well and the motions make sense for what's happening on screen most of the time. (Thinking of the princess monologue scene *cough* *cough*, something there doesn't sit right with me. I'll get back to that in a bit.)\n\n* Sometimes you die for next to no reason. Especially if you pushed the button (a fraction of a second) too late, or didn't realize you should be doing anything, and maybe pushed the wrong button in the "crucial moment" *Point's at myself*\nApparantly the game has several modes you can play. I've only played home mode so far, and I found it to be overly repetative. The game forces you to repeat the same section repeatedly until you beat it, and makes you repeat old stages constantly. The only slight difference separating some scenes form others being that they are mirrored.\nThis game is difficult. I've only played on easy mode so far, but I'm concerned for when I'll try hard mode, as I've died so many times in this game it's embarassing.\n\n- On a side note, I've seen a couple of reviews stating that the game does not work well with windows 8. That is not the case. I'm currently using windows 8 (or 8.1 to be exact), and the game has worked completely fine for me. If you try playing the game while your power option is checked to "power saver", then of course you'll have a problem playing it. If you set your computer to "high performance" and make sure that you don't have tons of other programs running at the same time, you shouldn't experience that much trouble.\n\n* Now to Daphne, the damsel in distress... I don't even know where to start. This is the thing that has bothered me the most about this game. First off the princess' voice acting is terrible. And I have to agree with Puppet_kamon on this: "Thankfully she doesn't talk a whole lot, but when she does, my ears bleed." Second is the oversexulisation. The princess' outfit looks like it's taken right out of a strippers' closet. In addition, her over-the-top, unnecessary posing and gestures, while she is explaining how you defeat the dragon seems very odd to me. It looks like she is, or was ment to say something entirely different than the lines coming out of her mouth. In the end I was left with the impression that the princess was more of an object to be desired and obtained, more than anything else. I also wondered why the creators didn't make time-apropriate clothing for Daphne, as the knight's clothes/ armor looks like it's from the early middle ages, and hers from an other century entirely. (I have lots more to say bout this, but I think I'll leave it as is.)\n\n* Animation-wise I have no complaint. I absolutely love most Don Bluth directed projects. The backgrounds are well made, and as stated before, the animation flows well. Otherwise I'd wish for a pause button in the game, as I'd like to view the surroundings a bit more.\n\nAs much as Dragon's Lair grinds my gears, I can't bring myself to hate it. It's an overall good game for it's time, and was groundbreaking in terms of going from pixel based games to animated ones. I bought it on sale, at 50% off, a completely ok price for a game like this. Though I would not recommend this at it's intended price. 4/10 points.","December 1, 2014","false","1.0"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

What you likely already know about it, hencce why you're likely even looking at this, is more than enough experience with the game. This game is a monument to bad 80's arcade business practices to swindle kids out of their hard earned cash and nothing more.\n\nMost reviews being written by people going back for nostalgia tend to paint this game as something a bit better, but as someone who was born in '88, this was part of a game history I missed, so I bought it to check it out myself. As you most likely know, this is a "game" based on just being a very long QTE cutscene and nothing more. What you may not know is how finicky and unresponsive it is. Sometimes prompts show up too late and you die despite pushing the desired key at the right time, and sometimes it lingers with there only being a certin sweet spot in which it registers. I've redone rooms so many times simply because of late prompts or simple unresponsiveness.\n\nNow, if you're just here for some Don Bluth animation... then just watch it on youtube or something. The whole experience here is repeating the same two dozen rooms or so(think it's randomized from my two playthroughs) for about 20 minutes(depending on how much you die) all to save the most annoying and overly sexualized damsel in distress and then it's just done. It's a pretty short trip of nothing special even just by animation standards. But since it's coupled with atrocious "gameplay", it's definitely not worth the money or hassle.\n\nI bought this on sale for about $2.49 and that was still too much in my book. Full price you might as well just shoot yourself in the foot instead. Probably less frustrating, though maybe more painful. Physically anyway.\n\n3/10; because it does offer some replayability and has a nice frontend UI and extras where you can just watch the "game" without putting up with terrible input reads.

If you don't know what you're getting into, the chances of you liking this are extremely small.  It's basically a 30 minute or so QTE.  You literally hit your arrow keys in the direction of the screen prompts, move onto the next scene, and repeat until you beat it.\n\nIt can also be incredibly frustrating, as the checkerboard black knight scene has prompts that seem to rely on a very small, and almost misleading, frame of input.  The last boss is a pain too, mainly because you're forced into a cutscene that features some of the goofiest video game voice acting ever every time you die, and you'll probably die a few times on it.  That scene is worth youtubing for Daphne's dialogue alone.\n\nThe game does feature a theatre mode, where you can watch the game and enjoy the art without having to play it, which is nice since you'll likely being too clued in on looking for arrow prompts to appreciate the scene.  You can also turn off the annoying prompt indicator as well, which I'd suggest since its sound effect outweighs any good it'll do you.\n\nIn short, if you're coming into this completely blind, you're better off waiting for a deep discount, otherwise you'll likely to be disappointed with what you'll play.","August 17, 2014","false","1.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

This means the gameplay is essentially trial-and-error. Press the wrong key, or press a key at the wrong moment, and you lose a life. (Truth to be told, some scenes are more lenient and don't punish you for pressing too early.)\n\nI can imagine a kid in the 1980s or 1990s looking at this game at the arcade: "Wow, this game looks incredible! I want to play it!" Then the kid puts in some quarters and plays for no more than two minutes: "Wow, this game sucks! I don't want to play it again!"\n\nDuring a single gameplay (in "home mode"), there will be repeated scenes/rooms, which left me thinking if the game had any ending or if it would just repeat itself indefinitely.

This was an arcade game from the 1980s that had something special to set it apart from the others:  The animation.  Don Bluth was the man most notably responsible for this, as he had worked with animated films for Walt Disney, and numerous ones outside of the Walt Disney company.  The gameplay is simple; it's all QTEs (quick time events).  There are other games where the gameplay solely revolves around QTEs, or a majority of the gameplay does.  I've played a few, and to be honest I enjoyed them.  So why can't I recommend this game?  It's due to the fact that despite the game having an easy difficulty setting, there are times when the QTEs feel broken.  They are barely on screen for half a second before disappearing.  So if you miss it or happen to press the wrong button, you die.  Sometimes you might even accidentally press a button.  The result?  You still die.  I personally feel that if you're going to include an easy and hard difficulty option, the easier one should be slightly more forgiving.  Otherwise, what's the point?  The home mode offers checkpoints after each room is cleared, allowing you to pick up right where you left off should you die.  However, take the the broken QTE timing on easy, and factor in the arcade mode where are there are no checkpoints... It's frustrating.  Sadly, not the good kind (I know, oxymoron) of frustrating either, where you want to keep playing.  It's a "I feel cheated" frustrating.  There is also the lack of controller support.  Which is something I find very strange for a game that was in the arcade. Nostalgia can only go so far, and had these two things not been issues I would've gladly gave it a thumbs up.","August 27, 2015","false","0.8"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Every scene in the game is a .wmv file that loads and plays for every action.  This means that while playing, the game is constantly accessing the HDD without any apparent pre-load into RAM.  This results in lag between the rather fast paced events that can cause you to lag on one scene until the file loads by which time you have almost no time to react to what you're seeing.  I've tested this both with my standard hard drive and a solid state drive on the same computer and it's clear that the hard drive is the primary bottleneck for this game.\n\nTo be fair, the one in the arcade suffered from the same problems (or at least the one I played on) as it ran off a laserdisk, which was far worse to be honest, so the frustraitions I have carry from the original, but when I bought this I was really hoping to experience the game as it was meant to be rather than the way it was.","November 27, 2013","false","1.0"," 14 of 32 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","14","32","0","0"

I'd heard of it as a classic of gaming though and it was five bucks at the time so I thought I'd give it a shot. I had no idea what to expect other than the reputation but I was suprised to learn that for a classic of gaming it consists entirely of something that the modern gaming community constantly complains about, which is quicktime events. Really the whole game can be completed with a total of four buttons. Don't get me wrong though. I don't really have a problem with this but it suprised me that the game has the reputation it does when so much of the "hardcore" community loves to pick fun at quicktime events and yet this "classic of gaming" consists entirely of that.\nIf you're ok with that concept or if you're a fan of the original then there's really no problem here. I can understand the appeal even if it does seem strange by modern standards. If I was a kid with an unlimited supply of quarters I would have probably played the hell out of this just to see what happens next and watch the cartoon visuals unfold. Overall, recommended for fans of the original and people like me who are willing to spend a few bucks to get a look at gaming history. Otherwise you may be sorely disappointed.","December 28, 2013","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was hard as hell and many of us easily dropped $5 into this game per visit (at 25 cents per game)  The game was impossibly hard and most of us died a few scenes in at best.    This game is for all those people that wanted to play and beat the game, but never had the committment to drop $100 or more into the game to figure out all the moves.\n\nNow that I've bought it, it dawns on me just how much I would've ended up having to sink into this game to beat it.  I'm glad there is an easy mode on this that at least tells you which way to go and when to use your sword.  We didn't have that in the old arcade version.\n\nBut that said, if you've never seen or even heard of this game before, you're probably not going to like it.   This game is just for us old timers to finally beat a game we couldn't when we were kids.","February 6","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some didn't even respond, you had to spress 1 second before the actual arrow showed making it very frustrating to play. Another thing is that they just recycle events but mirrored, so same content but instead of press 'right' not to die, it's press 'left' not to die.\n\nif you want to see the animatic, go look it up on youtube.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3XNQja0H7I\n\nThe only plus side of this game is that the princess is actually a hot pornstar!","July 24, 2013","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

As much as some complain about quick time events (and yes this game is basically a very long running qte), I don't mind them as much. In any case, this animated classic is worth the play through if you're looking for some nostalgia, or looking to play through a bit of iconic gaming history. You probably won't get much play time out of it, but it's still a fun little adventure to be had in it none-the-less.","April 4","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
