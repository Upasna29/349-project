SCROLL DOWN FOR TL;DR\nTales Runner isn't what it used to be.\n\nDo not let the low game time fool you about this review. I only did this so I could write this.\n\nI have played Tales Runner since 2008-09 when it was hosted by GPotato, and have been a major fan of the game ever since. The cartoony graphics, quirky maps, and interesting characters are what kept me playing the game for so long. I was playing the game before alchemy was even released, and the most you could get on your stats were about +1 or +2 on specific stats with some items. All I did was play as Charlie (Now named Billy), and I had tons of fun playing with almost anybody no matter what level.\n\nOnce alchemy was released, that was a completely different story, and everybody had to get their hands on them because it was an interesting concept that made Tales Runner an MMO. At first, it was just something fun to get bonus stats so that you can become stronger as long as you kept your alchemy repaired.\n\nSkip ahead two or three years.\n\nGpotato then turned Tales Runner into a pay2win game. With all new pets, the grand Piero alchemy set that all pros including myself needed to get, and trees to put in your farm to get tons of EXP for so that you can level up, Tales Runner started making its downward slope into destroying itself. Finally, Gpotato released the biggest content patch that many users had been waiting so long for... Chaos War.\n\nAll new Angel and Devil sets were released, multiple Legendary Fire equips (That only came in different colors but came in the near same stats, but required TONS of farming for in game money to claim in their gambling system.) Chaos War brought along new content like turf wars, and chaos maps (Basically maps where you join together with different people to defeat a specific boss.) Everybody only did Guardian Training (Hard) because it was a simple, easy boss that anybody with good amount of skills could do in under 2 minutes to get MASSIVE amounts of EXP and TR. This is where the fun started getting sucked out of the game. That's all people did, as well as The Angry Brother map (Another easy map for those that are skilled that you can finish in only 30 seconds to get tons of EXP.)\n\nNow, there are two types of players in Tales Runner: Those that played for fun, and those that played to become the best. I fell under those that only played for fun after I realized that they were taking a game like this so seriously. I had all alchemy upgraded to their final level, most of them Rank S for the best stats that could come on them, every single character, and the skills to back up those items.\n\nI even joined in most events that the GMs hosted to get the players to participate in to win for prizes. I won a Tales Runner t-shirt from the Battle Channel that I still keep in my closet as a keepsake, and almost won an Xbox 360. The GMs, specifically Yuui were really some great, friendly people that knew how to do their job correctly. And that was pretty amazing for a game brought over from Korea to the US.\n\nShortly after the release of Kuro, Tales Runner became rather...empty. Before, I used to be able to find a Lizard Crisis (Hard) or Angry Lizard (Hard) room to play in with a full 30 people. Now it was just Brazillians (Not trying to be rude here) that spent tons of money on the game to get the best alchemy, pets, etc, while doing The Angry Brother to get high up in the level rankings, and the usual other high level players spamming Guardian Training (Hard) for more EXP. Gpotato then decided that they needed to shut down the server. Perhaps it was because they already peaked a few years before, or they just weren't having enough people play on their server. I was not too sure.\n\nI was devestated that they had shut down a game that was so close to my heart, that I had so many friends on. Luckily, Gpotato left the forums up for a few months after the shut down, and I got a bunch of my old friend's contact information to keep in touch with them, which I still talk to today. I've played on the Korean and Thailand Tales Runner server, though mostly the Korean one, and I can see the clear difference of what makes them differ from Gpotato's and OGplanet's version. They have players that actually play for FUN.\n\nThis game was originally created to be played for fun with others, even if there was a sense of competition thrown in. I've had tons of laughs for the many years that I've played with on Gpotato's Tales Runner, and the memories will never die out. To keep a hold of those memories, I've played on some of the private servers that Tales Runner veterans have made, like Atomix Tales Runner and Aeon Tales Runner; both of which are shut down now due to money/server hosting issues. When word got to me about the opening of a new, official US Tales Runner server, I jumped onto it as soon as possible, only to realize I was playing a piece of crap disguised as a brick of gold. The game will never be like how it used to be, and it is not even worth to me to start over from the very beginning to try and work my way up the rankings and get all my old alchemy and pets.\n\n__________________________________________\n\nWhat OGplanet is TRYING to do with Tales Runner now\n\nEver since with the release on Steam, it seems like OGplanet is trying to reach out to new players in an attempt to bring Tales Runner back into full swing to the way it used to be. But now, since the Korean server is far, far, FAR ahead of the US server now, and the previous US server had so many updates into it, OGplanet is able to implement new content into the game really, really quickly, and have advanced much farther than what Gpotato Tales Runner used to be.\n\nNow, some people may think that OG Tales Runner isn't pay2win. Let me shine the light on a few things that clearly make it that way.\n\n1. Buying Astros to buy TR so that you can buy characters and upgrade alchemy faster than having farmed the TR.\n\n2. Buying 'candy' to speed up your marriage days so that you can get to the last ranking ring much faster than having done it normally. (Before you had to be with a couple for a whole 365 days in order to get the ring.)\n\n3. There is still the aspect of using Astros to easily get the top gear in the game, excluding Legendary Fire gear. (Now unless you're a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, all you will get is the Black Piero Set and not the Elite Piero Set, unless you want to look really fancy.) This costs roughly 2064 Astros, or $100.\n\nYou can easily spend money in this game to get what you want, even if it comes down to a matter of skill, which some people forget. I've played with a default "Billy" for quite some time now, and I am still able to easily beat people that have fully geared main meta characters like "Troy", "Lily" and Kai. That says something to me, and shows that people are just buying their way to a sad attempt at victory, rather than playing the game and getting the experience needed to actually get better and enjoy the game.\n\nRather than farming for alchemy cards and TR, people would rather buy their shortcuts, which personally is not my problem, because people are allowed to spend their money the way they want to. I have no say in how others spend their money. So OGplanet is basically reaching out to new players to get more p2w players than they already have in hopes to make even more money to pay for their terrible, laggy servers.\n\nAll I can say now is, R.I.P. Tales Runner. Thanks for all the good times, and friends that I've made on the old Gpotato server.\n\ntl;dr - The game is pay2win, and is not like how it used to be. Only play it if you're incredibly bored and have nothing else to do.\n\nAnd these new names for the characters are absolutely terrible. OGplanet, just give it up.","February 18, 2015","false","58.2"," 208 of 247 people (84%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","84","208","247","20","7"

They need to have less "Drop you where you stand" items and more "speed-me-up" items, or at least a baseball mitt that catches other players items incoming.\nGameplay is now laggy and doesn't seem to be very optimized, even when going into the settings and playing around.\nTheir game guard desperately needs updated, as you will understand later in my review.\n\nThe Shop:\nAs compared to 4 main characters to choose from in the GPotato version, (Apollo, DND, Ming Ming, Charlie), This version only offers the Ming Ming and Billy alternatives. They do offer 3 different starting outfits, which is nice, but does not make up for the lack of characters to begin with. Every other character you have to buy with Astros. Things that used to be free to get with TR cash in GPotato's version, are now "buy to buff" and offer sometimes overpowered stats that are applied upon equipping. Items you used to be able to buy permanently are now "Pay 30k to have this for 30 days, and then you have to do it again!" Which, to put it lightly, sucks.\n\nGraphics:\nGraphically, the cartoon-like style isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it could really use updated.\nUpon setting all of the graphics to max, the game wasn't really changed much; Which is slightly dissapointing.\n\nThe In-Game Community:\nThe community of this game used to be friendly and open, and now it's full of people who won't even say "Hi" or reply when you ask a question. I encountered multiple hackers in each game I joined, who finished the race in 10 seconds and never moved from the starting line, people who dashed infinitely, and people who were not affected by running through hurdles or getting hit by items.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nI can look past the slightly outdated graphics, but the community, hackers, and the lack of optimization takes this game from an 8.5 to a 4.5 out of 10.\nI loved Tales Runner from GPotato, but this falls FAR behind.\n\nThey took an amazing game and made it pay to win.\nNeedless to say, Unless GPotato takes Tales Runner back over, I will not be playing it again.","February 18, 2015","false","0.7"," 46 of 59 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","46","59","3","3"

I played this game since it first appear on Gpotato all those years ago and then WinnerHub. Firstly this is not PAY-2-WIN as many think.\n\nFirstly, yes alot of items are real-money, however you have daily missions and some little events in the park to get timed cash items, some are not timed however which is good. It is not heavily stacked against you. A lot of the cash items you don't even need to enjoy the game or play it. Only 1 or two for the event maps but that is for the hardest stage, you can play the normal and easy stage for free and if you befriend someone who can get into the paid-rooms, they can invite you! So don't feel like you will never get into them.\n\nHowever, because many players are in the Event/Co-op maps (read below) you won't really need stats because they cannot push you around or hurt you with their fury! so really stats are only needed if you play the single-races which can be hard to get people for.\n\nPros:\n\n- Daily racing missions for items with stats/bonuses\n- TR is easy to get\n- Characters are cheaper then they once were\n- Leveling is easy\n- Can have items on as a costume (no effects) with effecting clothing underneith\n\nCon:\n\n- Some items are confusing on what they do\n- Hardly any item rooms\n- People hang in Event Map/Pro channel\n- Card hunting is more of a pain here\n- Server seems kinda emptish\n\nNow, people will mostly be in the event channel this is bad and good. Bad because it can get boring but also the fact you be having trouble finding people for maps you want to play. A lot of maps are ignored sadly.\nIt is good however because people will not see your level and kick you, unlike other modes where they will judge you unless you are Sandel+ (The Main Quests should get you up to sock+)\nHowever this is bad for true new players. On the event map you need to live to get rewards at the end but you could always hang back and get the exp/money off the floor. If you don't know how to dash-jump however you will have problems.\n\nThe server has died from when I first saw it but I don't mind. Plenty of people to find and play with and a lot of high levels are not judgemental as others think they are or want you to believe.\n\n\nAt sock level, a high ranker was happy to race with me and even give me a chance to show him I could do the co-op maps  just as good as they could. Because the server is not massive as it used to be I am seeing these people more often and having a great time with them. I not came across anyone yet who asked the host to kick me because of my low level compared to theirs, infact many stuck up for me.\n\nI say give this game a go but I would research how to Dash-Jump first because you will need it to keep up with the players as many are returning players from the other versions that were shut down. Otherwise the community is lovely as far as I have seen  and actually the nicest one I have found in years in the Tales Runner gaming community.","January 19","true","248.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","7","8","2","2"

But for some reasons, I can't.\n\nThere's some good idea and all, but they are all badly executed.\n\nThe camera is really counterproductive, jumping is awkward, most mechanics involves pressing repeatedly on the same button.\n\nControls are way too clunky, hitboxes are the worst, there's a bug RIGHT WHEN creating a character, pretty much everyone can't type. It's there since launch or something like that. (Launch on OGPlanet at least, I don't know the one before)\n\nRight when doing quests, you get your inventory full of clothes. I mean, that would be nice if your clothes weren't the type to expire. The countdown starts right when you get them, which isn't fun.\n\nIf you're trying to start, good luck, everyone plays on expert.\n\nYou're frequently wondering what you have to do, which isn't a good thing for a racing game.\n\nMusics are boring, characters voices and sound effect makes me want to punch my speakers, and the game sometimes makes me want to smash my keyboard.\n\nAt least this game doesn't shove you in the face the option to buy things with real money.\n","May 26","false","1.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

It's true that using money to purchase in-game outfits, pets, items etc will give you an advantage but not necessarily help you win the game. Coming down to it, skills play a rather important part in this game.\n\nFollowing on, learning your basic maneuvering, jumping, double jumping, DJ, Dash Jumping will essentially help you win regardless of the items other players have. Also, every game has its typical new players, average and veteran players. There will always be winning and losing, blaming others for paying to play won't make you any better.\n\nLast but not least, the graphics and quality of this game isn't bad at all. I reckon its much better than half the games there are out there. In the end, i'm gonna say that I do reccommend this game out. Nothing will be justified unless you give it a try yourself.

It is a game that rewards skill much more than having the best gear. It can be played either hardcore or casually and its microtransactions only offer convenience.\n\n\nThe Review\n\nTales Runner is primarily a social game. It is a very difficult game to enjoy if you are looking for a single player experience as the game revolves around racing with and against other players. It is also a game that can be played and enjoyed casually due to the lack of a need to maintain gear in order to win races.\n\nThe game was originally released in 2005 on its native Korean server and as such has relatively dated graphics when compared to more modern games. The graphics with its anime inspired design, however, has allowed the game to age much better than many of its contemporaries. The game, unfortunately, only supports a 800/600 resolution so if it is not played in windows mode the graphics may be stretched and distorted. I personally would recommend playing in windowed mode as the difference in overal graphic quality is significant.\n\nThe game features numerous maps to race in and is adding more with every patch. As such there is enough content that it is rather difficult to become bored with the game. Certain maps, however, are preferred by the community much more than others as such certain maps are nearly completely unplayed such as the animal racing and 20 player co-op maps. There are farms which function like your standard mmo housing system, and a park that features various minigames and offers a place to socialize with other players. There are also various missions for those who are looking to challenge themselves or prove their skills.\n\nDespite what many of the other reviews may say the game is not pay-to-win. All characters and most items are available for purchase using ingame currency that is earned by playing the game. Those items that are only available as microtransactions only offer convienence that may lessen the grind for the ingame currency and experience. There is no gear that is only available for purchase though microtransactions that provides a large enough advantage over the free options for the game to be considered pay-to-win. Despite that I must say that the early grind for in-game currency and alchemy cards is immense but if you are patient and invest in gear that boost your earnings per race the grind diminishes greatly. It should be noted, however, that if a player wants to maintain a large amount of gear without spending money on microtransactions the grind will will be significant and potentially overbearing. Though if a player is willing to spend money to maintain their gear only about $5 a month is necessary which is less than many subscription based MMOs. Finally, having good gear is completely unnecessary to enjoy the game or to be able to win races. A player's skill is a more important contributor to winning races than having the best gear.\n\nThe game has daily events that offer players a chance to obtain those items that are only available for real-world currency for free. These daily events function much like a lottery except that there are daily play-time requisites that helps to reduce the number of entries and improves your chance of winning those.\n\nCurrently the game is having problems with server stability due to recent DDOS attacks. While overall disconnections are infrequent, there are periods of frequent disconnections that can become an inconvenience. Based upon former server performance I expect this issue to be fully addressed soon. Somewhat related to this, the customer service for this game is rather slow and I hope this will be improved in the future.\n\nThe community is average. There are those who are completely unenjoyable to be around and those who are eager to accept and help a new player. Depending on the game mode (mostly cooperative maps) it is likely to be frequently kicked from a room if you are low leveled. This is by far probably the worst aspect of the community for the new player experience. Other issues with the community involve those who are fequently looking to cause player-player drama but they can be easily avoided.\n\nOverall Tales Runner is a very fun game that offers a large amount content for players to enjoy.  It is a game that rewards skill much more than having the best gear. It can be played either hardcore or casually and its microtransactions only offer convenience.","February 18, 2015","true","5.5"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

Very Fun. It's a good mmo to play for a month or two and then go on hiatus from (Good players always come back eventually).\n\nTalesrunner is a unique, DIFFICULT, fun, but old  foot racing game enjoyed on servers around the world. NOTE: There was an old US server on gpotato that died many years ago, some players have played the game since then on other servers.\nAlso it can be a very amusing social experience where many players share accounts, because they've logged 1000s-10,000s of hours on the game and trust each other completely. Not many games other than WOW and Runescape can accomplish feats like that.\n\nWarning: This game is a racing game at it's core with a HIGH difficulty curve. You WILL be terrible compared to good players for MONTHS, even if you have BETTER equips than them, if you do not learn the tricks to going faster, like dash jumping, and don't route out the maps/look at videos of routes.\n\n2nd Warning: The point of this game is to try and get good times on maps and win races. That means that the equips in the game are not important to skilled players unless they're competing with other highly skilled players. I say this because some new players believe this is Pay to Win just because it takes a LONG time to get a lot of good equipment when lvl 1 players can buy many of the good equips with money (not ALL). Yes, it takes a long time to buy equipment and there are some things that can only be bought with real money, like pet resources. HOWEVER, it takes long because it wants you to master that 90% skill part before getting the 10% equips part and because there would not be much else to do.\nALSO, the in game real money currency, called Astros, is frequently and easily obtained by trading for the normal in game money you can earn and is NOT against the rules to do so.\n\nTL;DR: Try it for a couple days, if you didn't quit already then look up some tutorial videos on youtube or something and set yourself in for the long haul for a game you will never quit forever. (Recommend looking up Dash Jump Tutorial videos and buying 2 new characters, Troy and Kai preferably, before spending in game money on anything else).","February 18, 2015","true","2.0"," 20 of 38 people (53%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","53","20","38","4","1"

I thought to myself "what the ♥♥♥♥ did I do to get here?"\n\nWell, I was told to create a character, by create I mean "pick one of these 4 people, no customisation." I just went with the one that didn't look like some edgy 13 year old or salty 6 year old. Then some dude just got his history all wrong and failed to make humour, possibly, it was nonsense to me because I didn't do my research on everything in this game before I played it, because you know, you must know 100% of the game's plot before you play it...\nNow i'm asked to name myself, but litterally nothing works, either this game has a ♥♥♥♥ing huge community or there's a problem in the code, the only name not "unavaliable" was "KVELDIC". Even every variant of C.Sandwich, Kaptain Skurvy, Klump and VBDIVBEVRB was taken? Then I'm told to move, as usual for a game, then jump as expected. This is where things really hit the floor, my character sounded like Big the Cat with Cystic Fibrosis and Chronic Lung Cancer. I then used the menu to mute the audio, I never saw that room or those card demons ever again, and I don't want to, I'm scared. After staring at some popups for a good five minutes, I think I get offered a quest or something and I figure out the gameplay...\n\nIt's a clone of the Zoo Race!\n\nWhat horror thought the Zoo Race was good enough to warrant a game based on it? It's the same religion errors (noah throwing explosive barrels at animals that were people instead of building an ark) with the same idea (go from A to B as fast as possible "against" other "people" with confusing as hell track layouts and (probably, I muted the audio) garbage midi playing in the background. The only difference is that it is slower and has LESS depth, is that even possible? At least the Zoo Race came with a cutscene showing you the somewhat questionable story, here there's nothing like that!\n\nI think I did the first quest, all I did was press 2 buttons so I think I did it before being thrown into the menu again. So I move onto my next quest and pray to GabeN that the Zoo Race thing was a one-off.\nNope, I apparetly have to do something to do with Mary and baby Jesus.\n\nI officialy quit reviewing free steam games, the Playstation 1's bad side is better than this, and I'm talking about Bubsy 3D and the like.\n\nPeace out, Mothra-lovers, PC master race my ♥♥♥♥.\n\n"TL;DR: eat ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥s" - Dr. Andonuts / Toby "Radiation" Fox.","May 22","false","0.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","3","5","3","0"

It's kind of fun in a very confusing way. I was laughing because of how random and weird it was. If you're looking for some real skill based realistic multiplayer racing, is this game for you? Absolutely not.\n\nBut if you're like me and just want a good laugh and some lighthearted fun, this game will do the job. The tutorials and voice acting are annoying and the Jester creeps me out, but it's good overall. xD\n\nThe Character "Creation" at the start lets you choose from two characters and 3 "dresses" each at the start, so that's a little disappointing, but not a big deal. xD\n\nAlso you can't change the resolution, so unless your monitor fits the default resolution, you'll have to put up with a squished image.\n\nIn the end, there are a lot of things wrong with this game, but they're wrong in a way that just makes the game humorous and slightly enjoyable.\n\nIn a serious gameplay view, I wouldn't give it more than 2/10, but as far as levels of fun and enjoyment, I'd gladly give it a 6.5/10\n\nIt's definitely worth a try. It's free after all. I won't complain. xD\n\nFor those of you interested in seeing my failed attempts at understanding this game, see the video below. Please be kind.

The only P2W aspect of this game are as follows: Magical/Golden Hammers (Repairs Alchemy), a few TIMED sets via boxes in shop, the couple system (Still free until level 4), and majority of the pet items (Pet food and upgrades). Even so, there are still Wooden Hammers and Alchemy Pet Food that you can create by non-real-money-spending means\n\nThe Alchemy shop allows you to craft powerful items that will increase your stats while you wear it, and all of these sets are gained through TR (IG Currency) and specific cards that drop in specific maps. It's very grind heavy, but in most cases all the alchemy that people have is through hard work and time.\n\nAll the characters and most pets costs TR rather than Astros, the special sets you get from boxes in the shop can easily be countered with stronger alchemy, it's just the matter of putting in the work. Yes, people can buy Alchemy with Astros, however it extremely expensive and close to no one actual does it, so there is no real advantage. The publishers and CAs are doing their best to make game experience better than it already is, and continue to add exclusive events and event prizes to better benefit all players.\n\nReview the whole game, and try going after some alchemy before making claims like this. It's a very competitive game, and regardless of that it's extremely balanced compared to how it was before, so give it another try.\n\nAs for the "rankists" , this is normal in any competitive game, if you need help, all new players are free to message me, or any of the other CAs for help.\n\nIGN: [CA]Jayke\n\nKnown Issues:\nCan't type your IGN?: http://nforum.ogplanet.com/tr/forum_posts.asp?TID=611126&PN=1\n0 TR and EXP?: http://nforum.ogplanet.com/tr/forum_posts.asp?TID=619900","May 3, 2015","true","0.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Nice game for boring days, vacations etc.\nBUT, as someone whom played this game before, few years ago to be more exact, when Gpotato was part of the picture, it was much more enjoyable. For now, it turned to be p2w game, but in the past, your skills matterd much more.\nNot forgetting the fact, there ARE hackers in this game that turn the game less enjoyable, and how fascinating, they are 'pros' too. Though I am only sock level for now, and called a noob (even if, sorry, I'm much better than them), I get 1-3th places, and somehow, magically, get to be 8th place on the board.\nIgnoring that though, there is also a very BIG bug for few players considering me in, is that after finishing a match, you get 0 TR, 0 exp, and no cards. Even if you're 1th place, you get nothing, and get stuck in you level.\n\nI'm not saying the game didn't get better at all, actually, there is much more options open for playing or winning things for free (for example in the park, what is called now, plaza).\n\nThough to get your farm look better and have animals is now 100% harder, which is disappointing (because honestly, I played so many RP's in the past in friends farms, what was also a big fun part there).\n\nOfc, I'm addicted to this game since when I was little, and I played many private servers and for short terms official servers of Tales Runner, I never gave up on this game, and such a huge nostalgy is very sweet to have.\nI hope this time Tales Runner will not break down as the others, and hacking will be impposible for the love of god, moreover, not having such bugs will be more satisfying. And I wish the best of luck to anyone who playes this game as well.\n\nThat is why I DO recommend this game, but still hope for more in the future.\nIf anybody needs help getting to know things there, I'll be glad to help too.\n'Anyalis' (づ￣ ³￣)づ.","June 24, 2015","true","369.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/melwing/recommended/328060/","melwing","Melwing","http://steamcommunity.com/id/melwing/","311 products in account","This is an extremely odd mashup of a Elsword and Mario Kart. It is actually *really* fun, but it has been around for a very long time before this Steam release so it has a population of very experienced skilled players. It also has a mechanic where once the first person finishes a race a short timer counts down and when it expires, the race immediately finishes.\n\nBecause of this, in every one of the 10 or so multiplayer races I've done- I've only actually gotten to the finish line once. Every other time (even if I was in 2nd or 3rd place), the top 1 or 2 racers are so much better than everyone else that nobody else gets to finish the race.\n\nTo me, this is kind of a deal breaker as far as playing this game a lot. I'm sure I'll pull it out for a race or two once in a while because it really is fun, but it's frustrating to essentially never get to finish a game.","February 18, 2015","true","2.0"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","1"

I played the Steam version a little bit since it released on here, and I have to say the overall gameplay I still enjoy. My biggest negative I have to say, is that it does feel more pay to win now than it did years ago. I cant put my finger exactly on one thing though. overall I would recommend you try the game, as its worth at least that I think. Especially if it interests you enough to read the reviews.   Overall I wish that someone else would make a game Like Tales Runner, It would be neat to see another game like it out there.  One with less "junk" or pay to win, that comes with being an old free to play title struggling to stay relevant.","February 20, 2015","true","2.1"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

I recently played this game a few years before, quit for a while because the community gave up, and I came back in 2014, only to find the same thing happen again. Okay, whatever.\n\nSo, I forget about it, I had a few dollars spent into it and got what I wanted when  I was playing before, so I wasn't too heartbroken. Then, Steam has this thing about Tales Runner attempting to come back, and I'm so happy. I make a new account because I forgot my old one of course, and I download the game on Steam.\n\nBut, previously, I had some compatability issues (?). Dunno if it was me or not, but I had to redownload over and over, continuously for a few months before I could really get anything done, and most of my friends had been long gone because their friends were having troubles as well. Eventually, it caught up with most of the people playing, and when your friends don't have a Facebook or any stuff like that, you might as well just forget ya'll met in the first place.\n\nAlright.. so cons:\n1. Community\n2. Compatibility\n3. Hackers (Didn't mention this, but hackers are going ♥♥♥♥ crazy with peoples' accounts, and it makes me cry)\n4. Some events, but the GMs / whoever is in charge doesn't necessarily do anything to fix the game\n5. Having to pay legit money for whatever you want.. which is mostly everything\n\nPros:\n1. Community (Yeah, I said that for Cons, but people on there are great even though they never speak to anyone)\n2. Maps, even though they can get sort of old..\n3. Variety of characters. And the Alchemy you can make\n4. Leveling is fairly easy, you just should want to be persistant\n\nOverall.. for a rating I guess I'd give this game a 7 cupcakes / 10 cupcakes, but that's my personal rating.\nDon't recommend unless you really don't mind paying and you don't mind the asses that play that game","March 13, 2015","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First off a 3.5gb download and then ontop of that a launcher that has to be installed and updated everytime you play, not to mention you have to register with an email >_<. Secondly theres a slight learning curve when it comes to gameplay. The mechanics are a bit wonky and the sound effects are overplayed and easily spamable. Gameplay wise, it's mostly customisation of your charracter between games and reading of quests. The game must be played with others for some of the harder quests and even then seem imposible until you have good gear. Gear drops are also quite interesting in this game. Within just an hour of play I had over 6 backpack pages full of gear. Mostly customizable but definatly better with friends. Server base is unfortunatly very dead with only around 6 players sitting on the main world.\n\nGameplay: 6.5/10\nMechanics: 7/10\nVisuals: 8/10\nSoundtrack: 10/10\n\nEnjoyable.","April 19","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
