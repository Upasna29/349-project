"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/recommended/201420/","noibn","noibn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/","1756 products in account","Toki Tori 2+ is not at all the game I was expecting it to be. The original game was a series of self-contained puzzle levels that were solved using a limited set of items. Toki Tori 2 is not that at all. Instead, the game drops you in the middle of a vast open 2D world and leaves you to figure everything out on your own. There are no instructions, tutorials, levels or items. The whole world is open from the start and you just need to figure out how to get through it while collecting a series of, err... collectibles. Unlike the previous game, Toki no longer uses items to solve puzzles. Instead, your abilities are limited to walking, singing and stomping. That's it. Where the complexity (and genius) comes in is how you can combine those actions with the various creatures that populate the world. For example, you can lure birds to pick you up with chirps, move bugs by stomping, and much, much more. I won't say anything further on that, as half the fun is figuring out the rules of the game on your own. As with the previous game, level/puzzle design is utterly brilliant. So many times you will think there is no way to proceed past an area, only to have the solution click a few minutes later (and you subsequently smack yourself upside the head because of how simple it actually was). That is a sign of good design, and I admire it a lot. I can't really think of any puzzles that were totally unfair, although there were a handful that were somewhat tedious. The singing mechanic is also a pretty neat new feature. In addition to its standard functionality, you learn a series of songs that provide other abilities, such as time-rewind, warping around the map, and more. And oh yeah, the characters are all really cute - especially Toki and the frogs (if you're into that sort of thing as a selling point). It all comes together nicely in a really well-executed package. Overall, I liked this a lot better than the first game, due to the open-ended exploration/collection gameplay and the "complex simplicity" in the puzzle design. It's a fun, laid-back game that should appeal to puzzle fans. A-","July 26, 2013","true","25.7"," 96 of 103 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","96","103","0","0"

Eventually ported to the Windows platform many years later, the new PC version introduced high definition graphics to accompany its puzzling levels as the player guided the cute yellow chick, Toki Tori, through increasingly more difficult puzzle-filled levels as he searched for his missing young unhatched siblings before finally returning back home once everyone had been rescued and accounted for. Toki Tori was a highly addictive puzzle-platformer that was simultaneously fun and incredibly challenging to complete (particularly the brain-numbing later levels) and if you haven't given it a go yet, I highly recommend you do although you most certainly don't need to have played the first game if you plan on diving straight into this second adventure.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=346329721\nToki Tori 2+ once again sees the return of our cute and adorable little yellow puzzle solving chick, however, it is a vastly different puzzle-platformer experience when compared to the first adventure. Instead of opting for a linear level progression, Toki Tori 2+ opts for an open world where the player can pick and choose where their little feathery adventurer progresses to next. It's not totally open world though and does require the player to solve some areas before being able to move on to others but for the majority of the game you can pretty much guide your little yellow chick to where you want on the games world map. Toki Tori 2+ innovates further by doing away completely with items from the first game, items which the player used to solve the various levels puzzles, instead opting for a slim downed ability list which includes whistling and stomping. Don't let that put you off though as you will soon realize that in Toki Tori's world things are never so cut and dry or black and white if you prefer.\n\nThere are layers to the whistling which require Toki Tori to learn various musical notes that when played in correct succession will evoke a different aspect of the young chicks whistling ability. Stomping also comes with its own layers of mastery that will have different effects when used on various objects and creatures that inhabit this colorful and cartoony world. The creatures you encounter in the world will all respond in vastly different ways when these abilities are used so its up to the player to learn what ability needs to be used when and with what creature in order to successfully traverse the map. Let me tell you some of these puzzles can be nightmarishly tough to solve but most of them remain pretty exceptional throughout and stay true to the game-play mechanics that govern Toki Tori's vibrant world.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=346329400\nWhat I loved about Toki Tori 2+ is that it proceeds to place the gamer into a world with no tutorials or key prompts. The user is simply left to figure out everything on their own. In this day and age where every game comes with its own beginner tutorial (regardless of how affiliated you are with the genre or game-play style) or it veers off in the opposite direction and begins to practically play the game for you whilst you just sit and watch slowly becoming nothing more than a casual observer. I loved this and I wish more games would treat their audiences in the same adult fashion as this one and not assume that every single gamer is an idiot that needs to be taught how to play.\n\nOnce again Toki Tori 2+ story-line is on the threadbare side. You simply enter the world with the knowledge that you have to save this colorful cornucopia from a destructive black goo that is causing havoc all whilst once again rescuing your siblings. Everything is initially very bright and colorful but as you traverse the world things do get a little darker (but in a G rated way of course). Audibly - the game comes with a stunning soundtrack that is relaxing and incredibly pleasing to listen too. You wll often find yourself humming along to many a level/areas ditty. Visuals are pleasing and crisp for a game of this nature and often radiantly beautiful to look at and experience.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=346328797\nToki Tori 2+ also comes with a level editor and Steam Workshop support where players can go off on a tangent and create their own fiendishly difficult levels for the community to play and enjoy. If you are not the creator type, you can simply download additional puzzle levels from the workshop to try out and rate for other players.\n\nAll in all Toki Tori 2+ is a cute and entertaining side diversion of a game that is perfect for a play-through whilst you take breaks from all your big budgeted AAA affairs or simply when you are looking for some charming yet challenging slow-paced downtime from the frenzy that is some of the bigger action/RPG/adventure titles out there. I thoroughly enjoyed Toki Tori 2+ and whilst it may appear simple at first - you soon realize those first appearances are very deceiving as underneath the hood of all this cuteness and colorfulness is a task master that drives a hard bargain - often demanding only the best from those little grey cells that make up your brain.

On one hand, it's a very charming game with some interesting and at times challenging puzzles.  On the other hand, it is absolutely nothing like what I was expecting after having played the first Toki Tori game.\n\nThe first Toki Tori involved you using a variety of gadgets to solve puzzles in a small area.  Your goal is to gather eggs, of which there are a known amount in every level.  It was a fun, challenging puzzle game and I wanted more.\n\nToki Tori 2+, now... You don't have any gadgets. In fact, the only two abilities you have are to sing and to do a ground pound, neither of which were in the first game. Those are the only two things you will use to solve every single puzzle in the game.\n\nIt's also a pseudo-Metroidvania map style now.  I say "pseudo" because you don't really gain new abilities to unlock new areas.  You can access any part of the game from the very beginning, just so long as you know what to do. Not necessarily a bad departure.\n\nThere are no tutorials. At all. You have to figure out everything on your own. And I have to wonder why they left out anything explaining the basic functions of the game. Tori 1 had a single tutorial level for each new gadget you used. Here, there's no dialogue or explanation of anything. Even in the pause menu, you have several icons and you have to figure out what they mean for yourself.\n\nIn Toki Tori 1, you had the clear goal of finding all of your eggs to complete a level. In Toki Tori 2, I'm not sure what exactly you're gathering or why. Instead of eggs, you're gathering... something. They're yellow shiny things, but I don't know why you need to get them. Actually, after playing six hours of the game, I'm still not even sure if gathering the somethings actually has an impact on the game, apart from a sense of completion. There's also no indicator for how many somethings you've found or haven't found, so if I was going for full completion, I would have no way of knowing how many I'd missed. I cared about gathering eggs because they helped me finish a level. Here, I don't even know what I'm gathering, much less why, so why should I care?\n\nThat sort of brings me to another point. Without any sort of guidance, I have no idea what to do or why to do it. Even open world games like Skyrim or KOTOR gave you an idea of what to do. With Toki Tori 2+ I've just spent hours wandering around the world map (after figuring out how to use it - which I needed a walkthrough to figure out), solving puzzles, and looking at the pretty visuals. It all feels rather pointless if the entire end result is just that you see more scenery.\n\nThat being said, the game is very charming. It's a very interesting world and there are some beautiful settings. The puzzles also can be very interesting, if a bit repetetive (there's only so many times you can get a frog to cough up a bubble before you're just going through the motions). I wouldn't say I hate the game, just that it's not at all what I expected based on the first game and that I'm a bit confused why they decided to change, well... everything.\n\nAs the sequel to Toki Tori 1, I do have to say that I was a bit let down. Change in a sequel is good, but you do have to keep enough the same that it's at least recognizable as a sequel. However, as a standalone game, my only real complaint would be that without anything to explain what we're doing or why, there's no purpose. Apart from that, it's still a fun game. Perhaps for that reason, I'll give it a thumbs up. However, if you're planning to buy this because you liked the first game, keep in mind that it won't be similar at all.","January 24, 2015","true","6.3"," 35 of 37 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","35","37","3","1"

It achieves this unprecedented feat by teaching you new and non-obvious mechanics as you progress through the various stages, which you can then use to solve other challenges you passed earlier.

Game is now open-world rather than a set of different levels, and Toki Tori now only has a whistle and stomp ability and will often need to use the abilities of the creatures inhabiting that location to reach next collectible or checkpoint location.\n\nThe game is a bit difficult to follow initially as there are no instructions on how or why Toki Tori starts out moving in the forest, and what are the things the player has to look out for and to do to progress in the game. Eventually, the game will reward the player with achievements and secret locations for those who attempt to reach the ending and obtain every collectible in the game.","February 5, 2015","true","31.2"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","100","19","19","6","0"

Shortly after starting it, I realized that ME - not really a kid anymore - have already played it for five hours straight! Game doesn't give any instructions - and that's 50% of fun, from discovering things yourself. It's a great feature, some of us, relying on tutorials for every game out there, already forgot.\n\nThat said, I wouldn't recommend this game for kids, buy it if you like solving gradually harder puzzles of "how to get up on that platform?" or "there should be 10 items on this level I have only 5, where's the rest?". You need to make surrounding creatures to do your bidding by singing for them, stomping the ground around or teleporting them wherever they're needed.  You'll be lighting dark areas with a fairy, which you need to invite there by singing, you will use frog's bubbles to raise to higher areas, you will even need frogs bubble-fly another frog from time to time. Sometimes you will need that pesky bird, which god-knows-why has uber-affection for you, to be removed by zapping it with two slugs. There are times, when you will have wondered "how to get up there?", but having progressed slightly further you will discover new ways to do things, something you haven't thought of before, or just simply a new ability. This makes you go back and complete that task you haven't done before.\nWarning to those that are alergic to trying things repeatedly and failing 90% of the time - you're gonna want to be zapped by a slug yourself, so try another game.\n\nWriting anything more would be a big spoiler on how the game works, so enough to say - get it, you won't regret it.","December 22, 2013","true","37.9"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","22","25","0","0"

(Stomp and chirp) A useful point to note about this: 'Side paths' often require an undiscovered method of using your abilities. These tricks are introduced in different places of the world map, and to avoid frustration, clear what seems easier and head back after exploring other parts of the world.\n\nSome puzzles, often special areas, are extremely tedious. A slight mistake and the entire process starts over. Unfortunately, rewind mode doesn't exist.\n\n*The main problem with the game is sustaining interest of the player during the first few hours. The vague context of the game takes a little away from the experience. (If it wasn't for google, I would still be clueless what the story was.)  Tori's abilities feel extremely limited at the start. While you do learn about the environment and its interactions, it feels like Tori doesn't 'grow' for an extensive period of time. (A lack of reward) Moreover, the game is extremely unique and may feel uncomfortable to people who wants comfort in what they are used to. (Toki Tori 1 or most puzzle games) Chirping melodies also seem like a very important feature used to solve puzzles. (but it isn't, it's the interaction a chirp does)\n\nConclusion\nThis is the one of the few puzzle games I have played that uses inductive reasoning skills. It is not a game for everyone. Expect nothing of its predecessor (or most puzzle games for the matter) as your mind will be pushed into a different way of thinking. That said, Toki Tori 2 is in a genre of its own. If you have an open mind, you will probably love this.\n\n\n\nPersonally my favourite puzzle game of all time, more so than Portal 2. (and that was amazing)\n\nThings I wished the game told you:\n1. The teleporting eagle could've been introduced earlier in the game.\n2. Using the rewind melody on a checkpoint brings you back to a previous checkpoint and can be used repeatedly within the area.\n3. Do not attempt to bring all shiny orange frogs into the tunnel BEFORE entering the city on the first playthrough.\n4.

If you want a game where you want to  wonder where the fun went, buy Toki Tori 2+\n\nLong description;\nToki Tori 1 was a bit of a surprise to me how much fun it was. I didn't really expect to get hooked on a puzzle game, not generally my thing. Even if it was relative simple, with a short amount of items, the puzzles were usually engaging, making you think, and making you feel good about yourself once you finally figure them out. Or feel stupid if you can't and YouTube them and then go "Oh, that was the sollution. How could I not see that?"\nAll in all; it's good fun.\n\nWhich makes it all the more baffling what went wrong during the development of Toki Tori 2+\n* Instead of expanding the game, they took almost everything out. You only got 2(!) commands now. Z and X (stomp and make noise) which you need to solve ALL puzzles. Does 2 buttons for puzzles seem too shallow? Then you would be right, since it is. Instead of TT1 where you felt good solving the puzzle laid out before you here you simply need to do the command the developers want you to do, since there's not much more with 2 commands. Puzzles (like the frog and bubble) get repeated ad infentum. Instead of puzzling all you need to do is manipulate the environment, which isn't all that difficult since you only got 2 buttons to do stuff. To add injury to insult instead of large areas as TT1 TT2 decides to hugely zoom in. The result? That you never get complex large puzzles, but small compact instances. If you're "stuck" it never takes long since everything you need is within your small screen. It may take a small time to figure out, say, more fireflies bind together to make more light. But you can be guaranteed once you solve it the game will throw it 30 more times at you to make sure you remember what Z and X are on your keyboard. So instead of making your brain think, you simply follow the simple commands to allow the game to move you on. Away goes almost all the TT1 fun. But it gets worse.\n\n* For some reason levels weren't good enough, so we now got an "open world". Why? I don't know. You still follow level after level, but thanks to a map which is useless and doesn't show in any way where the levels are you pretty much wonder where the heck you're going. The map/levels branch too. I have no idea why, since it adds tedious backtracking, and a wonderement where to go next. Why? Because nothing is interesting at all. Do I need to go left or right for the game to start getting fun, to actually get somewhere? Nope... you just follow level after level of pointlessness, purpose-less and boring. Other games might actually make this pointless moving forward interesting with a plotline, cutscenes, rewards... ANYTHING, but not this game... it's just moving forward and forward into a meaningless pointlessness, not even worth exploring like say The Elder Scrolls since the world while cute isn't interesting *at all*. You can also forget looking forward to new mechanics, you keep Z and X'ing forever. Environmental stuff changes, but it never really feels any different than the very first puzzle you came across.\nIt's not a good thing when a game makes you wonder "why am I even playing this?"\n\nFinally, I got somewhere that I got a song to take pictures of animals. Why I have no clue still, but after I was done with it I suddenly got teleported to the useless map screen and had to point at a glowing pillar many many levels back. That pretty much was it... it was boring to go through content once, what makes them think I would even want to go through it twice? Why the heck can't that bird get me back to where I was... why even.\nYou know what, my 3rd Steam card just dropped. I don't care anymore... take your game. I'll go back to Toki Tori 1 to have fun. Since no way in hell will I retrack to where I used to be through the same pointless "puzzles" that bored me to death this first 1 hour.\n\nI have no idea where they went off so badly that they produced such a pointless, dull and uninteresting game, that while cute, lacks any depth what-so-ever. And for a puzzle-game, that's killing.\nMany people want sequels to be different, to not be more of the same. I would say the same. But Toki Tori 2+ completely missed the mark in this respect. A missed opportunity. Oh well, atleast we got the first game...","September 23, 2014","false","1.0"," 71 of 124 people (57%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","57","71","124","9","3"

All that the character can do is move left and right plus sing and stomp. The character doesn't really acquire new abilities (at least it didn't in my 80 minutes of gameplay). The chicken does learn some songs but those don't deepen the gameplay or widen levels like is usual in metroidvanias.\n\nBecause the movement and action is so reduced, consist all puzles from walking to a certain place and sing/stomp and from there walking to a another place and sing/stomp. Positive thing is the form of the puzzles: instead of usual flip a switch or step on a pressure plate puzzles, most of the puzzles consist guiding and manipulating animals. Usually interaction with animals follows formula: singing atracts and stomping scares. How and why singing and stomping should be used differs with every animal.\n\nThe biggest problem I had with the game was my metroidvania expectations. I waited something more similar to the first Rayman, which has new skills that widened old levels. In this form I found puzzles of the Toki Tori 2+ quickly boring and after a level is complete, are new aspects of the next level usually quite minor. If Toki Tori 2+ had one or two new animals (puzzle elements) in every level, it might maintain its initial novelty. Another thing that was quite of for a metroidvania was tempo. The character is a fat bird and that gives quite good picture. There aren't really any enemies in a usual sense. They should be considered more like obstacles, like in any other situation with animals. These obstacles are game's so called puzzles. From this it follows that each level could be divided into countable number of separate puzzles (obstacles). Because of this kind of world structure and the crippled movement, for me, the game seemed like a classic Mario game where instead of jumping Mario could only pull or push boxes. There wouldn't be a problem if puzzles were interesting and challenging and there weren't too long gaps between them. Getting forward and completing levels should be much more rewarding than it is now. In essence: combination of level design and gameplay lacks feeling.\n\nI'll admit that my playtime is quite low and the game could get better as it goes on, but for me to find game enjoyable this would require occurrence of some major gameplay or level design changing element. Even if game had more to offer later, it wouldn't erase the fact that I found early game very tedious.\n\nIf Toki Tori 2+ interests you and you consider buying the full game, I'll higly recommend trying the demo and then think if my critique could have had any base.","February 13, 2014","false","1.2"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","13","22","0","0"

The only thing stopping you from breaking away from the main path and climbing a seemingly unreachable area is lack of knowledge on how to combine the level's resources to get there -  knowledge that you will pick up in the process of solving simpler puzzles, or figure out yourself using common logic and a little creativity. As a result, the game has very little backtracking for a Metroidvania world, unless you consciously choose to skip harder puzzles and come back later.\n\nThe player  is only given two abilities, both unlocked from the start, and no inventory. This very limited toolkit is nonetheless used to create very challenging puzzles, even when all the elements are present on screen. Many puzzles misdirect the player with elements that play no part in the solution, or require "smuggling out" elements from other puzzles.\n\nThere are no tutorials and no handholding, the game has no text whatsoever. You learn how to interact with game elements and make them interact with each other by experimenting and solving puzzles where figuring out the interaction is the only way to proceed forward. Figuring out the game's mechanics is the main puzzle.\n\nThe art style may not be unique, but it is not low-effort by any means - it is clean, crisp and a pleasure to look at. The background for most levels are simply wonderful.\n\nLast but not least, most the Steam achievements actually add value to the game and serve as puzzles themselves.\n\n----\n\nThis game is a crazy bargain for the price even when not on sale, and I would recommend it to anyone seeking a laid back but well-designed brain tickler.","May 22, 2015","true","21.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

These are hidden by using the available animals in different ways than the main puzzles, or adding extra steps to the solutions to go further than the normal exit. Easier examples include having a bird grab you from a different location than its starting location so that it takes a different path to its drop off point.\n\nHarder ones usually involve safely escorting creatures outside of their normal wandering zones so you can use them to move to unexpected locations.\n\n\nSecondly, getting around:\nAlmost every 'screen' in the game has an object that you can use a song to teleport to them from any checkpoint in the game. You can rewind to a previous checkpoint using a song that is taught at a couple of early-game dead-end locations. This means you can always return to a checkpoint to use the teleport song but undoes everything done after touching the checkpoint, this includes collecting collectibles or any animal movement.\n\nThe majority of areas have also have small mole tunnels that open up once you've visited both sides of them to help you get around easier, these are typically located in zones that have complicated or lengthy puzzles to travel through them.\n\n... I thought i would have a "thirdly" here but there isn't much more to address.

It truly has a metroidvania style, with a map connecting all the puzzles. And the controls are simple, since Toki Tori only has 3 actions: movement, chirp and stomp. So, how can this simplicity lead to challenging puzzles? The answer is the environment. There are a lot of creatures and other mechanisms, and each one has unique abilities. You must figure out how to use and combine them to advance. And here lies the beauty of exploring this game. In metro-style games, you advance the map and find blocked areas, because you don't have the gadget or ability yet. Then you keep exploring, find them and backtrack. Here, those zones are always acessible. But you may not know how to progress, so you keep playing and discovering new ways to interact with the environment. And then you backtrack and solve those zones, knowing that it was possible to go there from the beginning. The map may not be huge, but there are lots to do. To beat the story, you need to find 5 special frogs. You can collect all wings to uncover new secrets. And there are hidden zones and achievements. Oh, and the art is amazing too. And the game doesn't feel like some puzzles connected to each other by a map. Here, the total is more than the sum of it's parts. And that makes this game truly special and rewarding to explore.","June 17, 2015","true","21.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jemwong/recommended/201420/","jemwong","Jem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jemwong/","170 products in account","Toki Tori 2 is, rather obviously, the sequel to Toki Tori. It's evolved from being a pure puzzle game, with limited use of items, to a more fluid platformer puzzle. While the original was pretty unforgiving, and often required surgically precise steps to solving the puzzles, TT2 isn't quite as strict. Most puzzles can be re-attempted without a reset or winding back time.\n\nIn TT2, you return as Toki Tori, and you only have two (unlimited) abilities at your disposal : a whistle, and a ground stomp. There are many other creatures and elements in the game, and they will respond to one, oftentimes both, of these actions. Puzzles are solved by using your abiltiies to manipulate your surroundings. It sounds very simple, but there are many, many different creatures in the game, and the trickier puzzles will require chaining their reactions together. The 'core' puzzles that you need to solve to progress through the game are fairly straightforward, but the side area ones are much tougher, and it always feels very satisfying to finally solve them and hear the bonus area background chime.\n\nThere are several good points to this game that I want to highlight.\n\n1) It doesn't try to babysit you. The game provides subtle hints to guide you along, but it lets you learn it without butting in obstrusively. The game itself starts off without any kind of narration, and you're left to make your way through the levels. In fact, the only help text I ever remembered seeing, was the hint to sing the Reset song, and even that only appears after you fail to follow the non textual clue. The effect of this is that it increases the immersion of the game, and makes solving the levels so much more rewarding.\n\n2) No need to constantly run to an ingame menu. Instead, Toki Tori can whistle a certain combination of notes to perform certain actions (e.g. reset to last checkpoint or go to the world map). It's a very nice touch.\n\n3) You don't get any new abilities as you progress (with the exception of the songs, but those don't factor into the puzzzles). This means there's no grinding involved. All puzzles are solvable right from the beginning of the game, but on your first try you won't know how. You'll learn several tips and tricks as you go along, and when you backtrack to the earlier to fulfill your masochistic desire to collect all the score items, it will suddenly strike you that you can get one frog to float another frog up.\n\n4) Graphics and music. The art style is very minimalistic, clean and ridiculously cute, and the music fits the game very well. For the most part, it's a relaxing experience, in spite of all the puzzle solving.\n\nAs with most platformers, it plays much better with a controller.\n\nHighly recommended.","January 24, 2014","true","23.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

There was a part right in the beginning where I had to actually check the control layout, however, I was okay with this because there are very few controls to begin with. After continuing, the title "Toki Tori 2+" rises up as you make your way to the other side of the map. I found that to be a very refreshing intro to a game.\n\nThe learning curve for this game is very minimal, as the puzzles do a great job of progressing in difficulty at a reasonable pace - you will always be aware of what mechanic you need to be using by the time you get to the more difficult variations. Trial and error is also convenient because of the very few controls you have at your disposal.\n\nYou can't jump in the game, however, you can stomp or sing - and either action usually has an effect on your environment. For example, frogs will orient themselves toward you if you sing, and (if they eat a small animal) they will release a bubble if you stomp. If you are hit by the frog's bubble, it will carry you up and either to the left or right (depending on the frog's orientation) until a short distance has passed or until you stomp. In order to help feed the frog (sometimes its food is not on the same plane), you need to stomp when the prey is near the edge of a ledge, which will cause it to fall to a lower level.\n\nLater, you will unlock special notes that you can sing in order to activate abilities like "rewind" (I was not expecting a mechanic like this and was pleasantly suprised). You can manipulate your singing by changing the timing of your spacebar presses, and using rewind will return you to a previous checkpoint you have activated (gold totem-like objects).\n\nThe game map is fairly extensive, with many forks in the road to keep you engaged and challenged. There are also gold puzzle pieces and other things for you to collect.\n\nHighly recommend for puzzle platform enthusiasts.","July 12, 2014","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You play as a little baby bird type creature with your only two abilities, you can stomp or sing. Despite only having these two tools you can accomplish a lot with them as you use them to maniplate the other creatures like bugs and frogs to move through the levels. For example you can stomp to drop a bug off the ceiling, he gets swallowed by a nearby frog and then you stomp again to make the frog burp up a bubble which will pick you up and carry you to higher ledges. It's really well done and leads to a lot of challenging and clever puzzles as you progress through the game.\n\nYou never get any direct hints from the game, instead it uses clever contextual hints as well as you just learning through trial and error. The game has some light metrodvania style level design with different paths and hidden areas to be found.  The graphics have a cartoon style that really fits the game and gives it a lot of charm.\n\nGood points:\n- great level design and puzzles that are surprisingly challenging and clever.\n-The game doesnt handhold and is brilliant at giving subtle hints about the games mechanics\n- Really charming graphics and music which gives it a lot of character\n-You get the ability to reset to the nearest save point ,and with a liberal amount of these, it gives you a lot of room for trial and error without making you repeat long sections\n\nBad points:\n- Can think of anything major that was wrong with the game. At a push it might have been nice to have a bigger variety of creatures as most puzzles rely on the bugs,frogs and birds.","May 21","true","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Whereas Toki Tori 1 is a straight up puzzle platformer with traditional levels, Toki Tori 2 is a Metroid-like explorable world, where solving puzzles is the way to get around.  Also, unlike the first game, there are no items to use.  Instead, different reactions can be elicited from the native creatures by Toki Tori either chirping or stomping.  While it sounds rather simple in theory (and some of the early puzzle are), figuring out the correct sequence to solve a puzzle can get rather challenging at times.  Simply put, this is not the game for people who hate puzzles or those lacking patience.  Those who do manage to stick around for the harder areas of the game will find an enjoyable experience, and will no doubt find a number of easter eggs in the process.","January 27, 2014","true","33.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Although admittedly it took a little bit to start appreciating the game. This is primarily due to the lack of instructions or direction provided by the game. There are no tutorials, no dialog, nothing. What the game does do to help the player is provide subtle hints, that I personally missed at first. For example, always pay attention to the little white bird. He will show you how to get to certain areas and even show you song melodies that you can play to do certain things (e.g. fast travel, restart, point out collectibles). Although this lack of direction made starting out a little tough, I ended up appreciating it later on.\n\nWhat I really enjoyed about the game is how it takes such a simple concept and is able to make complex puzzles. Throughout the entire game, you can only move (not jump), stomp the ground, and make tweeting sounds. You must use these abilities to interact with different animals and objects in order to solve puzzles. From the beginning of the game, you have the ability to get to any area. The only thing you might be lacking is the knowledge of how to get past certain points. Again, the game does not tell you how to do things with dialog boxes, instead it subtly shows you, through gameplay, how to use your stomping and tweeting to progress through the level.\n\nI strongly suggest checking out this video walkthrough for when you get stuck, and you most certainly will. You may have to hunt through the videos to find where he covers the section you are stuck on, but it is definitely worth it as he shows how to unlock all of the achievements and shows some stuff that I would not have been able to figure out on my own.\n\nAnother helpful tip is that the rewind song, which is: (tweet these notes) short short long long, can be played multiple times to jump back to previous checkpoints.","January 30, 2014","true","15.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It makes use of some interesting game mechanics. You can't jump, but you can "tweet" up to 5 notes, each of which can be either short or long, and you can pound on the ground. During the game you learn different sequences of notes that cause different magical effects (sort of like a bird casting magic spells by tweeting the right way). So rather than the usual platformer type stuff of killing things with weapons or Mario-style by landing on them, or getting around by jumping, you have to use tweeting and ground pounding to manipulate your environment in order to progress. And there's even a level editor for the thing.\n\nThis style of game isn't really my main area of interest, but this game is extremely well designed and is quite unique. If this is your type of game, then this one would be in the must get category.","July 13, 2014","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I was even perplexed within the first few minutes of playing, it didnt really feel like a puzzle game to me. If you want an awesome idea of what a good puzzle platformer would play like check out Moei Kun for the Famicom or like The Violinist of Hamelin on Super Famicom and that is more of a side scroller with puzzle elements but the game play mechanics make sense for a side scroller this doesn't, its just weird its like it couldnt decide if it wanted to be a puzzler or a mario like game.

The most unsatisfying "ending" ever\n\nAdditional Notes:\nJust like every game I play, I make it a commitment to finish the game all the way through. Of course, I finished this (despite this game's flaws), and my achievements are proof of that. Toki Tori 2 just has so many fundamental design problems making it a title I cannot recommend to anyone.

I love Metroidvania games, and this is not a metroidvania game.\nThe genre consists of a hero who runs around and fights monsters in an open ended world where progress is earned by finding new items that unlock new paths.\nToki tori 2+ is is a linear series of simplistic puzzles that center on stomping next to animals to scare them.\n\nYou play as a big yellow bird that can move around in a colorful world filled with cute animals, and you can interact with the world by singing and stomping. The stomping causes different kinds of animals to react differently. By scaring the right animals to do the right thing (usually eating another animal) you may advance to the next puzzle. If this was all there was to the game I would still feel cheated as it is no metroidvania, but it's a fun enough puzzle game where the player gets to explore a pretty world by solving simple puzzles.\n\nWhat kills the enjoyment for me is  the singing. It is a candidate for the most stupid game mechanic ever - basically there is a single button for singing. Pressing the button "rapidly" causes the bird to sing at a higher and higher pitch, and pressing it "slowly" causes the pitch to drop. The idea being that you run into birds that sing a song, and you have to mimic it. Here I think a rapid press is anything below 100ms, and everything above that is a slow press, which means that at least I am unable to accurately enter anything, and when I press as fast as I can I am still mostly unable to produce the rising tones, and thus the singing really hurts my fingers and takes a really long time to get past due to the button mashing effectively being random.\n\nTL;DR cute little puzzle game, not a metroidvania like the liars claim. Could be fun for a while, but the singing kills any enjoyment. Only get if you hate yourself and wish to inflict physical pain on your fingers.","October 24, 2014","false","1.7"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","6","14","0","0"

You tweet/chirp and stomp to make different things happen in the environment to get you around. You learn different tweet/chirp tunes to do things like rewinding time, etc. It looks cute, which is nice, and the music was pretty decent. However, I couldn't find any semblance of a story, or an objective. There are little spinning things to collect, but I didn't find a use for them and there wasn't a counter to tell me how many I had or if I'd gotten all of them from the level I'd finished. The world map has that sort of Super Mario World aesthetic, but you can't seem to actually move around on the map. It's just like "Yep, you're going to this place. Press Z" and that's it. Anyway, it's not a bad game from what I can tell, but without some sense of purpose, either from a plot or from a completionist point of view, I can't recommend it and doubt I'll ever finish it.","April 12, 2014","false","3.7"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

I've honestly played IOS and flash games with more depth, bare in mind that IOS and flash games are usually free or very cheap and Toki Tori 2 costs £12 (that’s right £12 at this moment) so there is no excuse for limited mechanics and ugly textures. However I do have to mention that the game has a good soundtrack and the sound effects correspond perfectly to your actions but that isn't enough to make the game nearly enjoyable.\n\nThe game is extremely slow paced and it mocks your intelligence with how easy the puzzles are so how can you possibly recommend this game unless you are completely delusional about this genre. I'm sorry but you can't justify paying £12 for this when Trine, Fez and Super Meat boy are all cheaper, maybe if you have played all decent the platformers on steam (which you probaly haven't) AND the game is on sale AND you have played the orginal and want some nostalga, then you MIGHT have a slight feasible reason to buy it.","January 16, 2014","false","0.1"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","4","15","0","0"

Toki Tori 2 is basically that moment but as a game.\nUnlike the first game, which was a puzzle game closer in heritage to Lemmings, Toki Tori 2 is an exploration puzzle platformer with zero in-game text and no ability gating. You have two ways of interacting with the world: stomping and, most interestingly, singing. By alternating long and short presses, Toki can sing big or small notes, respectively. Similar to the ocarina in Zelda games, different combinations of notes will have certain effects. Technically, there is nothing stopping you from using any of these "powers" from the start of the game. You could, in theory, brute force all of them on the opening screen, but that would take a while. The way the game teaches you these powers at the "right time" is through little birds that you'll see around the environment that sing little note combos. Copy these notes and BAM you'll learn what that combo does. There's only five or so powers, which was initially disappointing, but I realized that it would be much more challenging for the developers to fully explore the mechanics.

You know how you're the kind of person who wants games that don't hold your hand? Games that assume you're intelligent instead of making you feel smart? You might not expect it, but Toki Tori 2 is that game. Its mechanics live in the plants and animals that inhabit its world; only through careful observation of these plants and animals can you progress through the puzzles. Figuring out how this world works and how you can work within it is one of the most rewarding experiences I've found in a puzzle game.","January 3, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Instead of being a pure puzzler like the first game, #2's challenge lies in learning how things interact, and then using that knowledge to keep moving forward.\n\nNearly all of the normal annoyances of this type of game are averted -\nRewind time to the last checkpoint at any time, don't even need to open a menu.\nCheckpoints are placed amazingly well.  I have yet to have to walk more than a single screen to retry a puzzle.\nIt teaches you one thing at a time, then twists it to make it interesting, then combines it with other things you've learned to make it challenging.\nIt TEACHES, never TELLS.  Nothing is worse than having to sit through 3 minutes of the game telling you all about the move or tool you just obtained.  Toki Tori 2 hasn't done this to me.\n\nNothing is better in a metroidvania than coming back to an area and realizing that there's a puzzle you missed, but it was hidden in plain sight.

Toki Tori 2 is basically that moment but as a game.\nUnlike the first game, which was a puzzle game closer in heritage to Lemmings, Toki Tori 2 is an exploration puzzle platformer with zero in-game text and no ability gating. You have two ways of interacting with the world: stomping and, most interestingly, singing. By alternating long and short presses, Toki can sing big or small notes, respectively. Similar to the ocarina in Zelda games, different combinations of notes will have certain effects. Technically, there is nothing stopping you from using any of these "powers" from the start of the game. You could, in theory, brute force all of them on the opening screen, but that would take a while. The way the game teaches you these powers at the "right time" is through little birds that you'll see around the environment that sing little note combos. Copy these notes and BAM you'll learn what that combo does. There's only five or so powers, which was initially disappointing, but I realized that it would be much more challenging for the developers to fully explore the mechanics. And they've done a great job with that as it is. Admittedly, I'm only about halfway done with the game by my reckoning, but the variety I've seen in puzzle design and mechanical interaction has impressed me.\n\nToki Tori 2 is one of the most surprising games of 2013 for me. I wasn't a huge fan of the first game, but Toki Tori 2 has blown me away with its well-designed environmental puzzles and storytelling. I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who likes a great puzzle game.","November 30, 2013","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Toki Tori 2 is basically that moment but as a game.\nUnlike the first game, which was a puzzle game closer in heritage to Lemmings, Toki Tori 2 is an exploration puzzle platformer with zero in-game text and no ability gating. You have two ways of interacting with the world: stomping and, most interestingly, singing. By alternating long and short presses, Toki can sing big or small notes, respectively. Similar to the ocarina in Zelda games, different combinations of notes will have certain effects. Technically, there is nothing stopping you from using any of these "powers" from the start of the game. You could, in theory, brute force all of them on the opening screen, but that would take a while. The way the game teaches you these powers at the "right time" is through little birds that you'll see around the environment that sing little note combos. Copy these notes and BAM you'll learn what that combo does. There's only five or so powers, which was initially disappointing, but I realized that it would be much more challenging for the developers to fully explore the mechanics. And they've done a great job with that as it is. Admittedly, I'm only about halfway done with the game by my reckoning, but the variety I've seen in puzzle design and mechanical interaction has impressed me.\n\nToki Tori 2 is one of the most surprising games of 2013 for me. I wasn't a huge fan of the first game, but Toki Tori 2 has blown me away with its well-designed environmental puzzles and storytelling. I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who likes a great puzzle game.","November 30, 2013","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Be aware if you played the first - it is an entirely different kind of game altogether. While the first one was a point-and-click puzzle game, this one is a 2D platformer with heavy puzzle elements. That does not, however, make it any less fun. Now, let's take a look at what makes it so unique:\n\nYou can only do three things. You can walk left and right, you can tweet, and you can ground pound. You do not unlock extra abilities. In fact, every area is theoretically accessible right from the start - the only thing that prevents you from doing so is your lack of knowledge. Nothing is explained. The abilities have many, many uses - but you have to figure them out yourself. This might sound annoying but it really isn't. Pretty much everything you can do is self-explanatory and easy to figure out.\n\nMost of the puzzles are quite difficult. But never so difficult that you have to give up. After some time analysing the scenario and trying different approaches I always found the solutions.\n\nOverall this is a fantastic, unique, challenging game with sweet graphics and a nice, relaxing soundtrack.

A lot.  I had loved the first Toki Tori, but found this one frustrating and confusing.\n\nHowever, after having put it on the shelf for a year and coming back, I decided to give the game a real shot.  And after some initial frustration, I really started enjoying it.  The puzzles are really, really well thought out.  And only a few of them were what I'd call "unfair" and required levels of perception I seem to lack.\n\nBut given lots of patience and time, it was very rewarding to figure out the puzzles, and finish a level.\n\nWhat I *do* ding the game for though is its lack of focus, and overall confusing storyline.  Nothing really made any sense whatsoever, and I never felt like I knew what I was doing, beyond just solving puzzles.  This game lacked a lot of the charm of the original, even though, as I mentioned, the puzzle design was freaking fantastic.\n\nI'm giving this a thumbs up, if you love puzzle games, and can ignore the confusing storyline.","January 21","true","48.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I will start with this, if you are an adult then this game will stink. Its not for you, its for kids. I would say about under the ages 2-6. There is no violent death (that I have found at least) in the game (drowning was disturbing but no blood), its a relaxing fun exploration with zany (for kids) interactions with a magical world. Its about as wholesome as apple pie, and while I did get frustrated from some of the mechanics (birds that grab your guy) I doubt a kid wouldn't find this awesome/fun. The music is nice, the interactions are cute, Toki Tori is a polished gem in an industry that pumps out crappy kids games with no thought.\n\nTLDR; Get it for kids under the age of 7, no blood and easy puzzles with fun interactions. Past that age and its a boring kids game that I would say is borderline unplayable (for an adult).","May 20, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is hardly any tutorializing, and each new section requires you to figure out how new mechanics work, or use existing mechanics in a way you hadn't thought of. Synthesizing the tiny bits of knowledge about how your stomp and whistling affect the environment into a working solution requires plenty of critical thinking, and I must admit I found the game frustrating for the longest time, because I was almost in a perpetual state of "being stuck" on every new puzzle I attempted.\n\nBut the game made me feel incredible smart once I did figure how the world works and mastermind a series of actions to solve what are seemingly impossible puzzles. The solutions are never obvious, and more than often I found myself thinking, "There's no way to solve this. ...Wait, is it possible for me to do XYZ? There's NO WAY that's the solution; that's far too devious." And then it is.\n\nIf you're looking for an incredibly well-made and difficult puzzle-platformer, whose difficulty springs from your ability to think rather than any inherent unfairness, well then my friend, this is a must-buy.","June 24, 2015","true","23.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
