It's just pure pleasure to play. It's simple, it has good, responsive controls, and you can blow up enemy bullets to turn them into hearts.\n\nI choose to play it with a wired 360 controller. Though it doesn't say so on the store page, it's fully compatible and works really well (except in the menus, where it goes a bit funny).\n\nOh and I like the vocalisations and sound effects. But if you don't, or you are scared the neighbours might think you're into porn with extra hardcore laser destruction, you can turn them off in the options.

Or atleast love screaming at you. This game is more of a Bullet Hell Lite though, Still great fun but with none of the insane difficulty of a screen full of things really trying to kill you.\n\nGameplay-wise, this game handles with all the grace and maneuverability of a twin-stick shooter... So, depending on how good you are at them great to middling. I always manage to lose my grip on one of the control sticks whenever I play, but I still manage to suvive somehow.\n\nGraphically, the screen-shots speak for themselves. Bright, vibrant colours, varied enemies and stages, a third thing... I think this is one of the prettiest games that I own.\n\nThe music in this game matches the gameplay perfectly, so much so that I forget sometimes that the sound effects and the musical score are seperated.\n\n\nI may be somewhat biased in this review, because I have always been a sucker for games like this, but I do fully recommend this game if you enjoy pretty colours with a laid-back feel... Well, as laid back as a Bullet Hell game can be.\n\n\n\nA small bit of self promotion now, I have a Youtube channel where I do Let's Plays, and this game just happens to be one of the games that I have done on it. Who would've thought it? Anyway, if you want to see some gameplay footage of this game, please check out my Let's Play of it here:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frDdujwgOo8","December 15, 2013","true","7.9"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/leonresevil2/recommended/202410/","leonresevil2","LeonRes [OC]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/leonresevil2/","582 products in account","It's a decent twin-stick shooter, easy to pick up and play for short lengths. Controls are clean, it works well on mouse and keyboard, and it's forgiving enough on some levels to be comfortable for beginners. All you need to know is movement, shooting, and using the short-range bomb as a shield from bullets.\n\nThe game has many levels, with the harder path requiring higher scores to unlock. Gameplay is varied with unique challenges available after completing those levels. Scoreboards have been broken for awhile, but what does that matter? It would be topped by a few cheaters unless the devs did regular wipes. And if you are looking to sit on top of a leaderboard, find an unpopulated game.\n\nI play games for gameplay. The gameplay here is solid, but levels can get a bit challenging at times, so I don't play a lot. I usually play for a short period to pass some time, and the game works for that. The lives system seems unnecessary since all levels can be restarted and replayed at will. But the game does twin-stick nicely, and 50% off is a great deal.","August 4, 2014","true","6.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Contrary to most games in the genre, in which such life-saving bombs should be spared for desperate situations, Scoregasm encourages the player to use them liberally as they help achieve higher scores and combos. Thid id probably the reason why Scoregasm is considred too easy by the most hardcore players.\n\nThe action is frantic enough to remain interesting and the controls (aside from the menus) are perfectly precise and responsive with the Xbox 360 controller. The music is good, provided you enjoy slightly outdated techno.\n\nTechnically, graphics are nothing too impressive, though perfectly serviceable, except in some rare levels where elements from the background can easily be confused with enemies.\n\nThe big problem with Scoregasm is the online scoreboard, which ceased to function just one year after the game's release and has never been restored, despite the developer's promises.\n\nScoregasm is not a bad game per se, but it's not original enough to make it easy to overlook the disappearing features and poor support, especially in such a crowded genre.","March 30","false","2.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","2"

Does this make it a bad game? For me no, but this is considered by many to be an essential feature of this type of game. I did contact the developer about this and he responded quickly and did say that he still intends to fix this, but three years really is a long time for anyone to wait. Still I have to credit Charlie for this!\n\nThe game itself is good. Not one of the absolute best twin stick shooters in my opinion but well above par for the most part. For casual twin stick players it may well appeal far more than some other twin stick games that I would consider better. If you are just after a fun casual blast then download the demo and if you like it and are not bothered by the high scores issue then get it, you probably won't regret it.\n\nFor twin stick pros cracks do start to appear in the execution of the play mechanics. The expert mode relies on chasing down the gun power-ups in order to give the metered close combat bomb attack a chance to recharge a little, when it runs out you will die on the expert stages. This would work perfectly if you could actually see with any amount of ease where the power-ups are, the little glowing yellow icon is lost amongst a sea of glowing yellow bullets. This combined with power-ups not spawning from the bomb attack and coming from any random enemy mean that you can easily kill the one with the much needed drop via the bomb instead of shooting it. The end result being that it comes down to luck rather than a tactical deployment of your weapons and skill. So close to being great but ultimately flawed...\n\nSome other problems have become apparent too. I can't unlock the third exit from level 3c, even though my combo was 106 above the third level requirement. This seems broke so any achievement hunters are going to have a problem getting the “Mr Perfect” award. Likewise I can't unlock the challenge for this stage on either normal or expert setting despite having spent more time repeating this stage than I spent unlocking all the other 42 challenges available in the game. This again seems either broke or a very misjudged difficulty spike.\n\nAll in all a good and enjoyable game with some issues that stop if from being a truly great one.","January 31","true","8.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/strange_horizon/recommended/202410/","strange_horizon","Zephram☼","http://steamcommunity.com/id/strange_horizon/","157 products in account","A game so nice, I bought it twice (don't mind the time played). One of the most fun shoot-'em-ups I've found on any platform. The fundamentals are rock solid, and their apparent simplicity will test you in surprisingly varied ways. Steam has a lot of shmups to offer, and you might wonder why to bother with this one... I'll try to spell it out below.\n\nThis game dispenses with novel mechanics and focuses on fun gameplay, level designs, and interesting challenges. It's got oldschool genes in it, but doesn't pigeonhole itself into being retro. It's neither horizontal nor vertical, but requires you to move and shoot omnidirectionally in every level. Horizontal scrollers tend to have a lot of environmental hazards, while verticals tend to have bullets flying everywhere... this has both!\n\nEvery level has unique situations to deal with, and even a veteran player will have to master them individually. Losing your powerups isn't the death sentence it can be in other shmups, because they aren't key to an easy victory - no screen-filling death lasers here to make you a sloppy pilot. There are enough powerups to mix things up, but they're random. It's a game of skill, not memorization.\n\nDifficulty and pacing are outstanding. The curve is fair, practicing produces noticeable improvements every time, and when you accomplish something, you feel the glory. But it's also a game easily picked up and put down by the casual player. You're not stuck playing the same levels in the same order, and don't have to beat every previous level for another shot at one you've unlocked. Levels are like Starfox - 3 difficulty paths you can travel between as you meet requirements. All of this together makes a game well-suited for casuals, hardcore shmup fans, and anything in between. You'll always have something to work toward that isn't TOO far away.\n\nScoregasm is in my personal top 10 for shmups, and is my pick for best twin-stick game on the PC. Though made with the X360 controller in mind (I think), any Dual Shock works fantastically with it. If you like shoot-'em-ups, I can't imagine not liking this, unless you have some very specific preferences for your games.","July 1, 2014","true","1.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

As opposed to your standard scrolling SHMUP game, this follows cloer to the gameplay style of Geometry wars in facing waves of enemies. The difference here is while Geometry Wars is a endless wave SHMUP game, in Scoregasm each of the levels is with a set wave of enemies and attacks. But the gameplay is fast paced and action heavy, and it's really fun to play. I can't say that I found anything negative abou the game and for $5 it's not a bad price. This is a game I'd definitley recommend for anyone looking for some action heavy shooting, and is really fun.\n\nIf you'd like to see the gamplay in action, I did a let's play on this game https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ehz6VVN7Mk","July 1, 2015","true","0.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

I'm no twin-stick guru, but the real challenge in the game comes from the "Challenges" you can unlock by meeting certain requirements. Even the first Challenge is really quite crazily hard, and that alone does extend the lifetime of the game significantly. This game is probably best buying it only on special, because you might well get bored fast, but if you like twin-stick shooters I do believe it does justify paying full price.","July 12, 2012","true","0.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

OK\n\nThis is a fairly basic dual stick style arcade shooter with mediocre sound, mediocre music, basic graphics and yet, is somewhat fun (for short periods of time) and quite challenging.
