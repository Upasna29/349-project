Each game has a similar art style and each game is a dungeon crawler and that is where the similarities end. It's not my intention to write a side by side comparison of the two games as I believe that EACH offers a unique and fun experience and yes, Virginia, there IS room for more than one game.\n\nCard Dungeon is a very cool mashup of a roguelike, a card game, and a boardgame and it gets it all right. There's no deep lore here folks; go play Pillars of Eternity or Dwarf Fortress for that. This is an unabashedly fun dungeon crawler that at least in spirit feels a bit like the physical D&D big box games like Wrath of Ashardalon, Castle Ravenloft, and The Legend of Drizzt and a bit of the sadism of Dungeonquest (permadeath) thrown into the mix.\n\nCharacter creation is limited by design at the beginning of the game. You are a crusader and you have only one positive trait and one negative trait available. The rest are locked. I'll assume that you've played dungeon crawlers and/or roguelikes. Combat is executed by using cards that you'll find in the randomized dungeons. Like Magic the Gathering, there are thousands of cards and there are varying rarities of cards. You can have three cards at any one time but these cards have only a limited number of uses so plan wisely. Additionally, when you discover new cards, you need to decide whether to take that card or not. You cannot "save" it for later. This allows for some very compelling strategic and tactical considerations as you progress.\n\nYou'll find gold to spend and monsters a plenty to kill. In a cool twist however, you can choose not to kill the wildlife but just go after monsters. I like this touch a lot as I prefer to leave bats alone and fight nasties.\n\nThe game's tutorial is interactive and the controls are intuitive.  While this game began life as a non-PC product, it's clear that the developers put a lot of love into this and it feels like a PC game from the ground up.\n\nDon't expect "grimdark." This game doesn't take itself too seriously but that doesn't mean it won't try to kill you. It will because after all, the mission of a roguelike is to kill you in wonderfully creative ways. I imagine that this game will eat up a lot of hours with the randomization of dungeons plus the discovery of thousands of cards.\n\nThis game is an example of Greenlight done right. The game is very stable and VERY addicting. I will still play Card Hunter because despite superficial similarities, the games ARE different. As of this review, Card Dungeon is $8.99 until June 9th. It's a steal for the amount of fun this seems to promise.\n\nHIGHLY recommended for fans of dungeon crawlers!\n\nEDIT: Someone in this game's community hub actually asked if this game was "religious" because the character is a crusader. It's not and I can vouch that I have never seen it at church. ;)","June 2, 2015","true","2.2"," 48 of 57 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","48","57","3","6"

If you don't have a damage card, you aren't going to be able to damage anything around you.\n\n2)  This can happen very easily.  Cards wear out - QUICKLY, and you only have 3 of them.  If you encounter a 15 health boss, and his two minions with 5 health each, your 2 damage attack is not going to keep you alive.  Running away at 1 square per turn is tedious and annoying.\n\n3)  This could have been a great squad tactics game.  A party of adventurers delving through a card-based dungeon would have been a lot of fun, but they went the relatively lazy route of single-adventurer... pretty much what everybody else is doing.","June 3, 2015","false","1.4"," 44 of 64 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","44","64","3","3"

The enemies don't get much stronger and only slightly "bullet spongy".\n\nImprovements could be made regarding to controls and UI but for the most part it works. Only the scrolling is complete bullocks right now: scrolling with the mouse stops when your invisible cursor hits the edge of the screen (I guess), and scrolling with keyboard (WASD) means if you release them it will instantly snap back to your character - which posed some serious problems when trying to look at monster hitpoints.\n\nCard variety feels also a bit limited due to overlapping and certain subsets I never felt inclined to use, like push/pull, trap removal, walls, shields, control, summon - even heals I never used again after the card I started with wore out. In my playthrough it came down to this finger of god thingy (a ranged massive single target damage spell), an AOE like heat wave and a fire/lava tile spell of some description. With repairs I could sustain my favourite combo pretty much over the 2nd half of the game, rarely having to trade any of them in for something else.\nAt the end of a run you can unlock some trait cards to change the starting conditions of your game or give yourself a serious disadvantage, but even so, I don't feel the urge to play it again.\n\nIt's OK but not more (yet).\n","June 3, 2015","true","6.5"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","3"

Using the different combinations of card is fun, and all the runs can feel reasonably different. Luck plays a reasonable part however, which feels like it could be tweaked over the long haul to help give the game life. However, the major problem doesn't come from the game itself, but the platform it's on. The game is a mobile port that's asking for 3 times the price of the port in question, and the major problem underlying that is the lack of value added in the port. Seemingly upgraded graphics help a little bit, but little attention has been paid to keyboard options that would have been perfect for the games long hallways and possible backtracking, and broken options such as the sound volume not saving, or menus that disappear when you alt tab. And with no real benefits to recommend it over the mobile port besides some upgrade graphics, I honestly can't recommend it on Steam. Go check it out on the android store.\n\nGameplay and Video First Impressions: https://youtu.be/ruu1jJtyxMI\n\n+:\nGives a Board Game Like Feel similar to Card Hunter. Visuals for the most part do the job in that case.\nVariety in attack cards help vary things up from dungeon to dungeon.\nReplayability is definitely high with unlockables and addictive nature of the game.\nReasonable performance for a mobile port.\n-:\nFeels like the card degradation mechanic needs a tweak of some sort, as lack of idea of when a card truly will die can be problematic.\nFeels like at times the game needs to explain itself a little more.\nLack of ability to fast track movement leads to repeated movement and waste of time that could have been avoided.\nGame can feel like luck isn't working in your favor,  and that a bad run of luck will doom you, more then other roguelikes of the genre, IMO.\nPoor use of the PC and it's available feature set, not taking natural advantage of having a keyboard when it would be appropriate.\nBugs regarding lack of sound settings saving as well as menus disappearing on ALT+TAB.","June 4, 2015","false","3.2"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","19","25","2","1"

Now, I have no interest in which of these products is the chicken and which is the egg, and am merely pleased to announce that these two games have at least as much NOT in common as they have, well, in common!\n\nThe main differences which I can readily deduce, having not played an ENORMOUS amount of either, are (drum roll, please):  In Card Hunter, you play a party of adventurers, while in this one your Crusader crusades alone; the gameplay of Card Hunter is mainly comprised of a series of stand-alone combat scenarios, with some prose in-between to tell the "story", while in this one you actually move around and actively "explore" a dungeon; and last, but certainly not least for many of you cheap-skates out there, Card Hunter is FREE while this one costs money.\n\nMe, I don't care too much about such petty issues - I'm the direct descendant of noble birth, my family has been burning and beheading the less privaleged for centuries now, so I've NO end of riches to burn - but for you plebs who can't afford ten dollar games, even when they're 75-90% off, I guess I'm obliged to help you with the oh-so-hard decision of whether to buy this game (or fork out for, I dunno, a pack of chewing gum or something instead).\n\nMy advice for now would be this:  Try out Card Hunter first, since it poses no such overwhelming financial dilemmas, and if you enjoy that, well...this one may well be worth a purchase also, especially if your biggest disappointment with the free game in question is that you don't get to actually WALK AROUND A DUNGEON.  This one possibly also has the slightly less condescending sense of humour - Card Hunter is a nudge-nudge, wink-wink "nerd"-fest of the highest order - but on the whole, they're both pretty self-deprecating, both pretty "zany", both reasonably fun, and both have, er...cards (in "virtual"/digital form, of course).  Personally, I like 'em both about equally thus far; which is to say, quite a bit, but not to the extent that I want any of the developers to bear my first-born children.  After all, I'm really not sure they're worthy of my noble seed...\n\nWith no further ado, I endow this game with PRECISELY the same recommendation and rating which I gave it's semi-namesake, which would look a bit like...wait for it...\n\nVerdict: 8/10.\n\n(My work here is done.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off for a spot of peasant-hunting.  No, not "pheasant"-hunting.  PEASANT-HUNTING.  Someone has to keep their numbers down.

A 3 card limit will force you to make tough decisions when choosing which card(s) to take or keep. Cards can decay as you use them, giving them limited uses before they break!\n\n\nDISLIKES!\n\n- Panning camera does not stick, automatically snapping camera back to your character after you pan (an option to toggle this would be nice).\n- Mana/Health indicators only show on one side of hero/enemies, forcing you to always spin the camera around to see them.\n- Camera rotation controls can be a bit tricky\n\nBonus: Cards have cute humour and some fun movie/game references sprinkled as flavoured text. Enemies shout out funny sayings in comic style speech bubbles that will make you chuckle.\n\nCard Dungeon was a very pleasant surprise.

For all the reasons mentioned in the other reviews, it looks to be a very enjoyable game ... except for one minor detail: yes, the random card drops.\n\nMy first game went reasonably well for it being my first game. I had a very cunning plan of having one attack card, one heal card and one card for handy effects. In the third dungeon however, my attack card ran out of attacks, didn't find any new attack card, ran around opening things, didn't find anything, died slowly.\n\nMy second game I decided to go with two attack cards and one for other effects. Ran into the boss-fight in the second room, explored a bit further in the hope of finding at least one fresh attack card ... found nothing. Teleported to the second dungeon, soon ran out of attacks, life quickly followed.\n\nMy third game I decided to ignore any card that didn't do damage, unless I had an open slot. Still ran out of attacks before I could complete the first dungeon ... got to teleport around the rooms a lot before I ran out of mana and life again.\n\nI'm not sure if I want to start a fourth game.\n\nI'm fine with having random elements in a game, but this kinda feels like the whole result is decided by which random carddrops I get, any decisions I make in game are just for show.\n\nApart from that it still looks very nice though.","July 5, 2015","false","4.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

You will have to constantly change your strategy as cards that you grow dependent upon, dwindle and fade. With very few ways to revive cards in the game, this leads to some dynamic moments of card combinations. Now don't let the cute, board game graphics fool you this is still at heart, a Roguelike. There will be random traps, monsters, treasure and more. Sometimes the odds will stacked against you and sometimes it will be a cake walk, I find that the latter is mostly true. Card Dungeon isn't the worlds most difficult game, however it still manages to be challenging enough. The major caveat about Card Dungeon is that it is a mobile port, meaning that while there is no microtransactions, you are paying for the convenience of playing this on your PC. The graphics are updated but the gameplay is the same. There is also some minor tidbits like repetitive gameplay, graphical bugs, and UI complaints, but its nothing that truly holds the game back, they are just minor annoyances. Card Dungeon is different enough that it is worth a look. The gameplay can be quite rather addictive and if your looking for a lighter casual Roguelike experience, with a D&D board game flair, Card Dungeon is a fine choice.\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/WLDaHWiOqTU\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","June 27, 2015","true","2.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Symce/recommended/361130/","Symce","Symce","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Symce/","238 products in account","I'll just start with describing the game a little and listing the cons and pros.\n\nIt's a dungeon crawling game with 3 levels to each dungeon. There isn't really any customisation at the start, nor are there any tutorials, and it's not really needed either. The game is very accesible from the get go.\n\nYou get to pick a Positive and a Negative trait at the start of a new game (at first you'll only have the choice of one of each, but you pick up random knowledge gems that unlock more traits in the dungeons)\n\nYou also start with 3 cards that you can use against foes (or to give beneficial effects to yourself) These cards wear out however. At first a small crack appears, that gets bigger and eventually it breaks completely. There are various qualities of cards. The lowest one is poor, which means it breaks down fairly quickly. Higher qualities become more common the further you get in the dungeons.\n\nIn theory it's a very small game with not that many tools to your disposal. Since you only get 3 cards you can keep, when you pick up a new one you have to decide whether it's worth it or not. If not, it gets discarded. Sometimes you come across equipment that can help you become more durable, evade more hits, etc.\n\nThere's no save feature and I'm not sure yet if there's much replayability when you finish the last dungeon. I'll list some pros and cons.\n\n\nPros:\n\n1: Actually more tactical than you'd think. There's various ways to handle a new room. Use a minion, or a clone of yourself. Or pop a card that causes blood to spray everywhere and lure in a shark.\n\n2: Easy to learn/play.\n\n3: The price is just right imo.\n\n4: Decent soundtrack\n\n5: Can be played in small intervals, since progress gets saved automatically. This also means when you make a mistake you'll pay for it.\n\n\nCons:\n\n1: Does get repetitive at times. It's basically kill, loot, repeat. But then this something of a rogue-like, so that's to be expected.\n\n2: Lack of customisation. Honestly the only thing you can do at the start is pick traits.\n\n3: Game seems small, I think I'm 3 hrs in and unlocked over half the dungeons so far.\n\n4: Correct me if I'm wrong but seems there's no difficulty settings that I could find?\n\n\nI'd still recommend the game if rogue-likes are your thing, just don't expect a ton of depth or fiddling around with stats and such. But for this price I'd certainly grab it.","June 3, 2015","true","8.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

At one stage I didn’t even cast a single spell for the full three levels and managed to kill almost all. The game was a yawn difficulty wise (due to flaws and balancing issues) and I mostly played to the end to see if it got harder eventually with the last level, and also because I didn’t want to hear someone object “just wait to the last levels – THEY are hard!”. I am sure the game IS hard if you play it intuitively, which I did the first couple of tries. But feel free to read on and hear what happened next.\n\nAt the beginning I opted for melee cards and summon cards. Then I found a card where my lord simply squishes an opponent. Now… why would I want a card that does 3,4,5 damage when there is one card simply killing the opponent in one draw? It doesn’t make sense! But then again, this card is actually pointless as well. The best card seems to be the card where you create 3X3 square of fire, causing damage to everyone there, and then damage each round (3+ dependent on quality). This was the only card I needed for the entire game. No need to switch. Ever.\n\nI was suspicious when I saw the game play of only three cards. That usually calls for super optimizing with no use for 99% of the cards. How did the developers plan to handle this? By deteriorating the cards as they are used. So was I forced to change cards because of this? No. As there is a refresh altar at each level that fixes your cards? But can you really go through with only three cards without them being exhausted? Well, not if you pick bad cards. That is the strange dynamic here. If you use bad cards you probably need to shift them during the level as they wear out from being so ineffective. But if you choose great cards, not only do you win each fight easily, they don’t wear out as quickly as you just need to use them a few times. A typical double effect that unbalanced the whole system.\n\nOk. So why are the area spells so effective? Well, to start with it’s a no brainer because of the limited number of uses of each card. You need to super optimize to take out several opponents at once. This is easily done with area spells in this game because it seems the developers didn’t really play test their game. You may think I am rude now, but honestly… if you don’t play test your game… I don’t know what to say. Ok, any developer can let a few flaws pass, and AI is difficult, but here me out. This isn’t about the monsters having to be supersmart. I just think it would be a good idea for them to avoid squares that are set on fire, full with poison, cursed or whatever – when they can just take the square beside it. Or just wait the spell out. It’s not like the monsters are in a hurry.\n\nBut it gets worse. Not only are the monsters so dumb that they step into every trap, and area spell lingering that exists, and multiple times. The same square. But they are not immune their own area spells. You heard me! It’s not only that they may spit poison or fire and be susceptible to poison of fire… they are susceptible to THEIR OWN area attack! This is what made me go through three levels of gelatinous cubes and just see them kill each other with there are spells. And a single cube would kill himself as well. All you have to do is open the door and see them kill themselves. This is impossible to miss when testing regardless of whether you realize the massive unbalance towards the area spells of the character and the Artificial stupidity of monsters when it comes to area spells.\n\nBut there is more. You have three cards. You can choose to have cards to kill opponents or cards that heal you and hope for healing potions as loot. You can also choose an advantage that heal you now and then. Or… you can also find a headband that heals hp and mana EVERY TURN. You heard me. Every turn. And there is no food in the game so time is on your side. So all spells, potions (as they cannot be stored and used at convenience anyway) that heal are more or less pointless. Even if one misses the obvious choice to buy HP from the merchant and never mana… you would still heal upto 7 hp a turn. It’s very hard for the monsters to match that. Most levels I just hit space and waited for the monsters around me to walk on a trap or get hit by their own area attacks. But when I got bored I put an area attack spell (which is lingering) in action myself and watch them quickly die.\n\nThis is the reason the game gets a thumb down. I have no problem with minor UI flaws and movement glitches and what not. But I hate sloppy game play and lack of balancing testing. For me to easy obtain tools to bypass the intended gameplay (cards being deteriorating) and the idea of switching cards and then to never face a challenge in the game again is too bad developing. I can still for the world understand how they could believe that the single attack cards or even cards that do no damage would be of any use whatsoever.\n\nGames isn’t about optimizing, it’s about having fun. But the games should provide a challenge to force you to adapt strategies and discover the game from different angles. When strategic choices are no-brainers and you can choose to only play with one of all the available card and crush all opposition. When an entire level commit collective suicide because they die from their own attacks, when the entire spectra of advantages and disadvantages becomes redundant. That is bad, if not sloppy, development.\n\nToo bad, as there are many interesting thoughts from the developers. And I am sure they did their best. They just seem to lack the ability to understand the consequences of their ideas and/or not understanding that the product need to be play tested. When flaws are found you need to tweak or rethink. But of course, not doing proper testing is one way of avoiding unnecessary (?) work.","July 15, 2015","false","13.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Easily worth $9 imho. Love the art and there is defintiely some strategy as you need to think before passing up cards. Some don't like the deterioration of the cards as you use them, but I think it's a neat way to show wear and when you are getting close to losing it. I don't want the game to tell me everything up front. Very addictive game! Can't wait to see what else they add!","June 6, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fun little game that encourages exploration and seeing everything. You have three cards you can choose from during your turn, and overusing a card will cause it to break. It's a great little mechanic that keeps you from grabbing one overpowered card and just using it the whole time.\n\nIn addition, you get equipment cards to raise defense, and you have traits that will work for and against you. Unlocking them requires gems, which you obtain from exploring.\n\nOverall, really fun little game, and certainly worth the price.","June 6, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then there are times that I got a little too arrogant and got killed for it! lol  Good times! lol\n\nCard Dungeon is a fun and at times, very strategic game!  It plays just like it looks, but even better! lol  It feels like playing a Dungeon & Dragons board game alone with a hidden DM (who has a slight vendetta against you!) lol  So what if the DM wants to kill you a little bit… :-)\n\nThere are tons of cards to unlock and tons of choices to make!  Lightning or Fireballs?  Area effect or single target?  It's not hard to play, but levels are randomly generated, so sometimes you'll fight a mini-boss way before you're ready!  In that case just…  RUN AWAY!!!! lol\n\nBattles are satisfying and rewarding!  It's a fun romp every time with loads of replay value!  It  deserves many KUDOS!  Even when you die, which I must admit, most of my deaths were my fault, it's still fun to play, over & over again!\n\nIn conclusion, Card Dungeon is a seriously awesome, rogue-like, dungeon crawling board game!!!  A lot of love and dedication went into the making of this game and it shows!  I highly recommend this game to anyone that remotely likes rogue-like and/or D&D type board games!  It's got a great look and awesome, addicting gameplay!  It's calling you! ;-)  It won't leave the back of your mind unless you buy it and play it.  Beware, gameplay is addicting and can lead to insomnia!\n\nHere are my iMac system specifications: Apple iMac 27", i5 Quad-Core Intel processor 3.1GHZ, AMD Radeon HD 6970M with 1GB dedicated video RAM, 4GB system RAM, 1TB hard drive running OS X version 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard), Journaled HFS+ Extended file system, Logitech optical USB mouse.","June 4, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

The art style is very interesting and creative.\n\nGameplay is very fun and addictive. I like how the game only allows you to equip three main cards at a time. This provides an additional layer of strategy. You'll need to make sure you have cards that allow you to attack your enemies. If you run out of attacks you'll be in a world of trouble. So always having some kind of attack is required. There are attacks with weapons like swords and knives as well as spells you can cast. Spells range from lightning bolts to lava. you can also get cards that allow items to be thrown to cause damage such as bottles of acid.\n\nLike any other RPG you'll find treasure and equipment by opening chests or defeating enemies. Equipment like armor will increasre your defenses.\n\nThis game is also a rogue-like which means you get once shot to complete your adventure. If you are killed by monsters or spells in the dungeon it's game over and you'll lose everything. this adds a level of challenge to the game.\n\nOverall Card Dungeon is incredibly fun and is a good pick up and play game. Highly recommended if you enjoy rogue-likes and card games.","June 4, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

In fact I was enjoying myself despite having to wait forever each time for my turn again.  Until I realized only three cards, and rarely having attack cards which you need drop is a bad thing.  Aka round 1-2.  It's not fun if you can't attack and kill everything.  I mean yeah let them gain up on me give me a good chance to die, that I don't mind.  Being cornered where I can't even hit back and am stuck just sitting there or quitting.  That tends to ruin a good game.  It's kind of heart breaking really I was hoping for a semi relaxing yet still make you think game.  Maybe after a few touch ups?  But for now I can't seem to recommend it.","February 12","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
