You play as Sleet, after a few puzzles you meet up with another robot Ai Floe. So far the story has been great, dialog is fun and keeps at least myself interested in more of the character's interactions.\n\nPuzzles consist of a lot of smaller things, exploring is a big part of each puzzle area in fact.\n\nPuzzles can range from having X buttons pressed, to Less than X press, or More than X pressed. To finding Y object to put within a machine. Some puzzles are small math tests where you do things like use weights that are between 100 xxx 1000. They use this in other places, even with fire, and electricity.\n\nAs you progress you get deployables. These are miniture devices you can toss out about 12 or so before they start imploding. These range from saw blades, lasers that rotate, fires, tesla probe. To things with A. to B. icons (haven't used everything yet.)\n\nAlong side normal puzzles you have (actually forgot the name) combat rooms. These have puzzles in them, but to get access to them you have to kill enemy bots and gain money to open more of the stage.\n\nThe third type of puzzle room I have witnessed is a sort of escort mission, you have a timer, and a device that moves while near it. You have to figure the whole thing out while staying close to the device to keep it moving.\n\nOver all, movement is very fun and insanely fluid. Decent enough settings. Even a 00:00 - 24:00 day light system you get to play with in the settings, want it pitch black set it to midnight. Want a bright day? Set it too noon.\n\nLike I said in my short review. Only major complaint so far is that while it has controller support you can not invert the Y axis at all. (yet, dev already comment saying it would be in the next patch or so)\n\nMy experience so far, well worth 40 bucks and I just scratched the surface.\n\nAnother thing I forgot to note here. EVERY stage has a way point race on it. Even the combat, and payload missions!","March 1","true","28.8"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","1"
