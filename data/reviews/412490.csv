If you see a few mis-spelled words or things out of context just drop them a message on the steam forums.\n\nUnlike traditional tower defense games, this one has a large world map filled with small skirmishes however each skirmish map is fought over and if you lose, you lose that part of the map until you conqeur it back again. I like the concept because your towers are persistant, so once your killing engine is in place you can then plant future turrets for future wars! This rewards forward thinking and also makes you think; "do I place a tower to deal with this problem here and now or do I plant a better turret for future battles?".\n\nThis is a regular tower defense game with a few puzzle defense stages thrown in as optional extras. A nice compromise and it shows a real love for tower defense games in general to include both types.\n\nYou can also gain the ability to upgrade towers (its complicated) but once you gain the ability, you can freely switch it around so I would re-enter a stage and upgrade tower type 1, leave, come back and upgrade tower type 2. A nice touch.\n\nThe game is overall okay, nothing offended me but a lot of things bothered me.\n\nYou get access to 4 skill trees however everything in all 4 trees unlock at exactly the same time and you are free to delve into all the trees at once. This makes it seem pointless, to seperate the trees and makes the gating system very apparent. What would have been better, would be if each tree had different unlocking tiers so I had more to look forward too as opposed to just grinding out till the next milestone.\n\nYou also never lose territory. I mean you can and will if you play the game the way its meant to be played but you can just alt-f4 out of a lost battle and poof, you are free to lose as much as you want. It kind of defeats the purpose in my opinion and you can also quit a losing battle and reload your save game from the regular in game menu anyway. I don't feel like I am struggling against the forces of good, because I am free to cheat my ♥♥♥ off anyway.\n\nOkay, you got me, I hear what you are saying, its my own fault if I cheat right? Well remember those gated skill trees? You need to own so much territory to unlock more skills and the skills are, you guessed it, more and better towers. So losing territory is really a set back both in terms of the games narrative but also you as the player. You get nothing new to look forward too until you hit x territories so if you lose even 1, it may have a chain reaction as you lose all the connecting islands too and you are right back to winning them all back with nothing new or interesting going on in the meantime. To put it a simpler way, lets take Sonic the Hedgehog. Lets say you die in scrapbrain zone and that sends you back to greenhill zone act 2. Its needlessly annoying, oh and we take away any chaos emeralds you found beyond greenhill zone as well.\n\nOther niggles with the game come from balance. A lot of the early towers are really quite pants and you are stuck with them for longer than you would probably like. While you wait for the more exciting towers you try using the not so good towers in different ways but nothing changes the fact that they just suck. Enemies move fast, even the slowest of the slow monsters still move fast so when you have a tower that attacks every 10 seconds and a large, high HP monster whom only gets hit by that tower twice, well you lean towards faster attacking towers, naturally.\n\nThe game does limit where you can place towers so it is closer to a puzzle defense game but most of the early towers feel so rubbish that I just used the two towers you start the game with in addition to the starting spell up till about tier 3. Not even the slowdown tower was worthwhile because it only slowed 1 target at a time and even worse, the slowdown wears off! And even worse still upgrading the tower increases the enemy slowdown, naturally, but it also increases the refire rate so upgrading the tower makes it worse not better!\n\nThe same can be said for most of the later towers as well because anything that hits slower than 5 seconds will only hit a mob once and I have limited space for these towers anyway so it's not efficient to use anything slow.\nThere is a spell that makes a tower shoot faster...But it has a cooldown on it because of course it does. Make it a passive and a lot of the towers would become viable.\n\nOverall I'd like to sit down with the dev team and tweak the towers, make autosave either happen during the game or as soon as a fight starts with a 'you lost' flag on it until you win and the flag changes and rejiggle the skill tree and then i'll be happy.\n\nEverything else with the game is fine and I have no complaints and the presentation is pretty top notch on this one.\nIf you love tower defense games, I actually find it harder to recommend this game since it will drive you up the wall, however if you are new to tower defense games then this one is okay.\n\nI also found it a nice touch that you can kill the wildlife for money. Oh thats right, we play as the bad guy in this game and whilst it does the cliche thing of 'we are bad so we do bad things, of course' I liked the fact that they allow us to freely kill wildlife with no prompt or encouragement and that it can be beneficial to do so as well. A good example of meta-storytelling.\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","March 4","true","5.9"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","14","15","2","0"

The graphics and the interface is extremely clunky - there are places where the graphics are too dark and you can't see.  There are also places where you're playing pixel hunt with a moving target.  Having to calibrate the mouse is a touch aggravating.\n\nI liked the gameplay - I'm a sucker for tower defense, and I like the idea of the persistent board which makes it easier to revisit levels in case they were lost.  The concept that you're playing the evil one is pretty nifty, as well.  I'll give it another shot in a few days.\n\nSo, I'm torn on recommendation.","March 2","false","0.8"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","1"

I never heard of it before and it had no ratings so it was a bit of risk. I've played it for about half an hour and it seems like its going to be a nice little time killer game. The upgrade system is decent, the story is fine (for a tower defense), and it seems like it requires a nice bit of strategy to play without being overly complicated. The UI is just a little clunky and they throw a lot if tutorial information at you right away, but that's not too big a deal. Nice little tower defense game.","March 2","true","1.1"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","0"

(From what I gather you play as the pirate who's possesed by a demon who's corrupting trees, and you are defending the trees from goblins who are trying to stop the demon)\n\nOverall I'd say this is a great Tower Defense if you are willing to forgive a few minor  issues.","March 2","true","6.2"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","0"

I have to say that I really liked this mechanic since it really makes you feel like you are becoming more powerful in the game. As you gain control over more areas you get more abilities and can build more towers. This works well with the story of you playing as the bad guy that is trying to take over the world. While the game starts off a little slow, it started to grow on me as I built up my empire and became more powerful.\n\nThe biggest problem I had with the game is that other than the area control element, Yrminsul plays like every other tower defense game. If you like tower defenses you will probably like this but if you don't care for the genre you probably won't like Yrminsul.\n\nThe other problem I had with the game is that at times there are some areas that I wish were a little more polished. The first couple days I played the game, some of my saved games disappeared for some unknown reason. This problem seems to have corrected itself when I last played the game though. It is also way too hard to click on the small and fast enemies which is important for a lot of the special abilities in the game. Finally I don't think the game gives you enough time to collect the infamy dropped from enemies.\n\nIf you like tower defense games I think you will enjoy Yrminsul. It is not the best tower defense game I have ever played but I still had fun with the game.\n\nNote: I received a review copy of the game from the developer but received no other compensation for this review.\n\nRead My Full Review[www.geekyhobbies.com]","March 4","true","9.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

One flaw is that it's difficult to see what exactly you're doing when trying to kill enemies. The game is like Sanctum and Orcs Must Die in that it forces you to not only build towers but also use more "direct" powers to attack enemies. Problem is, targeting the enemies with your lightning bolt is tricky, because they are small and you cannot zoom in!\n\nThere are parts of the game that seem promising and I hope some changes are made to the interface and such. Tower defence games are *almost* the only games I enjoy, and I've already played a lot of the good ones out there... which is why I'm still giving games like this one a chance. Recommended for other people like me who are desperate enough to tinker with a somewhat-promising game that currently feels frustrating.\n\nIf you hate mandatory coin-collecting with the mouse, this game's not for you.","March 5","false","1.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","3"

That said this game blew my mind.\n\n*GAMEPLAY (8/10):\n\nBasic tower defence gameplay upgraded with skill tries, corrupt/defend and random events.         (can get repetitive)\n\n*GRAPHICS (9/10):\n\nModels and art style is what made me want to try this game. It's just so colorfull, and that's a lot to say for tower defence game which are usually plane looking.  (beautiful)\n\n*SOUND (8/10):\n\nMusic and sound effects are appealing. They go along gameplay so well sometimes you don't even notice them. But if you turn sound off you'll see a big difference (tried).\n\n*PHYSICS (9/10):\n\nPhysics are what makes this game so good. Difference in enemy healt, speed and effect and your towers and powers are what makes this game so good. Good placement and cordination are key to victory. But game uses enemy placements good too so it can get challenging very fast. (easy to understand, hard to master)\n\n*STORY(10/10):\n\nIn my opinion story is best thing this game has to offer. It's given to you via a comic book that you unlock as you progress. Skiped a part you didn't want to? Don't worry you can replay it in menu again and again. It's kinda childish but really creative and different, also it has some psychological values.\n\n*CONTENT/PRICE (9/10):\n\nMap in huge and there are a lot of events that can happen at any given time. There are skill tries to upgrade and seeds to collect. You will face many different enemies including boss fights. I guess it has around 20-100 hours of gameplay.\n\n***OVERALL SCORE: 9/10\n\nRecomendation:\nOverall this is a great game I recommend to everyone who likes tower defence. If you don't like them but still buy this game it will surprise you. And if nothing else if you're bored and are looking for something different look no further.\n\nKey was given by developer for review.","March 5","true","2.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

But to be honest, this really feels more of a "practice project" than anything that should legitimately be on Steam for 7 bucks.\n\nThe game feels kinda sluggish and slow, and I don't find myself as comfortable with it as with most tower defense games control-wise. The graphics are a weird mix between a Flash game (mostly in the menus and interface) and something like Rayman 2 (The original PC Release), devoid of dynamism and far less appealing visually. The gameplay itself is nothing that creative or appealing. The 2D graphics are neat, however !\nI found that it was a bit of a shame that, with such a focus on the "story" part of the game (there's a big emphasis on the movie clips and such), there wasn't much more effort put into the actual story, character design and storytelling parts of the game, which, wether it be through the dialogue or plot, are...rather shallow. The kind you usually quickly give up on and find yourself skipping through to get to the action.\n\nAnother thing that was a big turn down was how...uninished the game felt. It crashed the three first times I tried to open it and I never managed to get the resolution and screen width to match despite my best efforts, and it doesn't run...so well anyway despite my computer handling more requiring games perfectly fine. The aforementioned "Flash game" menus and how it took me multiple attempts to simply rebound my keys validated the impression that I shouldn't have paid money to access this.\n\nIf this is the first (or one of) game you guys made, then...great job, it's actually good for a first try. But in my opinion, something so...low-quality (to be charitable) shouldn't be showcased on Steam for 7 bucks when you can find much, much better and more enjoyable, dynamic and functional Tower Defense games for free online on whatever flash site. What felt the most disappointing to me was that the artwork for the game looked really amazing and fun, and what I ended-up with was outdated, sluggish, and, honestly, ugly and uncreative 3D for a tasteless gameplay.\n\nYou guys have all the ingredients to make great games (kudos again to the 2D artist, since their awesome art is actually what decided me to buy the game) but this just felt like there wasn't enough effort and creativity put into it. In addition, the gorgeous artwork being anecdotical in the ACTUAL gameplay (and having "Ew 3D" instead) kinda felt like a scam, though I'll give you the benefit of the doubt on this not being intentional.\n\nI hope you'll find this criticism to be constructive, apologies if it happens to sound angry or salty ! I do hope to see the aforementioned possible improvements in your future games if there happens to be !","March 3","false","0.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","16"
