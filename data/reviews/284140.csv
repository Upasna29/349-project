Technically speaking, the graphics look like something that would be home on a tablet rather than your desktop PC.\n\nIf you can look past these issues, the game has a lot to offer. The focus on stealth is refreshing. The writing is solid, giving you just enough information to keep you interested, while also keeping you (mostly) in the dark. The references to real world conspiracies and plots are well done, presuming you are at least familiar with the subject material.\n\nThe atmosphere is arguably the strong point of Majestic Nights. Stylistically, the visuals are bright and bold and oozing with 80s flair. The soundtrack is phenomenal.\n\nThe season pass offers pretty good value. The soundtrack is probably worth the $20 alone. There is also a Pen and Paper RPG on the way, which is not something you see offered everyday.\n\nIt's not a game for everyone, but it certainly has its merits.","November 6, 2014","true","2.0"," 65 of 78 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","65","78","4","1"

Cardholder and private investigator Callie (Cal) are knee-deep in weird.\n\nDespite appearances, gameplay is more like a real-time Shadowrun Returns than Hotline Miami. Combat is pretty primitive and mostly consists of sneaking, stealth, assassinations, and brief moments where you clear out several baddies at a time by exploiting their primitive AI to lead them right around a corner and straight into your waiting assault rifle.\n\nThings are a bit buggy and/or kludgy, but hopefully that'll get ironed out as the series progresses through the rest of its episodes. The cool story hook and awesome music were enough to get me in on a season pass.","January 2, 2015","true","6.4"," 32 of 40 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","32","40","4","0"

The Suit has tasked you with tracking down Cardholder for him.\n\nEpisode One is for all intents and purposes an extension of the prologue and plays very similarly. You'll go to different locations, gather intelligence on your target and wind up in a secret location, hot on their trail.\n\nSome of the issues i mentioned in my previous preview are much more pronounced in episode one, such as janky, aggrivating shooting mechanics and confusing plot. They do make it a chore to play the game at times, but overall things are still enjoyable.\n\nOverall I gave Episode one a 7/10. You can read my full review of Episode One here:\nhttp://criticalindiegamer.com/2014/11/majestic-knights-chapter-one-covert-genesis-review-pc/\n\nHaving just complete the Chapter Zero prologue, I'm impressed...if a little confused. ButI am sure all will make sense in due course.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEpisode Zero\n\nMajestic Nights transports you back to an alternate reality 1980s and puts you in the shoes of an enigmatic character called "Cardholder". In Chapter Zero you'll find yourself interrupting your neighbour while he is on the toilet, you'll beat up a bouncer at a nightclub, and gun down lots of secret agents.\n\nI couldn't really make sense of the story, but I think that's intentional. There's lots of talk about faked moon landings, MK Ultra, Illuminati and various other conspiracies. If you are into that kind of thing you'll have a blast.\n\nThe game plays out a bit like Shadowrun, except with realtime gun battles instead of turn based. You are given various different dialogue choices for every conversation, and you can choose to play the nice guy or be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you so please.\n\nGunplay is a little finicky but still rewarding. Holding the RMB brings up your gun with an accompanying laser sight so you can aim accurately. Clicking the LMB fires the gun. Action sequences revolve mostly around cover shooting, and you'll have to brace yourself up against something to stay out of the line of fire.\n\nWith Chapter Zero set to release for free, you might as well pick it up and give it a go. It's short at around 1 hour long, but there's lots here for fans of cover shooters, stealth games , or conspiracy theories.\n\nFor a more in- depth write up, check out my preview at:\nhttp://criticalindiegamer.com/2014/10/majestic-nights-preview-pc/","October 30, 2014","true","3.1"," 54 of 82 people (66%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","66","54","82","3","4"

It has a very similar feel and gives off that same vibe. The combat is live action, but FEELS like it should be turn based. The controls are pretty straight forward, although 360 controller users might get confused at first, particularly while using the gun(Right stick aims).\n\nThe game takes place in an alternate 80's. In this reality conspiracy theories and cover ups are all real. It's full of nostalgic references for those of us who called the decadent decade home, and is a fascinating glimpse into the 80s paranoia fueled mindset that would eventually spawn the 90's hit series X-Files.\n\nThis game is everything an RPG fan could ask for, and the only real downside is that it's taken so long for episode 2 to release.","May 29, 2015","true","2.0"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","18","19","3","1"

For my money this means Majestic Nights is darned good fun: full of good humour, fun action, great atmosphere and some fascinating over-arching conspiracy stuff to tie it all together. Makes me glad I picked up a Season Pass just in time for Episode 2. It's not without its flaws -- in particular that this engine, like SRR's, isn't super well suited to stealth mechanics -- but the fun outweighed the flaws for me by a comfortable margin.

Stealth system is quite fine, until you draw your gun and shoot your way out like Clint Eastwood or like James "Sonny" Crockett from Miami-Vice. I must say, I am a 80's lover, so I really enjoyed the game.\n\nBad things about this game? Dialog speed during cutscenes and in-game. They are going too fast to read and are disturbing. And also, game has different mission / scenarios , that you need to buy as dlc or with a season-pass , sadly I felt like I was kinda ripped-off a little bit.\n\nIf you are an indie-game lover or 80's lover like me.

Its a point&Click without really pointing and clicking. More like walking and then clicking. The music fits, the scenes look just like they should for the story line and premise. Some of the dialogue feels a little cheesy but then again, the 80's was cheesy.\n\nMy only real complaint is with the aiming system on the gun. It almost seems as if it fights you. I think they couldve done better with a free floating, mouse controller crosshair. And for some reason in the bar/club scene (Whisky) a lot of the patrons that are sittings are cut in half (torso on the floor) until I enter the area. then they correct themselves.\n\nOverall its good way to kill some time and $5. I thought it was going to be a little more action intense but thats ok. Just know that its more of an adventure/easy puzzler/story-driven game. Its also a little easier to play with a controller. So if you have one, plug it in.","October 30, 2014","true","1.7"," 34 of 54 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","34","54","0","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deandoe/recommended/284140/","deandoe","Erwin the German","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deandoe/","306 products in account","This game is a ♥♥♥♥ing mess so far. While I like the dialogue (what little there is,) the art style, and the music, the majority of this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stealth mechanics, frustrating combat, and bugginess. The AI is alternately dumb as a bag of rocks or clairvoyant - capable of shooting you through walls or thwarted easily by waiting for them to lose interest in the gun wielding, big haired assassin they just saw running past them. Your character can generally only take a few hits before dying in a ten second long slo-mo death animation (which you'll be seeing a lot if you play on hard mode - here's a hint; don't) and your enemies either go down with a single hit or as much as three bullets / katana swipes. When you die, you get to do the whole sequence over again!\n\nI was having fun with this game until the second chapter - Cardholder's story is generally a bit less actiony-shooty, although after a certain point the investigative adventure game aspect of the game is seemingly tossed out the window in favor of horrendous stealth and fighting with Cal's second chapter.\n\nIt's also buggy. The AI can often see you through walls and shoot you through them. You will get objectives you've already completed. You will see conversations that have already happened happen again. You will not be able to talk to certain characters despite their being highlighted. Enemies will somehow vanish between loading screens.\n\nWhat's good? I -sorta- like the story, though I have no ♥♥♥♥ing clue what's going on with it. You're basically thrust into the plot with absolutely zero lead up or introduction, no idea who you're playing as, what their motivations are, what's at stake, who the bad guys are... is this one of those rare games that would benefit from a narrative text dump? Yes, probably. Or, y'know, a cutscene, something to establish what's even happening.\n\nI also like the art. The dialogue is witty and very 80s, which is exactly what you should expect. Music's also fine - I have a softness for techno and electronica. To be honest, I'm disappointed so far in what I've seen. I was really looking forward to playing a game with this sort of concept, but the shortfalls in gameplay and story make it nigh intolerable right now.\n\nHowever, since Majestic Nights is coming out in installments, I imagine there's plenty of time for the developers to get their ♥♥♥♥ together and iron out the terrible aspects of this game. Hopefully.\n\nRight now, it's a waste of 20 bucks - stay the ♥♥♥♥ away from a season pass until they improve on this.","November 1, 2014","false","3.0"," 65 of 111 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","65","111","4","6"

It took about 40 minutes to complete and seeing as it was a free bonus and not a main episode, I hope the first episode of the game isn't this short. It's entertaining and clearly wants to be Hotline Miami, with a similar theme, soundtrack and visual style to HM. The gunplay was a bit ♥♥♥♥ and I felt invincible but it was exciting to kill enemies the first few times around.\nThere's multiple-choice sequences in the game in the form of speech and it really allows you to complete the missions multiple ways which I like and the writing was pretty decent and made me laugh a few times.\nI'm gonna go play Episode 1 now but Episode 0 was a 7/10.\n\nEPISODE 1 REVIEW\n\nFinished Episode 1 of Majestic Nights. It was also short, but was really fun and playing as a different character while on the search for the previous character was a cool way of twisting things around.

The smooth neon aesthetic, the synth cheese soundtrack and the gritty action dialogue of the first episode's protagonist are pure joy for anyone who is into 80's nostalgia bombs and more than make up for the little flaws in execution of the gameplay.\n\nCombat is a little bit clunky, being mainly stealth mechanics with some basic cover and shoot that doesn't leave a huge amount of room for clever tactics, but I get the feeling that the combat will never be the first focus of this series; it's all about the story, characters, dialogue choices and delightfully cheese-y 80's setting.\n\nAnyone who is into the 80's or who enjoys fun Indie projects should consider giving Majestic Nights a closer look.","January 27, 2015","true","1.3"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","0"

Also I did notice with playing the prologue there we're a lot of bugs nothing game breaking but just things such as NPC's clipping into objects such as seats and tables when ever I moved around they would change positions at times.

Now unfortunately the game has a way less intense and way more bland soundtrack, making the experience worse then it could have been. But as it is the case with many games it should be judged on its own, not compared to other games.\nIt has its own feel of the '80s', however the cars used seem to be from 50s-60s, the streets are as good as modern detroit, and its supposed to be somewhere near los angeles by the looks of it. Its minor details which dont make too much difference anyway.\nNow the gameplay isnt perfect, the shooting system is pretty bad, there are game glitches  like shooting through walls, ai having very limited behaviour and moonsliding, ignoring the corpses, bugs and gameplay errors. But none of them are fatal, every single bug can be ignored.\nFor an indie game, this is fantastic work. And for the price they are asking its decent.

I thought this game was going to be a call back to Fallout and other classic RPGs. I loved the concept and the art style to pieces. However, what it really turned out being was a buggy, underdeveloped, and repetitive mess. I don't even think that a good dab of polish could fix this. You're either talking to people (which is more simplistic than I've seen it in just about any other RPG), or you're doing cover based shooting. Hell, the only thing that seperates this from a generic cover based shooter like "Gears of War" is the vaguely isometric perspective. It's a dull and watery game wearing an older and more complex game's hat.\n\nI can only hope that the developers take this criticism to heart and improve upon their product, because I think with the right tweaks and craftsmanship this game could become really great, instead of the amateurish product it is now. The game is far from irredeemable. If the team really pulled through and made some stellar later chapters, and perhaps thoroughly patched out these ones, then I might feel like it's worth recommending. As of now however, I can not, in good faith, recommend this game.","November 2, 2014","false","1.4"," 36 of 65 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","36","65","2","5"

After you make your way through the character dialogue and gather your things, you then proceed to a stealth level where you must get your silenced pistol and access codes from your house. Stealth isn't too bad, you hide in the dark and AI have pre-determined patrol paths, pretty easy for me. Not sure why everyone else had so much trouble, though I haven't played much! These are just my first impressions.\nUpon starting this mission, I realize that this game more linear than I thought! I was disappointed to find this out, as from the screenshots and trailer, the game had large maps, and it really looked like an open world RPG in the style of the old fallout games! While playing this mission, I went to the wrong house, to find an overweight man who is supposed to be John's neighbor, being interrogated by a female police officer while he is trying to take a ♥♥♥♥.\nWhat the hell. After waiting for the officer to leave the house, I then talk to 'my' neighbor (I'm playing as John), and then say that I'm here to collect my spare house keys. Perhaps if you go through the dialogue correctly, you could obtain an item that allows you to use the back door and further avoid police officers roaming your house? I couldn't exactly find out.\nIf you walk next to two bushes (Which are very deliciously stylized btw, like Deathspank meets Borderlands and The Wolf Among Us) a mediocre scripted sequence occurs, where two officers guarding the front entrance to your house start gossiping and then leave. I hated this! I would have rather had a more dynamic event, where you can move about as they gossip and leave, instead of just waiting for a cutscene to play out. Very frustrating design choice!\nI then make it into my house, and then proceed to get my pistol and access codes, or atleast try to..\nI had to restart this mission as I was spotted and then shot to death in my house. When you restart a level, you restart from the beginning. This is terrible! Though these missions are fairly short, but still very frustrating design.\nI made it back to the inside of my house, i get my pistol and my access codes, and then I pop the 3 officers roaming my house who were looking for me and were trying to kill me, then I complete the level! This level was alright, could be much better.\n\nTo improve:\nMore emergent design: How about allowing me to distract the cops by triggering a car alarm on one of the cars parked outside my house, allowing the player time to get in and get out, and perhaps if cops are coming back into the house, the player could leave through the back door or a window you can go through, perhaps with a vaulting mechanic?\n\nStealth Kills: Choke holds and neck snapping.\n\nExtra Infiltration options: Allow me to get into my house through something like a window or a back door, or from a side door inside a garage or something, some homes have garages attached to the homes themselves with doors inside them that allow you to get into your home after exiting your car and closing the garage doors, that would have been interesting.\n\n-\nNext mission you have to make it inside of a nightclub, I kick a bouncer in the scrotum, make my way inside to ask people annoying questions, and try to avoid getting knocked out by the same bouncer I kicked in the family jewels.\nI make it to the basement floor to meet "Mystery" who then claims to know who I am, I then go through the dialogue and Mystery wants me to buy them a shirly temple from the bar, I get suckerpunched multiple times by the angered bouncer, whom I bashed in the balls with my boot. This was extremely aggrivating, I'm quite a distance away from this guy and his haymakers have ridiculous range! I also could not equip my silenced pistol and deal with this bouncer after luring the AI character to the bathroom or something to avoid making a scene, certainly no cool emergent design choices like that!\n\nTo improve:\nMore emergent design: Allow the player to lure AI (which are seeking the player and trying to kill them) into a discrete area (Like the bathroom of the nightclub) and deal with them there, either with a stealth kill or by allowing them to equip items like the silenced pistol (It is in the inventory and I can see this VERY clearly) if the player is willing to get their hands a little dirty when dealing with bad guys.\n\nExtra Infiltration options: Is there a back door to the nightclub? Maybe a window leading to the basement area or the bathroom? Maybe an airvent of some kind? That would be cool, allow me to avoid kicking a bouncer in the ballsack.\n\n-\nI had to stop playing at this point, as all this flawed design really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off, but I wouldn't say that this game is terrible, just not my cup of tea. I was hoping for more of an Open World Realtime Action RPG, but alas, it was not. I don't really know how to feel about it, I wish I could select "Maybe" instead of Yes/No, because it's not like this game is completely bad! The stealth segment was kinda fun (Same with the shooting) and I was able to choose what my favorite conspiracy theory was at the beginning of the game. (IE: Area 51, and the Kennedy Assassination are selectable dialogue choices in the introduction level, I got a kick out of this.)\n\nI would have loved a more open freeroaming action RPG game with multiple methods of approach to each objective, but unfortunately this game does not, or atleast not yet. I'll get around to playing the next chapter.","August 15, 2015","false","0.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

Combat is unwieldy and unsatisfying, while the stealth sections are astonishing in their awfulness.\n\nThe plot has the potential to be interesting but just ends up being a case of throw all conspiracy theories in a bowl, stir and hope something good comes out - but it just ends up as a mess.

I was really looking forward to it but regret buying it greatly.","August 31, 2015","false","0.3"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","6","0","0"

One could go clone some sharks and make a race game, kinda rip off existing designs and claim innovation.\n\nIf your into that kind of thing, great don't play this game. You probably won’t like it as it takes concepts and elements of political, social issues that concern our world today, not to mention situations that influence our existence as a species and ties them all together in a cocktail of entertainment.\n\nMajestic nights is the first solid attempt I have seen from an "Australian" studio that are trying to create content for serious hard-core gamers that don't have the intellectual capacity of a flee.\n\n"Look at me I'm indie man". No your not, your ♥♥♥♥ and the reason why I have to justify to overseas Developers why the country I was born in is known for the creative signature of a three year old.\n\nMajestic Nights is a cult classic with allot of personality, Deep storyline, solid level design and allot of personality. A kind of X-Files meets Hotline Miami Majestic might not be a long game but it's certainly fun and immersive.\n\nThe Art could have been a little more polished but it fits right in with the slap stick humour within the games narrative. As a bonus Majestic Nights has a fantastic soundtrack that is the key to really swinging your thing.\n\nIf you’re a Hip new age guy, Don't buy this game, grab your crayons go play with Xcode in your mums tuperwear room and call yourself a Developer.\n\nIf you’re a Hard-core gamer and Love Thick plot elements, adult concepts, Aliens with a dash of dark humour. Then grab a hold of Majestic nights.\n\n","November 2, 2014","true","53.4"," 18 of 55 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","18","55","0","11"
