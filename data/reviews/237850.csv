If you're someone that plays games principally for story and setting, then this is for you. If not, and it breaks my heart to say this, then I would avoid this as it is narrative heavy. If you've played previous Dreamfall/TLJ games then this is definitely a worthy successor. If you haven't, then this review might not be helpful for you but give it a shot anyway.\n\nLong Review: This is a difficult game to review. The first in the series, The Longest Journey, was released around fifteen years ago. The second, Dreamfall, was released eight years ago, and was riddled with cliffhangers that are only now being resolved. I honestly couldn't tell you whether someone who hasn't played the earlier ones would enjoy this, so I won't bother. This is a review for the original fans of the game.\n\nThe game is visually stunning. It's not next-gen graphics or what have you, but it's modern and the love and care the team at Red Thread Games put into making Europolis feel like a 23rd century proto-dystopian city which still manages to look fantastic and somehow make me wistfully want to live in such a place. The darkened, rain filled, sky with neon all over the place and an odd mix of 19th century, 21st century, and 23rd century architecture is fantastic, with neat little details. You'll walk past a big modern skyscraper and see parts at the base which are crumbling and showing brick walls or the original iron supports.\n\nThe voice acting and story is great. The voice acting is phenomenal, and in all characters you can feel the genuine emotion and thoughts running through their dialogue. Better than most AAA games. The dialogue system they've set up should be the gold standard in games, where you can mouse over each of the answers and hear the protagonists thoughts on why that would be their answer. We only see a small snippet of the story in the first episode (called a 'book'), but already you can see how the threads are beginning to weave together into a coherent whole. And when I say a small snippet, I don't mean that it's short. My playthrough lasted four hours (it flew by so fast, I could've sworn I wasn't playing more than an hour), so in total this is looking to be a 20 hour game of pure content, and not achievement hunting, or pointless side missions, or collectibles. It's certainly got me itching for more. There appears to be genuine choice and consequences as well, though again - it's still too early to tell before the other books are released. That said, this is where one of my main concerns lies. The game has the option to track your decisions, and the majority of decisions I made, so too did 80%+ of other players. Hopefully they address this in future so there's more genuine choice, instead of obvious ones.\n\nThe gameplay, sadly, is a bit lacking as well. Which is understandable, this is essentially one of the old 1990s adventure games, transplanted and moderately reworked to fit a 3d setting and is a bit lost as a result, but there haven't been any sections that have been unenjoyable as a result, and it hasn't detracted from the games main strengths. Fortunately, they haven't included combat (thus far) as they were forced to do for Dreamfall, but so far there have been none of the 'impossible puzzles' that were common in so many such games if only because there have been few puzzles full stop.\n\nI was in my early 20s when Dreamfall first came out, and it's probably the game that's moved me (emotionally? spiritually?) more than any other game. I say this with considerable relief, Dreamfall Chapters evokes the same kinds of feelings now that I had when first playing Dreamfall back in '06. If you're a fan of the series, or of top-of-the-line storytelling, this is a must-buy.","October 21, 2014","true","12.9"," 280 of 310 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","280","310","2","7"

Constant fps drop in busy areas in both books, even on a high-end gaming PC. Multiple people have these issues, which I repeatedly checked on. In the two biggest areas in both episodes, the frame rate can drop to around 15fps. Unacceptable, especially since those are the areas you are stuck in for the longest time. Some people however can run and play the game fine, even on lower hardware, so it's a really weird issue, but it's still unacceptable to have these frame-rate issues on stronger machines.\n-What used to be occasional bugs has gone berserk with the release of episode two. A big chunk of bugs, starting from even the menu that sometimes spades out and will just do what it wants. There is a surprising lack of bug-testing and polish.\n-Very noticeable difference in quality and polish between models. Some textures look really good, some look pretty damn dreadful. Some character models are really good, some just fail to impress in comparison.\n-Animation, although sometimes relatively solid, at other times just seems very weird and especially walk cycles of some characters as well as how they rotate and/or talk seems very out of place.\n-Barely any explanation of the games that came before. Newer players will most likely feel lost.\n\nThe good:\n-The game looks really nice. The art style is really good, it has a really nice range of colors, and some areas like the main city you explore in the first episode are insanely detailed and look alive and believable.\n-Really interesting characters, both from older games in the series as well as new ones. Mostly good voice actors, although some sound a bit amateurish compared to others.\n-Relatively lengthy episodes, which can easily take around 3 to 4 hours per episode to finish.\n-The story continues right off of the last game and brings a slow but interesting new start to the series.\n-Good choices that actually change whole parts of the books (episodes) themselves and do offer an incentive to replay the game again.\n\nDreamfall Chapters is almost a game that should be recommended to every fan of modern adventure games. It is very slow paced, and it completely consists of walking around and talking with people, with little variation and very simple puzzles in between. Taking all of that into consideration however, it does manage to (so far) tell a really interesting tale with fun and colorful characters, and has a beautiful art style as well as decent length and structure to it. The only thing holding it back are the poor optimization and the bugs found every now and then (More so since book two). Even though players new to the series should have no big problems getting into the game, they might be left a bit confused at the start, and it does seem to target older fans more than anything. Everyone who loved the last Dreamfall game should also be in for a treat with this one, anyone else who is new to the series should still risk a look if they are primarily interested in good story telling and a slow atmosphere-focused game with little action, but a lot of wonder to breathe in. The lack of polish is the only thing keeping this game away from being as good as its predecessors.\n\nEDIT: Game still has huge performance issues and some bugs, but apparently the transition to the updated engine has helped for some people. Stay tuned for how it turns out once that engine update is out of beta and/or we get episode 4.","October 21, 2014","true","27.8"," 135 of 162 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","135","162","2","2"

The Longest Journey is a wonderful point-and-click adventure game classic: if you like adventure games and haven’t played it yet I highly suggest you do so.  Dreamfall (there’s no way around it) just isn’t as good.  This is not to say that it’s unplayable or that I didn’t enjoy it at all, but as a stand-alone game I wouldn’t whole-heartedly recommend it.\n\nIn order to really appreciate Chapters you don’t need to have played TLJ, but, unfortunately, I really think you do need to play the original Dreamfall first.  Among other things, Dreamfall ends on a cliffhanger and Chapters more-or-less picks up where it left off.\n\nChapters takes places in a rich game world revealed and developed over the course of the series.  This applies both to Stark, a vaguely cyberpunk version of our world set in the near future, and Arcadia, a fantasy world that’s the flipside of the coin—where magic rules rather than technology.\n\nI think the legacy of TLJ and Dreamfall is both a blessing and a curse for the creators of Chapters.  As I said, they started off with a storied, well-developed setting; but, at the same time, Chapters needed to continue Dreamfall’s story—a story that had arrived at a critical moment where sinister forces are on the verge (we’re talking like seconds) of upsetting the balance/taking over the world/ripping everything apart.  Marcuria, the city we visit in Arcadia, is under military occupation and the invaders (who have their own interesting culture) want to stamp out magic and replace it with their steampunk technology (and the purpose of some of these machines is very suspect).  Meanwhile, in Stark, an entertainment device called the Dream Machine has become ubiquitous and people are using it to escape the troubles of reality and spend more and more time in a virtual dream world.  From the very beginning one feels that a dramatic climax is imminent.\n\nChapters is a story rich game (and it’s an interesting story), but sometimes story rich means gameplay poor.  The episodes where you have control over the main character and get to move around solving puzzles are unevenly interspersed between long conversations and cut scenes.  This is, to some extent, made up for by the fact that you’re sometimes given a chance to make choices which will affect what happens later in the game (Chapters sort of beats you over the head with “This choice will matter!” although there’s an option to turn those messages off).\n\nSo all-in-all, I think you’ll risk being lost or not invested enough in the characters if you play Chapters without playing Dreamfall and there are parts where the game is light on interactivity and heavy on dialogue and exposition, but the story is an interesting one and in other places gameplay and story are balanced enough to satisfy.","January 22","true","28.2"," 78 of 89 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","78","89","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EnigmaticInterChange/recommended/237850/","EnigmaticInterChange","The Cockroach King","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EnigmaticInterChange/","333 products in account","Book One:\n\nIt’s been almost a decade since the ending of the previous installment left us with an abrupt cliffhanger while making us eager for more ventures of Zoë Castillo.\n\nEver since then, the future of Dreamfall was uncertain, with Funcom shifting its focus to online games before finally being salvaged with successful Kickstarter funding. So how does the first episode hold up after all those production perils and is it a worthy successor of the Dreamfall series?\n\nFor those of you who just tuned in and are unfamiliar with its predecessor (shame on you!), this story-driven adventure game takes place in two worlds, technology-infused Stark and magical land of Arcadia. Our heroine Zoë will start the journey by investigating the disappearance of her ex-boyfriend Reza Temiz, before unraveling a global conspiracy led by Japanese toy manufacturer WATIcorp. As you would assume, their real focus is far from making toys for kids and more on delivering a new, vastly damaging lucid dreaming drug to the market, something which will have dire consequences on both Stark and Arcadia in later events. Slowly you are introduced to new characters and find yourself jumping between worlds following the WATIcorp trail before realizing how small of a cog in a story they are and that much more is at stake.\n\nThe story picks up several months after the Longest Journey ending with Zoë still being stuck in a Storytime limbo. It is an otherworldly realm now swarming with Dreamachine addicts and other trapped souls. Following the gloomy finale in The Longest Journey, WATIcorp has gained even more power and influence by openly selling dream consoles from previous game labeled now as “Dreamachines”, a device marketed as a tool for enhancing lucid dreaming while making most of its users highly addicted in the process. You will get to witness that side effect firsthand while roaming through the streets of Europolis later, tripping over many of its comatose inhabitants in street corners.\n\nAt first, you will get a glimpse of storyline by helping other trapped souls and Dreamachine addicts in Storytime and later reconciling with our old mysterious friend Vagabond, who will inform us that both of the worlds of Stark and Arcadia are in great danger and Zoë’s help is needed once again. Before finding ourselves in Stark again, the game will briefly reunite us with another familiar face Kian Alvane, where we also learn more about his fate after the events in The Longest Journey. Along with Zoë, he is one of the three playable characters in the first episode of Chapters (I don’t want to spoil who the third protagonist is but let’s just say it is someone who I found quite charming and took me completely by surprise).\n\nSeeing how this episode mostly acts as something to entice new and returning players of Dreamfall, I can understand the lack of challenging puzzles in game for the most part. Usually you will find yourself merely repeating what the game asks of you or just combining items on few occasions but sadly that’s all there is to it. Luckily, that would probably be the only flaw that you might see in game, since everything else has been polished to the perfection. From the soothing scenery of Storytime (but only if we ignore that nightmarish wardrobe with slimy tentacles coming out of it) to the luminous and lively streets of Europolis – it is quite clear at first glance to where most of the love for the game went.\n\nSome older fans of Dreamfall might be displeased with the new voice actor for Zoë Castillo but frankly, that is something you might notice if you finished the previous game in the series only recently. And I assure you, beside that minor change the game does not hold back when it comes to delivering some quality voice acting. I can safely say that now we have a strong contender for one of the most adorable voices for a repair bot in video games ever.\n\nSpeaking of Europolis, it is one of the few locations in first episode where you will spend most of the time and for a good reason. The whole city is gorgeously designed,  highlighting the contrast between rich and poor on every corner. One moment you might find yourself gazing at the beautiful skyscrapers in Sonnenschein Plaza before stumbling over one of the many slumbering Dreamachine junkies. And let’s not forget our old pals from EYE, a global police agency who will watch over your every move, creeping on you and thousands of other citizens in Europolis.\n\nIn most games and movies, I always found the inclusion of lens flare nothing more than a cheap gimmick and what developers tend to incorporate when they run out of any other creative additions. But in this context, it is a feature which works incredibly well and adds something new to the whole dreamy (wink wink) undertone of the game. Dreamfall Chapters also does a remarkable job in pushing the capabilities of Unity engine to the sheer limits. Often i found myself going on short breaks from whatever game was asking me to do and decide to take an excessive number of screenshots instead. Even some seemingly bland section such as medieval prison complex makes up for an interesting and enjoyable location in the game.\n\nAnother thing on what developers focused more in Dreamfall Chapters are choices. Just like in a certain Telltale’s post-apocalyptic zombie game, you will now be notified with a large text prompt whenever you make an important decision while having an option to see the percentage of selected choices from other players online which might significantly help you in making a decision. The real question here is will these decisions result in greater variety, establishing a different image of the world for each player or are they nothing more than templates merely guiding us to one of the few prearranged endings of the game. For now, I believe it could go either way. One of my decisions in prologue during the second playthrough resulted in having a completely different job and doing business with a new key NPC once I found myself in Europolis again. Every other choice implied we might only see possible results of them in upcoming episode(s), especially when I played with Kian Alvane. To be fair, I am still a bit skeptical on how my choice between pork sausages or cheese soup for boyfriend’s dinner might leave a significant impact on the future of both worlds but i guess only time will tell.\n\nAbstract:\n\nDespite the serious lack of challenge in puzzles and relatively short length (although this point might prove invalid later with the release of new episodes), Dreamfall Chapters is quite deserving of your attention. With its superb voice acting, stunning locations and captivating story which will only leave you counting down the weeks for the release of the next episode, I will say we have a rewarding sequel for the Longest Journey. After an intro as good as this one, it’s hard not to expect only the best from the next episode.\n\n8/10","November 27, 2014","true","5.6"," 97 of 118 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","97","118","0","5"

Like its predecessors, Dreamfall Chapters is an interactive story.\n\nThe Good:\n- After eight years we are FINALLY moving forward toward a resolution.\n- Beautiful graphics. The city of Europolis is huge and feels like a real city. You can eavesdrop on conversations! I loved just poking around the city looking at everything (remember to look up at the sky).\n- Protagonists are interesting and relatable.

I can't wait to learn more about them.\n- Some new, imaginative ways to interact with the environment.\n- I love the costuming - even the NPCs. Really well designed and I can tell a lot of thought went into every outfit.\n\nThe Bad:\n- The controls were almost unbearable for me. I really couldn't get used to them and I got very frustrated at times trying to click on elements to interact with them. Some puzzles took me a long time to solve purely because had no idea an item could be interacted with, despite moving it into the centre of the camera field. Moving around felt very slow and clunky, even after several hours of playing.\n- My computer has above the recommended specs and I got some brutal fps drops.\n- Some ham fisted dialog and story elements. I get that Ragnar is trying to make a statement about the political situation in the West at the moment, but really. Lea Uminska's campaign posters are exactly the same style and colour as Obama's "HOPE" posters. Konstantin Wolf's posters have a Futurist/Constructivist lean to them like old Soviet propaganda posters.\n- I noticed quite a few small errors - maybe some were intentional? They were distracting.

Yes, in my opinion, this game can be played if you haven't played any of the others. It'll take you some time to get into it, but eventually events and things will make sense to you. Obviously it'll be easier if you did play the games though. (I won't discuss any specific spoilers.)\n\nI've heard many good things about the games, and when I found out that this game was coming out, I decided to check it out. I like games with an interesting story and choices that will affect how you as a player will experience it.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about the game before I played it, is that two of the three playable characters are poc, persons of color. Now that wouldn't matter so much if they weren't good characters to begin with. Fortunately, Zoë and Kian are interesting characters. I have more to say about Zoë since the focus of the game was more on her in the first book, but from what I've seen during my time with Kian, he'll have to make tough decisions in later books.\n\nThe intro chapter of the first book (which I will refer to by its title, Reborn) was amazing. It (re)introduces you to Zoë, what happened to her, where she is, and where she wants to go (which is a decision made by you). In the first chapter, it already becomes clear that she's unsure of her path in life, which makes her a believable protagonist if you ask me. She loves helping people, finding a good cause to work for and she's witty. Additionally, she struggles, just like you and me.\n\nI thought the last chapters of Reborn were a little dull. It involved running around the town and finishing objectives, and when I realized I was about to finish the chapter, I felt a bit relieved. However, that's not to say that the entire chapter is dull. [Zoë Castillo voice] "Nope. Nope, nope, nope." Like I said, the beginning of Reborn was amazing to me, and throughout the chapter, I've found many little things I thoroughly enjoy. I won't address them here, since I was surprised by them and that's the best way to enjoy something.\n\nThe voice acting in this game is mostly right. The protagonists have good voice actors, so I don't have anything to complain there. Here and there, there are characters in the game who have questionable VA's, characters who have voices that don't suit their look. But these are small things that won't bother me in the long run.\n\nI don't know what happened with these games, and how Dreamfall Chapters came to be. All I know is that the community wanted it to be a thing and it absolutely deserves the praise it gets. Set in a beautiful world you can (mostly) interact with, believable protagonists, an absolutely enchanting soundtrack... if you like this sort of game, please don't hesitate. I believe in the choices I made so far, and Dreamfall Chapters did a good job of reminding me that they will all have consequences... and that I will have to face them soon.\n\nI can't wait.","December 22, 2014","true","12.9"," 55 of 67 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","55","67","2","0"

There are both here on Steam as well as on GOG. If you have played those two already then I’m sure you’re curious if Chapters lives up to being the long awaited third game in The Longest Journey series for almost a decade. The answer is a resounding yes, heck yes. Chapters is already pretty great one episode in and I’m really glad I backed it.\n\nChapters is just as well written as its predecessors but one thing that really stands out is how freaking beautiful and immersive it is. After the first two parts that show what Zoe and Kian have been up to since the end of Dreamfall, Chapters puts you into Europolis, the huge megalopolis that’s Zoe moved to, and for an adventure game it’s a lot bigger than I expected. It’s also really dense without a lot to see and conversations to overhear. It’s really great and something that TLJ and Dreamfall didn’t achieve as well.\n\nThe gameplay takes a lot of inspiration from Walking Dead and it honestly suits it well. A key difference is that instead of timed dialogue segments that force you make decisions on the fly, Chapters is a lot more contemplative, you're not timed and the characters will actually think about the dialogue options to themselves when you mouse over them. The gameplay is also your standard adventure game point and click fare but the interface is now extremely streamlined and minimalist in all the right ways, especially compared to Dreamfall’s clunky ♥♥♥ interface.\n\nIt's still early to really tell if your choices really make some changes (Though as the game hints, your choices are going to affect the journey, not the destination) but there is a nice substantial deviation from one decision that you can make early on that can lead you to meet different characters unique to the path you choose. So if they keep that up it will be really neat.\n\nThe end of the first episode also has the best run animation for a video game character I've ever seen.\n\nThe only negative is that looking at other reviews it seems it's not only me and that the game isn't totally well optimized, the game can suffer slowdown in Europolis and there are graphical glitches. But that's something that can be fixed with a patch so its far from a dealbreaker.\n\nChapters is shaping up to be truly great and potentially the best game in the series. It has all the heart and wonder that the previous games had and then some. Backers have no need to fear and those who didn’t back it definitely need to check it out.\n\n*EDIT*\nNew patch rolled out and its definitely improved performance. Now this game really doesn't have any real flaws!","October 21, 2014","true","17.6"," 63 of 82 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","63","82","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/elboim/recommended/237850/","elboim","Michael Elboim","http://steamcommunity.com/id/elboim/","106 products in account","This review is updated up to Book four.\n\nBasically, playing this game is like watching a movie that stops every five minutes, and continues only after you walk around your house three times. Even though saying that, book four is a MAJOR improvement compared to the first three, and is more streamlined and less running around. I hope these changes will be improved even further in book five.\n\n4.5/10\n\n\nThe good:\n+ A direct continuation to TLJ and Dreamfall.\n\n+ Very good graphics for the amount of money they had. The game feels AAA.\n\n+ Some characters are fun and unforgettable (Zoe, Mira, Shiit-bot, Bip, Crow, and the Yaga).\n\n+ Voice actors or the above mentioned characters are great.\n\n+ Specific scenes from episode four (Yaga and Oular Village) are just done beautifully.\n\n\nThe bad:\n- Technical Design.\nOn my Windows 10, Intel i7, GTX560 with 10GB RAM, the game barely scratches 60FPS on the lowest possible settings. Sometimes it lags even then. It feels like too much time and money were invested on looks only.\n\nThe game lacks many basic animations. When a character picks up an object, jumps, falls or fights, even just stands still, most of the time it looks unnatural.\n\nLoading times aren't the best.\n- Fake length.\nYou move slow, even when you run.\n\nYou can skip most of the scenes and lines, but there are many random unskippable scenes or lines that must be fully heard - which freezes the momentum of the game. If you read the subtitles faster than the characters talk (which you probably will), you can't always skip them. I found myself yelling at the game more than once to "get on with it!"\n\nEach of the first three books take about 4-5 hours to finish, but if every scene and line were skippable and if you didn't have to mess around with the maps so much, they would take about 1-2 hours (while still listening to lines casually). The game forces you to fully listen to lines you already read in the subtitles, and to literally get lost - not on what you're supposed to do, but on where you are in the environment.\n- Bad gameplay and puzzles.\nThe most common puzzles are to reach from point A to point B, find an item by "pixel hunting" in a 3D world, speak to a certain character or just wait.\n\nFor the first three books at least, you will have to walk for tens of minutes without any sort of a fair guide. There are certain spots where there is a map stand, which you will have to find, reach, look at and analyse. Using the map to find out where to go is a must, and is probably the most annoying and common task in this game.\n\nA good puzzle gives you the solution in front of your eyes, and you only have to find a way to solve it by connecting the pieces. This game hides the pieces and forces you to find them in a big and uninteractable environment, and is punishing you by making you walk even more.\n- Soundtrack is not interesting.\nWith the exception of the background music for the Oular village from book four, which is the single music track in the game that I noticed, the music is not as interesting enough as to be in a story based game. Both Dreamfall and TLJ had great OST.\n\nWith all due respect to composer Simon Poole, both Bjørn Arve Lagim and Leon Willett did a whole lot better job in earlier games, and I can't see why they didn't include them this time.\n- Overall annoying characters and mediocre voice acting.\nMost characters are boring or annoying. This includes mainly Kian, which was not interesting at all even during the original Dreamfall.\n\nKian's voice actor is half asleep, but it might not be his fault, it might be because that is the nature of the character, and so does most of the voice actors (with the exception of the above mentioned good characters).\n\nThe most important and interesting character in the series, April Ryan, is not in the game at all up to book four, although mentioned.\n- Useless choice system.\nUp to book four, the choice system, which is done wonderfully in Telltale games and in Life is Strange, still feels useless in Dreamfall Chapters. The choices never felt important or in place.\n\nThe game keeps telling you "This character will remember", and "This will have consequences", but you never feel that your choices matter. At the start and end of each book you will be reminded that "Your actions DID matter!" and that "Your future has changed!" but it feels like the game is pathetically trying to defend a flawed mechanic that it wasn't built to hold, and might have been implanted only to draw fans of the genre.\n\nSome choices have such bad balance between them, that one of them is clearly the "right" one, and according to the book-end results more than 90% of the players chose it. If the game wants me to make a specific decision, why include a choice at all?\n- Bad writing.\nThere is no clear objective at any point, and you don't know or care most of the time.\n\nCliché and expected lines.\n\nKian's parts especially are a "snore-fest".\n\nThe story as a whole is just not interesting and barely moving forward. If this is truly written by the same Ragnar Tørnquist who wrote TLJ, I seriously don't know what happened. While TLJ was one of the most interesting and inspiring story based video games I have ever had the honor to play, Kian saving the world from his people or Zoe finding out that everything is a conspiracy is hardly interesting, compared to April in TLJ, which always had a clear objective that lured me to keep wanting to help her.\n\nIn conclusion:\nEven a story game should stick to what it knows. This game is heavily based on the worlds of the two previous games, TLJ and Dreamfall, but the new story is unlike them at all, and this game tries to be many things it isn't: It tries to be a Telltale game by including a choice every second, even though they clearly still means nothing, even in the fourth book, and it tries to be Game of Thrones by including so many war-politics, which all feel so cheap and not in place that they fall apart on each other.\n\nThe fourth book really tries to change things, and feels much more like the original Dreamfall (which is still light-years below TLJ), but it's an improvement, even if it might be too little and too late, because let's face it, no graphics, sound or story can save a game from horrible gameplay.\n\nThe worst things about the original Dreamfall was how much backtracking, walking and running we had to suffer. There are no fighting scenes this time, which is a good thing, but the long and tedious runnings are still here, not to mention an unrelated action scene here and there with Kian, and these hold the game back from turning into the beautiful masterpiece that The Longest Journey was.\n\nThe game is long not because of its content, but because of how much time is wasted by reaching from point A to point B, and only after you find out where point B is, and it is SO hard to find out where to go, even if you know the name of the place. Like I said at the beginning, playing this game is like watching a movie that stops every five minutes, and continues only after you walk around your house three times. Although, again, this is true mostly to the first three books.\n\nI had bad Kickstarter decisions, but this is the worst of them all by far. I will cross my fingers for the fifth book, because the fourth book really showed that they at least try. Who knows, maybe they will double the running speed next time.","June 28, 2015","false","17.6"," 214 of 359 people (60%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","60","214","359","12","27"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FreakOramaXD/recommended/237850/","FreakOramaXD","FreakOrama","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FreakOramaXD/","737 products in account","Just to sumarise what I'm about to say, everything about this game is high quality in terms of graphics quality, sounds/music, art style, story, voice acting, controls, creativity, basically anything one (or me at least) can think of about a game that's story focused, the game has it all in great care.\n\nThe game has gorgeous graphics in terms of technical power (effects, textures, animations) and art direction, with smooth high quality soundtrack that conveys an epic sense of journey, also the great voice acting for the game that's almost fully voice acted with a ton of different types of accents.\n\nThe story is interesting and compelling, with different scenarios happening that goes alongside with how you play with different characters other than the main character in a different world and time, and these worlds are believable ones to be in, especially the city where you mainly play in as the main character with how one can tell and differentiate one area from another, and so memorising the city slowly becomes accomplished, looking at a map becomes a useful tool to check where you're going rather than using it as a guide for the rest of the game.\n\nAlthough at a certain point in the game i found myself where i couldn't find the place where the game told me to go, while this annoyed me a bit i found it enjoyable to go and find it myself, thinking that the city is an area where i can see myself go to in real life, and that's kind of a great feeling to having while roaming the city, trying to find the place you want to go to. I guess instead of thinking this as a negative, I'd go with 'bitter-sweet'.\n\nThe choices the game presents you with are vague but described correctly and not falsely, in which case it falls back to the person playing on which of the choices is the best one to choose, putting serious thought into a choice keeping in mind that something might happen later on.\n\nAnd so at the end of the game, book one out of five, the game reminds you of the choices you made and how each one will effect the story and character(s) throughout the next chapters of the game, with a "what other players choose" which is neat. Having the game push the idea of how the choices you make or have made will have meaningful changes or consequences later on, and whether that's true or not, having you believe it, believe in the idea that you're choices actually has an impact, is a great point for a story focused game to have.\n\nOverall i love the game, from the technicalities like the graphics, sounds, level design and controls, to the design choices like the art style, level design, characters, to the story and how there's a lot of mystery to it. If you want the full package with the full story and content, then wait until all of the chapters are out, but i do recommend getting this game, saying it's well worth the asking price on PC digital stores, and really can't say no to it, heck I'd say this is a GOTY contender in my book, but let's see where the rest of the game goes in the remaining chapters.\n\nShamless link[www.ksalue.com] to original post.","October 30, 2014","true","3.4"," 35 of 49 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","35","49","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shyguyyy/recommended/237850/","shyguyyy","Shyguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shyguyyy/","65 products in account","Rating up to book three:\n\nI really hate to write a negative review for this game, because I'm a huge fan of TLJ series up to this point and I couldn't wait for the third installment to come along. That being said, if I could give a neutral rating I would because I think this game still has a lot of potential.\n\nFirst, I don't think this game works well having the chapters released so far apart. These are immensely story-rich games, with a lot of choices- and a lot to keep up with. It's been months now since the release of book three and to be honest I can barely remember what has happened thus far. It isn't that the story isn't interesting, it's just too detailed to keep up with if you're only returning to it every few months. If you're going to purchase this game, I recommend waiting until all parts have been released.\n\nSecondly, they could have done a much better job with some of the choices you have to make. A lot of the choices feel unimportant (though perhaps that will come back to bite me later), and then another chunk of the choices are too obvious- as in 90%+ of players chose the same thing. I'd say that for every good choice I have to make (as in I'm actually torn about what to do, and feel as though my choice matters) there are 4-5 choices that seem obvious or I don't care about.\n\nThird, I really hate Kian's character in this game. We are over half way through the release of the five books and I still don't feel like I understand his character at all. He has no personality, and no depth. While I enjoy the storyline that he is a part of (I enjoy being a part of any rebels group lol) Kian himself- as a stand alone character- has made no memorable impression on me.\n\nBut there are great elements to this game as well.  While the details of this story aren't sticking with me (again, I mostly chalk that up to the chapters being too spaced out) there are a lot of elements to the overall plot that I really love- especially the impending election/political storyline. There's a lot of Star Trek-esque social commentary on humanity's relationship with corporate power and greed, as well as class tensions- which I find super interesting. The atmosphere and settings are incredible as well. I wish you could interact a little more with your environments but as it stands they've done a phenomenal job of bringing the worlds of Stark and Arcadia into the next era of graphics. A lot of the new characters are quirky and memorable, and the voice acting is top-knotch.\n\nI'm going to give this game a rest for the time being, and wait unil all parts have been released before I give the entire thing a play-through. But until the game is fully out and I can get a feel for how it plays when the chapters are continuous,  I just can't bring myself to give it a thumbs up.","November 11, 2015","false","26.6"," 59 of 93 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","59","93","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rezzealaux/recommended/237850/","rezzealaux","rezzealaux","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rezzealaux/","101 products in account","I'm going to be talking about the immersion/atmosphere/mystique in Dreamfall Chapters as it appears in Part 1 and appears to be the trend for the currently unreleased parts, i.e. the quality of the writing and the mechanics of how the game conveys you that writing. See other reviews for stuff like graphics and whatever. I played TLJ and Dreamfall in like 2012 or something and loved them so those don't really matter to me too much.\n\nDreamfall Chapters seems to also rely on the story to carry it, but I don't think it will.\nThe expansion from point-and-click 2.5D static background in TLJ to the simple 3D corridor in Dreamfall survived decently well, but Dreamfall Chapters just drops the ball on the atmosphere as far as I'm concerned.\n\nWith TLJ the technology limitations and game type worked fairly well together. Fixed background allows easily for design to really make it feel more like an art piece and really define what it is that the player sees. The nature of clickable things being part of the fixed background though kept it on the game side via interactive exploration. April growing and shrinking also gave a more effective sense of distance than I think game developers these days are willing to admit.\n\nDreamfall managed to keep the transition to 3D decently since 3D world capabilities were probably fairly limited back then. Our world's cities were fairly narrow without too much "open world", but there were enough things to interact with to not feel like it was simply a walking simulator. Marcuria's city was the same way.\n\nDreamfall Chapters however is way too populated with interactable things that do absolutely nothing.\nWhat happened in TLJ when you clicked on things and they had no purpose in the story or its progression, it simply gave you no response. There were things here and there you could look into, but there weren't that many and they gave you a feel of the situation, things that felt like they were there to speak for the music, the art style, and the premise of the story.\n\nDreamfall somewhat removed this with its eye/highlight system, but it was a reasonable system. The system had a very narrow range of view when selecting things to highlight, and although scanning was a lot easier than running a tiny cursor over the whole screen, it retained enough of the TLJ spirit to it to feel like I was still exploring and finding things out. The world shown was fairly small, but the way things were talked about made it feel fairly big and alive. Sort of like Remember Me, if you played that. The small corridors with glimpses of a huge world behind it are pretty good design choices. Creating a desire and hinting at it is often stronger than fulfilling a desire that one is unaware of; see skimpy clothing on women and basically any PR/hype for any product before it's out.\n\nThe population of the world in Dreamfall Chapters completely reversed this. I can remember the look of some people and some of the things of TLJ and Dreamfall. The autotaxi I thought was super neat, and the space station scene and the type of people in it have been strongly imprinted in my mind.\n\nWhereas the technological limitations were implicitly acknowledged in TLJ and Dreamfall by its design, Dreamfall Chapters makes it way too obvious to the player. Now instead of a few things that you really pay attention, there's a torrent of repetition. In Europolis no matter what I higlighted in the market I heard the same things over and over again. Why are there 20 or so market tables but only 2 or 3 messages I hear about all of them? What is the purpose of 10 selectable trash cans? The adbots of Dreamfall Chapters nowhere near compare to the Screens of Dreamfall. There's a bunch of people now walking around that I really don't care about, and a lot of things strewn about that I don't know if I should really care about.\n\nAnd I know where every single one of them are because with almost no effort on my part any time I look in a general direction, I'm told exactly what is and what isn't selectable.\n\nThere's something else that causes this complete lack of atmosphere or mystique.\n\nIt might be the writing.\nIn the opening of TLJ and Dreamfall we're introduced to a bit of the mystery and the scale of the story we're about to uncover within the first several minutes of the game. TLJ opens with a girl in underwear clearly from a time and place we can relate to and in a world which is clearly not. Dreamfall opens largely the same way with some vaguely modern guy with a bunch of kooky priests doing kooky stuff.\n\nThere is none of this in the opening of Dreamfall Chapters. We're told everything matter-of-factly, Zoe Castillo seems to perfectly know what she's doing except when she doesn't, and whatshisface opens his mouth too much in too many stupid ways and there's nothing amazing about any of it at all. Storytime used to be this really unknowable timeless place, now it's, oh, it's basically just where dreams happen. And we have this guy who has a poor command of the english language who appears sometimes. And we have superpowers somehow. We're told that we need to go back and stop the undreaming or something, which could be great even if the intro was poor, but we don't do any of that. We go back into the real world and all we talk about is Zoe's feelings and politics. There's nothing tying this to anything at all.\n\nNot knowing the whole story is integral for a story to move forward, but thinking you know the next step is necessary for a story to even happen. April knew what her next step was going to be at all times, even if it was wrong. Zoe Castillo in Dreamfall knew at all times what her next step would be, even if it was wrong.\n\nZoe Castillo in Dreamfall Chapters doesn't know jack about anything and any time she's about to reveal something important, we're told to decide what it's about instead.\n\nWhat was the 20% point for the average playthrough of TLJ or Dreamfall? Surely it's different from this. Looking over various Steam reviews it appears the average time to completion of Book 1 was somewhere between 4-8 hours (mine was 6 at time of writing). I took 13-14 hours to get through Dreamfall and about 15-17 to get through TLJ. I've seen a lot of defenses about how gameplay time isn't representative or whatever and this is true but the flow of the story is undoubtedly different and whether by percentage or by absolute playtime (which cannot be completely ignored) and in basically any story you see by the 20% point or in any game/movie/TV series/book by 4-8 hours in (unless the story is several hundred hours long) you have a fair idea of what is going on. At any time the audience can feel disengaged and you always have to have something around the corner to keep them turning the page or whatever it might be in that medium.\n\nThere is nothing of the sort in Dreamfall Chapters as far as I can tell.\nI don't think it is reasonable to say that Dreamfall Chapters is good. I have no real reason to come back to it except for the fact that I backed the game and want to see how things turn out. I cannot recommend this game to anyone who has not already played TLJ and Dreamfall, and even to those who do I cannot really say it is a worth spending money on.\n\nFor all the reasons that can be said about releasing a game in chapters, it is undeniable that RTG thought that this first book/chapter/part of their game was worthy of releasing to the public and thus fair for any and all criticism. It is not an alpha or a beta or an early release. It is a public release of a section of the game.\n\nUnless the design philosophy changes quite radically I don't think I will be changing my recommendation.\n\nOh yeah, "THIS PERSON WILL REMEMBER THIS" blares in your face after like every convo choice.\nIt's like RTG forgot "Show Don't Tell" is the key to immersion.","October 27, 2014","false","6.0"," 99 of 165 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","99","165","0","0"

This has been one of my favorite stories of all time.","October 21, 2014","true","6.2"," 48 of 75 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","48","75","0","0"

They are my favorite games of all time and I have played through them several times. If you expect this sequel to be anything like the first two, like I did, then you will be sorely disappointed.\n\nI played the Longest Journey and the Longest Journey: Dreamfall because of the compelling and interesting storyline, the gorgeous scenery and because I grew attached to the characters themselves. They are the type of games that let you escape into a dazzling and mysterious world with interesting characters that you can't get enough of.\n\nDreamfall Chapters started out pretty well in the very beginning of Book 1, but as the game progressed it very quickly became obvious that the developers of the game wanted to shove their political views down your throat. The political agenda became very clear. For example, Zoë is engaged in a political campaign helping a socialist party, Zoë has a Marxist best friend and then every other girl in the street is walking around with hijab on.\nI did not buy this game to play "Politics Simulator 2015" or "Baby Simulator" (if you played this game you will know what I'm talking about).\n\nDreamfall Chapters is otherwise visually gorgeous, but it lacks gameplay,story and puzzles. It also lacks clues to lead you to the next point.\nLet me also point out that the dialogue is a lot of times vulgar and forced. They manage to squeeze in profanity where it's not needed. Dropping the f-bomb and saying sh*t several times in a single sentence does not make good or "cool" dialogue. It seems like they are using profanity as filler to make up for a poor script. The Longest Journey and Dreamfall are not known for vulgar dialogue and it is not something that needed to be added.\n\nThe developers have turned a fantastic game series into something bland and stereotypical with political propaganda. Zoë has become someone I don't recognize, doing and saying things that don't fit her personality as I know her from the Longest Journey: Dreamfall. I am also sad about April Ryan.\n\nI won't recommend this game to fans of the series, but I will likely continue with Book 3 because I invested time in the other chapters and want to see if there is some hope on the horizon. I doubt it though.\nI will replay the original games but not this one.\n\nSummary:\n+Visually gorgeous\n+Zoës updated model is beautiful (except her new haircut in book 3).\n\n-Blatant political agenda\n-Lacks story\n-Lacks gameplay\n-Lacks puzzles\n-Poor and forced dialogue\n-Vulgar language\n-Short chapters\n\nTINY UPDATE 6/28-2015:\nBook 3 left my mouth agape. It was VERY short. I have no further comments as my opinion have not changed for the better.\n\nThank you for reading.","June 21, 2015","false","33.3"," 263 of 463 people (57%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","57","263","463","18","26"

After just completing book three of Dreamfall Chapters I feel like I'm still waiting for the game to really start answering questions left over from the last game; to begin working towards a satisfying conclusion.\nGameplay, (what little there is) is stale and uninteresting. The Kian character is dull and uninteresting. The Zoe character, while I like playing as her, is a totally different construct from the second game. Not only does she not even resemble the same character in the looks department but her attitude and speech patterns are different as well.\nCasually Discarding Damien Cavanaugh the way they  did in Book One was actually really annoying and felt like a betrayal actually.\nOn the plus side Mira and shitbot are really entertaining. I just wish this game felt more energetic, like it had purpose and was leading us somewhere cool and interesting instead of wasting my time with pointless uninteresting errands.\n\nWhat is the link between Waticorp/dreamnet and the Azadi's White Tower in Arcadia?\nWhy did Zoe say at the end of TLF: Dreamfall that Reza couldn't be trusted?\nWhat happened to April Ryan? How does she survive (And she does survive as evidenced at the end of TLJ) being stabbed and falling to a dark watery grave?\nAnd for the love of the balance, will we ever see Wonkers again?!\n\nIf you were expecting any of these questions to be answered in books 1-3 you will be left feeling very sorely disappointed.\n\nIn a way, I can't help drawing a comparison with this game and the writing of the Star Wars Prequels. Nothing really happened in the first two movies, everything was squished into Revenge of the Sith. Is that what's going to happen here? Will we begin to get some meaty story in Book 4 or worse book 5?\n\nThis game so far just feels like a wasted opportunity to me. I'm hanging in there, but only because I've already pre brought the season pass.\n\n5/10\n","July 7, 2015","false","29.6"," 98 of 167 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","98","167","4","1"

This could have been avoided by the promised Journey: Graphic Novel which was due to be released beforehand to recap the previous games stories - sadly this was nowhere in sight for those who backed the game on kickstarter in the $75 and above tiers which has left a somewhat bitter taste in my mouth and ruined some of the experience for me as I was not able to go back and play the first two games before playing chapters.\n\nMoving on from this - chapters has started a whole new story in the TLJ universe and one that I'm ready to get involved in, the first episode is clearly aimed at laying the ground work and some will be dissapointed by the fact that half of this episode is spent running around the same environment completing quests that will clearly become big story beats in the future. After a few quests in the main area the game began to feel a little stale and almost like the developer needed to provide filler by making you run around a lot to lengthen the episode. I'm hoping that this doesn't become a common sight as the games remaining episodes are released.\n\nOne feature that is new to the TLJ series is The Walking Dead style choices where RedThreadGames promise that choices made throughout the game will have consequnces in future endeavors, it's not yet clear if they'll pull this off as well as TellTale(The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us) but it's certainly something I'm excited to see as the episodes get released.\n\nIn terms of puzzles, Dreamfall: Chapters contains everything you'd expect from an adventure game of this type, from inventory based puzzles (Combine everything!) to puzzles based purely on a piece of dialogue you had with someone an hour ago. I didn't find myself ever getting frustrated with any of them and they all made logical sense unlike some of the series early work(Fans will remember a certain rubber duck puzzle) however some may rightly criticise them for being a bit too easy, which is slightly alarming considering this was the main complaint fans had with Dreamfall: The Longest Journey\n\nOverall if I had to be honest with myself as a massive fan of the previous games, it's really difficult to recommend Dreamfall Chapters as an episodic game and personally I'd wait for the full series to be released, however if you can't wait to continue the story then by all means Book One is still a solid game with solid mechanics that you'd expect from this kind of adventure game and I've come away with a definite interest in seeing how the story develops going forward.","October 24, 2014","true","12.0"," 27 of 39 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","27","39","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MoonStrikeLilly/recommended/237850/","MoonStrikeLilly","MoonStrikeLilly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MoonStrikeLilly/","297 products in account","This is at true adventure game and a continuation of the Longest Journey and Dreamfall.  Dreamfall Chapters again follows Zoe Castillo, a young woman who first appeared in Dreamfall being asked to find and save April Ryan, the main character  from the first game, the Longest Journey.  Dreamfall Chapter's furthers Zoe's particular part in the adventure in helping to determine the fate of the balance between the two worlds of magic and science, Stark and Arcadia.  If you like mysteries, don't mind fantasy or sci-fi and like agnozing over decisions that may affect your own fate as well as the overall fate of the world, this game is for you.\n\nTo continue,  I wholly recommend this to people who like TellTale style games, as this game uses the similar mechanic of "choose your own adventure."  If you have not ever seen one of these type of tales, which started out in books, it's a format where your actions can lead to different paths or at least a different experience in the overall plot, can flesh out what and who characters are and give you at a deeper understanding of the environment, the story and it's meaning,  and give you a better sense of actually participating in the adventure.  You can actually feel and understand Zoe and Kian's decisions and agonize over them, and worry about what kind of effect this is going to have on the character and the worlds.  Is it going to get them killed? Is this decision later on down the line going to make the end result of the story actually change?\n\nThe game development team is on the third book in several chapters, and the gameplay is over 10 hours already for $20.00.  That's less than the price of two movie tickets in my state , and there will only be more to come.  With that $20.00 you get to immerse yourself in another world, feel the environment and participate in it, make decisions that may or may not affect your life and well being, as well as the world around you.   Some decisions are quite small and some very large.   Some small decisions actually lead to larger consequences .  You get to participate in an overall mystery and experience more than one world in the combination of fantasy, sci-fi, mystery and ordinary things that are part of life.\n\nThis game is not for everyone, but neither is any game that you can possibly buy out there.  Some people don't like shooters, some don't like strategy, or side-scrollers, and some people don't like adventure games.  Some people think adventure games should only come in one format and involve tons of mind-breaking puzzles.  Some people don't like certain content.  In the the end, to me It's just like some people preferring hockey over football or baseball.  It's up to you whether you like this game or not.  I can only say in the end though that I really enjoy it and it was worth every penny  spent on it for me.  These adventures are truly different and you can never quite be sure what is going on.\n\nI hope that this review was helpful, and I hope that Red Thread Games can continue making adventures in the future that are like this.","June 12, 2015","true","347.2"," 25 of 36 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","25","36","0","2"

If you are a fan of the previous two games, this one will not disappoint. The first book will take you about 5 to 7 hours to complete, depending on your play style. Several playthroughs are highly encouraged because of the choice and consequence system so you should get more than your moneys worth out of the first book.\n\nThe game is pretty nice graphically, but there are some issues with lighting and frame rates. The gameplay is what you have come to expect from this saga and mostly boils down to exploration, collecting and combining items and talking with all the different characters. There are occasional bugs but they are never game breaking and they don't take much away from the experience. The amazing sound design and the new choice and consequence system both increase immersion and Stark and Arcadia feel like living and breathing worlds, though the focus of this book is very much on Stark.\n\nMost importantly the developers at Red Thread games have managed to create a deep, compelling and mature story filled with amazing characters. This first book will not yet give you all the answers you are looking for, but it does a great job of setting the tone and it made me very excited for things to come.","October 24, 2014","true","103.9"," 23 of 33 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","23","33","0","2"

Dreamfall chapters seems structurally similar to "the walking dead" game, where choices with consequences seems to be one of the main features, as well as the episodic content. However, unlike the walking dead - this game actually seems like the choices matter more and have real impact compared to "the walking dead". The setting is fantastic, the characters are very good as well - especially Zoe.\n\nPros:\n- The music is immersive, and really really good.\n- Story is very interesting, very unique.\n- Zoe is a great character! And there are few games with female protagonists, which is something this industry definitely needs more of.\n\nCons:\n-A couple "objectives" are not very intuitive, and you kinda run around without knowing what to do, this could be improved, but I imagine this to be a question of taste. Regardless, this is a minor issue.\n- Facial animations could be better.\n- The city seems poorly optimized performance wise, but it is playable.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone that likes a good story, and making choices. I really liked it, and look forward to new chapters!!! :)\n\nThe game moves a bit slower than many other games out there, so I would recommend that the player have a bit of patience in order to enjoy it, certain things aren't very intutive and might take a bit of time to figure out - but nothing is hard by any means.","October 25, 2014","true","34.9"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","21","30","0","0"

The first few stages have a couple puzzles that feel like tutorials for bigger ones that come later, but then it just becomes one big talk-fest mixed in with fetch item/walk around town.\n\nNow the original, The Longest Jouney, had a ton of puzzles, even if they were inventory-based. Dreamfall less so, but still enough to feel like you're playing a game. This one, on the other hand, is just dialogue and character development (?). Decisions, how they affect you, etc.\n\nI don't know if it's meant to be like this, and the next chapter will deliver on these decisions, but for now this was sorely disappointing.\n\nOtherwise: visuals, music, environments are great.\nDialogue and voice-acting are usually good, but sometimes a bit off.

It fails to pick up where original Dreamfall left. Instead it's full of boring running around, flat/unwitty dialog and interaction problems (often you just don't know where you're supposed to click). Also nothing ruins character driven game like wooden character animations. I mean the original Dreamfall had better animations frigging 10 years ago.\n\nTo be fair, except the animations, the game looks beautiful. Some parts of the Kian story arc aren't half bad. The story also starts to pick up speed at the second half of Episode 3. Unfortunately to get this point, you need to suffer through roughly 10 hours of boringness. Even in Episode 3 there are some very tedious parts.\n\nThe game also has some performance issues so don't expect to play it with low-end system.\n\nEpisode 4 update: Episode 4 is the first episode that starts to meet the expectations I had for this series. Dialog is better (mostly thanks to crow) and performance issues are somewhat alleviated by the game engine update.

It is teeming with people and details: protests, weird fashion, confusing slang, neon signs, hovering ad-bots, vending machines, market stalls, and fascist police shaking people down.

Calling it a cliffhanger would be an understatement but it's been so long now that any feelings that have might been on the questionable ending has long passed and replaced with a sense of "Reconcilliation" or "Rebirth" as the first chapter of the overall experience is titled (or Book One if you will).\n\nChapters make no comprises here. It starts off directly from where the first Dreamfall left off, giving that eerie sensation that it litterally hasn't been 8 years, but both the player and Zoe seems to think so at least, judging from her elaborate inner monlogueging at least. Before we are treated to Zoe, we are presented with a summarization of what has happened, and the world itself -- In Dreamfall there exist two worlds, Arcadia (the world of magic and dreams) & Stark, our world in a distatnt futuristic-dystopian-cyberpunk-inspired-23rd-century-state. This is what seperates the franchise from truly being labeled sci-fi. fantasy, or just generally be restricted by any genre, which gives a lot of free-roam for telling a fantastical story with exostic characters.\n\nAs soon as that is out of the way we are shortly introduced to a scene that showcases the sounds of a birth taking place, a scene that will make sense if one considers the scene that came right before it, which I'll avoid elaborating on due to its spoilery content, for those who've played the previous games but not this one yet -- Let's just say that it all alludes to the title of "Rebirth" as a soothing female narration will point out.\nIt's interesting to note that during the story, there are words that seem to reccur again and again, like reconciliation & remembering, mostly in regards to Zoë's current condition, but consider these words and one will find they mean the same. It goes back to namely; Rebirth, the state of starting anew and building upon the old to create something new.\n\nBook One is the story of Rebirth for both Zoe Castillo and co-protagonist Kian Alvane (now voiced by Nicholas Boulton, known for voicing Hawke in DA2), and as all these introductory scenes come together we find ourselves in the company of our heroine, Zoe Castillo -- She's still in a coma and even worse, she's stuck in a limbo called Storytime, where all stories goes to die, as does hers. Having somewhat come to terms with her dire situation, Zoe has garnered a purpose in this netherrealm between worlds, as she's gained powers to manipulate the fabrics of Dreams and thus she utilizes them to guide dreamers who's lost their way, and help them find their way back to reality.\n\nMeanwhile, in the world of Arcadia, Kian has found himself facing execution after being convicted as a traitor to his people for things he did not commit in the last game. Memory doesn't serve me too well in regards to Dreamfall with everything, but Nicholas Boulton's voice acting adds that needed sense of despair to a broken man, who's been betrayed and lost so much. It's actually a quite welcoming take on the character with the new voice, but he's not alone, as Zoe's voice is also quite different.\nKian, however, soon find himself being rescued by an enigmatic stranger with an eyepatch, who also briefly appeared in the beginning intro cutscene -- He reassures that Kian's story won't end here as he's somehow REALLY important to a revolution that is going on in his homeland and he's the key to turn the tide. It's safe to say that while it is seemingly uncertain how this relates to Zoë's adventure yet, it mostly likely will intertwine with hers in future episodes.\n\nBack to Zoe, after having helped a few, poor, lost souls escape their nightmares, she soon find herself being embolded to return to her world, by a mysterious being returning from the last game, called The Vagabond. He reassures Zoë that her story has not yet ended and by returning to the real world she'll have a fighting chance against whatever it is that threatens dreams and everything we hold dear.\nThis is where the meat of Book One begins -- Chapters is largely reflected upon the dialogue choices you makes, specifically one 'major' choice that will change the kind of person Zoe might become as she wakes up again. This is a choice you make prior to this.\n\nMoving on from the premise and into the functions of the dialogue that I've been mentioning just now; The occasional dialogue decisions you make are rather well seggregated, and they are written as such not to cater to any pretentious moral compass. It's more or less as dredged in various idealogious, reflections of states of mind, that all seemingly makes sense in regards to either Zoe or Kian's characterization. No choice feel preposterous or even out of character which adds complexity and thus a more fulfilling and engaging experience. It's something I feel developers like BioWare, Sucker Punch, 2k or other developers who've dabbled in awful moral choice system mechanics, never seem to capture quite well.\nBoth Zoë and Kian each have a short inner monologue for every choice you can pick, to truly draw the player into the character's mindset and be able to pick which response seems most appropriate, considering each circumstance.\nIt feels more or less like a neat marriage between the dialogue systems of a few noteworth RPGs like Deus Ex or Witcher, where the moral ambiguity of the Witcher and the easy-to-monitor paraphrasing of Deus Ex's systems come great together. It's gratifying to see that the quality of The Longest Journey franchise's writing is still there, and it shines just as bright with the new addition of a dialogue system for the first time ever in the franchise.\n\nThe writing being solid as it is only helps complimenting the ongoing process of bringing life to the world of Stark, as you're in the position to roam around the city of Propast -- A cyberpunk, dystopic, metropolitan, totalitarian soceity, where the affluence of Cyberpunk & George Orwell really kicks in -- Corruption, conspiracies,  surveillance everywhere, guard operatives enforcing their authority, junkies, the scum of the underworld, political intrigue etc. It's all of the things I really love from dystopic/cyberpunk/noir narratives mixed into one delicious cocktail.\n\nI'm running short of characters, so I'll sum up some thoughts here -- Chapters is what I'd consider a successful kickstarter that delivers, and only truly fails with it being an episodic game,  puzzles being a bit simple and choices more or less feeling like a retread of the pretentiousness of Telltale that amounts to nothing. Each dialogue option however feels intuitive, the world feels alive, the characters are great, writing solid...\n","November 9, 2014","true","71.7"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","20","30","0","1"

Sorry RTG but you dropped the ball here. Hard. SOME SPOILERS WILL FOLLOW!\n\nThe following recommendation is based on Book 1 and 2 and may be altered later.\n\nThere are two things that stand out of the things I felt most let down by.\n\nBlandness\nYou start the game out with some awesome abilities, a very interesting way of showing what has been going on from Dreamfalls ending. But how is this described as an adventure game? There is no adventure. There is almost no “game” either. The most exiting part of the story is that of Kian. There is some mystery, some story and at least one interesting character to chat with. The rest is just meh as it is so bland, so nothing, that so much of what you do, despite the “NAME will remember this.” and “This action will have consequences!”, feels so uninspiring and meaningless. Yes, they do matter, but the way these messages are shoved in your face over and over just gets repetative and you stop caring.\n\nFor a game to be a game at all, it needs a block. In action games, these are the form of bosses or levels. In adventure games, they need to be puzzles, quests or social interactions. Something to block the path of the game that makes you stop, think, and maybe get the correct answer, or the wrong one, or just pick one out of several bad ones but bad in different ways.\n\nThere are two types of adventure games. We can call them The Longest Journey and Dreamfall, as they both symbolize each side well. TLJ had puzzles, most of them were item puzzles that gave you a inventory where you had to keep many things that might come in handy later on. The items combined with the story to make it feel interactive. Like “I did that!”. Today, we have for example the Deponia series bring up this kind of adventure game again. In Dreamfall, this was replaced with environment puzzles and social puzzles, much like is the fad right now with The Last of Us leading the front. This lowers the intractability of the game, in place for a deeper written storyline, with characters developed much further.\n\nDreamfall chapters is so far the worst possible outcome, where it has very few challenges. Kians Informant and dock puzzles, plus Zoes steam vent puzzle, show that the game developer knows how to do them. I am just so very confused that after two chapters, there has been basically 1 blocking challange.\n\nThe social side of the story is abysmal. The most glaring proof of this is the shrink section. Every positive rewiew speaks paragraph after paragraph on how gorgeous the scenery and background is in this scene. I agree. But what seemingly every single person did was get stunned by the graphics, and stopped listening. The dialoge is cramped. Stuffed into a tiny box and delivered in the most awkward way. This would have been more approperiate if it was the first session but these characters have met eachother for 3 months. Everything they talk about have already been talked about before. So why does the characters edge towards eachother like it is the first date of two extremly shy individuals? The scene makes no sense, especially when the narritive throws several curveballs in players faces that have played the former games.\n\nIf you fail the conversational roadblocks, the game handily removes the wrong answer you picked last time. It is hand holding in the worst kind of patronizing ways. Information as to what you are doing is withheld as much as possible. The weel of interface is severly lacking in descriptions. For example. You need to pick a suspect of selling out information. You can Eye each person in the market. Once you Eye, there is a Hand. NOTHING is mentioned on what these actions DO! You have to guess, and guess what? The Hand instantly makes your pick, no confirmation box of any kind and it is irreversible. Want to try again? Replay the entire game.\n\nMy gutfeeling is that this was intended, as you need to replay the game at least 4 times already to find all of what can be described as story. But this also means that each character, including Zoé, has nothing behind them. Every character, apart from Queene, Mira and Enu, feels like background characters I will forget within 10 seoconds of meeting them, even Zoes background becomes just a blur of nothingness. It is only in the last scenes of each chapter where we actually see some emotions come out of the main character who up to this point has been almost zombielike in her way to interact.\n\nLeading into my next point, the game feels "cut". Events, social interactions, item interactions. Anything to make the gameplay stand out is utterly lacking. Again, this feels very intentional, someone saying "Look at the pretty colors! Look at our fantastic engine!" in a way that had the gameplay been more interactive, better and more emotions (for a test, let the campain manager get beat up. Listen to Zoes reactions. She delivers them in the most unsympathetic and lobotomized voices I have heard for many years.) it would have removed the players attention from all those great things.\n\nAnother thing leading into my next point is the save system. You have 1 save file. That is it! You can replay chapter 2 with the same base save file of chapter 1. But if you want to replay chapter 1, you will automatically delete every saved action. Horrible, HORRIBLE made gamemechanic RTG. Every single adventure game, episodic or not, have multiple savefiles. So that you DON'T have to play EVERYTHING over again.\n\nTime\nTime is an important part of this game. Yet I get the feeling the developers did not have the time they needed. The script is good. Very good in some places. But the delivery of the voiceactors are awful. There is nothing in them. Let the actors have time to get into character. Now, most lines are delivered with horrendously fake voices.\n\nAgain, time feels off in the game. Chapter 1 takes place over a single day. Chapter 2 jumps a week forward in time. The story takes a jump. And it is falling off its feet. Yes, it tries to move forwards and in some aspects it succeeds. But it feels completley discconected from the first chapter (Zoes story, not Kians). If the first chapter was a demo, I would get it. And it nearly is. The second chapter takes about 5-7 hours of gameplay to get through the first time, where the first took 2-2½ hours. The sinking feeling that creeps in is that "This game was never meant to be played OR created episodically". I would still have respect for RTG and Ragnar Thornquist if they had come out in september last year and said "Sorry guys and girls. The game can not be finished by November. We need another year to finish it.". Backers would have been annoyed but understanding. Developing a full game, from scratch, takes more than 1½ years that they had.\n\nTime is something that the game does not give. The replay value should be high in episodic adventure games were you have so many choices, but after playing chapter 2, getting 1 ending, I just felt "Holy ♥♥♥♥. I am not playing through all of that again, just for a slightly different storyline.". This perhaps compared to Life is Strange I have been playing as well. Replayed chapter one 3 times, and chapter two 5 times. Yes, it is a shorter game, but I have more fun, and more interesting choices. The choices in Dreamfall: Chapters are not compelling enough to warrant multiple playthroughs becuase of all the boring ♥♥♥♥ I have to go through again. Having 1 save file is, again, horrible for a game like this.\n\nConclusion. I can not recommend this game at full price right now as it is not up to par with what was expected from it. Once the FULL game is done, out, bug-tested and fixed, I may be inclined to change my opinion but as of now, do NOT buy this game.","November 1, 2014","false","25.5"," 35 of 58 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","35","58","0","1"

The stunning landscapes, cityscapes, new and improved characters, it's all pure eye candy. Good controls. And I had no issue with Zoe's new voice.\n\nBut really, REALLY, did I just wait 8 years to be sent on stupid pointless errands? What happened to Zoe?

Yeah, yeah, I know, it's only chapter 1, and it looks like they're focusing on story and character development, which is fine, but come on... throw us a bone here. Even the cliffhanger was blah even if super cute. If I could describe this game in one word, it would be "bland".\n\nBut the main reason this game grated on my nerves was its blatant, in-you-face political agenda. Oh, look, how cute, Zoe has a Marxist friend! And every other person on the street is wearing a hijab! We're told communists are cool, nationalists are "old white men" with "xenophpobic wet dreams" [sic.] The symbol of the ideology responsible for the deaths of millions of innocent people is displayed on city banners and portrayed as "cool". WHAT?\n\nIt's not that the game creators clearly have political views different from my own. I don't want ANY politics in my games.

It is a huge leap from Dreamfall: The Longest Journey, some of the characters I had trouble recognizing. Visuals aside, the story finally continues the story of Dreamfall, and it is doing it well so far. It definately is on par with Telltale's The Walking Dead in terms of the storytelling department, as there is plenty of "feels." Controls are completely changed and makes interacting with objects and walking around a lot more easy, you can even play the game with just the mouse so that you may pick your nose while you play! The voice acting is supurb and believable, some of the dialogue is comedy gold. The music really sets the tone and plays a big part depending on the situation, really well done. The animations are vastly improved from the last Dreamfall, naturally. There's many choices to make to alter the outcome, they will all have concequences. I wished I supported the kickstarter back in 2013. If you even remotely liked The Longest Journey, or even Dreamfall: The Longest Journey, pick this up. It certainly was worth the wait, unlike Duke Nukem Forever.","October 21, 2014","true","22.4"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","19","30","0","0"

In the same amount of time I played this first "book", I'd have had a fair few interesting and challenging puzzles and there would have been a few events that really piqued my interest  in TLJ . None of that in Chapters so far. As far as "puzzles" go, you're just sent around to fetch stuff and to talk to people.\n\nDon't get me wrong: I'm fine with games that are mainly story-driven, but I would have expected some puzzles from a game that's a successor to one of the best point-and-click adventure games (even if not directly, it's still part of the same series as TLJ). And the events that are there are simply not making me curious as to what will happen next.\n\nMiscellaneous nitpicks: I found a fair few graphic imperfections (seams, floating objects)  and even managed to get out of the map once. The dubbing is OK; but no more than that (Zoe always sounds fairly detached, but she was like that in the previous instalment as well, and I can see why the devs might not want to choose another actress for the characater).\nI felt that one of the choices with Reza was a bit accidental for me (I walked towards him and expected to argue some more, not to do the complete opposite - a more explicit choice might have worked better there).\n\nThe thing that might make things interesting is how the choices will affect the next chapter.\n\n\nFor now, I can't say I'd recomment this.

If you’re new to the series, it likely won’t have nearly as big of an impact on you and you’ll be a bit lost at times. For those gamers like myself who have been waiting for a continuation of the series for YEARS, this is a fantastic continuation of a great story.\n\nPROS:\n\n-    Fantastic storytelling. Character dialogue is fresh and engaging.\n-    Nice graphics. I wouldn’t go so far as to consider them “amazing” but the in-game graphics definitely hold their own amidst other indie current-gen titles.\n-    Great music. The soundtrack stands on its own and provide nice ambient mode.\n\nNEUTRAL:\n\n-    Mediocre gameplay. Very similar to Telltale titles, the gameplay here is very simple and essentially consists of navigating to certain areas and talking to various NPCs. It’s a bit disappointing considering that the original title dating back to 2000 had TONS of puzzles to solve and variety. Oh well.\n\nCONS:\n\n-    Busy work. I hate to say it, but some of the later actiivities in Book 1 seem like busy work. Essentially “here, go talk to XYZ and fetch ABC.” I can forgive that for a bit but after awhile, it gets old and tedious.

As always, when you like something you want to continue doing it and now I'm really looking forward to the upcoming parts. Of course I would have loved if all parts were there for me to play already - just like I would like to start to watch and read the rest of the Game of Thrones/Song of Ice of Fire series, or play Kentucky Route Zero to the end. But my anticipation of upcoming episodes and the possible frustration with the episodic nature of any of these is not a fault on their part, but rather the result of being awesome stories.\n\nDreamfall Chapters is much like the original Dreamfall, a highly enjoyable story in amazing settings with a high focus on dialogue and somewhat less on gameplay and controls. To be fair, the gameplay is much better than in the original Dreamfall, but still nowhere near as good as the story ... (The only hiccup I've found is the totally unnecessary "algae-puzzle" in one of the possible story lines, where you have to steer a robot with really lousy controls in a puzzle that is not the least challenging except to your patience.)\n\nEuropolice, the largest setting is simply amazing. It's huge, beautiful and full of pulse. Going on exploration on your own, besides achieving the necessary goals, is totally worth it. It takes some time to learn to find your way around, but there is a clever (and fun) map system embedded in the gameplay that will get you started. Some of the dialogue between non playable characters you can listen to but not interact with. Still it gives you clues as to what's going on in the city and adds to the feeling of being in a live environment.\n\nThe game is much about decisions and consequences, and though a lot of the consequences are yet to be revealed I like how you are warned and reminded of that your choices matter. The major decision points are marked by a symbol representing "The Balance", so you can think before you jump. But one time I accidentally triggered a choice before I realized that there was one. Fortunately it was late in the game so I can quite easily replay to make a real decision.\n\nFor longer replays the save game system is not great. Your decisions are stored, and the ones you made in your last play through will be the one you keep for the next book. To keep my original decisions even after playing the game again, I have to locate a time stamped save slot from near the end of my first attempt. (Or copy the saved state to a different folder on my computer.) It would be great if you could name your different plays and shift between them inside the game.\n\nAll in all it's a great start of a probably great game. I really recommend it.\n\n\n---\nUpdate after book 2:\n\nI enjoyed the second installment of the game as much as the first. A new huge area to explore (though not yet with the same pulse), and the consequences of many of my earlier decisions are starting to show. Some of them are quite subtle but some are huge and really alters the story and to some extent the characters. I've replayed the first book many times and the second book once, to check out alternatives to my intial choices, but there are so many possible paths that I'm sure there are outcomes that I have yet to see and experience.\n\nAs before, the save game system makes replays harder than necessary. Book 2 does include a partial fix, where each saved game now is automatically named after the chapter. It helps to some degree, but unfortunately existing saves are not updated so they still only has a timestamp and a location.\n\nThe first two books still feel much like an opening - more questions are raised than answers given. But that is to be expected - we still have three more books to look forward to.

Even if you turn down the ambient noise and music volume, the main character's mumbling from the bottom of a metallic barrell is impossible to hear over the maddening, repeating cries of street vendors. How could they screw this up this badly???\n- Endless, pointless dialogue between playable chapters that goes from nowhere to nowhere.\n- Completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ political theme. The story forces the player character to do campaign work for the developers' favourite political ideology - one that has been in steady decline everywhere for several years now but is supposed to be on top again 200 years into the future. The alternatives? Marxists and fascists. 200 years into the future. I mean, seriously???\n- The female protagonist is a wimp and the infantile story needs a spine, while the writers need to lay off the weed.\n- The graphics engine looks less than spectacular, but makes the cooling fans in the graphics card whine at full speed.","June 20, 2015","false","20.9"," 24 of 41 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","24","41","0","0"

The sequel  - Dreamfall, was attempt to cater to new audience with 3rd person view and some arcade elements, but puzzles were still here followed by rich story,  descent game overall. The new game changing it format again, now they decided to ride on Telltale success. If you like "The Wolf among Us" and other Telltale games you would probably like Chapters as well. No more puzzles (unless usage of key on lock is puzzling for you),\nbarely any objects to click on (2-3 hotspots per scene, whole city has like 10 POI) but a lot of dialogs and "choices".\n\nThe choice system is a classical approach with "moral" dilemmas which will affect development of your storyline. On good side - they put some efforts to help you understand your possible options better as each choice is provided with inner monolog with a detailed explanation. On other hand it still not enough and unless you share mindset with dev-team you can't predict reaction and outcomes, common flaw of such games.  Unfortunately there are no saves in game (only auto-save on checkpoint) so you can't play around with different options and need to start new game to see different outcomes.\n\nFirst chapter has around 3.5 hours of gameplay 2.5 of which is dialogs and cutscenes and other hour is you running around city between people you obliged to talk to. Main area of action is very small, even claustrophobic with a lot of reused props.\n\nOn bright side of the game - dialogs and NPC are good, music is pretty good too but it is hard to judge a story yet. Visual style is far from being impressive and also struggle to perform properly in open area of the city. Animation is on bare minimum as well.\n\nCan't recommend unless you are Telltale fan, Also chapter is pretty short so it worth to wait for full pack on sale if you just interested in story continuation of old games.","October 27, 2014","false","5.7"," 39 of 70 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","39","70","0","5"

No spoilers.\n\nIf you've played The Longest Journey and Dreamfall and enjoyed the story, this is a must play. The gameplay is closer to a refined Dreamfall than it is to TLJ, but it's less buggy and without the combat. There are some "adventure" segments with puzzle solving, and a lot of exploring and talking. Lots of great returning characters and familiar locations, along with some new ones too. The artistic direction is pretty incredible, being able to see Marcuria in full 3D is a delight.\n\nA new feature to the series is the introduction of decisions that affect the story. I have currently only played through the four books once, so I'm not sure how "worth it" it is to play again and see different paths, but it's in interesting addition. Decisions can for example effect which location you end up spending some time at, or which ally accompanies you on a mission. I could take or leave this feature, but some may feel strongly about it one way or another.\n\nI am loving the story.

It's a story rich game with a story that is told well and feels believable. The dialogues feel like conversations I could have with my friends instead of being so well scripted like so often happens. Even swearing in dialogues feels very much like how swearing is normally used and not just there because. It's very refreshing to be able to connect with a character so well, being able to make their choices in a way that feels right. The choices also have impact, more impact than I experienced in the Telltale games for example. Some choices are obvious but some seemingly smaller choices have great impact which is absolutely amazing.

It's not smart enough, it's not pretty enough, it's not fun enough, and it's certainly not compelling enough.\n\nWhich is a shame, because it could have been. Parts of it are good. Parts of it made me enjoy it, even enjoy it far more, or far differently than I normally enjoy major titles from major companies.\n\nThe central problem is that the game is too in love with its own setting, and its writing tries to brush off its shortcomings with supposedly clever wit to paper over the fundamental lack of actual emotion in much of the character writing. This essentially manifests in the game being worse the more serious it gets, which means each Book is a steady slide towards worse and worse writing.\n\nKian's half of the story exemplifies this the best, and most all the faults to be found in Zoë's story can be found first with his.\n\nFirstly, his behaviour and personality is completely inappropriate to the tone of his supposed story. A member of a resistance, a traitor to his own, hunted by his former allies. Yet he and the resistance gallivante about in a bar outside the slum which is frequented also by the soldiers of the occupying force! Much of his dialogue consists of the same witticisms that Zoë is fond of sprouting. He can even come to appear laidback. And then the moment a more important scene occurs, all this characterization is cast aside for some nebulous serious personality that seems largely unconnected with his general behaviour.\n\nWhat is worse, Kian's wit is rarely funny, and the gallery of rogues - really, three other characters in total - is distinctly unimpressive, and sadly one-note.\n\nThe resistance proper seems to be driven exclusively by the actions of three individuals and one urchin boy, and their grand plan is nowhere to be seen.\n\nWhat, then, is there to invest in? For what reason might one care about Kian and the resistance?\n\nI cannot answer that question, because to my mind, there is nothing. All that seemed like it might have been worthwhile turned vacuous and meaningless the more it was dwelt on.\n\nBut Zoë, then. What of her? Is there at least some merit to her story?\n\nSome, yes. Fundamentally, Zoë, almost solely from breaking mildly with convention, and from her archetypical pluck, manages to hold on to some coherent characterization. But it doesn't seem able to last. The pressures of the plot are driving her into a role that the writing cannot sustain, and her coherence and integrity seems to dissolve as she reacts in the same blandly determined manner to any sort of challenge or setback.\n\nAnd in the end, the core plot itself is simply not interesting enough to sustain the game on its own.","June 28, 2015","false","19.9"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

I get nostalgia and a warm fuzzy feeling when I think about these games which honestly, are my favorite games of all time. They have one of the best stories (if not 'THE best story) a video game can have, drawing you in the beautifull narative and the cool puzzles that the main characters have to solve to proggress further into the story. This game, Dreamfall Chapters has done justice to the series. The story is rich, mysterious, and immersive. The characters are well made and complex, they feel really natural, and they are not classical stereotype characters. The graphics and sound effects are stellar. I can not recommend this game enough, especialy for someone who played the first two games of the series.\n@Red Thread Games:  I love what you've done with the game! Congratulations, you've brought back my favorite game from childhood and it really shines, it really is a faithfull sequel to Dreamfall. Now, that being said, it is one of the most poorly optimized games I have played in my life.  I have upgraded my PC for it, now I have a Radeon HD 6850 video card, an X3 455 AMD processor and 4 GB of RAM. Sorry guys, but it is unacceptable for a system that can run Battlefield 4 and Assasin's Creed and al the cool eye candy shooters at medium to high settings, to not be able to decently run this game at even medium one (I am expecialy reffering to Europolis, the Chinese market, where the game lags like hell - like 20 seconds stutter - the picture is frozen for 15-20 seconds - when I move the camera or when I enter the area from the Sonenschein Plaza). Please tell me, is Europolis more dependant on the CPU, RAM or GPU? Anyway I am awaiting for a processor I ordered to arrive now, it is a FX 6100 and I will soon upgrade to 8 GB RAM as well. Anyway I have read from other guys that have better systems than mine (even the one I will have after upgrade) that the game still lags...

The Zoe's butt story has a bit more psycological approach than before, which is good. It provies you Zoe's butt some choices.

I think this game is a must have for The Longest Journey fans (and also adventure gamers). 9/10.","December 1, 2014","true","36.3"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I was confused by this at first.  It makes more sense to think of the game as a volume of books with continuing chapters (book 1 is chapters 1-3, book 2 is chapters 3-5, that kind of thing).\n\nWith that said, give it until at least book 3 (chapter 6-7).  I wish books 1-2 were a bit more palatable.  The foul language and tense personal relationships just ground a bit on me because, in a game full of decisions, I had little control over them except at a high level.  Oh well.  I got past it.  Chapter 3 is where it took off.  Some of the early decisions can have big ramifications, but the thing is, you can only guess at their ramifications.  There is no combat.  The tension that combat might usually serve is replaced by decisions that you can only make once (unless you reload prior to the decision and do it again).\n\nThe music is setting appropriate, the scripting is clever (Enu is great, as is the best bird in gaming, Crow) and taps into events in previous Longest Journey games, the voice acting is clear and fleshes out the characters (again, props to Enu and Crow), and despite a bug now and then (as of this writing, 3-20-2016), I would recommend this game.  21 hours in and I'm through book 4 and waiting for book 5!  If I was faster at some of the puzzles, a playthrough would have been a couple hours shorter.","March 20","true","22.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

It may only be the first of five chapters, but it's still one of my favorite games of 2014. It represents everything that I enjoy about modern narrative-driven adventure games.\n\nI love that you get to see the mundane everyday life stuff. I loved getting to explore Europolis and talk to everyone and interact with everything. I love the semi-dystopian cyberpunk future setting that reminds me of the likes of Deus Ex Human Revolution's Detroit. I love the branching conversations and decisions reminiscent of The Walking Dead or The Wolf Among Us (Red Thread seems to draw a lot of inspiration from TellTale, which is certainly not a bad thing in my eyes).\n\nI'm a relative newcomer to this series - I picked up and played through The Longest Journey and the original Dreamfall just weeks before Dreamfall Chapters came out. I'm certainly glad I did - they're both great games on their own, and frankly the brief video synopsis isn't really enough to get to know the characters and care about them. That said, Dreamfall Chapters is definitely my favorite of the trilogy so far; they seem to have learned their lessons from the previous games, and have brought it more in line with "modern" adventure games. I highly recommend playing through the whole trilogy.","January 12, 2015","true","27.3"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

This game has really figured out how to translate the traditional point and click adventure games into a full 3D world while keeping the wonder, immersion, good story telling  and rich world. The game focuses heavily on delivering a good story, adopting some interactive elements from Telltale but also improving upon their formula and adding their own features. It also has a great soundtrack that really drives  home the emotions the narrative delivers.\n\nThe game is not afraid of tackling difficult issues and mature topics, and this seems to be the main reasons people have given negative reviews here on Steam. However the game tackles these issues in a multidimensional way, and you'd do well not to judge the portrayal too quickly.\n\nI've been looking forwards to this game for years, and I think it's really delivered. With Episode 3 of 5 being right around the corner at the time of writing this, I think it's absolutely worth picking up. For me the first episode alone would have been worth the asking price for the whole season.","June 12, 2015","true","80.0"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aurinband/recommended/237850/","aurinband","MelodicEnmity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aurinband/","104 products in account","In my opinion, my favorite game ever created would have to be The Longest Journey. I believe not only did it have one of the best and intriguing stories of any video game, it was a "thinking person's" game. It was beautifully crafted, fully detailed, featured superb voice acting, and contained challenging puzzle-gameplay. TLJ not only gave us one of the coolest female heroines, April Ryan, but created an entire world to get sucked up in. Most movies getting pumped out today do not have half the creativity that TLJ did.\n\nDreamfall, the sequel, was an amazing game as well, though not without its faults (horrible combat system for one), that brought the loveable Zoe Castillo character into the limelight. Now we have Dreamfall Chapters, the continuation of the Zoe character arc and world.\n\nDreamfall Chapters is one of the best games I have played in years. I am a fan of adventure games and they seem to be taking off in episodic, choice-making formats. I have played quite a number of them, and have to say that Dreamfall Chapters is about the only game where your choices do matter and have drastic effect on the gameplay. Even though Telltale and DONTNOD have made some incredible games, Red Thread is about the only company to truly master a choice making format in my honest opinion.\n\nAs far as Dreamfall Chapters itself, there is nothing lazy about how this game is crafted. Just like The Longest Journey, Dreamfall Chapters is meticulously detailed and meaningful. As the books progress, the puzzles do go up in difficulty, but still not quite near the challenge that The Longest Journey provided.\n\nI ultimately feel that Dreamfall Chapters provides the best aspects of both games. I can't wait for Book 4!\n\nI can only find two cons:\n\n1) Does this really have to end after Book 5? I think I speak for a lot of old Funcom and now Red Thread fans by saying "we want more!"\n2) There is no set release date or official announcement for The Longest Journey home. It would be a dark era of gaming if TLJH does not get made, as it is what started it all and deserves a proper sequel and possible closing for April Ryan's story.","August 5, 2015","true","21.4"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","10","17","0","0"

The graphics are breathtaking and the soundtrack is simply amazing. The gamplay revives the old point and click adventure genre, which is a fine change from the general FPS and other action games that I usually play. The game's storyline is based around the choices that you do or don't make, seemingly driving home moral choices and decisions with consequences. I found myself immersed in the storyline and am probably going to try and find the previous two games so that I can "catch up" with the story so far. I found myself running around and interacting with almost everything that I could just to hear the part of Zoe's inner monologue.

It's been three months since the last episode came out.  The wait has been kind of insane for an episodic series, and at this rate, the finale will be some time in 2016.  Because of how much time has passed, I have barely any memory of what happened in the first episode (Something about a spicy sausage, a Muslim prison riot and a space baby...), and it will take some work to get emotionally reinvested in the game by the time chapter 2 comes out, whenever that is.\n\nI'd say forget this is a thing, and just wait for 2016 to buy the whole thing on sale for ten bucks.\n\n- Update 3/12/15 -\n\nThe second chapter is just coming out this week, making it nearly five months between two hour chapters.  No apologies or explanation from the developer, this is just how they've decided to do business.

This first episode - with immersive story telling and descriptions of the world around you - sets the pace for what's to come in the next 4 books.\n\nAnd if you think that one added layer of story to the universe is enough for RTG ? Well it's not. Not to spoil things but even in book one it's appearent there's a new depth to be found in this already rich story which makes it very "meta".\n\nThe story builds up and becomes very "ominous" in many ways. There's that layer which is in front of your face. Zoë wakes up from her coma, has to follow therapy to find her place in the world again, finds a hobby in rallying for a political party as volunteer, and goes back to work in what she has been schooled for.\n\nSo its obvious that we continue the obvious bits from Dreamfall, we resume our relationship with Reza, we remember bits and pieces from our ordeal with Waticorp but not everything. But something is ominous, not everything is like it seems. And I'm not only talking about how you can make regarding your relationship with reza, the political party and your Psychiatrist. Nothing is like it seems, and the pedestrians you encounter as Zoë sometimes send you weird messages.\n\nAs Kian, you get a new chance to redeem his character and he'll have to help the resistance to the Azadi, and he does so because we find out that he feels he owes a debt to the "northlanders" after killing their scorpion. So he came to his senses and is now helping the rebellion against his own people. In that quest you'll be making some hard choises and this is what makes the game interesting.\n\nStory wise it's all okey. It hands you interesting choises and bits to ponder about and it's fun to replay the game so you can see all aspects of the story unfolding and see un expected outcomes.\n\nRunning around in marcuria and europolis is also very cool. The city is big but not super huge. After a few runs, I start to remember and orient myself and that creates a bonding with these areas. The game offers no compas, just an inworld map. As you learn to localize the different sectors in both world, I have the feeling that I'm drawn more into that fantasy because it makes me think about the location names and pinpoint their location as I walk. The old town market in marcura, the souk in Europolis, I start feeling like Zoë and Kian and start associating locations just like I would with my real life city.\n\nThe only few negative things I have to say about the game is some puzzle stuff and the technology side of t hings, but there's positivity in there even:\n\nI feel that unity 4.6 (the engine they are using) seems to be unable to render the game at fluid fps even if you have a geforce 970, but having the misfortune to have an i5 from several generations back doesn't help the case ofcourse. Because the engine is very cpu bound and runs on one thread.\n\nI have to be intellectually honest as well and say that these guys did a massive job of creating such a rich and detailed world in that engine. Even some professionals are in awe to see such a densely populated world can be created with that engine. So they really push it to its limit.\n\nKinda like what we did with our left 4 dead expansion, we were constantly flirting with the source edicts limitation. But this as a side note.\n\nThe great thing is that, to release the game (I am talking again about Dreamfall Chapters) on playstation 4, they need to port everything over to unity 5 and optimize. When they completed that task which they said almost wrecked their company, The game ran almost at double the FPS for the same settings on several computer configurations including mine. Unity 5.2 offers lots more cpu optimization as well as improvement in the rendering engine. So as the road is evened for the game to be released on PS4 as well. So that's the positive about this negative point I'm describing.\n\nAnother little "meh", is that you only seem to be able to activate a multi task puzzle from one option, which will activate all others. For example: in Marcuria, when Kian has to blow up the Azadi weapon stack, you HAVE to start outside the south gate and pick upo the black powder, then all other options for that puzzle inside the south gate (such as the nails) will become available for pickup or interaction. To me, this was confusing at first, as I just knew from visual inspection that there were a few opportunities for that puzzle.\n\nThere are other "jittery" puzzle activations like that such as the azadi runner. You can manipulate it in such a way that you can shortcut his loop. I know this is done for convenience so that you don't have to wait for him to run the entire loop, but as you learn that you can just wait for him at the junction where he has to go left and right, you ofcourse adopt this procedure of working.\n\nBook 4 is such a wonderful journey that takes me back and makes my heart jump because you revisit several crucial locations and new wonderous places that are really really having the TLJ stamp on them.\n\nIt's so nice that I kinda wish the game wasn't such an interactive walking simulator at that point. I wish that when Zoë arrived in the 2 magical new locations, there would be some kind of puzzle for you to solve, so you bond more with the place other than to live the story, which is very superb, but a puzzle where you had to work a bit to get to see these story bits, would have been nice.\n\nThat's it for now. I'm adding to this review as consequent books come out.","October 24, 2014","true","126.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

That's all.\n\nIf you have NOT played The Longest Journey and/or Dreamfall: TLJ, I highly recommend you do so. If this game looks at all appealing to you, or if you love a good story and have the time (first 2 games will probably run you over 50 hours, easily). Playing the first 2 games will make this one much more relevant. I can see that it may not be necessary, but the depth of backstory that's apparent in Chapters will make it worthwhile. (For instance, new players will not get the full emotionally crushing blow when they meet the Mole. And WHO really IS Lady Alvane? Man I can't wait to find out.)\n\nWhile the graphics are dated (especially for TLJ), much of the original game art consists of hand painted backgrounds, so it's still lovely to look at (especially parts of Arcadia and April's dreams). I re-play both games about once every 1-2 years, and they're still worth it. They're like being inside a particularly good fantasy/sci-fi novel. Every character is relevant, loveable (even the villains) and authentic.\n\nFavourite game series of all time.

I enjoy it so much that I consider playing it again just to find out the other options I have not chosen yet. I understand why some people dislike the "telltale" type of this game as well as the aimless wandering, which at times, is absolutely dreadful. If you are stuck and you simply have no way to tell where you need to go next or what to do next it can become painful.\n\nBut the story itself is both, absolutely fascinating as well as scary. Considering how far we have come today with virtual reality, this game gives you a slight climpse of the "bad facors" of such devices. I do not want to spoil anything, but anyone who knows a bit about Zoe, knows what the Dream Machines are about.\n\nNow, for those who do not know the story at all, there is a trailer in the game that you can watch at the beginning, It will tell you in short the story of the past and lead you to the current happenings.\n\nIn short:\n+ Deep Story\n+ Deep Character Backgrounds\n+ Quite a few good laughs and chuckles\n+ Cleverly written in some parts and hideously translated (german) in other parts.

There are minor problems, the voice cuts (choppy) at times during recap, long loading screen, lots of "where was that place again?" situations, and some say certain parts of the story didn't quite add up, though they liked the game a lot.\n\nI loved the story, the need to think some of the puzzles through, the characters.

The only thing that really matters is that this is an adventure made with an incredible amount of love and care. Awesome, tragic, deep. Very consistent. All that's left is Book Five, which is, well, coming soon.\n\nGraphical and sound design are executed very thorough. This is a very solid work, with the teeny-tiny exception of voicing for some characters, especially Reza. Voice volume levels are also tend to differ from chapter to chapter, but I can live with that.\n\nAs for technical realization, well -- as a Linux gamer, I'm quite used to all sorts of glitches. Fortunately, they are mostly visual, due to use of some shaders which are not available in *nix-version of Unity. Lack of optimization also shows, for I'm struggling at Arcadia with medium graphic settings set, on a rig running 2-gig GTX750Ti b\w AMD quad-core and 32 Gbytes of RAM. Propast, on the other way, runs super-smoothly. Dunno what I'm doing wrong, to be honest.\n\nNevertheless, ported version is, well, okay. It's stable, it's not crashing. And Linux is my personal choice, so I guess most people won't encounter these issues which I've mentioned.\n\nTo summarize: yes, this, in my opinion, is a good game. It does not feature complex puzzles. Sometimes it suffers from technical issues. But I do recommend it, for it's a game made with unbelievable amount of love & attention to details of the story (which is pretty much what you'd want from an adventure/quest), memorable characters -- and let's not forget great soundtrack.\n\nSo yeah, don't be a greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and buy this one already.

If you haven't played the previous two games The Longest Journey or Dreamfall please go out and play them, even if you only play Dreamfall. This game references them heavily, requiring the player to have some prerequisite knowledge in order to put events in the game into context. Thankfully it doesn't sacrifice the pace of the story in lieu of accessibility.\n\nIt's a recurring theme actually. In a choice between story and something else, this game chooses the former. Every single time. You'll need to set your own expectations, if you come into this expecting something akin to a fantastic interactive story with some extremely well realised characters, you will not be disappointed. If you're the type of person that gets bored with dialogue and skips cutscenes to carry on playing then refrain from purchasing it.\n\nLike Myst, Gone Home, and The Walking Dead, this is an experience that requires you to take a back seat, and just enjoy the narrative presented. After seeing a presentation from Red Thread a year or two back, I was worried that the new choice system would be a cliched binary "save the puppy" or "eat the puppy alive" moral dichotomy, and that it would compromise the main characters' intended personalities. Thankfully that isn't the case. Choices never fall outside their conceivable paths of action, but there are clear distinctions between them. Neither do a lot of them centre on a moral choice, instead them being a personal one.\n\nArt direction is as fantastic as ever, and they really manage to drive home the wider state of the world, particularly in Europolis. Last time around it was Arcadia that blew me away so it's a nice change. There are some flaws in execution, such as weirdly skinned characers, art assets that can be a little rough, and some minor shader issues. But if you a consider it a tradeoff to prevent a situation as in Dragon Age 2 where areas and assets were just constantly re-used I'd happily take it.\n\nI do have issues with framerate in some parts, but since I haven't updated my drivers in ever I'll refrain from making a judgement on it just yet.\n\ntl;dr: If you played and like the previous two, it offers everything they did and more. You won't be disappointed with it. If you're new to the franchise purchase and play the previous one first, if not both. If you like them buy this one. If you hate games with cutscenes and dialogue, only wanting to get to the next level, then stay away like the plague.","October 25, 2014","true","31.8"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","1"

It felt like the first AAA adventure game since Lucasarts decline, with graphics and audio that still hold up today. I guess nobody bought it since it took this long for the sequel to come out.\n\nIn many ways Dreamfall Chapters is disappointing to me, but it still manages to hit a good enough quality level across the board to be an acceptable sequel. There’s shortcuts all over the place in the production, like missing animations, simplistic audio design, clipping, etc. It’s clearly a mid-budget production compared to Dreamfall.\n\nSo far only “Book 1” of the story is out. It establishes the setting and the characters, without kicking off the story properly. This makes it a bit frustrating to play as you can feel it’s just about to get interesting when it ends. Time will solve this problem as more chapters are released. It shows a lot of promise! A few scenes in it are great. But then there’s a long slow bit that put a damper on my enthusiasm.\n\nIt’s missing much of what I admired in Dreamfall 2006 from a technical perspective. Like the audio design, which is still top of the class. Believe it or not, Dreamfall 2006 is a good game to test subwoofers with. It pumps out ferocious bass in one early game sequence. It also had a ton of one-off ambient sounds, like the sound of a riot. It was purely for mood, as the riot played no part in the story and wasn’t addressed by characters. Environmental storytelling through ambient sound design.\n\nNone of that is in Dreamfall Chapters. Everything is on an acceptable level, without pushing the boundaries. They should be able to keep this level of quality consistent across the entire game without going broke. Despite all my reservations I can’t wait to see where the story goes from here. The writing is of the same quality as the other entries, for good and ill. The style of humor, the same kinds of characters, the same type of story. It’s all here. If you liked the other games, you get more of it from Dreamfall Chapters.","November 1, 2014","true","18.5"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

I like that you can make choices that affect the way the game unfolds although it is not clear in what way it affects the game as yet. Kudos to the developers for doing some radical things including role-playing Saga, a toddler! It was so cute to listen to her babbling and giggling as I explored the house and tried to dodge Dad to get to the shiny sparkly thing!  The characters are not stereotypes, there is no gratuitous cleavage, what a change that is!  What I don't like about it: there is not much to get one's teeth into yet but hopefully that will come. Also the people of Propast: no kids (except one), very few old people, no fat people, body types are the same (i.e. "ideal") (great that there is a lot of ethnic diversity though).

The developers should have taken this into consideration and maybe added in quick snippets of "flashbacks" from the previous game the moment you meet one of these characters, there are a few games that do this, especially the Metal Gear Solid series, and it's very effective.\n\nGraphics-wise, this game is both very aesthetically pleasing but there is the case where the blending of colors gets a little messy... maybe that's just my computer, I dunno, I don't judge too harshly when it comes to graphics unless they are outright crap, which isn't the case.\n\nKnowing this is one of those "visual novel"-esque adventure games, my judgment knows not to expect "over the top" action and gameplay, but more on revolving around being immersed in the story and context, and by god does Dreamfall do just that. I indeed felt very pressured when confronted with difficult choices, especially towards the end with the boyfriend. I think that's the few times in my life where thinking like a woman helps you greatly in that kind of situation, but I won't delve too deeply into it because spoilers.\n\nThe humor is pretty good, but don't expect to laugh at every scene of course. The dialogue is very well-written, and I absolutely LOVE adventure games that have more than a single piece of dialogue whenever you examine something more than once.\n\nThe soundtrack is okay, it has its moment every now and then but it's nothing to write home about.\n\nHerein lies the main issue I found, and it isn't just a problem for Dreamfall Chapters: the complexity of the problems you have to solve to progress in the game relates to that of a children's puzzle game; the difficulty of the game may be far too easy, even for an adventure game. I shouldn't be able to complete a chapter within 3 hours simply because the challenges of the game involved "go to Point B, pick up Item X, return to Point A, repeat for the next challenge." Maybe this will be resolved in the later books, but so far, that's only the first half of the issues.\n\nThe last of the issues I found in Dreamfall is that the depth of your choices as it relates to what Zoe is thinking in coordination to what she actually says doesn't actually match up. To clarify: If for one choice (and this is all made up and does NOT contain any spoilers) Zoe is thinking "Hmm, if I tell Character Z about the romantic relationship between Characters H and J, he might think I'm trying to sabotage their efforts for my own gain, maybe I shouldn't tell him about it at all", I expect her to not say anything about the relationship at all, not say "Well there is that one issue between two lovers, but I don't want to get into it." There are instances in the game where what Zoe says doesn't match up with what you were going for, if that makes any sense. I noticed this to be more problematic when you're on the old woman's boat, but I won't say anything else for the sake of spoilers.\n\nOverall, I'm very ecstatic about the game and would recommend it to anyone. All I can hope for is that this excitement for looking forward to the future chapters doesn't turn into Buyer's Remorse as some people had with The Walking Dead.","March 12, 2015","true","5.2"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AltQ_Q/recommended/237850/","AltQ_Q","Meowcomb Turdballs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AltQ_Q/","273 products in account","Over eight years have passed since Funcom published Dreamfall, a sequel to the acclaimed point-and-click adventure game, The Longest Journey. The sad news was that Dreamfall failed to sell enough to make any established publishers interested in resurrecting the franchise and all hope for a sequel seemed lost. With the advent of crowd-funding, Ragnar Tornquist (writer/director of all TLJ games) created a new studio (Red Thread Games), seized the opportunity and launched a Kickstarter to build the conclusion to Zoe Castillo’s story.\n\nAfter smashing their initial target, ecstatic fans (including yours truly) settled into another long wait with excitement and enthusiasm, along with trepidation and fear that the game may not live up to nostalgic expectations. Red Thread Games have already proven these fears unfounded. If you loved Dreamfall, you will fall in love all over again with Chapters. I expect the reverse is also true though, and haters or non-fans of the former will not be wooed by the latter.\n\nFor those of you who haven’t yet played Dreamfall and the first cutscene of Chapters, I’d recommend exercising caution as spoilers are ahead.\n\nWhen you launch Chapters for the first time, there is a newly minted recap of the previous game available; Highly recommended if it’s been a while since you last visited the worlds of Arcadia and Stark.\n\nUpon beginning a new game, the prologue begins almost immediately after the final moments and frustrating climax (see: cliffhanger) of Dreamfall, refreshing us on the situations the playable characters are in.\n\nWe see April Ryan’s funeral ceremony, presumably indicating that she did in fact die, apparently ending the debates floating around various internet forums post-Dreamfall. That being said, let’s be realistic. There’s no way she won’t be featured at some point later on. Dreamfall may be Zoe’s story, but The Longest Journey is April’s – and it’s not yet complete.\n\nZoe is still in her coma, and has become a guardian to those trapped in the “Dreamtime”, within nightmares they can’t escape from brought on by using ubiquitous “Dream Machines”.Kian Alvane is languishing in prison with his execution looming, sentenced for betraying his kin during the latter stages of Dreamfall.\n\nChapters then gives first control of the player to Zoe, trapped in “Dreamtime”, helping others while musing on the state of her corporeal body. Book One offers the first two chapters of the overall story and a short interlude before coming to an end all too quickly.\n\nThe length of the episode is a double-edged sword: a cause for frustration and anticipation. After many years of waiting for any scrap of news about development, then development itself, Book One is then over in roughly four hours. However, given the developers have stated this is the shortest of the five Books, the game should be well over 20 hours by the time it is complete. That’s as much as I was hoping for – the length of a season of television or similar long-form storytelling.\n\nThe writing and dialogue are top notch in the given medium. The lines are snappy, and the characters themselves are ever relatable and unique. The Europolis portion of the first chapter is deeply political and although set far into the future, is (like much good Sci-Fi) more relevant than ever and tackles issues of authoritarianism and corporatocracy with Orwellian overtones.\n\nAs the player reaches certain junctions and crossroads during the story, you are given various choices with seemingly important and varying consequences. At this stage, apart from one fairly major branch in the initial chapter, how choices effect the game remains to be seen.\n\nI imagine it’s causing many headaches from a design perspective to plan and write for all the different story branches that have already been opened up from the choices made (ideally moving away from norm in games whereby different choices ultimately result in exactly the same outcomes). I’m cautiously awaiting how these are addressed later on. I suppose my skepticism is due to the fact no game has so far accomplished what Red Thread are trying to achieve. Fingers crossed.\n\nThe core gameplay of Chapters is fairly similar to its’ predecessor, with third-person movement and control, interacting with objects in the environment and with the numerous, lengthy cutscenes rendered in-game. The combat and stealth sections of the original Dreamfall are gone, to the disappointment of absolutely noone who played the previous game. They were ♥♥♥♥ing atrocious and I breathed a sigh of relief to know they’re gone.\n\nIt’s hard to judge much of the gameplay of Dreamfall Chapters just yet, given that Book One serves as a tutorial and a foundation of what is to come. It would be unfair of me at this stage to level too much criticism on puzzle elements, but I’ll have more to say on these elements in future reviews. Book One simply gives the player a crash course with interacting with items, the interface and the game world. Given my past experience, all initial puzzles were a breeze and I was never stuck trying to figure something out. For the most part, I moved effortlessly from point to point eager to advance the story.\n\nAs far as the technical side of the game goes, it’s not always sunshine and roses. The Unity engine is at the core of the game, with awesome visuals thanks to the hard work of the Red Thread team, but with the warts and lesions of an emergent platform more suited to mobile games on a smaller scale. Especially in Europolis, performance issues plagued the experience. Even running a GTX 970 and a powerful Intel processor, I barely managed 30 FPS with dips below 15. The area looks nice – but not THAT nice.\n\nApparently (since I played) the developers have already made sweeping improvements to overall performance and stability, but as Europolis is the largest and most ambitious game area ever created in Unity it’s no surprise that it’s causing issues in playability and performance. This detracted significantly from my immersion during these sections, and I’m hoping that when we revisit Europolis in later chapters we can look forward to a much smoother ride.\n\nOn a lighter note, just as we’re accustomed to from previous games, the voice acting and music are superb. The actors do a fine job bringing the script to life, often times better than in previous games. My main gripe is that the characters in-game have poor facial animations and visual delivery of lines hasn’t improved much from 2006’s Dreamfall. I often found myself looking away from the screen during prolonged conversations and absorbing the material as if it were a novel or script, rather than subjecting myself to the uncanny-valley visuals of the stiff models in-game.\n\nI enjoyed my time with Book One, although it was far too brief. If the developers can maintain consistency in writing and design interesting/challenging puzzles, I’ll be happy. However, performance improvements are vital to improve the overall experience and I’d love to see more attention given to facial animations and expressions. Dreamfall Chapters is approaching greatness but it’s not quite there yet.\n\nIt’s early days yet and I can’t wait for more.","November 12, 2014","true","13.8"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

There's been so much hard work and dedication put into the making of it, I fail to see any cons. I put my faith completely blind in it and even though I am always sceptical in such situations I finished the game being absolutely mesmerized and hungry for more! It's a sequel with nothing ruined (that's a big deal these days...) : the characters, the plot, the choices, all live up to their past.

I finished the game twice and am still going for more playthroughs to make sure I have covered everything it has to offer.\n\nTL;DR: Awesome graphics, engaging plot, decision making, easy controls but lacking in character animating and... a bit short. 9/10\n\nP.S.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AltQ_Q/recommended/237850/","AltQ_Q","Meowcomb Turdballs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AltQ_Q/","273 products in account","Over eight years have passed since Funcom published Dreamfall, a sequel to the acclaimed point-and-click adventure game, The Longest Journey. The sad news was that Dreamfall failed to sell enough to make any established publishers interested in resurrecting the franchise and all hope for a sequel seemed lost. With the advent of crowd-funding, Ragnar Tornquist (writer/director of all TLJ games) created a new studio (Red Thread Games), seized the opportunity and launched a Kickstarter to build the conclusion to Zoe Castillo’s story.\n\nAfter smashing their initial target, ecstatic fans (including yours truly) settled into another long wait with excitement and enthusiasm, along with trepidation and fear that the game may not live up to nostalgic expectations. Red Thread Games have already proven these fears unfounded. If you loved Dreamfall, you will fall in love all over again with Chapters. I expect the reverse is also true though, and haters or non-fans of the former will not be wooed by the latter.\n\nFor those of you who haven’t yet played Dreamfall and the first cutscene of Chapters, I’d recommend exercising caution as spoilers are ahead.\n\nWhen you launch Chapters for the first time, there is a newly minted recap of the previous game available; Highly recommended if it’s been a while since you last visited the worlds of Arcadia and Stark.\n\nUpon beginning a new game, the prologue begins almost immediately after the final moments and frustrating climax (see: cliffhanger) of Dreamfall, refreshing us on the situations the playable characters are in.\n\nWe see April Ryan’s funeral ceremony, presumably indicating that she did in fact die, apparently ending the debates floating around various internet forums post-Dreamfall. That being said, let’s be realistic. There’s no way she won’t be featured at some point later on. Dreamfall may be Zoe’s story, but The Longest Journey is April’s – and it’s not yet complete.\n\nZoe is still in her coma, and has become a guardian to those trapped in the “Dreamtime”, within nightmares they can’t escape from brought on by using ubiquitous “Dream Machines”.Kian Alvane is languishing in prison with his execution looming, sentenced for betraying his kin during the latter stages of Dreamfall.\n\nChapters then gives first control of the player to Zoe, trapped in “Dreamtime”, helping others while musing on the state of her corporeal body. Book One offers the first two chapters of the overall story and a short interlude before coming to an end all too quickly.\n\nThe length of the episode is a double-edged sword: a cause for frustration and anticipation. After many years of waiting for any scrap of news about development, then development itself, Book One is then over in roughly four hours. However, given the developers have stated this is the shortest of the five Books, the game should be well over 20 hours by the time it is complete. That’s as much as I was hoping for – the length of a season of television or similar long-form storytelling.\n\nThe writing and dialogue are top notch in the given medium. The lines are snappy, and the characters themselves are ever relatable and unique. The Europolis portion of the first chapter is deeply political and although set far into the future, is (like much good Sci-Fi) more relevant than ever and tackles issues of authoritarianism and corporatocracy with Orwellian overtones.\n\nAs the player reaches certain junctions and crossroads during the story, you are given various choices with seemingly important and varying consequences. At this stage, apart from one fairly major branch in the initial chapter, how choices effect the game remains to be seen.\n\nI imagine it’s causing many headaches from a design perspective to plan and write for all the different story branches that have already been opened up from the choices made (ideally moving away from norm in games whereby different choices ultimately result in exactly the same outcomes). I’m cautiously awaiting how these are addressed later on. I suppose my skepticism is due to the fact no game has so far accomplished what Red Thread are trying to achieve. Fingers crossed.\n\nThe core gameplay of Chapters is fairly similar to its’ predecessor, with third-person movement and control, interacting with objects in the environment and with the numerous, lengthy cutscenes rendered in-game. The combat and stealth sections of the original Dreamfall are gone, to the disappointment of absolutely noone who played the previous game. They were ♥♥♥♥ing atrocious and I breathed a sigh of relief to know they’re gone.\n\nIt’s hard to judge much of the gameplay of Dreamfall Chapters just yet, given that Book One serves as a tutorial and a foundation of what is to come. It would be unfair of me at this stage to level too much criticism on puzzle elements, but I’ll have more to say on these elements in future reviews. Book One simply gives the player a crash course with interacting with items, the interface and the game world. Given my past experience, all initial puzzles were a breeze and I was never stuck trying to figure something out. For the most part, I moved effortlessly from point to point eager to advance the story.\n\nAs far as the technical side of the game goes, it’s not always sunshine and roses. The Unity engine is at the core of the game, with awesome visuals thanks to the hard work of the Red Thread team, but with the warts and lesions of an emergent platform more suited to mobile games on a smaller scale. Especially in Europolis, performance issues plagued the experience. Even running a GTX 970 and a powerful Intel processor, I barely managed 30 FPS with dips below 15. The area looks nice – but not THAT nice.\n\nApparently (since I played) the developers have already made sweeping improvements to overall performance and stability, but as Europolis is the largest and most ambitious game area ever created in Unity it’s no surprise that it’s causing issues in playability and performance. This detracted significantly from my immersion during these sections, and I’m hoping that when we revisit Europolis in later chapters we can look forward to a much smoother ride.\n\nOn a lighter note, just as we’re accustomed to from previous games, the voice acting and music are superb. The actors do a fine job bringing the script to life, often times better than in previous games. My main gripe is that the characters in-game have poor facial animations and visual delivery of lines hasn’t improved much from 2006’s Dreamfall. I often found myself looking away from the screen during prolonged conversations and absorbing the material as if it were a novel or script, rather than subjecting myself to the uncanny-valley visuals of the stiff models in-game.\n\nI enjoyed my time with Book One, although it was far too brief. If the developers can maintain consistency in writing and design interesting/challenging puzzles, I’ll be happy. However, performance improvements are vital to improve the overall experience and I’d love to see more attention given to facial animations and expressions. Dreamfall Chapters is approaching greatness but it’s not quite there yet.\n\nIt’s early days yet and I can’t wait for more.","November 12, 2014","true","13.8"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

Then it was all just rumors in the wind, looking for any glimmer we would see the sequel happen. it's hard to be unbiased about this game having such a love for it, from a fans perspective, it does stumble quote often. since the update to the Unity 5 engine, the performance issues have been resolved and the game looks graphics were turned up to 11, also in this day and age we should have support for ultrawide resolutions. overall i enjoyed this game and have easily gotten my bang for the buck entertainment. book 4....wow....i can't begin to say how hard the hammer was dropped in this one. it's finally coming to an end. 16 years. i've waited a long time to see this end. to reach the end of the longest journey is kind of a joke. but truly is my favorite game series of all time. hopefully the last book will meet our expectations and i can finally see the end to this amazing story.","December 18, 2015","true","28.9"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

Hard to tell from this first part if it will live up to the high expectations.  As usual, great music.  Graphics are pretty but not always run smoothly. Not much gameplay though.  Don't bother if you haven't played Dreamfall (or didn't like it).\n\nEdit: with Book Two (minor spoilers for Book One)\nWhere Book One feels like the introduction or opening chapter in a book where the scene is set, Book Two develops the story much further.  You are still playing Kian, the ex-warrior/'apostle' who's now working for the rebels in the parallel fantasy world 'Arcadia'; as well as Zoe who is trying to rebuild her post-amnesia life in 'our' future world 'Stark', but keeps getting drawn into intrigues and conspiracies.  The patches have improved the performances.  Like Book One, choices play a big part and the game sort of hits you over your head with 'Your Choices Will have CONSEQUENCES', repeatedly (not that it's necessarily a bad thing though).  NPCs are all well-rounded characters and believable.  Voice acting and music remains fantastic.  Some of the puzzles are not intuitive, but not nearly as difficult as 'old-school' adventure games like this game's predecessors 'The Longest Journey' or 'Dreamfall'.","November 8, 2014","true","31.0"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","0"

Simon Poole, the composer, does a great job with the score and it plays along effectivly with the visuals. In addition, Egil Olsen, a singer/ songwriter from Norway, is featured in the streets of Propast. In other words, Red Thread Games really pays attention to details.\n\nI would say that this is one of the more successful Kickstarter games, maybe even one of the best projects in a while. The team delivers regardless of the delays they have had, inter alia the upgrade to the newer Unity 5 engine.\n\nThere is a lack of story based games that actually focus on the story rather than the fighting to create suspense and action.

Available load points or selecting Continue always seem to dump me at the autosave points that occur after interactions and storyline shifts. For the most part, this was only a minor annoyance as the game saves often enough, but returning to the game I always had to reassess my active tasks and my inventory to determine which steps I needed to repeat.\n\nThat said, I am anxiously awaiting Book Five after having played through Books One through Four. The visuals in the game are stunning, the variety of settings, the colors, and the people.\n\nThe storyline is intriguing, although not having played the prequels, I probably felt more of a knowledge gap than someone going in after having played The Longest Journal and Dreamfall. I feel a connection to the characters, from our main characters Zoe and Kian, to some of the more minor players, such as Bip and Nela. Revelations and connections made through the story kept me engaged and invested in the stories.\n\nThe puzzles throughout the game are all reasonably easy to accomplish. I think there may have been two places in which I was stumped on how to progress;  one of which I could have solved if I hadn't been so adverse to interacting with the AdBots.\n\nWhen making choices, you can see how your choices compare to the choices that other players made. In the few games that I have seen this feature, I have enjoyed getting to see the breakdown of which percentage made what choice.

The settings are wonderful and magical, and the game has a great soundtrack that flows well with the game. The characters are colorful and well-written, and the game has an excellent balance between the comical and serious parts. Already in the first 2 of the 5 parts, it delivers in longevity, and is basically already longer than your normal Telltale game. Some gameplay mechanics could use some fine tuning, but the story of the game makes me forgot these things along the way.\n\nJust a wonderful experience.","March 13, 2015","true","40.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This lastest addition to the series is using the desicion making style of game mechanics to get you more involved in the story. I love these kinds of games because they mix up a bit of puzzle solving with good casual gaming. So far I am loving these books. Book one and two have only left me craving the next episode.\nIf you played the previous games is this series then you absolutely must play this. If its your first experience with these games then to be honest I recommend playing them in sequence because it will make a lot of sense but it is very playable as a solo title. The others can be played and prequels.\n\nEpisodes are a good length too with decent amount on content, unlike some other similar desicion based games where the episodes only last just over an hour this was a good 4 hours or so of game time, part of that was running around finding things and locations but thats what adventure games are all about!\n\n","March 15, 2015","true","21.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I love how my actions in Book 1 shaped my experience. It made me want to go back and play Book 1 and Book 2 in a different way to see how things would have turned out. The puzzles in this Book were a little more challenging. Not mind bending, but there seemed to be more thought put into them in my opinion. The story is getting better and better and man that cliffhanger. I have to wait 3 or 4 more months for the next Book and it will be the Longest Wait! I was hesitant to pay $30 for the season pass, but I am so happy that I did. It took me 3 hours to complete Book 1 and 6 hours to complete Book 2. That is almost the same length of time spent for the equivalent season of any telltale game.  Not only that but we still have several books to go before the season is over! Are there some graphical glitches? For sure, and I am pretty confident that in the near future, there will be patches to address these issues. Is the game flawless?

I now own all the games in the series and love them. The only problem I have and it seems to be a common issue is that the game isn't optimized properly. Or so that is what I keep hearing. Personally the game runs fantastic for me on my pc at high settings, but for only 30 minutes or so. After that the framerate drops significantly. I can stop the game and restart and the problem is fixed. Sometimes I even have to logout out of my pc account. Trying to lower the settings does absolutely nothing. I am sure that Red Thread will address this situation at some point. It doesnt make the game unplayable and it is well worth this small inconvenience. It is a treat for the eyes and ears. The graphics wont blow everyone away but the art style really catches the eye. The story for all of these games is probably the best I have encountered in the video game industry and the voice acting from game to game is consistent as well. I think only one major character has a different voice actor in Dreamfall Chapters and it is a vast improvement. (I am a little biased due to the fact that this actor voiced one of my all time favorite video game characters of all time;  Sir Hawke, the Champion of Kirkwall. All in all this game is amazing so far and I am sure books 3-5 will be just as amazing, and I for one cant wait for them to drop. I give it a 9/10 only for the fact that the gameplay is a little soft. Even though its predecessor was lauded for its horrible stealth and combat mechanics, at least it had them.  There is no combat (so far) and there was one instance where you have to avoid a guard by making sure he is pointing in the oppsite direction. If he catches you then it places you outside a gate 20 feet from where you were. And you actually get an achievment for the quest called "And you thought there wouldnt be stealth." Despite these minor flaws the game has me hungering for more and I cant wait to see how it all ends.","April 3, 2015","true","147.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I played the 2 prequels shortly before beginning this one. They are a brilliant series. I recommend to play the 2 first games beifore this one, to fully understand the story, which can be very complex. Even if they are old games, it is really worth it.\n\nI enjoyed playing choice driven episodic games like the Telltales' one or Life is Strange, but I really think that this one is the best I've tried in this genre. Your choices seem really to matter and the game is not just an 'interactive movie' where you make decisions. There are puzzles inbetween and the game is really a crossing between a point&click and choices matter game, which I enjoy both.\n\nThe universe is amazing (as I enjoyed the both previous games) and it has elements from both fantasy and sci-fi. The story is great and has a lot of plots. The characters are various and enjoyable. The graphics are beautiful and the music is nice.\n\nI'm looking forward to playing the last chapter!","April 2","true","19.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Thats one of the few negative parts of this game. But like (for example) Life is strange, wich also lacks with better graphics, the story is the more important part and you have to focus on that.\n\n- The Character impression sometimes feels like controlling a robot talking to other robots. No Lip sync at all, and almost no facial expressions of any character. Thats really annoying in times of good graphic engines and little unhyped games doing a better job. Feels like playing a 10years old game with better graphics. So almost every dialog you have to watch looks like this:\nRobot1: BaBaBa Ba Ba, Robot2: Ba BaBa BaBa Ba\n\n- Sometimes models look like they've seen a scary ghost, but convulsive try to follow their role. That really ruins the atmosphere sometimes, but all in all it is negligible.\n\n- Some of the city areals are some kind of sterile and you have to overlook that sometimes.\n\nAll in all, after some playing time, all this little flaws feel a little bit annoying, but when you concentrate on the story its ok and the game is nice.","March 29","true","9.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

It is a very good intro though... if you want to play them all at once you may have to wait a while. You do get the full game for the price, no paying more later, so thats good.\n\nOn a positive note, the characters, art direction, music, voice acting, are all really high quality and everything fits perfectly with the story.\n\nThe story telling is fantastic, but you should definitely play the first two games before this one. Not that its impossible to start with this game, it does have a little intro video you can watch that explains what happened in dreamfall. But I think the first two, being mainly story based, are still incredible experiences despite their age. And this one really does pick up exactly where they left off.\n\nThe only downside for me so far is that I crave the rest of the story and must wait. This first episode is about 3-5 hours long depending on if you stop and explore the incredible surroundings, so for me about 4.5 hours (I just have to stop and explore things).\n\nIf you have not played the first two games they are both on steam(at the time of writing) in a $25 combo pack. As a bonus to the first games being incredibly awesome on their own, maybe by the time you have finished both of them the next episode or two will be released!","November 16, 2014","true","18.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I was worried at first that a sequel some 10 years later would suck, as that is often the case. But the team behind Dreamfall delivered!\n\nThe one caveat? The first "chapter" was in my opinion a bit too short, storywise. I expected certain things to happen, but when I reached the end, it felt abrupt and I felt like I was unprepared for it. Now, it's 4 hours long or so, it didn't feel too slow - the pacing was excellent, and in a normal game, you don't really want to the story to move too fast, so you can play longer.

Highly recommended.\n\nCompellingly flawed and vulnerable characters explore and grow in this tale of disparate but connected worlds. Dreamfall mixes futuristic modernism with medieval fantasy in a melange of myths that will be sure to intrigue adventure game lovers. I was surprised at how the two (actually three) settings combined to make a narrative whole as the story progressed.\n\nThe voiceover acting for most of the main characters is top notch. (The sidekick character seemed to not match the volume and timbre of the other characters IMHO).  Each character is distinctively defined with his or her own motivations.  The choices you make playing the two protagonists are fraught with realistic angst and ethical challenges.  There is no right answer.\n\nI liked the ability to click to see how other players decided to play each turning point--or to not click and go it without peer input.  However, I did not like that some of the decisions were timed with a very short countdown.  I was not aware this would happen at first, and some decisions were made automatically for me because I did not choose in time--not always the way I would have played it.\n\nThe game has good repeat play value because of the decisions.  If you'd like to play Kian or Zoe as harsher, more fearful, more selfless, or with a more black-and-white view of moral choices, you can do so.  The curious story of the third protagonist is a bit disconnected, but in a good way. It also has very few choices.  I am curious how she fits in with the other two in the next chapters.\n\nI loved The Longest Journey but missed Dreamfall.  Dreamfall Chapters has massive spoilers for Dreamfall, since the story is continuous--that's a *good* thing.\n\nA caution to those unfamiliar with games released over time: the end of Book 4 is not the end of the game.  The Steam release date for Dreamfall Chapters is listed as October 2014; however, Book 4 was released December 2015.  I bought 1-4 together thinking it was a complete set and was disappointed and surprised at the unfinished ending.  There is no epilogue to indicate when I might be able to get the rest.\n\nNonetheless, I would buy it again and can't wait for the next release.","January 13","true","63.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

By the time "4" came out, the rest of the game was just a vague memory.\nI'd still recommend the whole game- if someone waits to get it until chapter 5 is out and all the bugs are fixed so it can be played straight through... It really isn't 5 games, nor does it feel like it. it is one game that is portioned out to make it feel like your getting a lot of games for the buck.","January 16","true","97.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It builds the foundations of each character so that the player gets a true understanding of what each character resembles. Reading the other reviews, I see that this alone caused many players to lose all hope in the game and give up after only just beginning Book 1. That's their loss.\n\nDreamfall chapters accomplishes something that many games cannot, to make unqiue, likeable characters. Sounds easy but it is rarely achieved. The choice factor in this game DOES MATTER. Sometimes its something silly, other times it can be the difference between your favourite character surviving or dying. It also strongly matters to the relationships between characters in the game which will further impact how the characters will interact with each other. Will they assist one another or choose not to. That is based on the players dialogue decisions.\n\nBeing such a long game, averaging around 20-30 hours for the first 4 Books it really draws out and explores everything that it can, without it seeming like a bland and boring story. The pace is just right.\n\nSUMMARY\nThis is a beautiful adventure game with gorgeous visuals, logical and likeable characters, a stunning choice of music and a choice-consequence system that can advertently effect the future. Dreamfall Chapters clearly demonstrates that story driven games can still be masterpieces in todays gaming world.","January 18","true","22.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

While Dreamfall Chapters is very much a slow-boil of a story, I also enjoy the amount of time I got to spend in the locales, just soaking in the lushly designed ambience. This is a great looking game. That said, the story is perhaps a little out of balance, with the game and puzzle moments often feeling detached from the ongoing narrative. That said, once you get to the Third and Fourth episodes (Books), the pace really picks up, creating a feleing of greater eveness between game and story.\n\nThe decision making moments are really the highlight of the game for me, though - there's a feel of ongoing consequence to the choices you make. Perhaps the story always ends up in a similar place, regardless, but the game does a much better job of integrating your choices into the ongoing narrative than something like The Walking Dead, where your decisions often feel peripheral and meaningless to the story. For anyone who likes a 'Choose Your Own Adventure' Dreamfall Chapters can't come more highly recommended.\n\nFor non-adventure gamers I would recommend the game with a few caveats. Obviously it's a beautiful production, but the mechanics of the game offer little flexibility in terms of exploration. Yes, the worlds can be big, but there's ultimately little to do in them besides complete tasks associated with story progression.","December 8, 2015","true","19.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Overall it s a pretty good game, but at time specifically with some quests or objectives, it lacks a bit of direction as to where you need to go or exactly what you should do. Which usually results in you running around for quite some time. And last, I have to say it. Whoever drew Zoe Castillo gave  her so much ♥♥♥. It's like unbelievably fat. That may be part of the reason why I prefer the futuristic city storyline more. She is unbelievably hot. The accent gets a little old though.","December 15, 2015","true","21.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Truthfully it ain't as good as the first one was in "The Longest Journey", but is definitely nicer then the second game. Otherwise the graphics are close to an 8 (on a scale from 1 - 10, where 10 is max). The game is pretty well finished, since I hardly encountered any bugs. Thou the experience of playing it was pretty limited: is not always easy to figure out what you are supposed to do next, plus the diversity is very limited and the way you can handle any situation is fixed - having only one solution available per problem/quest. Sometimes it takes forever to find the designed order to pass a chapter/quest. Giving into temptation to finish much faster a quest on witch you already lost too much time finding a specific hidden item, sometimes results in forgetting that you were given a choice on the matter. The story finishes abruptly - maybe another chapter is missing. Overall grade: 6 minus.","December 9, 2015","true","25.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The trilogy in all is amazing, and Dreamfall Chapters doesn't disappoint. I feel like I have been waiting for this to come out forever. Very story-rich told by two characters. Zoe Castillo from "the real world" (although far more advanced than our word) is a complex character from the previous game, growing and dealing with difficult worlds. Kian Alvane, (also from the previous game) from the magical world, is also a deep, strong charcter. This game is not just for looks, although it definately looks beautiful. Your choices in the story actually mean something and change the story for better or for worse.

If you haven't played The Longest Journey or Dreamfall: TLJ then I highly suggest you do.  These games are well deserved of their status.  The story is original and engrossing, and something I'd never seen before.  The first and second game are quite different in mechanics.  In the second you are able to fight and there are things you can't miss.  In the first pick up everything even if you've placed it somewhere, as you may need it in the future.\n\nDreamfall Chapters is incredible.  The graphics are a wonderful improvement, the story is still amazing and the characters are what those who have played the first two games have come to love.  The worlds are in peril and I'm still not sure what role Zoe plays in everything but her story is intriguing.  While the first and the second didn't have much choice, the third takes your choices into account and molds the story in regards to your choices.\n\nI reccommend playing the first two before you embark on your journey into Dreamfall:Chapters. If you don't, you'll have a lot of questions and you'll be missing out on the wonders of Arcadia and Stark you've missed by opting out on TLJ and Dreamfall TLJ.","December 18, 2015","true","19.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It is a very good intro though... if you want to play them all at once you may have to wait a while. You do get the full game for the price, no paying more later, so thats good.\n\nOn a positive note, the characters, art direction, music, voice acting, are all really high quality and everything fits perfectly with the story.\n\nThe story telling is fantastic, but you should definitely play the first two games before this one. Not that its impossible to start with this game, it does have a little intro video you can watch that explains what happened in dreamfall. But I think the first two, being mainly story based, are still incredible experiences despite their age. And this one really does pick up exactly where they left off.\n\nThe only downside for me so far is that I crave the rest of the story and must wait. This first episode is about 3-5 hours long depending on if you stop and explore the incredible surroundings, so for me about 4.5 hours (I just have to stop and explore things).\n\nIf you have not played the first two games they are both on steam(at the time of writing) in a $25 combo pack. As a bonus to the first games being incredibly awesome on their own, maybe by the time you have finished both of them the next episode or two will be released!","November 16, 2014","true","18.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

While Dreamfall Chapters is very much a slow-boil of a story, I also enjoy the amount of time I got to spend in the locales, just soaking in the lushly designed ambience. This is a great looking game. That said, the story is perhaps a little out of balance, with the game and puzzle moments often feeling detached from the ongoing narrative. That said, once you get to the Third and Fourth episodes (Books), the pace really picks up, creating a feleing of greater eveness between game and story.\n\nThe decision making moments are really the highlight of the game for me, though - there's a feel of ongoing consequence to the choices you make. Perhaps the story always ends up in a similar place, regardless, but the game does a much better job of integrating your choices into the ongoing narrative than something like The Walking Dead, where your decisions often feel peripheral and meaningless to the story. For anyone who likes a 'Choose Your Own Adventure' Dreamfall Chapters can't come more highly recommended.\n\nFor non-adventure gamers I would recommend the game with a few caveats. Obviously it's a beautiful production, but the mechanics of the game offer little flexibility in terms of exploration. Yes, the worlds can be big, but there's ultimately little to do in them besides complete tasks associated with story progression.","December 8, 2015","true","19.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Highly recommended.\n\nCompellingly flawed and vulnerable characters explore and grow in this tale of disparate but connected worlds. Dreamfall mixes futuristic modernism with medieval fantasy in a melange of myths that will be sure to intrigue adventure game lovers. I was surprised at how the two (actually three) settings combined to make a narrative whole as the story progressed.\n\nThe voiceover acting for most of the main characters is top notch. (The sidekick character seemed to not match the volume and timbre of the other characters IMHO).  Each character is distinctively defined with his or her own motivations.  The choices you make playing the two protagonists are fraught with realistic angst and ethical challenges.  There is no right answer.\n\nI liked the ability to click to see how other players decided to play each turning point--or to not click and go it without peer input.  However, I did not like that some of the decisions were timed with a very short countdown.  I was not aware this would happen at first, and some decisions were made automatically for me because I did not choose in time--not always the way I would have played it.\n\nThe game has good repeat play value because of the decisions.  If you'd like to play Kian or Zoe as harsher, more fearful, more selfless, or with a more black-and-white view of moral choices, you can do so.  The curious story of the third protagonist is a bit disconnected, but in a good way. It also has very few choices.  I am curious how she fits in with the other two in the next chapters.\n\nI loved The Longest Journey but missed Dreamfall.  Dreamfall Chapters has massive spoilers for Dreamfall, since the story is continuous--that's a *good* thing.\n\nA caution to those unfamiliar with games released over time: the end of Book 4 is not the end of the game.  The Steam release date for Dreamfall Chapters is listed as October 2014; however, Book 4 was released December 2015.  I bought 1-4 together thinking it was a complete set and was disappointed and surprised at the unfinished ending.  There is no epilogue to indicate when I might be able to get the rest.\n\nNonetheless, I would buy it again and can't wait for the next release.","January 13","true","63.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It builds the foundations of each character so that the player gets a true understanding of what each character resembles. Reading the other reviews, I see that this alone caused many players to lose all hope in the game and give up after only just beginning Book 1. That's their loss.\n\nDreamfall chapters accomplishes something that many games cannot, to make unqiue, likeable characters. Sounds easy but it is rarely achieved. The choice factor in this game DOES MATTER. Sometimes its something silly, other times it can be the difference between your favourite character surviving or dying. It also strongly matters to the relationships between characters in the game which will further impact how the characters will interact with each other. Will they assist one another or choose not to. That is based on the players dialogue decisions.\n\nBeing such a long game, averaging around 20-30 hours for the first 4 Books it really draws out and explores everything that it can, without it seeming like a bland and boring story. The pace is just right.\n\nSUMMARY\nThis is a beautiful adventure game with gorgeous visuals, logical and likeable characters, a stunning choice of music and a choice-consequence system that can advertently effect the future. Dreamfall Chapters clearly demonstrates that story driven games can still be masterpieces in todays gaming world.","January 18","true","22.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Books two and beyond have been wonderful.  The recent engine update has really made my experience better on Linux,  Highly recommended, although some of the puzzles remind me a little too much of old Sierra games where I randomly click on stuff hoping and praying for something to be the solution.

And I have to admit, at first I was a bit underwhelmed. It was great seeing how all the characters were holding up after all these years. But in the first Book it seemed like the team was just getting used to the Unity Engine. The scene locations are all gorgeus and packed with details and the character models all look good, but the first book involved a lot of running back and forth. But after sticking with it through the first book, the game really picks up. The plot kicks off, and actions have the most ridiculous consequences. I'm refusing to take any alternative choices at the moment so I can keep my "canon" run, but I can see how by making a few different choices, you could be playing a completely different game.\n\nThe characters are all charming and humor is spot on. The sad moments leave me feeling dwelling on my mistakes all day and triumphant moments make me feel happy that I just got everyone through. I'd highly recommend this game to any and all TLJ fans, it's an instant buy. But for new players, I'd recommend going back and playing the first two games to really get the most out of the experience. They do include a nice "The Story So Far" movie in the game, but by playing the first two games you get a much better feel for the story, characters, and world of the longest journey.","February 1","true","23.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Choices that you make affect the story and it's really well made. There hasn't been a game recently that sucked me in and made me want to keep playing as much as this one.\n\nWhat I don't like:\nSome of the puzzles are hard or frustrating. Some you have to walk around aimlessly looking for "something" until you stumble upon something you can pick up. Then comes finding where to use it...\n\nOverall, this game is definitely worth buying for the story and the experience as a whole.

I like how they release it in chapters but I would prefer if every chapter had a "finish" of sorts. Alas we can't get everything we want. I feel everyone who has reviewed the game based on it's story has given it an unfair review. It's like, if everyone reviewed The Longest Journey based on the first stretch or "chapter" of the game they would've said it was horrible. That duck on a fishing line puzzle was ridiculous.\nRamble done.\nThe choices that affect the story in Dreamfall Chapters are VERY interesting I've not had to think this hard about making one for awhile. Choosing lovers, choosing friends, dooming friends, betraying friends and killing enemies. One that sticks out to me is that you are given the option to kill a horrible person and I chose to whereas many people did not.\nThe story is very well done. It doesn't impose it's ideas on you. It has no agenda. There is just some controversial characters in a general story with politics, drama, romance and action. As the chapters come player input is taken into account.\nIt is the first game in a long while to give me the feeling of not knowing at all what to do. Which is one thing I remember fondly of the first game. But I enjoyed walking around the world figuring it out.\nNearly every character is amazing. Shitbot is amazing.\nI'm excited for every new chapter and can't wait til the game is done.\nWith the new upgrade a lot of the other concerns were fixed. I hope that all the mixed reviews don't put people off. I am enjoying this game more than even the first two.

You adapt extremely quickly though and before you know it you find yourself stuck in yet another beautiful game.\n\nThe fun part about this game is the fact that you feel you're watching a movie - and actually get to choose some of the plot yourself, a lot of people has criticized the story but i personally love it!  Red Thread Games just posted a great movie for those of you that either can not remember the story from the previous games, or the ones that has not played either of them. I don't feel it is a 100% necessary for you to know the story behind but it will absolutely enhance your perception of the game.\n\nIt is an absolutely stress-free game so far, and a game you can enjoy whether you're tired, up for a movie, ready for some action or just bored and looking to spend some easy time. This, combined with loads of riddles, makes it the perfect game.\n\nA few glitches here and there as the game is still in an early stage, but the publisher is really listening to their players when it comes to reports and bugfixing etc. I still have not stumbled across any glitches that are severe enough to require a report.\n\nAs i mentioned earlier, this is yet another beautiful game. I have always favoured Arcadia and seeing the graphic quality-facelift they've put on stark, i can hardly wait for loads and loads of more level designs and hopefully lots of Arcadia.

If you loved the previous games, then definitely get it, but if you have no idea what this game is, then first play through at least Dreamfall: The Longest Journey, and if you're ever so bold to play through an old game then play the Longest Journey as well before you play this. It will be worth it, I promise. The game will be that more satisfying. Though if you want the real experience, play those games, then wait 8 years and then play this. That way you get the full waiting game down. I guess this is more geared towards people who played the previous versions.\n\nA second sequel to the classic Longest Journey, however one doesn't need to play the first two to jump right into this game. I highly recommend the other games as the games do have journey in the name, and while someone could understand everything from the recap they have in the main menu, I thought of it as more of the developers strumming my nostalgic strings.\n\nWhile there are problems with the game, the writing, music, and scenery still drive me to explore every bit of the game. The main problems with game I have are when the characters talk and the other characters they talk to don't seem to be engaged into the conversation at all. They devolve in this reserved blank stare as they are listening to the other speak, and the other speaking doesn't seem to maintain eye contact or even shift eyes or do any other special animations. Whil this was passable for old games in 2006, this is 2014, and we have super machines that can handle all the animations, so please animators or animation director or whatever, please unleash the full vision of the writers and artists.\n\nOther than that I also still get graphic artifacts on my screen when walking around Europolis or whatever. Especially around the hotdog stand with the communist vendor. Socialism vs. Communism aside, I saw at certain angles when I tried to give myself the movie experience were bright red faded squares of light, but maybe that's just the developers giving me a hint. Karl Marx=God\n\nBad aside, the music is just too damn pretty and perfect. Maybe they hired Hans Zimmer, I don't know. Throughout the game I couldn't tell if I had shed a tear for the pretty scenic colors, the writing, or the music, and you damned developers outdid yourselves in that regard. The writing is certainly better in this, it feels as though my choices throughout the game actually matters, though I fear it's too much of a good thing and I'm going to be strong along in later chapters, please don't realize my fears. Probably because you flash this choice has consequences and so and so will remember this whenever I make any sort of decision. I'm so damn skeptical and think, "oh yeah sure." I'd get rid of that little text entirely, who the hell though of that? You're ruining my immersion damnit.\n\nThe writing might not seem so special for anyone picking up the game, but it's absolutely delightful when you've played through all the games. The first ♥♥♥♥ing minutes of the game had me glued to the screen because they made closure for April Ryan, and then they allowed Zoe Castillo to ♥♥♥♥ing grow as a character. Though I guess you cuold go the other road and keep her being an insufferable ♥♥♥♥. At least she's probably making a pretty penny by staying petty. Other things that find closure they finally end the vagueness while keeping up the mystery. For example, "the Vagabond" actually has a purpose now, he's your magestic mystic minority character, no but seriously I was always confused what the point of the vagabond was, and I didn't even know his name until they spell it out for you in this game. So while these characters have flesh out brilliantly, I also think that the writing staff also grew a little. That's to say in language too, I suppose. Though you all throw out ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥'s and bleep out the bloody's. What the b____y ♥♥♥♥ is that about?\n\nAlso great job bringing back wonkers. Nothing like reiterating that Zoe's only childhood friend was a robotic purple monkey. Also Olivia died, not sure why, will find out more I suppose. Maybe it was an infection from alll the piercings, her body became septic and ther was nothing the doctors could do. RIP Olivia.\n\nAlso good job toning down the sex appeal of Zoe in the first chapter, then totally just flashing some perfect ♥♥♥ in the second chapter, then while analyzing other characters asses, they are not so great.\n\nPuzzles aren't as challenging as the previous games I guess, but I there's some confusing bits still, and I won't spoil the fun, but you might want to try looking up once in awhile. Also do less clicking and more thinking, you'll save more time than I wasted.\n\nAll around my complaints are just petty and nitpicky (just like zoe, did I say that? :O), and I believe anyone will throughly enjoy this sequel.\n\n8 b____y mary's out of 10","November 21, 2014","true","5.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I know that I shouldn't put these things on the very beginging of my review but screw this - I first got in touch with The Longest Journey when I was, I don't know, 5 years old? I still remember my grandma who bought me it and I played it together with my sister. Then I was 10 and I could play Dearmfall: The Longest Journey. I loved it (and I still do love it) and I can say that I pretty much have grown up on this game and a fantastic world Ragnar has created. Thank you.\n\nGetting to the very main point of my review I want to talk about technical issues first. It was quite a shock to jump from Dreamfall's Zoe and Kian to Chapter's Zoe and Kian and I think that I liked Dreamfall's version better. Crashes happend - a lot. Lack of optimalization was compensated by the cool look of the game, even on the lowest settings. It is kind of a plus. I liked the way I could control my character, I didn't hit as many walls as I did in the Dreamfall. But again - crashes in the city made my play very uncomfortable. Yes, I have to admit - my PC isn't the newest on the stock but it is not an antique either! I heard from other players that I am not the only one so maybe there is some way to optimalize so big and detailed places like Europolis? Maybe there is not, I can see that you guys have put a lot of work into this location, but not pointing out that one would be pure insincerity.\n\nOh, how I loved big complitated world of TLJ! And you know what? The realm in Dreamfall Chapters have not let me down <3 I can see so many links with the first part that I could cry in front of my computer - so many memories! The characters have not lost anything from their charm (my dear Kian, you are so hated by other fans but you've got me even more with your attitude against...shh, no spoilers!). I am truly amazed. RTS, you have a pat on the back from me *pat pat*\n\nAll in all, I strongly recommend this game. It was worth waiting for 8 years to see such a great production. I can see that the creators have put a lot of heart into what they were doing here, this game has a spirit, it provokes to think about some important matters like manipulation, thoughtless entertainment, 'corporialism'. What's more, this complex world and plot is flavoured with witty humour and nice dialogues between well-constructed characters.\n\nAnd finally, this game has no linear plot, which makes a gamer pour a little of his own thinking into choices he makes ;)","November 30, 2014","true","146.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

With such a lead-time, games generally will either fail to live up to the hype (possibly being objectively terrible [sorry Duke]) or be truly amazing.  I am happy to report that Dreamfall Chapters falls closer to that selective second category (a bit too early to tell if it'll stay there).  The music, voice acting and sound engineering are excellent, the graphics are beautiful (the landscape/background design particularly), the environmental details greatly amplify the realism of the unabashedly-surreal world and the writing, well, it's Ragnar Tornquist & company (need I say more?).  While the episodic format is a significant shift in pace from the earlier games, it makes sense on many levels (not the least of which being developer budget) and allows the content to remain fresh enough for multiple different playthroughs, which is more important in Chapters as the choice aspect is central to the way the story plays out.  The start is a bit abrupt if you haven't played the other games in the series, so I recommend playing through The Longest Journey and Dreamfall first (and in general), though Chapters does stand on its own.\nRight now it's short and sweet; highly recommended.\n\nTL; DR:\nPros: Story (writing), dialogue (writing), graphics, music, voice acting, sound editing, environmental interaction, world design.\nCons: Short (episode), heavily focused on previous story content (with brief synopsis), some minor clipping/finishing detail issues","October 24, 2014","true","29.0"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

I loved Dreamfall, and this just feels the same.  Story focus is largely on Zoe (thankfully), who remains a compelling, but conflicted charater.  They added a lot of swears this time, which can be a bit jarring.  That, and the opening scene ending where Zoe confronts a familiar character from Dreamfall lying in bed (no spoilers, but I am not referriing to Vagabond or any of the dream characters) is really odd and seems to come out of nowhere, given the character in Dreamfall.  So does the backstory about Zoe's dad.  It is tough to reconcile these with the previous game.  Still, these are tolerable nits.  Maybe bigger, bolder words are in order, but they would amount to the same: worth it if you're a fan.  Good luck!  And I can't WAIT to see where they go wtih this plot.

Great game with tons of bugs is way better than a poor but polished one in my book.\n\nOther than that, things are looking pretty amazing for Dreamfall Chapters. Most importantly, so far this looks like the true TLJ game to me. The storytelling, the characters the atmosphere, the locations - all is in place and lives up to the high bar of expectations set by the original games. It seems like the team behind the game has made a solid work and clearly has an ambition of delivering the best TLJ experience possible (given, of course, the short budget they have).\n\nSo far, only the first of five books (episodes) has been released. While most players seem to complete this episode in ~5 hours, it took me ~8 with all the exploration. This btw is quite long for an episodic adventure game as most of the Walking Dead or The Wolf Among Us episodes are clocking in at 2-2.5 hours. So we can expect at least 25 hours of TLJ goodness for a fair price of just under $20.\n\nFor those of you wondering - please don't expect Red Thread Games to charge you more for each episode. You buy the game now, pay once and get the episodes as they're ready to roll.","October 26, 2014","true","36.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

The story is very interesting, I haven't played nor The Longest Journey nor Dreamfall: The Longest Journey, but you kind of get intrigued with the story, also the way the story is told, reveals you what happened before so if you haven't played previous games that doesn't make so much of a difference. In the matter of gameplay it is good for the ones that like slow paced games, in my opinion it has a lot of dialogues, that many persons would consider boring, if you're looking for shooting combat, etc. this is not the game for you, it is more like point a click game with a very good story.\nConclusion\nIf you're looking for a game with good graphics and story for a reasonable price and you can tolerate some minor issues with the game this is totally a game for you.\n9/10 would recommend.","October 26, 2014","true","4.4"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

RedThreadGames goes way and beyond to be there for the community, answering questions and frequently update on the progress of the chapters. It's a big leap to do the sequel to the game Dreamfall - The Longest Journey, as well as The Longest Journey. There has been many opinions about how the story is throught trough or not, if you tie ends together with the games before. I'm one of those who thinks it's a good way to continue the story from previous games and I feel like they keep the mystic feeling about that something is amiss while at the same time moving forward to an answer. Some choices seem very easy in the beginning but this game constantly reminds you to expect the unexptected. The more you play, the more you try to get the puzzle together about what is happening.\n\nI think I did about 5 play throughs for the currently released chapters (3) and each time I got to experience something new. There are main choices that put you in an certain direction and the smaller choices in dialogues and situations shape who you are and how others perceive you.  I think the game is stunningly beautiful. especially the clothing of the main characters and how they move and talk. You are there, in the world, not just watching it from your computer monitor. When a game makes you feel that, it's a game worth playing :)\n\n","November 23, 2015","true","62.9"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","8","15","2","0"

Zoe now is reaching April's level of wittiness with snarky remarks and snappy witty jokes which is great since we don't get much of April in ep1 (won't spoil it more than that), IMO the length of the episode is spot on and the back and forth between Kian and Zoe was nice for sake of variety ... some people are complaining about lack of complex puzzles but i have to disagree, the puzzles here are simple and story relevant in a good way, so while i kinda enjoyed the tough puzzles of The Longest Journey some of them were too hard and ruined the pacing of the game when you spent too much time trying to figure out how to solve them .. i managed to finish them all without any online guides (except one early puzzle that required some pixel hunting), so i'm glad the focus is on the story this time, if i wanted to play a puzzle game i'd go play Portal 2 or The Talos Principle.\n\nOh, and there is that sweet surprise at the end, although only players of TLJ will know its full significance and recognize the location but either way it's still very intriguing and interesting section that i didn't expect at all .. adds lots of mystery and makes me so eager to play the next episode.\n\nTo sum it up:\n+The return of one of the best adventure games out there, Telltales have a serious competitor now.\n+Lovely graphics and attention to details that makes exploring the world a real joyful video/audio experience.\n+Fantastic top notch Voice acting and music.\n+Evolved dialog/choice story driven gameplay, simple puzzles that don't get in the way of the story.\n+Moves the story onward resolving plot points while also leaving Lots of mystery and anticipation for the fans to speculate on.\n\n-Some minor graphical hiccups and frame-rate drops\n-It is better if you play the previous games first as some of things might not make sense.\n\nOverall i'm very satisfied with the first episode and didn't regret buying this one bit, specially after waiting for so many years to continue the story, go buy it and do yourself a favor and play the older games as well, despite any problems they have (first game looking outdated, and 2nd game having some cumbersome mechanics) they are still excellent adventure games and a truly an forgettable journey.","December 26, 2014","true","30.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Book two is much bigger about 8 hours and book three is about 4 again. With two more books to come its fairly evident this will be one big adventure.\n\nGame is gorgeous , has a pretty good ost, great characters and great VO (shitbot!). Story is good and the first book (or episode if you prefer) set the tone for the game great introduced a lot of characters and happenings that will become more apparent later on.  There is a lot of brancing decision wise in the game so far. Small decisions will have big impact later on you will find.\n\nLast but not least on the positive side (at least for me) is the minimalistic UI which just get out of your way so you can enjoy looking around without a permanent ui in the way. Its very contextual so mostly it's just not there and popups when there is something to interact with. Loved it. more games need stuff like this.\n\nThe technical problems the game had (some low fps in europolis) when it came out have long been fixed.\n\n\nTLDR : Get it. If you like adventure games. Or good stories. Or people that actual behave in a believable manner (in a game about magic,shifters dreamers etc no less). Just get it. Its great.","October 23, 2014","true","24.1"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

Any issues with the controls from the previous game have been eradicated in favor of a simple and concise setup with no stealth or combat present. There were some stilted animations and an over-reliance on bloom in the lighting, but those issues were easily negligible when compared to the story that unfolded before me. Only time will tell if the choices I made have interesting consequences, but for the moment, this game shows how powerful a gripping story can be to a game.\n*Edit*\nMade it through book four and I'm still in love with this story.

I have waited over 8 years for the continuation of this story that has meant more to me than any other story ever told. The wait is finally over, and it seems it has been worth it! Seeing these amazingly well written characters again is like being reunited with old friends. I would recommend this game to anyone who is a lover of good stories, even non-gamers.\n\nDisclaimer: This review only covers impressions from book 1.\n\nSo... About the game. If you are looking for a fast paced game with a good combat system, this game is not for you. There is no combat. If you are easily offended this game is probably not for you either. It is a mature game, and characters in it reflect the wide variety of people you find in the real world. There are offensive characters. There is profanity. It is relatable. On the topic of characters, that's one area where this game truly shines! The characters you meet feel genuine, they feel complex. Real. This is a reflection of the overall fantastic writing which is revealing a thought provoking, deep and mature yet magical story. The dialogue alone had me laugh out loud on several occasions, while other moments pulled at my heartstrings. Of course this is only book one, but it is clear that great things are set in motion already.\n\nAbout choices. Choices make up a key aspect of the actual game-play. They are difficult! Generally there are no obvious good vs. evil choices. Most are morally grey. But they do impact your story in important ways. To help you make the choice you will hear the PC's inner though process as you mouse over each choice. This very effectively serves the dual purpose of letting you get to know the characters better while helping you guess at what the PC will say.\n\nThis game is visually stunning. Sure, if you compare it to the flashiest of the AAA next-gen titles you might find the graphics a bit lacking. But the artstyle is fantastic and it is clear that the world has been crafted with a careful eye for detail. The two worlds of Stark and Arcadia feature very distinct styles, yet there is a cohesiveness that tie them together.\n\nThe Soundtrack is simply amazing amazing. There is one spot in Europolis where you will find a crowd of NPCs around a musician, and I found myself standing around for a few minutes just listening. But even the music coming out of radios, night clubs and the "atmospheric" music is all highly effective and does a great job of underlining the impact of the story. The voice acting is also absolutely superb. Better even than most AAA titles I have played. I must admit it took some getting used to the new voice for Zoe, but she does such a good job I quickly got over it.\n\nTL:DR - If you love a good story and great characters, buy it.

Game looks a decade behind the times. Mouth movement is very off and choppy. That is until you get to Zoe and her city. This looks a lot better but the game runs so glitchy. Crashed a few times on me and often the system stops to catch up to you. This has a very very poor unpolished feel. However when your standing still or walking slow the game does look very good.\n\nI feel more interactions could have been worked into the city area. A mini map would be a god send as the city map system is very hard to clearly understand as its vague. All in all I love the story and the landscape graphics are good the people could use alot more work. I think mouth movement could be stopped all together and it create a better feel. It would be old school but at least a better old school.\n\nI am only glad that for the money your going to get all the chapters and not have to fork over more each time.

I'd still put some of my thoughts about Revelations;\nChapters 10, 11, and even the Interlude that follows, are probably the best sections of the game for me.\nThe plot really gets stronger here, at last. And while the 3 previous books (which are more than half of the game!) felt like they were just a warm-up for what's coming, here things finally start moving somewhere, and fast.\n\nI did feel rather disappointed at some points, as Chapters became a little like a walking simulator, Zoe travelled through some pretty impressive locations but had very minimal interactions with her surroundings. And no, I haven't forgiven yet to the very straight-forwards puzzles.\n\nBut book 4's plot was so strong and moving for me, and that made me satisfied of Chapters at last.\nAlso, I believe that only in book 4 you actually get to feel the consequences of your choices (I did say earlier that it feels like your choices are simply thrown out of the window. Well, apparantly they're not).\n\nHoping for a nice finale! and hopefully a better review aboutthe entire game once book 5 is released.\n\n~Book Three Review~\nI'm going to exceed the maximum length possible so I'll go short on this one as well.\nTechincally it's pretty much the same as book 1 and 2, although for some reason I experienced framerate drop but I can live with that.\nAnyway, Book 3 was alright, but left me rather disappointed. The TLJ universe is famous for its slow starts but then it all supposed to get amazingly good. Well in book three I got a rather thin and disappointing plot, not too deep and engaging like the first game in the series or even like books 1&2.\nI really hopes throughout the entire game that it's going to finish in an impressive way but.. not, it all felt very typical and shallow, unfortunately. I still had a good time playing the three books and so I leave this as a positive review, and expecting books 4&5 to start get things going and get back to the roots of the series' epicness.\n\n~Book Two Review~\nBasically, I don't have much to add to my thoughts about book one.\nI'm a huge fan of the TLJ universe and games, and I enjoyed this episode a lot, but I still can't help but have mixed feeling about DF:Chapters.\n\nFirst of all, by the time of the release of book two, most technical issues were solved (about time!) and I could finally play with high graphics settings, which was really fun and nice to watch.\nMarcuria is designed wonderfully and beautifully and would  cause every TLJ fan a great joy.\n\nThe story, the writing, the characters are all as good as always and are the main attractions of the game.\n\nThe choices are getting more interesting and difficult each time.\n\nIt's all nice and well, but some wicked thoughts are lingering in my mind:\n1)Where is it all going? Hard to believe but we're arriving soon to the middle of Dreamfall Chapters, and instead of answering some questiong aroused in Dreamfall, we're only getting more and more new questions unanswered.\n\n2)Why not making the gameplay interesting as well?\nAnd yes, there are good and interesting puzzles which I enjoyed, but many times I started feeling bored, just running around from place to place, doing some errands from the goals list, until some critical moment came where something dramatic happened and you had to make a choice.\nUnfortunately this game is almost entirely all about the story, and not much about the actual 'game'\n\n3)Music\nWhy, oh why.. The music in TLJ and DF was so good, so memorable, and here.. it seems like not much thought was put to the subject. And speaking of good stories and tales, music is a very important addition to the subject!\nIn book one I though the music was fine and expected it to get better fit next time..\nBut book two has barely any new addition to the soundtrack. The music is mostly reused from book one and is not much felt, which is disappointing.\n\nAnyway, the game in whole still rocks because of the terrific story, of course. Hopefully it would stay that way.\n\n~Book One Review~\n\nIn short:\n\nGood stuff -\n*Great complex story, the long awaited continuation for Dreamfall TLJ\n*Cool soundtrack\n*Choices and consequences concept introduced into the game\n*Graphics are cool\n*Good writing and characters\n\nBad stuff -\n*Not yet fully optimized for PCs and specifically for 32bit version of Windows (even after patch 1.1.2)\n*Performance and graphics don't justify system requirements\n*Game relies solely on story, not gameplay. Again.\n*Still too early to tell where the game is going and whether it's going to be good or disappointing\n\nI have good things to say about this game, but!\n\nUnfortunately, I'll have to start by saying that technically, this game is not too good. After waiting 7 years for a sequel, when you pre-order a product full price, then get release-delays, and then you have to struggle with the game and with your computer to run stuff properly.... Well, that's a bad start. Really bad start.\nAnyway, I had to buy more RAM and install a 64-bit OS on my system to run this game properly, and if I wasn't an advacned user, I would have been left feeling that I've thrown 30$ to the garbage.\n\nThough, considering the fact that RTG is a new and small company, that they have released pretty fast 3 patches for the game by now (which improved performance but didn't solve my problems anyway), and also considering that they're keeping in touch with the fans, supporting and trying to help as much as possible, keeping the fans updated through every advancement..\n\nWell, Red Thread Games earned my respect, despite this highly unoptimized product.\n\nGood. So, now, for the game itself.\nIt's good. Pretty damn good even, but possibly because I'm already in love with the TLJ universe.\nThe writing is good in my opinion, as expected, and it's the game's main strength.\nI really enjoyed the story and characters, both old and new ones.\nThe soundtrack has taken a new and interesting direction, which fits the game's new style.\nSeems like the devs took some inspiration from Telltale's choices&consequences concept, which I like.\nAnd generally, I enjoyed playing book one and the very opening really got me into this 'new' story.\n\nGameplay-wise, this game plays much like its predecessor. I thought that they'd polish Dreamfall's action sequences (so-called sneaking and combat) but instead they were completely thrown away and we're left with adventure-elements only and the new choices&consequnce idea. The puzzles are also rather easy (although they are more innovative than those on Dreamfall in my opinion).\nI really hoped the developers would listen to the fans about this one, and would make the gameplay more challanging, engaging and worthwhile. But it seems like they have stayed with their old paths and there again the game relies mostly on story.\n\nThe graphics look beautiful and alive but are not stunning, and not they nor the game's performance justify the system requirements.\n\nEuropolis is the largest area in book one, and looks interesting at first, but later it becomes an annoyance when you have to run long distances around without any reward or encouragement for exploring, as when you do that you'd mostly find people talking about politics and basically feel like a big part of the content is duplicated over Europolis.\n\nDespite my complaints, I did get really excited about Chapters and Book One, enjoyed it and am looking forward for the continuation.\nMy only fear is that Chapters has 7 long years of waiting to fill, and doesn't go humble about its ambitions. If the developers won't polish the game some more, and won't improve it's weak points, they could easily turn it into a disappointment.\nNow is simply too soon to predict whether Chapters is going to be a fulfilling title or just leave us feeling empty.","December 9, 2014","true","33.2"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Dreamfall Chapters continues the story of Dreamfall and The Longest Journey in a beautifully rendered, exquisitely voice-acted, and engrossingly written episodic game where your choices affect the outcome and direction of the story.\n\nAs with most initial releases, there are a few hiccups with FPS in various areas regardless of the player's machine configuration. The developers have been responsive and acknowledged these complaints and working towards fixes. I commend them for being responsive as they are, I've seen MANY companies drop the ball. I've only run into a few FPS issues (namely the intro movie) but seem to be fine going through Europolis (where lots of people have been complaining).\n\nI do not regret this purchase in the slightest and am eager for the upcoming chapter releases.

I 've always felt that the conclusion to Dreamfall left so many unanswered questions so when Chapters came along, I had to jump right back in and see where the story would take me.\n\nThumbs Up:\n- A well written continuation of the events in the previous game. Zoe feels very authentic regardless of the decisions she's faced with making. I can only assume that Kian will be given the same kind of development as the additional Chapters are released.\n- A fully realized environment. The layout of Propast feels filled in and lively.\n- Interaction with almost everything in the enviroment. Even if Zoe or Kian can't touch or use something directly, they will have thoughts and feelings to share with the player.\n- Continuity and nostalgia. So many story elements from the previous games are faithfully touched on and added to. There are a number of little tributes to Dreamfall and The Longest Journey if you know where to look!\n- Every decision counts. I particularly like this feature. It makes doing multiple playthroughs worthwhile.\n- An AMAZING soundtrack. So much of the score is just brilliantly done and it does a great job of conveying the story without being overbearing.\n- Driven by narrative. Chapters definitely covers a lot of ground in a short amount of time. It feels like a really good book or TV show. However, as it does not feature combat (so far), this may not be everyone's cup of tea.\n\nThumbs Down:\n- Some of the voice acting is a little hard to listen to. Additionally, the amount vulgar language just seems to be overkill. A little bit can add spice and depth to a character. Too much just makes them uninteresting.\n- Some of the puzzles and goals could stand to have a bit more explanation to them. I'm not talking outright hand-holding, but a gentle nudge or exposition could go a long way. Especially if you're negotiating between two people...\n- Many of the NPC are too identical. Repitions in hairstyle and clothing tend to break up the immersion, unfortunately.\n- Optmization issues. Even with settings at the lowest, this game could suffer from framerate issues on some machines. The is VERY noticeable in Propast.\n\nOverall:\nThis is a worthy sequel. It feels finished and fully fleshed out. I'm enjoying it immensely and I cannot wait to see what happens next.","October 27, 2014","true","32.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Conversation choices & actions feature heavily in this.\n\nLore & discussions\nThe game in essence tells a story and you get to make various choices during the game on how it progresses. These can be small or big choices like lying to someone, or reacting to situations in certain ways.\nIf you like lore, choices and a lot of ingame discussions this is the game for you. If you like mindless action, you might as well stop reading here.\n\nAnother big point is simply this.. female protagonist.\nMost games either have a male protagonist or, incase of a female one, sexualise her.\nAs roughly half the gamers out there are female, its nice to see more games which also include a female protagonist.\n\nNote that NOT all chapters of the game are released YET. (again, indie company.)\nWhile some question this choice it means they already get a income in sales on the chapters which are released, to keep making the new chapters.\nThis makes sure the chapters we already have are NOT RUSHED.\n\nNot rushing a game release is rare in these days.\n\nGraphics & looks\nWhile not, per se, up to par with triple A games, the graphics do look rather stunning. The occasional glitch can occur, but ive seen those in games of any 'quality'.\nConsidering even that this game is made by a small indie developer who even had to kickstart it, I would say we very much get more than expected.\n\nThe game has its own style, which works well for the story in question.\nThe main 2 characters tend to change looks and clothes depending on situation (and chapter), further adding to some realism.\n\nI personally did not experience any fps issues. (but of course your mileage may vary)\nACTUALLY with further testing it seems on my i7 970 + GTX 770, my fps on the 'awesome' setting is averaging around 30-45. I just do not notice due to gsync)\n\nSound\nThe game has good music, nice voiceacting and plenty of ambient sounds to make you feel at home, or better said in the world.\nIt is at times however hard to hear voice from music and ambient. Some tweaking in your settings may help against this.\nI left subtitles on to make sure I did not miss any words in sentences, as the default config can make that happen. Other noises then the voices talking can drown out the convo at times.\nSo some minor tweaks needed on what is otherwise good music and sound. (on a 2.0 speaker & headset setup. I did not test more speakers)\n\nControls\nControls are fine and work well for the game IF you account for one big thing.\nFor MANY functions its NOT HOLD KEY but CLICK KEY. There, if you are used to games where you hold keys I just saved you a headache.\nWhile functions like movement and running require you to HOLD they key, function like using and opening the RADIAL MENU requires you to CLICK and not hold.\n\nIf you hold the (mouse)key the radial menu will open and do... nothing. You are supposed to click it open and then click on the option you want to perform.\n\nThis method of control is absolutely no problem in playing the game as long as you know that its click.\n\n\nConclusion & TLDR\nThe game is heavily based on lore, discussions and choice. If this is your thing YAY, if not, NAY.\nGraphic-wise great game, especially considering its from a indie company. Great however is not perfect. (Is any game ever)\nNice music & voiceacting & ambience. But the volume mixture between voices & other sounds needs to be manually adjusted.\nIf you hold the radial menu rather then click it, you are gona have a hard day. Click for the menu's.\nFemale protagonist.\nGame is released in chapters and not all chapters are YET released. This increases budget for them to keep working on chapters while NOT rushing them. (aka we will not get junk.)","June 20, 2015","true","22.0"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

I have waited over 8 years for the continuation of this story that has meant more to me than any other story ever told. The wait is finally over, and it seems it has been worth it! Seeing these amazingly well written characters again is like being reunited with old friends. I would recommend this game to anyone who is a lover of good stories, even non-gamers.\n\nDisclaimer: This review only covers impressions from book 1.\n\nSo... About the game. If you are looking for a fast paced game with a good combat system, this game is not for you. There is no combat. If you are easily offended this game is probably not for you either. It is a mature game, and characters in it reflect the wide variety of people you find in the real world. There are offensive characters. There is profanity. It is relatable. On the topic of characters, that's one area where this game truly shines! The characters you meet feel genuine, they feel complex. Real. This is a reflection of the overall fantastic writing which is revealing a thought provoking, deep and mature yet magical story. The dialogue alone had me laugh out loud on several occasions, while other moments pulled at my heartstrings. Of course this is only book one, but it is clear that great things are set in motion already.\n\nAbout choices. Choices make up a key aspect of the actual game-play. They are difficult! Generally there are no obvious good vs. evil choices. Most are morally grey. But they do impact your story in important ways. To help you make the choice you will hear the PC's inner though process as you mouse over each choice. This very effectively serves the dual purpose of letting you get to know the characters better while helping you guess at what the PC will say.\n\nThis game is visually stunning. Sure, if you compare it to the flashiest of the AAA next-gen titles you might find the graphics a bit lacking. But the artstyle is fantastic and it is clear that the world has been crafted with a careful eye for detail. The two worlds of Stark and Arcadia feature very distinct styles, yet there is a cohesiveness that tie them together.\n\nThe Soundtrack is simply amazing amazing. There is one spot in Europolis where you will find a crowd of NPCs around a musician, and I found myself standing around for a few minutes just listening. But even the music coming out of radios, night clubs and the "atmospheric" music is all highly effective and does a great job of underlining the impact of the story. The voice acting is also absolutely superb. Better even than most AAA titles I have played. I must admit it took some getting used to the new voice for Zoe, but she does such a good job I quickly got over it.\n\nTL:DR - If you love a good story and great characters, buy it. The interactions with Shitbot alone are worth it.","October 23, 2014","true","57.3"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Game looks a decade behind the times. Mouth movement is very off and choppy. That is until you get to Zoe and her city. This looks a lot better but the game runs so glitchy. Crashed a few times on me and often the system stops to catch up to you. This has a very very poor unpolished feel. However when your standing still or walking slow the game does look very good.\n\nI feel more interactions could have been worked into the city area. A mini map would be a god send as the city map system is very hard to clearly understand as its vague. All in all I love the story and the landscape graphics are good the people could use alot more work. I think mouth movement could be stopped all together and it create a better feel. It would be old school but at least a better old school.\n\nI am only glad that for the money your going to get all the chapters and not have to fork over more each time. That would end things right there for me.","October 24, 2014","true","6.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

I'd still put some of my thoughts about Revelations;\nChapters 10, 11, and even the Interlude that follows, are probably the best sections of the game for me.\nThe plot really gets stronger here, at last. And while the 3 previous books (which are more than half of the game!) felt like they were just a warm-up for what's coming, here things finally start moving somewhere, and fast.\n\nI did feel rather disappointed at some points, as Chapters became a little like a walking simulator, Zoe travelled through some pretty impressive locations but had very minimal interactions with her surroundings. And no, I haven't forgiven yet to the very straight-forwards puzzles.\n\nBut book 4's plot was so strong and moving for me, and that made me satisfied of Chapters at last.\nAlso, I believe that only in book 4 you actually get to feel the consequences of your choices (I did say earlier that it feels like your choices are simply thrown out of the window. Well, apparantly they're not).\n\nHoping for a nice finale! and hopefully a better review aboutthe entire game once book 5 is released.\n\n~Book Three Review~\nI'm going to exceed the maximum length possible so I'll go short on this one as well.\nTechincally it's pretty much the same as book 1 and 2, although for some reason I experienced framerate drop but I can live with that.\nAnyway, Book 3 was alright, but left me rather disappointed. The TLJ universe is famous for its slow starts but then it all supposed to get amazingly good. Well in book three I got a rather thin and disappointing plot, not too deep and engaging like the first game in the series or even like books 1&2.\nI really hopes throughout the entire game that it's going to finish in an impressive way but.. not, it all felt very typical and shallow, unfortunately. I still had a good time playing the three books and so I leave this as a positive review, and expecting books 4&5 to start get things going and get back to the roots of the series' epicness.\n\n~Book Two Review~\nBasically, I don't have much to add to my thoughts about book one.\nI'm a huge fan of the TLJ universe and games, and I enjoyed this episode a lot, but I still can't help but have mixed feeling about DF:Chapters.\n\nFirst of all, by the time of the release of book two, most technical issues were solved (about time!) and I could finally play with high graphics settings, which was really fun and nice to watch.\nMarcuria is designed wonderfully and beautifully and would  cause every TLJ fan a great joy.\n\nThe story, the writing, the characters are all as good as always and are the main attractions of the game.\n\nThe choices are getting more interesting and difficult each time.\n\nIt's all nice and well, but some wicked thoughts are lingering in my mind:\n1)Where is it all going? Hard to believe but we're arriving soon to the middle of Dreamfall Chapters, and instead of answering some questiong aroused in Dreamfall, we're only getting more and more new questions unanswered.\n\n2)Why not making the gameplay interesting as well?\nAnd yes, there are good and interesting puzzles which I enjoyed, but many times I started feeling bored, just running around from place to place, doing some errands from the goals list, until some critical moment came where something dramatic happened and you had to make a choice.\nUnfortunately this game is almost entirely all about the story, and not much about the actual 'game'\n\n3)Music\nWhy, oh why.. The music in TLJ and DF was so good, so memorable, and here.. it seems like not much thought was put to the subject. And speaking of good stories and tales, music is a very important addition to the subject!\nIn book one I though the music was fine and expected it to get better fit next time..\nBut book two has barely any new addition to the soundtrack. The music is mostly reused from book one and is not much felt, which is disappointing.\n\nAnyway, the game in whole still rocks because of the terrific story, of course. Hopefully it would stay that way.\n\n~Book One Review~\n\nIn short:\n\nGood stuff -\n*Great complex story, the long awaited continuation for Dreamfall TLJ\n*Cool soundtrack\n*Choices and consequences concept introduced into the game\n*Graphics are cool\n*Good writing and characters\n\nBad stuff -\n*Not yet fully optimized for PCs and specifically for 32bit version of Windows (even after patch 1.1.2)\n*Performance and graphics don't justify system requirements\n*Game relies solely on story, not gameplay. Again.\n*Still too early to tell where the game is going and whether it's going to be good or disappointing\n\nI have good things to say about this game, but!\n\nUnfortunately, I'll have to start by saying that technically, this game is not too good. After waiting 7 years for a sequel, when you pre-order a product full price, then get release-delays, and then you have to struggle with the game and with your computer to run stuff properly.... Well, that's a bad start. Really bad start.\nAnyway, I had to buy more RAM and install a 64-bit OS on my system to run this game properly, and if I wasn't an advacned user, I would have been left feeling that I've thrown 30$ to the garbage.\n\nThough, considering the fact that RTG is a new and small company, that they have released pretty fast 3 patches for the game by now (which improved performance but didn't solve my problems anyway), and also considering that they're keeping in touch with the fans, supporting and trying to help as much as possible, keeping the fans updated through every advancement..\n\nWell, Red Thread Games earned my respect, despite this highly unoptimized product.\n\nGood. So, now, for the game itself.\nIt's good. Pretty damn good even, but possibly because I'm already in love with the TLJ universe.\nThe writing is good in my opinion, as expected, and it's the game's main strength.\nI really enjoyed the story and characters, both old and new ones.\nThe soundtrack has taken a new and interesting direction, which fits the game's new style.\nSeems like the devs took some inspiration from Telltale's choices&consequences concept, which I like.\nAnd generally, I enjoyed playing book one and the very opening really got me into this 'new' story.\n\nGameplay-wise, this game plays much like its predecessor. I thought that they'd polish Dreamfall's action sequences (so-called sneaking and combat) but instead they were completely thrown away and we're left with adventure-elements only and the new choices&consequnce idea. The puzzles are also rather easy (although they are more innovative than those on Dreamfall in my opinion).\nI really hoped the developers would listen to the fans about this one, and would make the gameplay more challanging, engaging and worthwhile. But it seems like they have stayed with their old paths and there again the game relies mostly on story.\n\nThe graphics look beautiful and alive but are not stunning, and not they nor the game's performance justify the system requirements.\n\nEuropolis is the largest area in book one, and looks interesting at first, but later it becomes an annoyance when you have to run long distances around without any reward or encouragement for exploring, as when you do that you'd mostly find people talking about politics and basically feel like a big part of the content is duplicated over Europolis.\n\nDespite my complaints, I did get really excited about Chapters and Book One, enjoyed it and am looking forward for the continuation.\nMy only fear is that Chapters has 7 long years of waiting to fill, and doesn't go humble about its ambitions. If the developers won't polish the game some more, and won't improve it's weak points, they could easily turn it into a disappointment.\nNow is simply too soon to predict whether Chapters is going to be a fulfilling title or just leave us feeling empty.","December 9, 2014","true","33.2"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Dreamfall Chapters continues the story of Dreamfall and The Longest Journey in a beautifully rendered, exquisitely voice-acted, and engrossingly written episodic game where your choices affect the outcome and direction of the story.\n\nAs with most initial releases, there are a few hiccups with FPS in various areas regardless of the player's machine configuration. The developers have been responsive and acknowledged these complaints and working towards fixes. I commend them for being responsive as they are, I've seen MANY companies drop the ball. I've only run into a few FPS issues (namely the intro movie) but seem to be fine going through Europolis (where lots of people have been complaining).\n\nI do not regret this purchase in the slightest and am eager for the upcoming chapter releases.

(there thats for fans of the series)\n\nFor newcommers, Dreamfall Chapters is a 3D adventure game in the manner of Walking Dead and many of the old point and click games from the early years of video games on PC.\n\nNow Ill say this now. you should play The Longest Journey: Dreamfall before you play this game (you do not have to play The Longest Journey but its got some usefull backstory and can help expand your appreciation of the world) now you do not have to in order to enjoy the game but it will have that much more meaning and you will really understand the characters and events at the start of the game if you have finished the earlier game.\n\non with the rest of the review:\n\nWhat sets this game apart from its forebears is that it has a tree based structure to its storyline. so for each choice you make there is a real consequence. Now thats the claim from Red Thread the studio responsible for the game.\nAs there is only the first part of the game available, it remains to be seen how extensive this system of choices is, but after some time playing the first book and trying every choice I could make. I am fairly confident that the game will deliver in its promises with upcomming episodes.\n\nThe game uses two choice systems, one is the Balance system a set of events that have a coinflip answer, where the resulting choice greatly effects future outcomes for the character. the other is a walking dead esque system where characters remember your reactions to various events and these are taken into account with future conversations and events.\nwhile many of the choices and events presented provided numerous choices and possibilities, there were very few choices available that had immediate results. I am greatly looking forward to the second book to see how these choices pan out.\n\nNow, it would be remiss of me to not mention some current issues with the game:\nIt has some known graphical bugs and issues with resource usage they are working on fixes for.( they fixed the large framerate drop happening in Europolis and other areas)\nSome people are having crashes and freezes (not me but some people are)\nThe save game system needs work because it just makes a ton of autosave files without any sensible naming system or organisation.(only an issue if you want to try a different response or load a non current game)\n\n\nThe game is mainly about making choices and solving puzzles, this in future will include things like stealth and probably some light combat. but it will be unlikely that combat will be particularly reflex intensive or action oriented.\nCharacters in the dream world seem to have various powers so a kind of magic is also featured in the game in certain areas.\n\nWill you enjoy this game?\nIf you liked games like myst, the stanley parable, any older point and click adventure  you will love this game.\n\nif your into combat and violence, you may still enjoy it but it will feel slow and boring due to long heavy dialogue sequences and alot of travelling.\n\nI love what they have done with dreamfall chapters and am looking forward to the next chapter to see how far they will go.","October 25, 2014","true","89.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

I really appreciate the episodic installments as an idea but don't believe the creators have hit their stride just yet (the pacing is slow and at times the material is trivial).  In general, I'm not a point-n-click fan but this story is rather epic and I love that.  Is the story enough tho?  The answer is no.  The game-play is laborious.  I almost feel as if it would be better without the puzzles as the pacing is rather slow and with the puzzles added in I feel like I'm lagging behind.  This is a negative impact on enjoyment obviously.  Perhaps it has more to do with the fact that I prefer RPG's but this game is not satisfying for me.  And this is where I'm polarized; I love the ever-evolving story but hate playing through it.  Cycling through the past two games (via walkthroughs) did add an appreciation for the entire story arc and helped to draw me in.  But this is a case where the amazing writing is overshadowed by the Gumby game mechanics.  I feel that perhaps just leaving this one as a QTE game would benefit it as less time would be spent on slow environmental interactions and more time on the part I love.  In fact I'm wondering if they should even bother with the pretense of a game on this one and instead simply allow the audience to click through the chapters like a DVD book.\n\nI hate to say it, as I really want to support this team, but this one is probably best experienced through walkthroughs with the current going rate of $30 USD.  Knock that price down to half and it's still better through walkthroughs.  Yeah, the gameplay is really not enjoyable for me.  :/  As refreshing as the "Books" idea is, I just can't ignore the gameplay.  It really makes this experience not fun.  Who want's to run back and forth or around in circles multiple times for a triviality?  Nobody a**holes.  Nobody.\n\n","December 20, 2015","false","26.2"," 18 of 37 people (49%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","49","18","37","3","0"

It was successfully funded on Kickstarter, and it is clear that the team at Red Thread Games is passionate about the Dreamfall franchise. This however, does not change the fact that Chapters (atleast in it's current state) is a bad game.\n\nSo what exactly do i mean by this? Well to start off with, the game runs like crap, and without the graphics to back its poor performance. Despite the game having recently been upgraded from Unity version 4.x to 5.2.3, I still struggle to maintain 60 FPS on my current rig(i7 2600K/GTX 780sc).\nBut what about the game itself? Well. To be fair. It's also very weak. Chapters LOVES to waste your time. It contains tons of illogical puzzles, and pixel hunt-like item scavenging. And when you aren't walking around a large level looking for pointless items, you're likely walking from point A to point B, just to be sent back to A again. Overall the game manages to drag out what could've been a nicely paced 2 hour per episode experince, into a tedious 5 hour walkathon, with very little exposition.\n\nAs such, I really cannot recommend Dreamfall Chapters, as it is simply a bad game. I will however recommend the previous title in the series, known simply as Dreamfall, as it is arguably a much better game.","December 12, 2015","false","11.7"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","0"

I guess when there are always more positive reviews than negative, it's easy to think you have succeeded. That is unfortunate. In light of Star Wars hype, they pretty much pulled a George Lucas(while I respect what Lucas did with the prequels, they do suck). If this is all they can offer us, then I have lost faith in their future games as well. Sure, the budget was much lower than previous games, but given that fact, they must have been in over their heads. The mechanics of this game is ridiculous and insulting to play. They design the game as if to give life to each plot, but the punches, the jumps, the climbing look so lifeless and lazy, I'm just shaking my head while forcing myself to play. They tried to do too much with so little and it feels like wasted potential.\n\nI'll give Book 4 a bit more credit than the previous 3. It had its moments and some of it was rather entertaining. But that was a brief window out of the entire game that feels like pulling teeth to get through. As a whole, there is nothing in this game that makes me want to hold onto it. That's sad because the previous games had a certain tone, mood and music that affected you as a person. This game is like a passive puzzle, a phone app more like. After I'm done playing, I don't give a rat's droppings about it. I really hope the creator's don't think this is their best game yet. No offense.\n\nHaving said that, I'm not even going to bother waiting for book 5. With the way it's been going, they can't possibly do anything else to change my mind about the game.

Sadly that it is an episodic (books) release like TellTale games, but still - the first book didn't disappointed me.\n\nPros:\nThe story so far is interesting, a little bit on a dark note, comparing to the other games.\nVoice acting is superb and graphics are pretty good (I didn't expected much, because it is Unity, but they actually managed to amaze me and make me press F12 many times).\nCharacters are interesting and catchy. They all have their personalities and even from a little time with them - you start to feel and emphasise (at least I did).\nDecisions are hard. Like really. Even in TWD or TWAU it was easier to pick what you like. Here, before making any decision you can listen to an inner insight on what it actually means to character. How she or he interpreters the meaning of this choice or another. And they do matter. I've completed the first book only once, yet I've already heard that depending on some decisions you can get a different job, which means different characters. You can be confident or unsure. You can cling to your past or throw it away and live a new life. I like it.\nAnd soundtrack. Soundtrack is awesome.\n\nCons:\nThe first book is short. It took me about six hours to complete and I tried to explore and got lost in the city more than once. (although, this is relevant. Modern games (full games, AAA titles) tend to have no more than a ten hours of content. And this is just a first book. I suppose for non explorer it would take about three hours to complete the first book. They said it is the shortest one and there's four more to come. So in all - that's above average playtime. Still sad though, comparing to dozens of hours it goes into completion of the original TLJ).\nThe game engine is... well. Unity. There's one particular area (a city) where almost everyone has a serious framerate problems or even crashes. In any other area performance is great, the frame rate goes to infinity and beyond, but in the city? 20 fps or less for me. 5 for some players, judging by forum. It was playable and still enjoyable, but yeah. It is a problem. I'm sure they will fix that in upcoming patch.\n\nI do recommend this game. As well as to play two other ones. Because they do matter and in the first book there's NO exposition of previous events. You do need to know at least plot of Dreamfall.","October 27, 2014","true","9.6"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

Add a lot of choice moments with permanent consequences to this great fantasy game and you have a lot of replay-value on top of all that. Dreamfall is one of the best games in the "Longest Journey" series. This game is quite literally "long" as well, as each individual chapter of the 5 books gives you a lot of game to chew on.\n\nHowever - same as me - you'll often find yourself hard-pressed to play the precesessors ("The Longest Journey" and "Dreamfall : The longest Journey") in order to get all the references, of which this game has a plenty. That said you can enjoy this game without any knowledge of its predecessors, but you might miss out on some subtle details and reoccuring characters.\n\nBut still: When it comes to good adventures this is one of the best to mention. Most definitely amongst my Top 10, right up there with Monkey Island and Full Throttle in terms of memorable quality. If you haven't played "The Longest Journey" (part 1) yet, I'd highly recommend to do so. Part 2 can be skipped, as it was considered one of the weakest. But whatever you do: If you love adventures, don't skip out on this one!","April 25","true","17.6"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

It took my heart right away and so I of course had to get the game. The characters, the idea of two parallel worlds being connected by dreams and the whole story swallowed me completely. And, of course, when Dreamfall - The Longest Journey was released, I needed to know, how the story went on and was hoping all my questions would be answerde. Well, a lot were but the most important ones, that keep the whole world together, were still left open, though loads of hints were given. Well and now, there is the third part Dreamfall Chapters. I just played through Book One and am flashed. It starts of as intriguing as Dreamfall - The Longest Journey ended. The gameplay is pretty intuitive, not much of a tutorial needed, everything just flows. Yes, there are still some graphic bugs but honestly, I so don´t care. I got so wrapped up into the story, that I mainly just got glimpses of the bugs I read later about. They don´t have any effect on the story itself. So, well, here I am, left with a lot of ideas and hints (and still missing Crow, though I am kind of wondering why the maps are all shown by "Crowboy" - reminds me of The Longest Journey and April meeting Crow the first time) and just can´t wait for the rest of the episodes to be released. Though I fear a bit, that a great and awesome story will come to an end at the end of this journey I am still looking forward to it.\nWhat I also love very much is making choices having an effect on the story, relationships and so on. I am really curious for the outcomes of my decisions. And, if I don´t like them, I will replay the game and re-live the story for a different turn.\nFor anyone knowing the other two games a must have. For any other interested in a new innovative story, also a must have (though a bit lore research would be needed).","November 9, 2014","true","18.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

This game is similar to games like Life is Strange.  The choices you make will determine the outcomes of events or relationships with other characters.  Sometimes a walkthough is helpful.  In one part of the story you're in a futuristic city.  In the other part of the story you're in a medieval town.  If you've played Dreamfall: The Longest Journey (which I advise you play first) you'll know what I'm talking about.  If you're into adventure and trying to figure out what a shadow corrupt government is up to you will love this game.\n\nPros\n- Very story rich.\n- Choices determine game events.\n- Gives you a choice to see what other gamers chose on important choices.\n- There are several "books" to this game, hence the name.\n- Futuristic and medieval environments.\n- Go against a shadow government.\n\nCons\n- Bad language.  This isn't the only game I have that has foul language but it's plentiful in this game.  Very unnecessary toward the storyline.\n- Lense flares.  You can turn it on/off but I had to turn it off.

Much like its predecessors, Chapters is dialogue and plot heavy, focusing on building a unique, believable fantasy atmosphere that really immerses you in its universe and characters. In addition, certain parts of the game were surprisingly open, allowing you to explore at your leisure should you so choose. It also appears to implement something new, different choices that the player can make when prompted which will have consequences later on as the game progresses, which remains to be seen. I only discovered one glitch, a couple of small, hard to find spots in a level that I clipped through completely by accident, and was afterwards able to run around in regions of the level where you're definitely not meant to be. The graphics are nothing short of amazing and subsequently might require a bit of a beefy computer to handle, and luckily I was able to get the full benefit of them with smooth performance. While the previous games will definitely help explain a lot of the events in this one, much of it is explained in this game alone, but I definitely recommend the trilogy as a whole.","November 17, 2014","true","59.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

This series really draws you in, and the choice and consequence element to this game ensures that the player truly feels involved with the actions of the protagonists.\n\nThe Story telling in Dreamfall Chapters is wonderfully enhanced by the quality of the visual representation of two unique worlds, and a solid soundtrack.\n\nI highly recommend this game to everyone, but the players who will get the most out of this title are Adventurers who enjoy playing games driven by an original and compelling plot, involving genuinely likeable and relatable characters!\n\nAlthough the series is not complete, this game sets the stage for an intense crescendo of an incredible journey.\n\nI can only hope people enjoy playing this as much as I am.","June 12, 2015","true","34.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sidea01/recommended/237850/","sidea01","Sidea","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sidea01/","21 products in account","I have waited years and years for this game. I am a huge fan of the Longest Journey and Dreamfall. They both hold special places in my heart, and I fell in love with April Ryan, Crow, Zoe, and even Kian. The story that is told between both games, even though Dreamfall is not exactly a sequel, is my favorite story I've ever played through in any game. And I've played a lot of games. Yes, I was highly anticipating Dreamfall Chapters.\n\nSo far only two books have been released, but I'm totally enchanted. The problem is, my enchantment gets suspended for a little too long between books. If you're an impatient fan like me, you should buy the season pass and play as each book gets released. If you're patient, I highly recommend waiting to play the game until it's complete. The time between books really ruins the flow, as both books have ended on cliff hangers that leave you craving more... and then so much time passes that you start to forget about the sense of urgency that you were left with.\n\nThe story:\n10/10! It starts out very slow. If you played Dreamfall, this won't be a problem because you'll understand the bigger picture and know why the slow parts of the story are important. If you haven't played Dreamfall, you might think the story is too thin and confusing for a while. So go play Dreamfall first. Dreamfall Chapters is wonderful, because it picks up right where Dreamfall left of: with Zoe's coma. We get to know a lot more about Zoe in the first book. In the second book, we get to know a lot more about the world she's living in in Stark - it's complicated, detailed, and intriguing. We also spend a lot of time with Kian in Arcadia, which is turning into less of a fairy tale place as the story progresses. The story with Arcadia is big, haunting, rich, and still building. I really want to know more!\n\nThe gameplay:\nWAY better than in Dreamfall. So far there's no combat, just puzzles and progressing the rich story. It's smooth.\n\nThe graphics:\nThe game looks great. It may not blow you away with incredible detail that requires two video cards and an overclocked i7 CPU, but it looks very good on any decent middle power computerr. It's clean, has a beautiful artistic style, and you will get sucked into the story because of both the graphics and the great story telling.\n\nThe puzzles:\nOverall they're good. There's a couple that felt weak, tedious, or just too long. I've not disliked any of them yet. The game is mostly story so far, but the puzzles blend right into the story and progress it well.\n\nThe Choice and Consequence system:\nIt's haunting. Did I choose the right choices!? When you get hit with needing to make a choice, you'll find that it's actually really hard. You really have to think through what kind of story experience you want. Should you let that character die for the sins he or she did, or do you think it's worth saving the character because that character might be useful? Should you disobey orders to do something better, or is disobeying too risky? You just have to chose an option and hope for the best. Yes, I will be replaying the game in order to choose the others choices, because I want to see how the story is affected!\n\nConclusion:\nGo play The Longest Journey and Dreamfall. Your life will be better for it. Then buy this game and play it! Even if you're not an adventure game fan, you can't deny that this series has an amazing story and characters. You're missing out by not getting to know these characters.","May 30, 2015","true","34.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The concept of a hidden dream universe within a Eutopian/Dystopian universe lends an ominous aire of mystery to the first person adventure genre. The atmosphere of these games paints a beautiful, disturbing and haunting picture of the possibilities of alternate universes.\n\nOne must stretch their imagination somewhat to fully appreciate this franchise. Especially if one is not particular to the heavily story and dialogue driven adventure genre. If you are a fan of the adventure ga me genre, and are more interested in story than action, then this game will tickle your fancy on a deep and moving level.\n\nI would only recommend this game to someone who accepts story over action. However, if you are willing to accept these gaming parameters, you are in for one hell of a moving story.\n\nUnfortunately, to get the full emotional and psychological effect of this franchise, it is highly recommended you play all 3 games.\n\nMy biggest problem with the new entry into this franchise is that the game is being released in overly expensive "chapters", rather than one solid sequel. As solid as this release is, I still feel the chapters are NOT worth nearly 30 dollars per chapter. A few hours of gameplay for 30 dollars economically just does not cut it for me.\n\nThis sequel should have been released as one 20 or so hour game...a full game for 60 dollars or so. As it stands we will be paying at least 100 dollars to see this story to it's fruition.\n\nI have to recommend this sequel ONLY to those who have played the previous Dreamfall games. To anyone else? Save your money. These chapter released titles are only worthy of the most die-hard fans of this franchise. If you are a fan of the Dreamfall games and you want to see the story come to a possible fruition, if you are okay with story over action, then I highly recommend you invest in these chapters.\n\nIf you love adventure games, and you've yet to play any other Dreamfall games, then forgo spending 30 dollars on each short adventure of the sequels.\n\nSummary, if you aren't a HUGE fan of the Dreamfall series, then wait until the company releases the entire series as a bundle on sale...you've been warned.","December 15, 2014","true","7.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Reminds me of The Witcher, in a sense that you do feel like every decision is very important and does really make a difference, unlike mass effect, for instance. Of course, we will have to wait and see how the other parts of the game ends, but so far, the game does it even better with the dialog and the way it presents the choices and making you feel the responsible for them.\nReload? Funny.. there's no saving around, you do stuff and live with it.\n\nFeels kinda buggy sometimes. If you click around too much it'll play many recordings at the same time making it impossible to understand and thus annoying once in a while. It's minor though.\n\nAll in all, maybe it needs a little polishing, but so far it exceeds expectation for someone who has been waiting for a sequel for years.\n\n\n","December 21, 2014","true","2.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

With the latest patches that give us better graphical quality control, you can disable shadows and a few other settings to make it playable on even less powerful platforms. I was able to run the game on a Surface Pro 1st-gen (Intel Integrated GPU); albeit there were some problems with the lens-flare effect blocking out the screen (I think the latest patch allows you to disable lens-flares though).\n\nAnxiously awaiting Book 2 and beyond~","December 23, 2014","true","24.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I only recommend this game because it is promising so much, but the first chapter is quite short (4 hours) and unconvincing.\n\nI remember how after minutes of the Longest Journey demo (back in 2000) I was totally absorbed by the game, it grabbed me from the beginning - the talking tree, April, everything made you care or curious right from the start.\n\nIn Chapter 1 we start where Dreamfall ended, which is good, because I always felt that Dreamfall ended abruptly. However, I found the politics plot of this Chapter quite boring. In April's times, Stark had also funny parts (remember the detective or the rubber ducky), but this time it is just dark, dystopian and dull, it doesn't surprise with anything.\n\nI am sorry to say but after the 1st chapter I don't feel anything for the characters, which is a big letdown, TLJ series made you feel involved. Even the choice/consequence system, which is a great feature, doesn't make me feel more involved. The story so far is thin and the characters sketchy. The only character I liked on Stark in this chapter, worthy of the series, was the lady on the boat.\n\nI also don't like the fact that most characters swear a lot, unnecessary a lot.\nThe part that I liked was the Arcadia bit. That's the world I want to see more, that's the place that made me love the series, not the dull slums of Stark. So I am hoping to see more of it.\n\nThe graphics are quite good, but the drawback is that you need good hardware to play this game which started as a point and click adventure. Also, I don't like the interaction system, it reminds me of action games and it just gets in the way of exploring the details in an area. Which brings me to the quest/goals system.\n\nThe action is linear, you get a quest (goal) like in an role playing game and you go from here to there like an errand boy (girl). So much for exploring. You don't need to explore and interact when everything points you towards your goal. The 1st chapter ended much to quickly. I finished the game after four hours, and my reaction was like "come on, that was all"?\n\nI know that more and more games are using episodes to deliver the game, but in Dreamfall's case it is a bad idea. The time between episodes will just disconnect me from the story, it feels like spliting a movie in 5 and watching a bit every month.","December 25, 2014","true","4.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Although you might think there is not much to be done and the chapter is quite short it prepares ground for the future events really well. I became soon again interested in game characters and I´m looking forward to the next chapters. The visuals are nice and although not necessarily next-gen the presentation is rich with an attention to detail. I really think the Unity gave developers a lot of hard times and the performance varies from machine to machine. RTG is trying really hard to squash the bugs and my gameplay was pretty much bug free.\nAlso I must compliment the voice actors. I played Dreamfall right before chapters to recap the events and I must say that I missed the original cast a lot. It took some time to get used to the new voices, but I must admit they did terrific job.

Also it was about to show various choices and everywhere-present consequences. Three worlds, two stories, one destiny. Lets see the realisation in detail.\n\nStory is pretty rich, even more due to two main characters - Zoë Maya Castillo and Kian Alvane. Their choices and decisions are shapng the world around them and even himself/herself and also other main character. There is also a possibility to remind you what happened in previous games, so you can be well informed. There are a lot of aspects to solve, with the dark feeling, that something is coming. Joy and happines is well balanced with sadness and despair, even anger and revenge. For every choice, there is a consqeuence, you just have to find out.\n\nCharacters are strong and abundant in their personalities. Zoë is changing from scared and happy-go-lucky teenager to a responsible and courageous woman, what brings here one of most positive elements. Strong female protagonist. Also Kian is transformed from zealous religious fighter to the defender of weak and opressed. Episodic chracters are helpful and specific. For me, the strongest one was Teta Queenie (czech word for aunt), who forced us to make very serious statement.\n\nVisuals are nice and realistic, art is catching and graphic is set to support the story and background in the game. Moods  and acts are reflected very accurately. However, there were some funny glitches, but it nothing disrupting the gameplay.\n\nSoundtrack is composed by Simon Poole and truly said, it is a masterpiece. Piano, reasonable amount of remix and other instruments with dramatical choirs are goind right under the skin and makes you feel like you were in another world. Exactly there this game takes you.\n\nGameplay was heartwarming, it is mostly adventure with puzzles to solve. Quests are not easy, but solvable, you have to earn your success and sometimes try a bit harder. Game provides you a huge number of various interactions, commented with thougts of main characters. By the way, you can even control a baby here! Choices are differed to lesser and main, second one have "balance" symbol next to them, so you can see, how your friends and rest of the world decided. In the end, all your decisions will be sum up with commentary what you can expect in the following episode.\n\nTo sum it up, Dreamfall Chapters, Book One - Reborn, is a decent and proud member of the Dreamfall Saga and all, what they promised, they fullfilled, sometimes even overcame. I am glad, this was picked up from the Steam Greenlight, it is an exact sequel, how it should be.\n\nRecommended and I can not wait for book two.","January 15, 2015","true","22.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game is packed with unique features and has AAA voice acting that is crazy good. The writing is quite possibly some of the best in any game ever.

I haven't been so wowed by a city since Deus Ex and Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Europolis, like Newport, pulses with a life that makes you wish you could explore forever. I spent a couple of hours just wandering around. Even with my tablet struggling to maintain 800x600 resolution it was a stunning experience. One of my favorite parts of this series is the "real life" pacing of the opening chapters; it is so refreshing to just be able to talk and eavesdrop and quietly enjoy such a rich world that subtly feeds your curiosity. The German translation is pretty good, though there is one conversation where the subtitles and speech are completely messed up. Other than that, and the lack of proper save games, I have nothing to complain about. It could be a little confusing if you haven't played the first games, but if you have? Man oh man. What a beautiful and compelling continuation to the story. Can't wait for the next chapters to be released.

If you've played the previous games, don't hesitate to purchase this one.\n\nPros:  Girl/Guy friendly.  Two stories entertwined, one with a girl protagonist and one with a guy protagonist, one in the past, one in the future.  There's a little bit of everything here for most individuals.  Book 1 was slow getting started, but Book 2 is much better.  Highly recommend you play this with somebody!\n\nNote:  The game is somewhat demanding of system resources and if you are not over the minimum system specs you might not be able to play.

Choices aren't missing, so you play your role in shaping the story, more or less. By playing multiple characters you are easily explained the idea while not being allowed to get bored. What I don't like is that there is quite absence of clear directions how you are supposed to accomplish the task. It makes you spend amount of time wandering around, trying to figure out what or how, and eventually you end up going to the internet searching for tips. It gets better in the forth book.\nNevertheless, I love it. Definitely worth it for those who are not satisfied with handling tasks and crave a meaningful plot.

Ragnar Tornquist never once has failed to tell a good story granted Zoe isn't as excitable, witty and animated (girl next door) as April Ryan was but they she's got character of her own that shines in a way that leaves you crossing your fingers for her, you don't want her light to go out, she is a character worth caring about even as the festering world (the villains) looks for a variety of ways to kill her or at least finish her story for her. Finding her memories is the most important thing for her because otherwise she will lose what she has gained including everything she is and become a hopeless vegetable like the dream machine addicts which is the name of the story, the story keeps you gripping for every moment wondering what waits around the corner of mystery. She intended to live a pointless and mundane life instead of a boring and empty existence as in Casablanca yet her story will guide her to an eventful and colorful life so that she is at least worth mentioning by Lady Alvane as she tells this tale to the kids from the first longest journey of a time when Stark and Arcadia were divided instead of one whole world called Earth where Lady Alvane and the kids are living. However Zoe's life isn't the last tale of the twin worlds for her life likely merely set into motion events that would propel towards the 'War of the Balance' as Crow chimed in at the closing of the original longest journey yet someone eventually educated the Starkers in the tale of the two worlds and the underground living Sentinel (which I suspect the madame by the river market is secretly one of the Sentinel who knows of the twin worlds as well) this of course is a tale that may come later and at the same time it may not, this is after all Rangar's story and we can only speculate.\n\nThe busy ♥♥♥ city is a bit irritating graphically just to move around and it doesn't help that red thread themselves resorted to next-gen graphics standard settings even as they haven't used next-gen graphics literally. I got into Zoe's apartment and that's when things hit an all-time high in lag, the mechanics are still a wee bit wonky but what can you do, except wait on a patch to get that puzzle back into the picture frame? It is true what Cortez said about true art, it speaks to the deepest part of you and leaves a mark on your subconscious that you won't forget in time for that is what Dreamfall Chapters is to me as is the entire longest journey saga. The controls are secondary compared to the graphics, characters and storytelling, good thing there is only a few for the basic interaction instead of like 30-40 of them for various different purposeful or simply meaningless functions. Also this game makes the achievements not mandatory and there is no next-to-impossible task that gives you one either since this game isn't designed on challenge but more on your thinking abilities to solve puzzles and overcome obstacles or hurdles in the story in order to progress. Also according Mr. Tornquist he will make The Longest Journey Home continuing April Ryan's tale and bringing it full circle to a close and doing the fans a favor in keeping it passionately in the theme it was introduced in but evolving it to not feel alienated from Dreamfall. I suspect that in time Dreamfall Chapters will evolve in story to set the stage for the finalizing installments or installment of The Longest Journey, no Ragnar will not wait 8 or more years before the next one for that was Funcom's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t prioritization that created that pattern. In any case The Longest Journey gives video games the great soul and universal power that all entertainment deserves called art!","May 12, 2015","true","62.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There are no interesting characters (they even reverted Zôey back to her dull self from the beginning of the previous game), no interesting dialogue, plot or environment - nothing.","November 1, 2014","false","4.8"," 21 of 44 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","21","44","2","0"

And I seriously think it's not cool at all. I think this system of gated story release didn't really work on the walking dead and it works even less here, because the books do not seem at all as self-contained bits of story. The first 'book' actually is more like a 3-4 hour prologue to the story where we meet and establish some characters, scenes and basic understanding of what's going on. I really like what I see, but I kind of expect to be able to see what's next. And I am not able to.\n\nIt's frustrating because the choice system seems extremely cool, but two months from now I am not sure I am going to be as invested in  the choices I made today during the session.

That should tell you all you need to know. Ragnar has fallen so far, I don't even understand how it could've happened.\n\nThis is going to be long, as I want you to understand, to see if you'll agree with me about this game.\n\nI'm not regularly critical about games, I like games, and I wanted to like this game. It began with The Longest Journey, which to me was a legendary affair, it still is. I remember so much about it, how it touched my imagination and inspired wanderlust. I recall much -- from the flying creatures that passed down stories in their own tongue, to the awakening of Venice. I approached it with wide-eyed wonder, it spoke to both the child and the adult in me.\n\nSo it was with that wonder I looked onward. I recall, again, at the time when friends and I chittered excitedly about Dreamfall. What would it hold? We wanted to think that our Ragnar would be brave enough, bold enough, to let the barrier between worlds fall. And that the dragons themselves may realise their error, and allow this to pass. And what would follow? An amazing epic about the trials and tribulations of two worlds colliding, perhaps with chaos taken to the brink and then to become better than either had ever been.\n\nDreamfall wasn't that. That was fine. It was okay. It was a little overwrought with awkward drama and unnecessary bouts of ennui to be edgy, but it was... all right. Of all the things it might have been, it wasn't memorable. It didn't leave a mark on me the way The Longest Journey did. It felt like Ragnar had left the child by the wayside, picking up an angsty teenager instead. One with dyed hair and a gruff attitude, a shallow, one-dimensional creature that was so desperate to be edgy, to be cool. The wonder had died. It was an intrigue, but it wasn't amazing.\n\nI'd hoped that Ragnar would turn to the child's wonder again. No such luck. The teenager was running rampant now, lots of new hormones as puberty set in. Rage against the machine, man! Stick it to the man, man! And it's a little embarrassing. The teenager holds the reigns, believing that ham-fisted writing, that beating you over the head with cheesy, kludged attempts at emotional manipulation, and overdone twists in an effort to be clever, and unnecessary amounts of Dark & Edgy...\n\nNow, you may play Dreamfall Chapters and disagree with me. Keep playing.\n\nThe first episode is okay. It is merely okay, much like Dreamfall which preceded it. It's okay. It's not going to stir your spirit, it's not going to ease your soulsickness, awaken your wonder, or give you that pleasant sensation that runs down your spine as your jaw falls agape in appreciation for just how much raw creativity a person can have. The Longest Journey could do that. This won't. But that's not a crime, Something can be just okay. And being just okay may not be quite worth the lack of a recommendation. Okay is fine, right?\n\nWell, then the second episode hits. Ragnar gets bored and leaves the teenager at the typewriter. Suffice it to say? This goes about as well as you'd expect it to, and it ends about as well as you'd expect it to. It's trashy, embarrassing, silly, and edgy. It's the sort of thing you see when a teenager writes a fan-fiction about their favourite TV show, except they try to make it dark by having people die and/or suffer. You have to feel my pain, man! Do you feel my pain? DO YOU???? Do. You. Feel. My. Pain?!?\n\nEmbarrassing.\n\nI felt genuinely awkward. I was worried someone would see me playing it. And this isn't a good thing. After the first episode, I was expecting better. I wanted better. I thought... okay, Ragnar is hitting his stride. The Longest Journey took a little bit to get off the ground, it had a slow start. Perhaps this does too? And that's about as far as my faith went. For all intents and purposes, I think it's fair to call Ragnar a one-trick pony. He had one trick -- The Longest Journey -- and he's been riding that wave ever since. Preying on nostalgia in the hopes that no one will notice that he's unable to actually write anything decent any more.\n\nHe shouldn't have let his inner child grow up into that obnoxious teenager. He really shouldn't.\n\nAnd the thing is is that I can no longer trust him, nor can you. He hasn't written anything really good since The Longest Journey, I'm not sure why I was expecting him to start now. I gave him a chance. This was his last chance. If you're an intelligent, well read person with an appreciation for literature, this is so bad it'll make you want to go and find a corner to curl up foetal in. You'll want it to stop being so very bad. It doesn't stop being so very bad. It continues being so very bad until you can't take it any more and you crack. It's really very bad, then, yes. Very bad. In fact, at the risk of sounding like Sewer Urchin, I'd say it's very, very bad. Yeah.\n\nSo bad. I need to stop writing those words, but I can't. Good grief. I've been exposed to an angsty teenager and I want to point you in a different direction so you won't have to sit awkwardly through what I did.\n\nOkay. Okay. I think I have what I need. There's a character in there who fires quick and fast ableist slurs at the mentally disabled. So edgy! The writer felt that that was necessary in order to create a shock response. It was exploitative, cheap, nasty, and as ham fisted as anything else in Chapters is what it was. If he'd had a black person being attacked by someone flinging ethnic slurs, he'd never have gone through with it. He played it safe, he chose a group who're regularly victimised and chose to pick on them. Sounds edgy, doesn't it? Picking on the easiest group like a giant yellow-bellied coward, I mean? He could only have sunk lower if his target had been furries.\n\nWhat, exactly, happened to you, Ragnar? I mean, what?? How do you go from The Longest Journey to... this pile of drivelling brain rot? Christ. So... don't buy this. Move on. Forget it exists. Just forget it exists. Go and play The Longest Journey again. You don't need this much angsty teenager in your life. You really don't.

All the effort and love that's gone into bringing the world to life would be hard to miss. The shamelessly colourful storybook artwork is as great as ever at setting the atmosphere. It seems nice to have some closure after Dreamfall's abrupt cliffhanger. I felt a slight giddyness starting the game up for the first time.\n\nBut it doesn't take long for it to get back to the old tricks. The puzzles are simple but tedious, usually taking you on pointless jogs from one edge of the map to the other, or relying on you to catch that one hint buried in the awkward and long-winded dialogue. Other times it's just about finding the exactly right sequence of messed-up dream logic so you can do the bleeding obvious. All business as usual to those who played adventure games in the 90s, but unfortunately the world has moved on and the design feels decidedly out of place with the otherwise very decent production values.\n\nAll in all, I'm not sure that I can honestly recommend buying Dreamfall Chapters unless you have a high tolerance for frustration or a positive outlook on the previous parts in the series. Maybe grab it from a sale, and take the experience as it is, and you may find yourself enjoying the good parts.","August 3, 2015","false","10.4"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

Think 3D visual novel, complete with writing that would only appeal to 13-year-olds, but without the frustrating story flags that end up killing you and all your loved ones because you made the wrong choice somewhere back in the second chapter. There are very few ways to really screw up in this game. It has very few puzzles (if you could call them that), and they mostly consist of finding and combining items or putting things in the right order. On the positive side, it still manages to make me curious about how things are going to play out, and there’s a little value in replaying the game to see how your choices influence what happens to individual characters (they generally make no difference in the grand scheme of things). The voice acting is quite good.\n\nI give it a 3.5/5 there. Entertaining, but far from a masterpiece.\n\nWhere things really start to crumble though is the technical side. I’m not going to beat around the bush here, this thing’s a MESS and it tends to absolutely ruin the immersion. Graphically, the game looks comparable to titles released in 2006, only with slightly higher texture resolution, a lot of post processing, awful lighting, beginner mistakes (depth/alpha testing failure and z-fighting for instance), distance popping, broken shaders, and rigid, almost robotic character animations that are not timed or positioned correctly most of the time. But it needs a very high-end CPU and gigabytes of RAM to pull this off at acceptable framerates. And even if you have lots of RAM, at some point (roughly 4 GB), performance just falls off a cliff as the garbage collector struggles to deal with all the memory fragmentation because someone thought they didn’t have to care about memory management with a game written using .NET. Nothing could be further from the truth. This seems to happen with a lot of Unity-based titles, so future gamedevs take note—GC’d languages are not a silver bullet. VSync is dysfunctional (probably due the unstable framerate; didn’t attempt to pin down the cause), mouse grabbing does not work properly (cursor leaves the window if you move it too quickly). The list goes on and on. In two hours of gameplay, I hit the “Report Bug” button about a dozen times (as of version 4.1.1). It’s frustrating, to say the least.\n\nI still give it 2/5 points here because at least it hasn’t crashed so far, so it’s not totally unplayable.\n\nOverall, I don’t think I can recommend this game as it is. I might have reconsidered if the developers had fixed some of the major technical flaws (instead of just the symptoms, like Propast completely wrecking performance in earlier versions), but apparently that is either not very high up on their list of priorities, or they simply lack the expertise to do so.","December 29, 2015","false","23.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

I must say I'm not as happy with this as I was expecting to be.  It's a beautiful game, but there's just not much to it.  It took me five hours to finish, and most of the time, I was just bumbling around aimlessly.  It set up for a lot of things, but there's barely enough story here to constitute releasing by itself.  If all of the installments are this short, they had better not be each $30.  I'm hoping that this was just an "appetizer" sort of thing and that the following releases will be more full.","November 1, 2014","true","6.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

This game is a long-awaited finish to what is am amazing story.\n\nI've finished it, and found that they did a great job painting the atmosphere and story.  This game is all about the story.  The graphics were good and the voice acting was top-notch.  I'm very curious to see where it goes from here.  If you would like a unique story and don't mind a game that isn't button-mashing, you should like this.\n\nThe only complaints I have is that it's terribly short.  I finished the first book in under 5 hours.  I know it's episodic, but I really exptected more to start.  Also, the animations are a bit stiff.  Character movmement just doesn't look quite right.\n\nThe last thing remains to be seen.  I'm not sure if buying in gets you all of the episodes or if they will be charging for the rest of the game.  $30 is way too much if this is all you get, and you have to buy the others.  If you get at least 2 or 3 more books, then the prices is about right.","November 4, 2014","true","4.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

We spent one full chapter in the daily life of Zoe, and how she buys dinner or prepares dinner, or gossips with some guy or another. Is this really the epic story we want to see? It's just fluff that could easily be removed or replaced with something a tad bit more interesting.\n\nAs it is, most of the game is padded with fluff to make it take way more time than it needs to.

Even with my lingering, wandering around aimlessly its finished at 3.5 hours. Now you hate this game arent you well dont because this game is awesome.\n\nThe most important thing for me in the game is atmosphere; city is awesome its dark, there are junkies around, there are machines looks like eating human soul, leadership is about the turn dictatorship, local mobs, black markets and then suddenly you can hear a middle eastern melody when walking next to a carpet seller! next to human organs; this is awesome; city is magnificent, its big well designed you feel inspiration and joy also under the constant pressure of danger same time, its hard to give this feeling.\n\nThere is one or two bad voice actors actually they look like they kinda make it lame because they are lazy but othre then these guys rest of the cast is perfect, characters are well designed and interesting (even they dont speak a word- serious) game also is for matures and reminding this to you a lot also another good thing.\n\nBuy this game people or at least try it once, it has tweaks, it should be longer, more things to intereact with, more dialogs and some puzzles -seriously this  is the sequal of an adventure game-.\n\nNote: Zoe is the closest character that has been created in a game like a real woman so far. Ragnar you impressed me\n\nEdit After Book Three there are spoilers here though minor\n\nDont buy this game, The only good thing this game done proper was storytelling and they just screved it up by forcing your protagonist to be gay.

If Zoe selects to resist, then most of the streets will be locked down. As the map system is terrible and I was not familiar with the streets, I spent two hours trying to find a route to get to the mission location (i.e., Dr. Roman's apartment) but just in vein. Eventually I had to give up and restart the mission all over again and change my response to the robotcop so that there would be less streets being locked down and so I could find the way to Dr. Roman's apartment. I was really pis*ed off by this "route-finding" mission.\n\nFurthermore, at the beginning of Book Three, what's the point to ask the player to collect the 9 drawings hidden everywhere in the house? What's the fun about it? Has anyone really enjoyed spending a couple of hours wandering around every room of the house for I-don't-know-how-many-times just to search for those well-hidden pieces of paper?\n\nStupid things/missions like these keep making me to think whether I should continue to waste my life on this not-fun-at-all game. At the moment, I barely found all the 9 drawings by following the hints given in the Boork Three Walkthrough. I have a feeling that I will quit playing this game very soon.\n\n---\n\nI just realized that after finding all the 9 drawings, the next mission is to attach them on the wall in the "right order". How the hell can I know what is the "right order" when no hint at all is provided in the conversation?\n\nThe design of the missions/puzzles really drives me crazy!\nNot recommend this game at all. 3/10, that's how I will rate this game.","October 29, 2015","false","25.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Well, yes I do. But you should consider a few things before buying and playing this.\nDreamfall Chapters is the third game of the series which started in 1999 with "The longest Journey".\nSo in order to properly enjoy and understand `Chapters` you must have played at least the second title of the series `Dreamfall - The longest Journey'. Because it ends with a cliffhanger and `Chapters` picks up where `Dreamfall - TLJ` left off.\nBut actually you should have played `The longest Journey`as well. Because it`s a good game. And it does contribute to `Chapters` storyline. Now lets take a look at the game itself. Chapters is a game which is all about it`s storyline and characters. The gameplay is pretty much boild down to a walking simulator. Something that may annoy a lot of people who are playing or will be playing this game is the objective mechanics. In most cases it is not too obvious where you are supposed to go and what you are supposed to do. Solving most of the `puzzles` does require a lot of exploring, walking, backtracking, talking and patience. I enjoyed that. It forced me to explore the world which got me much more immersed in the games world(s). But the "trial and error" mechanic this game heavily relies on can be really annoying from time to time. Also the game is really, really slow paced. All the running around can get dull from at times. The design of the worlds themself is like in it`s two predecessors top notch. Immersing and beautiful. The graphics quality is okay. Could be better but they do look well enough. One major issue I had with this game are the characters faces. Sometime they look like puppets with no emotion. Thats one big atmospheric killer. On the other hand we should keep in mind that this games development is still in progress and it is beeing made by a handful of people. And they put together an amazing game. And despite some issues I had with this game i still loved it. The storyline behind all the Dreamfall games is really good. Could`ve easily been a real book.\nSo. To draw the circle back to my first question. Do I recommend this game? Yes, I do. To everyone who enjoys a good story and good solid characters. If you have patience and don´t expect action cutscenes a la Final Fantasy you`ll probably enjoy this one. And if you don`t mind a few minor bugs, some stoned faces.\nAnd please do keep in mind that this game is developed by few people. It is not perfect.\nBut it surely is a very good game.\n","May 7","true","34.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The characters are interesting and well developed and each choice to be made makes the player think. Most impressive of all is the world, Prospast is a fascinating totalitarian regime city and feels like the kind of place that could exist. Mercuria was interesting and look foward to learning more lore as the game progresses. My one gripe is that the larger maps can sometimes be confusing to remember and on occasion I did find myself having to rely on guides or wandering aimlessly to discover my goal.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yorgeyvorg/recommended/237850/","yorgeyvorg","Destroyer of Anime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yorgeyvorg/","126 products in account","Friend, do not give up at the start. If you are looking for an impressive hook, it fails completely at it. Do you recall Zoë? If you do not, many things in this segment will confuse and potentially upset you, as they did me. I took the time, after understanding just about nothing, to play Dreamfall:TLJ. I had played the original eons before, sparking my interest in this little thing, but I never got around to playing its sequel. To get a good grasp of Zoë's story, I'm afraid you need to. And if you have played the game, as I did, it will still frustrate you, as it should.\n\nDreamfall: TLJ is perhaps the greatest example of blueballs I have ever seen immortalized in video games. The first half of the story establishes the character and the story, the next fourth sets the stage for the climax, and then... the final fourth of the game shows you just how horrifically rushed the game was. We rush through so much character development, so much of the climax (we effectively end on it), and the denouement is nonexistent: perhaps one story thread finds an actual resolution in the game, while many--such as Zoë's depression and feelings of aimlessness--are left open in the air. Completely unanswered, without so much as an indication of left or right.\n\nHere is where Chapters enters in and leads us on our journey. We meet Zoë again, and we expect the same old girl. And we do get it, in terms of the voice acting: the delivery of the lines is close, as well as her actual diction. She sounds like the same character, and certainly seems to see the world similar to her earlier version. Of course, she also suddenly has MAGIC DREAM POWERS to give the player something to do through our first chapter... because it, in itself, spends a lot of time TELLING US the resolutions to last game's questions. The dream sequence is not too terrible of an offender, beyond that it introduces us to a 'past Zoë' that never existed. Perhaps there were dialogue paths in the predecessor that I missed, but at no point was she a conceited, self-absorbed ♥♥♥♥♥. I'm not really sure why the first chapter ends with us 'accepting' this old Zoë that was just have to accept exists. Maybe she was a jerk before she quite her studies. Maybe the developers totally weren't trying to introduce some canned drama to the mix of an otherwise completely boring chapter.\n\nKian Alvane is the other focal character of the game, and he is something of a tabula rasa. Let's be real, for a second: his character was an expense they just had to let go of in D:TLJ. All of his development was clearly supposed to come in the rising action and climax of the game where YOU KNOW WHO gets the spear, but it is so horribly rushed and his character shifts his ideologies so radically and so unrealistically... does a word of what he said in that game matter? The only thing of real importance would maybe be his affection for YOU KNOW WHO, but in this game he has deer girl. So really, nothing again. Here's the thing, though: this is good. In fact, this is great. Not at all understanding who Kian was from the predecessor did not really impact his story in the least, and I was so much more drawn in by it than Zoë's. Kian's story, in the first and the second book, is comprised of many different tropes all strung together in the unique canon of TLJ. It is, however, done -well-. The characters are fun and interesting, and though Kian is a fairly predictable character, that does not really matter. Honestly, his voice actor carries the role. The dilemmas he is put into are interesting, and the character's responses feel believable. Unfortunately, the first chapter rushes you into this dilemmas and spoon-feeds you tension, giving you only a few points at which to get a feel for the world or for however you would prefer to play Kian. While I was much more interested in his story than Zoë's at this point in the game (and playing D:TLJ does not change this), I still found it incredibly boring and insultingly similar to the telltale games formula. And there's no escaping this: every time you see 'CHARACTER WILL REMEMBER YOUR ACTIONS' flash atop the screen, you should be mildly frustrated at how horribly lazy that approach is.\n\n\nThat is, of course, until the final chapter of book one. Its introduction is fairly bad, I will admit. A cutscene that would make metal gear solid rolls across, that TELLS THE PLAYER DIRECTLY THE ANSWER TO ALL OF THOSE PLOTHOOKS THAT WERE LEFT HANGING. This enraged me so much that I put the game down for a couple days--it is downright lazy storytelling. Zoë speaks to a counselor about what's happened to her, what she recalls, and what she does not recall--as well as the effect of her lengthy coma on her personal life and beliefs. Honestly, the consequences of that are fairly interesting--especially how her relationship with her father becomes more muddled (and this is one of the few instances where playing the earlier game changes something's impact). The problem is that we see none of them, and we are told absolutely every last one of them. Her therapist's office is also terribly boring, really emphasizing just how incredibly boring all of the talking angles are: someone stands in perspective, their head sometimes moving to 3/4ths as their eyes move around randomly. Sometimes they show emotion, but honestly the voice acting carries this ♥♥♥♥. So. Hard. Think Bioware level of 'model behaves awkwardly,' and tone it down just a little and you're here.\n\nThis all changes the instant you talk with the doctor or head out onto the street, and I mean this to the depths of my heart. The dialogue with the doctor is fun, believable, and Zoë's thoughts, presented to you before you make a decision, are honestly entertaining. The worldbuilding of Stark is incredibly visual, with a definite cyberpunk aesethetic revealed. And when the characters are used as tools to further the worldbuilding--describing, for example, the role of the EYE--it's done in a completely believable way. The characters are not looking at the camera and winking with a grin; they're living out their days. You are allowed to roam around a city's section and get acquainted for yourself with the nuances of the future. Given how closely the game modelled the incredibly restrictive and boring TTG model to this point, this caught me completely off-guard. And I almost had a heart attack when my seemingly inconsequential choices--you know, beyond the incredibly tacky YOUR CHOICE HERE WILL MATTER sign--actually altered the way that the plot progressed. This is perhaps what won me over the most at this point. Little details have considerable impacts. Yes, the direction of the overarching story does not change, but the stuff inbetween is altered. Characters take notice of your actions, and there are consequences in how they regard you. They also have different value systems--some prefer being lied to, while the others enjoy a brutal, hard truth. It's a refreshing touch to a genre that increasingly takes every effort not to create branching dialogue trees. My one complaint with the Stark sections is the journal: it tells you important things about what's going on in Zoë's life, and while they are interesting... they are also not really in line with Zoë. It's pretty obvious that somehow April Ryan is writing your notes, because they're written in the same eccentric way. April's diary in TLJ made sense and fit her character; Zoë's sortof sticks out like a sore thumb.\n\nBook two really won me over. Chapter 3, that last bit with Zoë, showed me potential: cool worldbuilding and realistic dialogue. When we start book three, we start with Kian. And this is really all I need to talk about: Kian's shot at a nonlinear environment. It's great. Characters are tropes, but excellently done tropes. I am out of space. Give this game time, and you will not be disappointed. It has flaws, but  weather the storm and you can be sure to be entertained by your choices' consequences.","June 19, 2015","true","13.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Your comatoese self lying on a bed, the dreaming (?) you walking around. The game tells me that I can look at things by pressing A. So I look at the bed and some things around it. Several times. I can't leave the place. There is no telling what to do. After walking around in the very small area for twenty minutes I happen to move close enough to the border and I can see a "trapped dreamer" and is able to leave the bed scene.\nNow I am at a very small bridge. Someone falls past the bridge. Several times. The game tells me that I can track the falling person by pressing X. So I do that. The person keeps falling. I try to press A and the game tells me that the person falls to fast. No hint, no nothing. The person keeps falling and I keep tracking her. I am getting very anoyed so I press X and A repeatedly when the person falls past the bridge for like the hundreth time. That helps, a new menu appears and I am able to slow down time. Maybe the game should have told me that it is possible to get a new menu and not just tell med that I can press X?\nWell, it doesn't help much anyway. The controls are weird ant it takes med 10+ tries before I am able to catch the falling person. The trapped dreamer disappers, I on the other hand, is still trapped on the very small bridge. But I have learned that I should move close to the edges of scenes to get to new locations and I am able to move to a dreamer trapped in darkness. But it is too late. I am anoyed and bored.

This is something that Dreamfall:TLJ, the second game, suffered from, but not to such an extent; and at least, it didn’t suffer from such weird pacing and writing issues.\n\nThe Longest Journey sometimes frustrated me by how arbitrary the solutions to puzzles were. Dreamfall Chapters takes this annoyance and dials it up to 11. There is also no explanation for your powers in the Dreamtime world; they’re just there, they’re not explained, and the game has to point to you through dialogue in a really hamfisted way that you have to use this “slow time” power on characters before doing another action in order to progress.\n\n"Show, don’t tell": the golden rule of narrative, and it was thrown away here.\n\nAs a result, the game feels like it’s forcing you through itself, it just doesn’t have the Longest Journey spirit and atmosphere at all. Remember how outlandish and “out-there” the universe of the first game was? You got thrown by accident into this parallel universe with its huge city, full of unknown and not relying on any conventions. Dreamfall:TLJ slightly dialed that down (but it wasn’t that bad), and in Chapters, you’re pretty much ending up with a generic mashup of cultures.\n\nA good comparison for this is going from Morrowind to Oblivion; you go from something very original and unique to something you’ve seen in 50 other games already.\n\nTwo technical things also bug me here; character animation is almost non-existent. They very rarely move while talking! And sometimes the game just fades to black for a second when a character performs an action instead of showing it through animation.\n\nThere are also really big performance problems, even on a high-end GPU.\n\nAs a long-time TLJ fan, and as someone who backed the Kickstarted for this game, I just can’t recommend it… I’m just really hoping the other 4 books will raise the quality but this isn’t looking good so far :(","October 24, 2014","false","22.6"," 22 of 47 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","22","47","0","7"

Things and Thoughts about the Game might change, for now they only reflect my impression about this Single Episode. Thank you.\nSo. what can i say about Dreamfall Chapters?\n\nFirst of all, please be aware that you wont understand much of the Story and the Game without playing "The longest Journey" and "Dreamfall" before.   ( Doublepack on Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/sub/320/ )\n\nAnd then, well, i loved playing The longest Journey,  Dreamfall is one of my favorite Games and ive been excited and wait for a new Part for a long Time.\nFull of exitement i started playing and it at the Beginning you start to remember what happend before, you remember the wonderfull british accent voiceacting, and how "Dreamfall" ended.\nYou see familiar Characters, you  and keep playing until you reach Europolis.\n\nThere youll be stunned by amazing Visuals, Light effects and a sweet and detailed Leveldesign.\nYou begin to explore... do  some tasks.\n\nWell so far so good, but without spoiling anything, there the Game begins to lack.\n\nNPS make a lot of immature jokes, many People talk rude and use a lot of swear words...\n\nIt might be funny at first, but after that its on the low niveau of Sains Row IV. Every second word you hear is "s**t" or "f**k". you see a vagi** graffiti on an election poster, Im not prude or conservative, but it just doesnt fit in.\n\nIt looks like Dreamfall, but it sounds like a Ghetto version of Dreamfall, that ruins the Atmosphere for me.\nI asked myself why they added this. well maybe to make the Game more hip and interesting for the younger Generation? I dont know. Personally i dont like that.\n\nAt other Points, Dreamfall is also trying to leave the old Path and copying other Games. You will find an annoying Robot, that reminds you on Borderland's Claptrap somehow.  And the Episodes and choices thing, that some people already know from Telltales Games.\n\nIm not sure how to feel about Dreamfall Chapters, honestly it looks great, sounds great, they added some interesting Puzzles again. But for now it doesnt feel like the old Dreamfall anymore. too shallow and impersonal.\n\nIm looking forward to the Second Part / Episode and see if i have to change my Mind.\n\nPro and Contra, for the lazy Readers\n+ Great looking Graphics, Lighteffects, Reflections and Leveldesign.\n+ Good Sounds and atmospheric Music\n+ Like at The longest Journey and Dreamfall: magnificent Voice acting, the british accents bring up a lot of Memories of the old Games.\n+ The Game has some good Puzzles, even if they dont always seem logic, you got to think about what you have to do next.\n+ Its following the Storyline of the Prequels.\n\n● It might be only my personal perception, but the Controls feel a bit clumsy at first, especially the Mouse movement. But i got used to it after a short Time.\n● There is no combat.\n● About 5 hours of Gameplay for the first Book / Episode.\n● Because of the strong language, this Game is not advisable for young Children.\n\n- The Game has a few Bugs, for example can you fall and get stuck in the Map which will prevent you from playing any further, so you have to reload the last Checkpoint, some graphically glitches.\n- The Visuals all together look great, sadly i cant say that about the Character Animation. Their movement looks unnatual and stutters from time to time.\n- A lot of unnecessary swear words and immature jokes.\n\nNote: For now, the Game requires really strong Hardware to be able to play on highest settings, without lag. But according to the Forums, the Developers are working on a fix.\n\nAs i said before, i would strongly advise you to play "The longest Journey" and "Dreamfall", before you play "Dreamfall Chapters".\nAll together, If you like profound adventure Games with a great Storyline, the Dreamfall Series is a must buy for you and i can recommend it.","October 23, 2014","true","8.6"," 19 of 41 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","19","41","0","1"

It's wonderful, everything anyone ever could've wanted from the sequel. The story is brilliant, the characters are brilliant, the UI is a wonder of streamlining and intuition. The puzzles from the last two games are nonexistant, but that's ok.\n\nBut the problem is, the distribution format, of releasing a 'chapter' at a time, is awful. I got through the first one in five hours (mostly because I suck at adventure games, normal players could probs do it in 2-3). I loved every second of it, but now I have to wait until the second chapter to see how many of my minute choices and actions unfold, half of which I've already forgotten, play out. And it's not like I can go back and play it again; i want to see how my choices from before played out, the ones I made in a split seconds decision before I had time to really think it out. The chapter format seriously interupts the storytelling.\n\nI understand the developers thought about this and were originally going to go with one big release, but they ran out of money and so had to go with the episodic format. So I'm not knocking them. But the chapters' release dates are spread so far apart (the second one might not even be released until next year) that it's basically pointless to play in such small measured doses, especially when the emphasis is on watching the story unfold and not gameplay.\n\nBasically, take away is wait until all the chapters are out before buying it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gooses/recommended/237850/","gooses","GooseAttack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gooses/","261 products in account","There are two very engaging plot structures at play in this game; a mystery construction of pipes in the magical realm and an epic political/corporate conspiracy in the technological one, and the desire to see where these went (coupled with some fond memories of The Longest Journey) was what kept me playing. And then it ended quite suddenly, without any form of denouement or resolution, which is solely the reason for my 'not recommended' -- the feeling that stuck with me as the credits rolled being "was that it?". The nature of episodic content is to string you out as long as possible so I wasn't expecting everything to be laid out in front of me, but I was expecting something.\n\nThere are also a bunch of design decisions that didn't sit well with me. Zoe (one of the main protagonists) is an incredibly well rounded, emotional, likeable, believable character with some fantastic dialogue, and playing as her is fun, rewarding, and easily the high point of the game, and it's worth playing for this alone (though was it really necessary to see her in her underwear so prominently? Just because it was in the first game doesn't mean you've got to put it in the sequel). However, it causes a rather jarring discontinuity when you're presented the muscly hunk of the second protagonist Kian, who is as generic as they come and has all the personality and humour of a plank of wood with a serious face painted on it. If they were trying to make a point about the opposing nature of the two main characters then it is poorly made, as the opposite of an interesting character does not need to be a boring one. Playing as Kian was a deeply tedious experience.\n\nThere are only two main environments (one per character) and while they look pretty nice at first, they're less appealing after the fifth time trudging through them, and it's a far cry from the feeling of adventure and discovery in the previous games. At one point a bunch of paths in the technological overworld get closed off, which serves no point other than to be annoying as you can still get everywhere, you just need to take an even longer route. The magical world's equivalent to this is to feature the most epically terrible stealth puzzle the world has ever seen -- something which the designers attempt to hang a lantern on with a 'so you thought there wouldn't be stealth, but there is and you suck at it' achievement, which is a joke in somewhat poor taste considering how badly the puzzle is designed, and how completely unecesscary it is.\n\nSadly it's not the only bit of questionable design. There's a big thing about how your choices shape the story, but the choices you're presented with are so highly ambiguous that you might as well flip a coin for them, and then you're told in big letters THIS WAS IMPORTANT. THIS PERSON WILL REMEMBER. What, so all the other stuff I've been doing isn't important? The rest of my interactions are forgettable? The mechanic appears to be that these choices shift the gameplay in some manner, but they can't shift it too much as the story has to follow the same overall arc, so it comes across as kind of pointless. All it means is that you're guaranteed to be denied some content -- some of the walkthroughs I looked at referred to puzzles and sections that I never got to see. Adventure games don't have a terribly high replay value, so all this achieved was making me feel that I'd missed out. The choices feel very unsatisfying, and I think it's because they're trying to make them shape the story rather than the character. In Mass Effect (which I consider to be the gold standard for choice-based gameplay) the choices you make have little to no impact on the main story, but they have a massive effect on how you view your character, and while they may have had minor gameplay implications you didn't feel that you'd missed out on anything, but that's a roleplaying game where the development of your character is important to you. Here there aren't any roleplaying elements, and the choices you're forced to make don't develop your character in any way as the game will rationalise them so that the character you've been given remains consistent.\n\nAnd then there are bits where the illusion of choice comes crashing down -- there's one bit where you have to chase after a character, but you're not in time to catch them. Only this is in an overworld, so you have the option of buggering off somewhere else. It's okay, they'll wait for you. You can even work your way around and approach them from the front -- but the game then begins its cutscene with you running up behind them.\n\nThere are some profoundly interminable cutscenes, invariably of people talking to each other - I was playing on a laptop and there were several times where the screensaver kicked in due to the lack of input, which made me wonder a bit if the creators would have preferred to make a film. It's also distinctly tonally inconsistent. Sometimes it's lighthearted and funny, sometimes it's serious and drab and sometimes there are bits that make me think 'really? was that entirely necessary?'.\n\nThere are some interesting moments, and it's possible that once it's complete I'll revisit it with a different opinion, but as it stands I don't feel it a story worth the time it takes to tell.","April 12, 2015","false","11.7"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","1"

Disappointing to say the least after waitiing YEARS for this release. I will write more as I complete more "Books" as I still have Book Two to complete.

Loved the VO for Zoe and the other main guy.\nMusic: Gentle and emotional. Also liked that guitar guy song in the city very much.\nArt: Fantastic. Really beautiful and detailed Europolis city and Storytime + Character models.\nStory: Certainly Has a Soul. Also a lot of plot for just one of five books. If we get so much content with each book it will really be an epic saga. I like how it feels at the moment. Deep and complex.\nDialogues: Really entertaining and witty, some bad language but it fits perfectly. Making decisions is fun and I like how you can hower above each option and hear character's inner voice. Also there is a lot of optional talking which is pretty awesome.\nGame-play: There are some puzzles but very easy to solve. The only strange one was one with the wine and I lost my sense of direction a few times in the city so thank god for the Crowboy.\nSetting: Full of life, almost each object has a story to tell.\nBugs: None that I can see. They even postponed the release to squash some bugs to give us the perfect first experience.\n\nIf you like Telltale games you will probably also like this one. Only this one have better graphics, art, more choices and a ton of other content to get immersed into.

As others have said, if you're familiar with the previous games you'll be on board with this from the first seconds. Otherwise, if you've any interest in adventure games at all you owe it to yourself to check this out. It's only the first few chapters of the story so far, and it starts off slowly, but once it gets going you'll find yourself in the largest, most free form open world environment I've ever seen in an adventure game. This isn't the tiny rooms of the Walking Dead, we're talking huge cityscapes.\n\nYou have the choice and consequence of modern adventure games, and the best of dialog and inventory puzzles from the classics. You won't be hauling masses of stuff around with you, but you will be combining items. And, while we've not seen the outcomes of many decisions as yet, there's at least one major character who you can entirely miss depending on your choices.\n\nAnd, most importantly, it absolutely lives up to the writing of the classics. There's more dialog then you'll ever hear in one play through, often with escalating jokes hidden away behind examining items multiple times, incidental background events and internal monologue. Zoe has matured into a witty and engaging heroine, and you will relate to her problems and struggles as you wander her world. It's a game that genuinely deserves to call itself mature, because of the themes it fearlessly explores, not the amount of blood it splashes around.\n\nPleased to have backed it, and hope it sells a ton.","October 23, 2014","true","44.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xpaladin/recommended/237850/","xpaladin","xpaladin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xpaladin/","406 products in account","Be advised o ye potential newcomers, there are four issues with this game as of October 2014. First, be advised that there is only one 'book' available in chapters, i.e. one episode, so you're only getting roughly 4 hours of gameplay out of this. Second, you're going to want to have played both The Longest Journey and Dreamfall completely before picking this up or you're going to feel like this game is an acid trip. (Frankly if you haven't, they're incredible games worth the money.) Third is that the graphics are a little unoptimized so it will make even some rigs capable of running Glorious Star Citizen cry in pain. Unfortunately, this is not helped by the fourth concern, that the character models animations are a little sub par and that does cheapen an otherwise brilliant and immersive experience.\n\nThat said, there are a ton of positives. The setting is fantastically designed and believable. The writing, dialogue and choice system are on par with anything put out by Telltale. Zoe's internal monologues are plastered all over the game and are reflective of the choices she (ahem, YOU) will make, Effects on the storyline are VERY noticable and yet seamlessly woven into the game. It appears that quite a lot of effort was put into making the consequences of actions matter, at least in the short term with Zoe's attitude.\n\nTL;DR - I like where Tørnquist and RTG is going with this. This is what TLJ/Dreamfall fans -- as well as fans of the adventure games genre -- have been waiting for. I recommend a buy after more chapters have been put out there. (And FFS, if you haven't played TLJ and Dreamfall, drop everything and do that right now.)","October 23, 2014","true","26.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I personally had zero issues. I've heard mouse and keyboard works great as well.\n\nVisuals:\nI mean some of the guys look a bit to cartoonish, but beyond that minor gripe this game is current gen. The lighting is truly  where it shines. The atmosphere it creates feels correct.\n\nSound:\nI bought a copy of the first two games on GOG even though I had them on steam just to get the soundtracks after I had beaten both games. This game is no exception and it may actually greatly surpass them by the time all five books release. The voice acting is spot.\n\nGameplay:\nNo odd fight sequences so far thank god. The gameplay feels very natural as you explore the world considering it is an adventure game and adventure games have yet to truly find solid ground on what it means to be an adventure game in todays gaming scene. Though because Dreamfall Chapters is not your standard point and click adventure game of days gone by so some old schoolers may have gripes on the amount of puzzles and difficulty of them. You will not be relentlessly bombarded with inventory puzzle after inventory puzzle involving a duck, but they do exist and they play out quite elegantly in the world.\n\nStory:\nIt's basically what the game is about so if you want explosions and gun fights similar to a 90s action flick go buy Marlow Briggs. The story is very incomplete beings it is only book one, but if this sets the tone for future releases you can expect the most atmospheric story game in history so far. I've heard if you read the journal entries the game makes more sense if you haven't played the past two titles, but I would imagine you'd be confused unless you play them honestly.","October 23, 2014","true","24.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TIM_THOUSAND/recommended/237850/","TIM_THOUSAND","TIMOOOO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TIM_THOUSAND/","211 products in account","It’s impossible to talk about this game without talking about its predecessor, Dreamfall, and Dreamfall was a terrible disappointment.\n\nDreamfall featured a relatively incoherent plot about new characters it never convinced me to care about. The graphics were pretty but only mediocrely designed, the writing was clearly trying to be interesting but failed due to incoherence, and the whole thing felt like a chore to play. I finished it out of a sense of loyalty to The Longest Journey, which remains one of my favorite games of all time.\n\nI’m happy to report that I have good news and great news about Dreamfall Chapters.  The good news is that it is noticeably superior to Dreamfall in every aspect. The great news is that, with some effort and additional work, I think I could be convinced that it’s a worthy sequel to The Longest Journey.\n\nDreamfall Chapters is beautiful, yes, but the thing that stands out about it is that it’s very intelligently directed. There’s an economy of the frame at play here, with dramatic shots being reused to communicate additional information and enhance drama, that just wasn’t present in the previous game. I’m excited to see the game designers thinking carefully about the camera in the cinematic scenes. I can’t help but think of some of the iconic scenes in the first game -- the wizard’s castle, Flipper’s den, the Dragon’s ledge in the beginning -- and I see that the direction of Dreamfall Chapters is an attempt to get closer to the stationary-camera-style visual density that The Longest Journey gave us. Of course, it’s not the same, but the narrative and cinematic tricks that we can do now almost make up for the lack of lush detail you could find in pre-rendered 2D backgrounds. And I’m encouraged by the way Zoe can engage (wittily!) with many details of the environment, making it feel as if what details are there are thoughtful and intentional.\n\nI’m also impressed with the writing. I found myself caring about Zoe and Kian for the first time, even though they were introduced in the previous game. This is where the series really benefits from the episodic structure -- where the previous game felt rushed and ineffectively communicated, Dreamfall Chapters takes its time, and does so to great effect. We can breathe as each character takes one of many asides, explaining her motivations and feelings, and it fits just as if you’re watching a film. I can’t help but compare it to the original game, where we’d get the same narrative, but the screen would be still (we’d be looking at a “room” in an adventure game, after all), and the only character movement would be April’s swaying idle animation; If you see these as parallel structures, it’s pretty exciting to imagine the power of the engine of the new game in terms of storytelling capability. There’s just so much more available to the creators here than there was in TLJ, and it’s good (and it could be great).\n\nBut whether it amounts to greatness remains to be seen. The team working on Dreamfall Chapters is already fighting an uphill battle, trying to save an IP they know is great from the failures of its unfortunate sophomore iteration. They must use characters that I (and maybe I’m alone) didn’t really care about, but it looks like they’re doing a good job of salvaging them and repairing the damage. They have to figure out how to take the narrative structure their audience fell in love with during TLJ and shoehorn it into a first-person 3D interface, and it seems like they’re doing better than they did the last time. For the first time since TLJ, I’m excited to see where this is going.\n\nAs a sort of personal aside, I think that the story trajectory is now my biggest problem with the game. One of my favorite things about the original was how it was founded in the technological world from the beginning -- this helped create a base for the main character and helped center the narrative, allowing the magical side to feel more like fantasy and embellishment, almost as if it lacked rules. It was a dream, and it felt dream-like, and returning to the technological world brought with it real narrative consequences. When things in the dream-side had narrative consequences, that became interesting because it was a transgression of the dream idea (as if a dream shouldn’t have narrative consequences but did anyway), but that was a rule to be broken and not something that happened often. It helped reinforce the magic of the game. Now, we have entire political plots in the magical realm, and I’m struggling to care. I’m still kind of bored with Kian. I can’t muster interest in the political intrigue of Arcadia. This part of the story does not feel magical and it does not feel like a dream, which is the way I was taught to see it in the original.\n\nRegardless, maybe the story will eventually prove me wrong. Dreamfall Chapters left me eager for more, which is much more than I can say for its predecessor.","October 23, 2014","true","24.9"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I played Dreamfall: The Longest Journey back in 2009/2010 and I loved it, in the beginning I thought it was a standalone game, but found out later that it was a sequel to "The Longest Journey" from 1999. So I went on playing the first game. I really thought that it was an amazing game and when Ragner Thørnquist later stated that there would be a 3rd game I couldn't raise my arms high enough. I didn't really check up on Dreamfall Chapters to hype me up, as I do with every other game because I don't want to dissapoint myself. It totally paid off in the beginning, so I started playing Dreamfall Chapters.\n\n*FROM THIS POINT IT MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*\n\nThe game has a good start, picking up and giving us a small rewind on what has happened since we left Alvane arrested for treason and Zoë in a coma. High pace of events. But then it feels like the story falls off track, or at least in my opinion, I haven't got any answers on the questions I asked myself when i completed the second game. All we know is that April Ryan is dead, Kian Alvane got arrested and is now a free man, or at least what we think, Zoë is out of her coma and got sorta back on track again. It was 2 short chapters and an interlude with a baby we know nothing about? The gameplay is great, the graphics and characters are amazing, but I think that after 8 long years of waiting (4/5 years for me) we are owed a longer book with more explanation and a longer chapter than that, because the visit at Mira's shop and helping out testing Shitbot, doesn't say anything, and feels more like waste of time when the first book is so short. I really hope that book two is longer and let's us meet up with the old faces of Arcadia and Stark, such as Cortez and Westhouse.

The fight system seems to be gone. Sneaking is still present, but toned down and only used in a single situation. One new addition in Chapters is the choice&consequence system, similar to what Tell Tale is doing. Hard to tell how that will pan out, as so far there hasn't been much consequence for the choices you make.\n\nOn the negative site, the performance is at the moment pretty bad, but patches for that are incoming. The choice&consequence system is also a little obnoxious, as it gives large on-screen indicators whenever there is a choice, this really should be toned down and be pretty much invisible. Animation are also a bit lacking, as it's still the old hand-animation stuff, not the fancy motion-capture that is used in most other bigger titles.\n\nAs for story, not that much happens in the first book, a few new characters are introduced, you revisit a few old places, but nothing big is so far driving the plot. I personally like that, as it gives you time to familiarize yourself with the world and the world itself looks amazing. Chapters has easily one of the best representations of near-future sci-fi you'll find in gaming.\n\nPuzzles are, as in Dreamfall, still rather streamlined.\n\nOverall, this is the Dreamfall sequel I have been waiting for, it doesn't radically change the formula and continues right where it left of. If you liked Dreamfall, get this game. If you haven't played Dreamfall, play it before you dive into Chapters, as Chapters doesn't bother much with retelling what happened in Dreamfall. Playing The Longest Journey couldn't hurt either.","October 29, 2014","true","9.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I had backed it on Kickstarter and at that point, they were talking about a single game, not vignettes. I wasn't particularly happy about it, but I put my faith in the team that had brought us TLJ and Dreamfall (though I felt much more strongly about the former compared to the latter) and decided to wait and see.\n\nThe result is a 4 hour tutorial that does absolutely nothing to advance the plot. Sure, we get to Europolis, but the sidequests there cannot be finished. That's right—you go through these tedious "find this thing and bring it to this person" quests, but there's no resolution. Each one is a dead end. You don't actually fulfill any of the quests you set out to complete.\n\nI felt like there was way too much fluff injected into this one, as well. Minus the opening sequences with Zoe and then with Kian, it's basically a lot of talking and not enough action. The entire segment with s***bot, as funny as it was, was completely unnecessary and did not contribute to the plot whatsoever.\n\nAs far as design goes, I was very disappointed by Europolis. I literally saw the exact same character models standing next to each other sometimes, same clothes and all. This guy was everywhere I turned. It's like the city is populated strictly by clones. Moreover, you see basically nothing of Arcadia in this game, which was a huge disappointment to me, and I'm a bit put off by this "Saga" nonsense (if it's headed in the direction I think it is, which it appears to be).\n\nRagnar and Red Thread Games gave us a beautiful backdrop and interesting NPCs, but nothing interesting to do. That's a big problem, and not what I paid $110 on Kickstarter for.\n\nEDIT: After playing Book Two, my opinion still stands. I actually can't play all of Book Two without restarting, because one of the quests at the beginning (getting a character to infiltrate a meeting) won't trigger properly no matter what I do. I also noticed the camera is somehow worse than it was before. No matter how many times I try to zoom out a little so I'm not directly over my character's shoulder, I'm pulled back in a few seconds later. It's disorienting and dizzying and I really don't enjoy being nauseous.\n\nI've also fallen through the streets of Marcuria twice, which means restarting from your last save. And just like in Stark, the models for people on the streets are reused to a laughable degree. The same dude with a really unmistakable hat appears in the same area three times. That's just lazy.\n\nI've already paid for all installments, but if I could, I'd cancel and ask for my money back. I am not happy with this game whatsoever.","November 1, 2014","false","5.5"," 15 of 34 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","15","34","0","0"

I agree that this information might have been provided somewhere (I haven't read the description before the purchase), so I dont' blame anyone for that - my fault.

Instead there is a strong focus on the decision making component of the game and on the introduction of the basic mechanics. I simply expected more.\n\nAlthough I decided that I won'trecomment this game at the moment (11.11.'14) , I will try out book two.

I sincerely hope my verdict will change after the remaining episodes have released, but I currently cannot recommend this game...\n\nI have been looking forward to this for quite some time but the experience this far has disappointed me. There is little to no gameplay present save for the conversation wheel and navigating yourself through the city of Europolis. Sure, the game is focused on story and having multiple choices that may(?) change the world around you, but I feel that all the consequences are not clear enough yet. After these first 6 hours of gameplay I have yet to see more than one obvious consequence for an action I have taken. If there are any more actual twists present, they are not clear enough to be noticeable from a single play though.\n\nAdditionally, I have played both of the previous games, but I feel left out on details from the past story as I can't remember them. The recap that is present is more like a trailer and doesn't really help me remember any details outside of the main plot of the previous game (Dreamfall). The original title - The Longest Journey - is not even mentioned. I can only hope this was a "prologue" episode and that the rest of the story will leave enough clues for us "vets" to remember exactly where they left us after Dreamfall.\n\nI will be waiting for the remaining episodes and update this review in the future.","January 1, 2015","false","7.8"," 11 of 26 people (42%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","42","11","26","2","0"

The enviroments such as the cyberpunk city and dreamtime have suprisingly good graphics. The storyline begins where dreamfall : the longest Journey left off and the plot begins to thicken an evolve as you play through the first book; Reborn.  The puzzles throughout the game are somewhat complicated and incorporates some adult psychology in order to help some of the dreamers escape their nightmares that have been induced by the dream machines.  The game is in its own class.\n\nThe length of the first book reborn is about 4-5 hours long.  Just as I was really starting to appreciate the game it ended and I was left very dissapointed.  However, there are 4 more books that come in the form of downloads in the upcoming months.  The budget for this game was limited given it was funded 1.5 million from kidkstarter.  I'm assuming that is why it has been broken into 5 books.  If I had known that I was only receiving around 4-5 hours of playtime I would have waited until the game was finished in it's entirety.  Overall, the game itself is one of a kind.  Although, I do feel I was ripped off given I paid full price 29.95 and recieved only 1/5 of the game.

To be updated*\n\nSummary: Dreamfall Chapters is a story and choice focused game with minor puzzle elements; heavily borrowing mechanics from The Walking Dead. It has a lot of great aspects, such as good atmosphere, interesting characters and great voice-acting. However, poorly designed puzzles, as well as a long and drawn out section towards the end of the game left me bored. The game has a lot of promise, but after playing the first Chapter I cannot recommend buying it yet.\n\nLong version: Dreamfall chapters is the sequel to The Longest Journey and Dreamfall. Like The Longest Journey it has a great setting and rich backstory in the technological world Stark and the magical world Arcadia. Unlike The Longest Journey however, the Dreamfall Chapters is NOT a puzzle game. Rather it is a story and choice focused game which happens to have some puzzles thrown in from time to time. Very much reminiscent of The Walking Dead in that respect. This move away from puzzles and focus on story is neither good nor bad, it just means it is a fundamentally different game from The Longest Journey and will appeal to different people. The Dreamfall Chapters offers up a wonderful world and good characters which are well-written and well-voiced. The choices are a fun aspect to the story, though I do not think they will make me want to replay it, and it is sometimes a bit unclear that you can actually make a choice (which made me accidently leave someone to get tortured… my bad!).\n\nMy biggest problem with Dreamfall Chapters is pacing and the puzzles, however. The great thing about The Longest Journey was that it managed to combine intricate (sometimes ridiculously complex) puzzles with a good story and interesting characters. The puzzles here are very bare bones and feel disconnected from the rest of the game which focuses so intensely on the story. The puzzles, on the other hand, feel like they are getting in the way of the story, slowing it down rather than adding to it. And as soon as I was stuck on a puzzle the wonderful façade that the game had painted started to crack. What looked so good when I was exploring suddenly contained nothing to interact with, no people to talk to even in a crowded marketplace when the goal is to buy something, no hints as to how to progress. You eventually find the solution, more by the absence of alternatives rather than any brilliance on your part. In a real puzzle game the puzzles themselves are the point and there are usually other puzzles to solve if you are stuck. In the Dreamfall Chapters there is nothing but a story which is not progressing.\n\nThis problem is compounded by the deliberately slow pacing of the later parts of the chapter. The city you find there is at first lovely and looks to contain endless details to explore. However, that quickly turns out not to be true. The number of things to interact with is incredibly limited and the snail pace movement of the main character and the absence of a fast-travel system, quickly turns moving around the city into a grind. As I was finally running Zoë home after a day in her life, I completely understood why she did not want to fight with her boyfriend. I was very bored of running back and forth on the map where I had already seen the sights and heard the conversations, watching Zoë awkwardly zigzag after my keyboard commands that obviously should have been controller commands.\n\nI was sure I would be recommending the Dreamfall Chapters after the first 1-2 hours, but after finishing the first chapter I am concerned. The lazy puzzle design and the dragged out city section really distracted from the story and left me feeling bored rather than interested in what will be coming next. It is a shame, because the game has a lot to offer and a lot of potential, but right now I cannot recommend buying this game.","November 10, 2014","false","5.3"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","9","22","0","0"

I've been a devout fan of the Longest Journey Saga for agest, and Dreamfall (the old one that is) sits tall and proud in my favourite games list. However, Dreamfall Chapters is a resounding disappointment. In essence, it's a mere TellTale Games clone (pick any of those to compare it to, they are all boring in my opinion). You get to play as a semi-depressed / fully apathetic Zoë Castillo, who aimlessly walks around a metropolis doing mundane chores, such as following a silly (and awfully unfunny) robot around. When it comes to dialogue, it's all about the TellTale system, aka you have a number of options to choose from and an unimmersive and unnecessary HUD tells you that "Character A will remember what you said". There is also a section where you get to play as Kian Alvane, with an improbable prison break with run off the mill, uninteresting puzzles to solve while climbing a tower to the exit. There is one thing I enjoyed, and that is the research that went behind the lore of the game. For instance, at some point Zoë starts talking about visiting North-Eastern Italy, specifically Trieste, and she goes on a tangent describing this city's sunny horizon. To summarise, Dreamfall Chapters is charmless, slow, mundane, and insipid. Again, I cannot stress enough how much I'd rather this game be great. Fact is it is not. I haven't finished the first chapter, and I don't think I'll be buying the next ones (edit: as pointed out in the comments, I was not aware that buying one of the chapters lands you all of them, Thanks eye).

Not only is it extremely linear, but it is mind-numbing.  I have learned absolutely nothing about the game nor the characters.  All I do know is that it's very one-way.  Do this.  Do this.  Do this.  DON'T THINK ABOUT EXPLORING--It's not happening!  Or at least it hasn't yet.\n\nOh and tutorials?  What are is this thing you speak of?  They don't exist.  I have no idea what I'm doing to the point where I, in frustration, button mash with the hopes of magically clicking on or doing the right thing.\n\nSeriously though, it doesn't explain how to interact with the world.  Yes, in theory, it's straightforward.  But in reality?  It's harder than it looks.  For example, right off the bat, someone is falling.  There's no tutorial to show you how to use your powers.  There's nothing that says, "HEY, LOOK AT HER AND CLICK A!"  No, that would make too sense.  It would rather have you frantically look around for a stick, rope, ladder--whatever to save this falling person's life.  Sadly, no such thing exists so you just feel like you've failed the world.\n\nWhen you eventually realize that A is the only button worth using (assuming you're using an Xbox controller), you think to yourself, "God, I'm dumb."  No, you're really not.  The game really just wants to make you figure everything out on your own.  Which is fine and dandy but... no.  I want to have fun.  Not throw my controller across the room because I failed to save the falling woman 20 times!  Yes, 20 times.  I swear, if we weren't in dreamworld, she would be dead.\n\nMechanics aside, the main character is annoying.  WHY DO YOU USE THE SAME LINE 100 TIMES?!  Like, yes, we get it.  The dream machine is bad.  CAN YOU BE ORIGINAL!?  How old are you?  5?  Because you honestly sound 5.  Not only that, but she's extremely judgmental.  And, from the sounds of it, she's saved the world before.  SO WHY IS SHE BEING SO EDGY?!  Like, ooooh, the world is calling upon you to save them again.  Better be salty as f--- so everyone knows I'm really just a teenage girl who's useless.\n\nLong rant aside, I do not recommend this game.  Only buy it if it's like... $1.99.  Not worth a penny more.  So glad Steam decide to do this return policy.  I'm definitely getting my money back.\n\n/END RANT/","June 14, 2015","false","0.9"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

Now, 8 years later, Dreamfall Chapters picks up from where Dreamfall ended, continuing the journey of Zoe Castillo, who's narrow shoulders carry the balance of two wolds, the world of magic Arcadia and the world of technology Stark.\n\nThis first part of the story starts by picking up the threads of Dreamfall. You see how the actions taken in the previous game have effected and this serves as a starting point for a new adventure, where Zoe needs to find her way again. Red Thred Games, consisting of the original developers of the Longest Journey and Dreamfall, have done an admirable job with this first chapter. It might not be the most adventurous part of the story, but it serves as a nice piece of groundwork for the things to come.\n\nThe story also has different branches, as your actions have an effect to the world.  Depending on how you choose for an example effects on what kind of story is told when Zoe awakens into her new existence. It doesn't only effect on how she dresses, but where she works for an example.\n\nAll in all Dreamfall Chapters is a promising start for a hopefully fulfilling tale of the worlds of balance. Chapter 1 delivers a promise of greatness and if Red Thred Games can keep that up, it could end up as one the best adventure titles of recent years.","November 6, 2014","true","27.6"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

While The Longest Journey was a classic point&click adventure and Dreamfall focused more on interactive story, Chapters fully embraces the narrative choice, popularized by The Walking Dead by Telltale. Unlike there however, questions and choices are much more subtle, less morality based, but we are yet to see how will they change the story (if at all). Finishing this chapter took me roughly 4 hours to complete and I am very happy to report that Tørnquist havent lost his edge and very much delivered in terms of worldbuilding, writing compelling characters and as always top-notch dialogues.\n\nIt is probably best Kickstarter project I backed.

I own a i5 760 @ 3,6 Ghz and a GTX760, System runs at High Performance setting, so no throttling.  With this setup I am able to play most games at high settings in 1024p resolution. Bioshock Infinity, Tomb Raider, Watchdogs, Farcry, Shadow of Morder - no problem. This game though is very choppy. For instance the Title Screen is completely fine, intro is choppy, first area seems to run somewhat fine, then framerate crashes in second chapter. Inbetween massive framerate drops.\n\nMany users already reported that problem. Even after three patches it has not been resolved. Developer states that the game graphics are 'demanding' and they can't do much optimization as they are limited with the Unity engine. Sorry that is a poor excuse. FAQ in their forum to solve this problem doesn't help at all.\n\nAs long as this has not been issued I strongly discourage you from purchasing this game. A pity because let's plays on this game look great!

The puzzles are a bit odd to say the least. the game is an increadible slow boild.\nan excample of a puzzle that was odd would be, and i got to spoil here:\nin the harbor you have a robot called kit robot, you need to remove some barrles from the river. one barrle is unmovable by the robot. the other is. but the secence you need to complete the puzzle is strickt. remove barrle one, then you can get the robe, then ring a bell. what fustrated me was that their was no need for the stricktness. their was no reason why you could only get a robe after the first barrle was removed.\nfor the story wise, might be that i never played the previous game; i did not get the story. for what it was worth it seemed alright, some intresting characters, memorie loss and other ideas that might just involve in an intresting story in the next chapters.\nyet the game does not make me intrested in playing the next chapters or the previous game to get the story. the game pulls out some nonos in story telling by telling most of the story instead of showing, having some unrelated scenes to this chapter that take a huge amount of time.\nfor example, another spoiler here.\nin onepart of the game you play in the past and need to escape. even trough you had no fighting scenes it was prity intense for an interactive story telling. but the tension was not build propperbly, it consists by walking around a lot trying to find a way to open the next part of the game. now the set up as a prison riot would make you think you have some time limit, but no. another missed chance. after that you go back to Zëo in a futuristic world. that point this game grinds to a hold and leaves the hand breaks on for the rest of the way. get dinner for boyfriend, get to work, and do some volentairy work.\nonly towards the last part of the game I get to some plot relevant ideas. everything in the middle is jsut filler.\nOne more point that grinds my gear is the way the choice system is set up. the choices you make will be remembered for the next chapters. the outcome depends on what everyone who played the game made. and that is where i feel the choice system falls appart. i don't care what other poeple choicen, i want to see my play trough, my choices to come to conclusion.\n\nto conclusion: it might be an intresting story burried somewhere in a game with the lack of good puzzles and unfinished level design. Trough the graphics are good, it falls part with the attension to details and keeping some tension in the plot going up.\nI would not recomend the game at this point, maybe with the second chapter it will improve, trough the first chapter is the chapter that should have drawn me into the game to the point i can't wait for the next chapter.","January 5, 2015","false","22.9"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","1"

When I saw developers were collecting money on Kickstarter, I immediately pledge at a word.\nBut now, I am starting to hate Dreamfall the Chapters. This game is the only game which runs with artefacts on my computer (just imagine character’s eyes with laser beams like the Superman).\nWhat else? It took five months to release Book two. Chapter 5 in that is the shortest. And I have spent only a little time playing it from the beginning to the end. As one can see, the developer’s efficiency is questionable.\nIn addition, I was heartily sick of the developer’s Tolstoy-like “novels” that I was getting every time before a release date by email explaining which event on Mars stops them from releasing.\nNo one should play it until all the books has been released.

The "Episodic" content is released super slowly and even then continues to take place in mostly the same old environments that the previous episodes played out in. Very little is added, especially episode 3 was a disappointment. Also, the game characters look totally different from the previous game (Dreamfall) due to a completely new design and different voice actors for the main characters. This makes the continuity harder.\n\nThe slow release of episodes was made even worse by Red Thread's decision to completely change the game's engine after episode 3, including for the older episodes, which caused even bigger delays. It's hard to stay interested in the game this way.\n\nI wish they had stuck by their original plan and released this as a whole game.. This is how it was presented to the kickstarter backers. I have never seen episodic gaming work except for TellTale who do it brilliantly, everyone else manages to screw it up (where's Half Life 2 Episode 3 by the way??). I was worried about this when they announced the episodic format after the end of the kickstarter and unfortunately it came true.\n\nAnyway I'll play it out as I've prepaid for everything but I started losing interest after episode 3 was so dull and now the delay is way too long.","November 15, 2015","false","23.0"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","6","0","0"

These feelings have not changed.\n\nHowever, it was brought to my attention that this game would get 5 episodes, not only 2 as I'd originally thought, which means that 5 hours play time is about par for the course. It still doesn't excuse the fact that\na) there's hardly any actual gameplay. AFAIKR the original TLJ Dreamfall was criticised for being more of an interactive movie than a point-and-click, yet I never could see that and anyway, it worked. This time around it's justified and -- so far -- it doesn't.\nb) there's no developents to speak of, neither character- nor story-wise, no build-up of mystery, suspense ... anything\nRunning around doing menial tasks following instructions (a lab assignment, f.i.) is all right for a tutorial and/or to give the player a feeling of normalcy before everything goes wrong, but one whole episode is too much, even if it's just 20% of the game.\nc) The controls concept is very nice in theory, but very finicky in practise, at least on PC. And yes, Europolis is beautyful and epic and all that, but the "intelligent" maps got on my nerves in no time and after a while you just want to get there the 2015 way, via some kind of fast-travel system.\n\nIf I had to sum up the episode in one word it would be "tedious" and a game shouldn't ever be that.

This review is strictly for episode one as it's all that's out and all I've played.  The worst part about episode one is all the running around you do in the city.  You spend a good amount of time just running back and forth across the map (which I didn't find very intuitive to navigate).  I didn't find the dialogue to be as good or interesting as the previous two games either, there is nothing that hooks you from the beginning and makes you want to keep playing.  Lastly, the graphics can look good with the settings maxed out, however the animations are pretty bad.  The characters are stiff and there isn't much facial expression.  I know this was similar to the Dreamfall but it didn't bother me as much in that game.","March 12, 2015","false","15.2"," 0 of 11 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","11","0","2"

Now I actually liked this change in pase, although some of the nightmare puzzles were a little annoying, the classic dreamfalls humor and gorgeous artsy visuals made it enjoyable.\n\nI didn't mind the intro, but when they did a time lapse, gave the protagonist amnesia and briefly went over the fates of  some of the previous characters it really irked me; Cherry on top, you are put into a new city with no recollection, stuck in a game tutorial for the rest of the first installment. I had to drag myself through this gutt wrenching beginning missions hoping for some plot, but before I knew it the game had ended prematurely and on a cliff hanger.\n\nThis was not the best foot forward.

By the ammount of pointless dialogs, should have been a book. 2/3's of the game is composed of filler dialogs that don't exapand on neither the story nor the characters.\n\nExtremely annoying is the lack of proofing for all texts in the game, as if translated from russian, dialogs are bland and empty. Ragnar Tørnquist tries to lead a game studio without the full power of Funcom, and by the look of things is over his head.\n\nThe Longest Journey - 8/10\nDreamfall: The Longest Journey - 10/10\nDreamfall Chapters: The Longest Journey - 2/10\nKickstarter backer.\n\nUpdate:\n\nHey guys, thanks for the response and the gift.\n\nProofing wise the dialogs are fine, its the style I have the problem with. I have an example for you: re-read the Makoya harassment scene. An Asian man starts to tell a seeming beautiful tale that should be a lesson for the man they are harassing. It starts fine, goes on and on without any direction for a while and ends with "You stupid ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥". As part of an ancient tale of wisdom. This foreign injected cussing elements are littered throughout the dialogs and serve no purpose, but every time you hear them its like nails going over a chalkboard.\n\nI am a game developer working with translators all the time (10 languages per project). For some reason when the source material comes from Slavic countries, the texts are littered with "emotional cussing" whenever opportunity presents. Have a native English speaker go over those dialogs and see the cancerous bits cut out.\n\nYou had an extremely polished first and last portion of the game, but the Europolis area looked like a rushed prototype. I'm sure you were not happy with it, but had to release it due to deadline pressure. Print a quote and put in somewhere visible: "No one remembers the delays, everyone remembers the launched product". In 1.5 years when you release your final episode, backers will be your least concern regarding deadlines. We can wait, you don't need to rush things. The vocal part of the community demanding a release is less than 3% as things usually go. Dont let those voices make you forfeit your principles towards a product you can be proud of.\n\nOnly justifiable reason for this game to be released in current state I can think of is financial struggles. Which speaks volumes of unrealistic project scope vs available resources. You release it hoping to get some rocket fuel to go on, but realistically if you continue on this path, it will only get worse, tone it down and cut stuff out however painful. Be responsible to yourself. You can always release director's cut in a couple of years.\n\nThe review will be updated as more episodes come out.","October 26, 2014","false","3.4"," 8 of 35 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","8","35","0","0"

Yes, 'Dreamfall Chapters' does promise a great story - but those good sides are rather obscured by episodic releases, while all the bad sides are already clearly evident:\n\n- Bad language. Too much of it - 'DC' has more bad language per square millimeter of gameplay I have ever seen in a computer game. I have no idea what the developers wanted to say. Why, we have ladies present here! Wait... OK, those ARE the ladies who are using that much of bad language. Well, call me old-fashioned, but I prefer ladies who do not swear all the time for no apparent reason.\n\n- The graphics. It is not so bad, but even 'Dreamfall' of 2006 did not look much worse. Dark and gloomy Dreamworld, dark and gloomy prison, dark and gloomy Europolis city... And not a sight of the sunny Arcadia.\n\n- The bugs. The game is obviously not optimised - FPS is jumping back and forth, and even powerful PCs have some trouble running it without any crashes.\n\nSo - there is not much sense in buying the game for now (if you do not already have a Kickstarter backer's code).\nAnd I still hope that I would be able to recommend this game after it will be released completely in a year or so!","October 24, 2014","false","6.9"," 27 of 85 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","27","85","0","9"

It was apparently crowd funded and I'm sorry that I missed it.\n\nAs with the ones before, this adventure game's charm comes from the dialog and settings more than the puzzles. One of my favorite lines of dialog comes when the main character is speaking about checkpoints where passes are only issued on the other side, "Kefka would be proud."\n\nThe puzzles are native to the story and generally non-intrusive. They tend to be difficult to get on the first try. Through penalty-free trial and error, none of the puzzles take too long to solve.\n\nIt is worth warning that this game is "Book 1" of a longer series. Expect about 5 hours of game play to hit all the achievements and not much longer than that to have seen everything. I've played other games (I'm looking at you FPS) that were shorter, less entertaining, and cost me more money.

Can't wait for the 2nd chapter to come out tomorrow.\n\nThanks for reading the review, definetely a 8 out of 10.","March 9, 2015","true","30.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Dreamfall Chapters is no exception ... it is a healthy struggle.  We are just learning how to tell and participate in stories in a new way - immersive story based video games are maybe 30 years old.\n\nI am very grateful that this work is being continued in Dreamfall and if there is another Kickstarter campaign to finish April Ryan's story - I'm in.\n\n\n\n","March 7, 2015","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They tend to be difficult to get on the first try. Through penalty-free trial and error, none of the puzzles take too long to solve.\n\nIt is worth warning that this game is "Book 1" of a longer series. Expect about 5 hours of game play to hit all the achievements and not much longer than that to have seen everything. I've played other games (I'm looking at you FPS) that were shorter, less entertaining, and cost me more money.

Not by the graphics but by it’s story. It was so superbly told it was only later I realised the audio, voice acting and world in which it all took place, were beautiful also.\nIt took much to long before it’s follow-up, Dreamfall arrived. Somehow it was not what I was hoping for, but the story made it worthwhile.\n\nAnd now finally the latest instalment of the Dreamfall saga arrived. And I have to say, the graphics are nice. Not the best there is, but after some time I saw the beauty of it. It’s about what’s there to see rather then what is missing. In other words, I got used to it and it made my fantasy render the world nicer than most games do because most important, atmosphere, so often overlooked,  is so much present.\n\nThen there is the audio, most people tend to forget about it, hardly notice it, but in Dreamfall Chapters it so beautiful done. Take some time to listen to the great soundscapes, they mingle perfectly with the world surrounded by it, enrich it. And like in its predecessors voice acting is great. Zoë just wouldn’t be Zoë without that voice.\n\nAnd then there is the story, in all honesty, it took me longer than expected to be struck by it. But once it did, it just didn’t let go. It’s (game) storytelling at its best; how I could only hope for all games should be told, but so few are.\n\nSo, for me, Dreamfall Chapters is in my top 3 of 2014 and after looking what games are still to come, most likely also in 2015.","March 23, 2015","true","28.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I loved the story telling and the beautiful graphics of the original series. I still get the similar feeling from Dreamfall chapters. The graphics are not really top notch compared to the other blockbuster games but the scenery is there. Very creative places and settings. I also found it's even more focused on the story telling than the original series; which is not a bad thing. I feel like I am actually watching an interactive TV show. It still has puzzles and stuff but it's not as difficult. I remember the original series has so many tricky puzzles - or maybe I just grew old and the puzzles are not as difficult anymore. lol\n\nAnyhow, I am taking my time to play this game so I can enjoy it longer and manage my time as well since there are only two books out and it seems like there's a significant wait time for the next ones.\n\nThe bottom line is I am so happy about this game and can't believe the sequel to the longest journey series is finally here. It's not a usual adventure game that you have to grind so much just to follow some silly story. This game is more philosophical and deeper than most of the games out there. Probably that's why there are so many people who have been longing for the sequels. I wish there were more than 5 eps. I actually hope it has "seasons" and come back again some day.\n\n","June 5, 2015","true","671.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Plays similarly to Dreamfall if you omitted the stealth and fight sequences.  I can't say I miss them... usually.  There are "bits" of stealth and action, but they are very much bits and don't result in a lot of "do-overs".  This game is more about choices, much like a choose-your-own adventure book.  It seems there are many different mays to reach your goals as you play.  There is some puzzle-solving, but most of it is fairly simple... but it *can* occasionally be obtuse and difficult to figure out what to do or even where to start, a bit of a holdover from old point-and-click PC "adventure" games of the 80's and 90's I could do without.  (No, I never was able to finish the original "Longest Journey", try as I might, obtuse click-puzzles bore me to death.)\n\nWith months between episodes, I wish there was a "last time on Dreamfall Chapters" function that recaps more than just the previous games.  It would also be nice if it were better optimized.  Graphics are nice with great lighting and atmosphere, but there's usually not a lot going on and the character rigs aren't as complex as AAA games.  Seems like it should perform better than 30-50 fps on an i5/R9 380 rig at 1080p.  That said, the fact this thing is made by a very tiny team is impressive.  You can also play it completely with a controller just like the previous game, which to me is a huge plus.\n\nI will finally say I just finished episode 3.  I hope all the loose ends get tied up and everything makes sense in a satisfying conclusion.  Unfortunately, I feel like this game has the potential to pull a "Lost" or "Fringe"... just a feeling I have... we shall see.  After all, there's still bits from the original Dreamfall that don't quite fit.\n\nI give it 8/10.","July 25, 2015","true","18.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The original game TJL has an absolutely unique strange atmosphere, and in my opinion it was lost in its sequel. In Dreamfall Chapters the stunning futuristic atmosphere comes back and I just cannot express how happy I am about that. Also, after all I am glad that I played "Dreamfall: The Longest Journey" because the story told in The Chapters  wouldn't be clear without it.","July 25, 2015","true","22.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Plays similarly to Dreamfall if you omitted the stealth and fight sequences.  I can't say I miss them... usually.  There are "bits" of stealth and action, but they are very much bits and don't result in a lot of "do-overs".  This game is more about choices, much like a choose-your-own adventure book.  It seems there are many different mays to reach your goals as you play.  There is some puzzle-solving, but most of it is fairly simple... but it *can* occasionally be obtuse and difficult to figure out what to do or even where to start, a bit of a holdover from old point-and-click PC "adventure" games of the 80's and 90's I could do without.  (No, I never was able to finish the original "Longest Journey", try as I might, obtuse click-puzzles bore me to death.)\n\nWith months between episodes, I wish there was a "last time on Dreamfall Chapters" function that recaps more than just the previous games.  It would also be nice if it were better optimized.  Graphics are nice with great lighting and atmosphere, but there's usually not a lot going on and the character rigs aren't as complex as AAA games.  Seems like it should perform better than 30-50 fps on an i5/R9 380 rig at 1080p.  That said, the fact this thing is made by a very tiny team is impressive.  You can also play it completely with a controller just like the previous game, which to me is a huge plus.\n\nI will finally say I just finished episode 3.  I hope all the loose ends get tied up and everything makes sense in a satisfying conclusion.  Unfortunately, I feel like this game has the potential to pull a "Lost" or "Fringe"... just a feeling I have... we shall see.  After all, there's still bits from the original Dreamfall that don't quite fit.\n\nI give it 8/10.","July 25, 2015","true","18.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But I flippin' love this game! First, I'll just get out of the way the fact that I waited 10 years for it to come out. I played Dreamfall when it came out on XBox and was devastated that it ended the way it did with no new development in sight. The world building was rich, I love playing as Zoe, and the story was great. Solid writing, fantastic voice acting, and a female protagonist with agency. I'm a long time PC adventure gamer, and I felt like I'd been waiting for this game all my life. I went back and played The Longest Journey and loved that too. Then I played Dreamfall again just to appreciate how well the fleshed out the world, and how aware you are of the passage of time and it's affect on both places and people. There was also always wonderful diversity in the characters, and I don't just mean the magical races. This series was hitting all the right spots for me.\n\nWhen they announced the Kickstarted for Chapters, I flipped my ♥♥♥♥. I couldn't back it fast enough. But of course I was on the edge of my seat, wondering if it would be worth the wait? What if I waited all this time and it was a total disappointment?\n\nHaving finished Book 3, I can say emphatically that this game is excellent. Zoe has deepened as a character. The changes that have happened in the world between games have deep impact. This game is taking on huge themes - militarization and fascism, racism, politics, revolution. But it all feels very personal as you get to know the characters living through all this. My heart has broken over the people and places that have been wiped away by the conflicts (no spoilers, but there are some deaths that happened between games that I found profoundly tragic). With all this going on, I'm delighted that the quirky, meta, snarky sense of humor that has run through this series has remained. It feels well balanced, and never takes itself too seriously, which I really enjoy. Especially when they make nods to previous PC adventure games, or lampshade a particularly obvious trope.\n\nTL;DR if you like PC adventure games ala Monkey Island and old Sierra stuff, but you want something a little deeper and more conscious (cheesy as that sounds, I mean it) you have to check out this series. Start from the beginning and work your way through. You will be rewarded for your exploration. It's just lovely.","August 25, 2015","true","57.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Dreamfall Chapters, like its predecessor, is a heavily narrative-driven game. If you like games like The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us, Heavy Rain, and Beyond: Two Souls like I do, I believe you are going to enjoy Dreamfall Chapters.\n\nAll the endearing trademarks of the TLJ franchise are also back: funny, witty dialogue, interesting characters, exotic locales, fascinating but mind boggling mysteries :P, great soundtrack, and fantastic voice acting. I also love the new internal monologue game mechanic. It allows you to weigh conversation options in a more organic way because you get to literally hear what Zoey or Kian is thinking.  The choice and consequence mechanic is also pretty intriguing and adds replay value. Book 1 starts out slow but I actually love the pacing. It gives you time to get acquainted with Zoey and, to a lesser extent, Kian and their present situations. Book 2 moves into more traditional adventure gaming territory with more quests and puzzles. The story in Book 2 also picks up considerably and ends with an unexpected and surprising "bang".\n\nOne gripe is that the game is really taking its time reintroducing our favorite characters from past games. The good news is that we'll be seeing Crow in Book 3. Another gripe of mine is that fairly prominent characters from the previous game seem to have been unceremoniously written off. After 8 or so years of waiting, that was a bummer :(. I am hoping that there will be lots of surprises in store for us in the last 3 chapters.\n\nAll in all, if story matters to you, then I highly recommend Dreamfall Chapters.","June 12, 2015","true","36.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As an immediate Kickstarter backer, very excited for a conclusion to the trilogy, I was initially disappointed with Chapters.  It wasn't clear from the outset when you are making critical choices, and I wish there was an easier way to replay specific scenarios instead of entire chapters to see the branching impact on the story.   Book 1 started strong, 2 slumped a bit for my taste, and 3 kicked it off again with major plot developments.\n\nThe story overall is a familiar continuation to Dreamfall, which itself was a strong thematic sequel to The Longest Journey (TLJ), one of the best adventure games of all time.  Dreamfall was plagued with some questionable technical decisions in gameplay, and unfortunately, that extends into Dreamfall Chapters.  The game is pretty in still shots, but runs horribly on many PCs.  I've been fortunate - running a Core i5 with a recent midrange GeForce, it runs acceptably.  It has gotten better since the launch of Book 1 and may be dramatically better by the end of Book 5.\n\nI've heard that RTG is getting a lot of bad press after book 3, but it was my absolute favorite so far.   It seriously advanced the story beyond 1 and 2, and was also in many ways a return to form of the original Dreamfall and TLJ.   It is much better than the overly-long book 2 that feels padded with fetch quests and spends too much time in Propast, the dystopian future city that has a lot of atmosphere and yet manages to be boring beyond a few memorable characters.  I much prefer time spent in Marcuria, although I would like to see more of Arcadia overall.  Sometimes the downside to making a modern game is the sheer amount of work to pull of any new environment -- this makes me wonder if we will ever truly see an updated version of TLJ due to the insanely larger scale of that game.\n\n\n** SPOILERS BELOW **\n\n\nI want more magic!  I hope that Zoe in Marcuria/Arcadia is used beyond where she was in book 3 as a stranger in a strange land.  She's been there before, and I'm sure she can be of use to the resistance.\nI wish Kian had shared about the purpose of the pipes and tower (maybe he did, but it wasn't discussed on camera) so that Zoe can go to the magical hub under the city (from previous games) and we can hear more of her story.\nI really don't care if Kian is gay, the writers can do what they want with that, but I'm disappointed that he has the potential for two love interests and the player can't choose either to pursue.  Yes, my Kian kissed Anna.  And her revelations at the end of Book 3 were good at establishing her character.   Enu is much more interesting overall, but is likely too young for Kian anyway.\nI'm very excited to see Ge'en finally, and am crossing my fingers that Captain Nebevay (TLJ) survived the Chaos Storm and will be there!\nI'm not giving up on April Ryan either.  Ragnar seemed pretty certain she was dead, but Dreamfall Chapters has already established that dreams can be used to shape reality.  It's a longshot that she'll return, but Saga's story recap of TLJ through her illustrations drove home that the authors want us to remember April.","July 6, 2015","true","22.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

DFC does everything right on these parts. I fell in love again with some characters I've been missing since TLJ Dreamfall and I'm thrilled to finally learn about the countless complex mysteries of both worlds, Stark and Arcadia. The only major downside at this point is that you have to wait quite a bit for the next Book. And the one after that. And the... ugh. This is an exercise in patience.\n\n\nSome more detailed notes/impressions:\n\n- DFC is not an Action Adventure. It's not fast-paced. You don't run around guns blazing or jumping from roof to roof. Thankfully you also don't have to endure wacky stealth sequences anymore, or actively punch the bad guys on the nose (like in the predecessor). What you do is solving puzzles, exploring, making decisions, and watching a lot of cutscenes and dialogue while the story unfolds and things get complicated. If the latter's your thing, this game is for you.\n\n- The tone swings between drama, suspense, and sometimes totally unexpected comedy. It's all there. There's a lot of lighthearted stuff going on while drama and mystery keep you hooked at the same time. Great mix.\n\n- The game starts out quite slow, linear, and even depressing in Book One. Personally I came to a point when I got pretty bored. Just play through the first 2-3 hours and there's a good chance you'll get into it. Book Two and Three became real page-turners quickly. Book Three especially.\n\n- While I enjoyed most of the puzzles, this game also made me pull out my hair from time to time. Excessively running around in a fairly big open world just because you've overlooked that one darn item that isn't even hinted at isn't always fun. Oh well. There have to be these parts in any game, I guess.\n\n- KB+M controls sometimes feel a bit clunky. I have to get accustomed to them anew every time a new book is released.\n\n- DFC has a keen eye on diversity and tries to be as inclusive as possible. This is a good thing.\n\n\nConclusion: Great game with minor flaws. Recommended for everyone who's all about story and characters!","July 7, 2015","true","45.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mimirela/recommended/237850/","mimirela","JigglyPuff","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mimirela/","1 product in account","I've been a fan of The Longest Journey since I came across Dreamfall: The Longest Journey and it left me in a state of emptiness after I finished it, like the feeling you get after you finish a book. I found out about The Longest Journey and played it as well and ever since, The Longest Journey and Dreamfall are one of my favorites games of all time. This game was a gift to me, and it remains to be the best gift I've ever received.\n\nWhen I learned they would be making a sequel to my favorite games I was so happy but frustrated that I would have to wait so long, but it was worth the waiting! If you're into fantasy, cyberpunk, adventure and story this game will have you come back to it's universe Stark and Arcadia over and over again to meet some of the best told and designed characters in amazingly made two different worlds.\n\nPreviously, I recommended this game to my friends but I told them they should play the previous games before this one to understand the story and love it, but as I progressed, I saw that this game alone has so much to offer even if you don't know much about the universe the story keeps introducing new characters and shows how the old ones changed as the worlds kept changing. So, even if you haven't played the other games I totally recommend it and I believe it's worth your money.\n\nIf you've played the previous games I doubt I need to say more because this game takes the story where it left off. As soon as you start the game and see the opening cutscene, the game says ''this journey is not going to be an easy one''.\n\nThe game has one of the best stories I've ever heard, read or seen and it NEVER lost its magic for me, I was never bored in any part of the game, there was always something else to be curious about something else to explore and understand and try to figure out. The moment you start your Journey, you should be ready to be surprised by anything because this universe is anything but boring. I enjoyed every single moment of it. Exploring the world in Dreamfall: Chapters was especially amazing because of the improved graphics. Every place you wander will have it's own magic with their own colors and a theme unique to them. The game has a fantasy side to it but not in a universe that is filled with Elves and Orcs or Angels and Demons. It introduces so many races with their unique cultures, designs and stories. They beautifully fit in the games universe and they shape it into what it is. The cyberpunk side of the game doesn't look as unique as it's fantasy side, but it brings humans from different cultures together and you will be seeing how they blend in the futuristic world of TLJ. The voice acting is great dialogues are not dull and if you take your time to interact with objects around yourself the protagonist will comment on the objects and Zoë tends to have interesting things to say about pretty much everything. I like her style. Her voice actress is different from the previous game but she does a great job as well. And as I said the story is amazing but I loved how it pulled me in and at some point I was so mad at something that happened I decided harshly and the consequences were so awful it made me feel horrible. So, yes the decisions you make, so far, have great effects, makes you consider the tiniest things over and over again. I hope the fifth book will live up to my expectations and my decisions will affect how the game ends. Though, I'm not sure if I can handle it if it ends badly because of my poor decisions, I will be crossing my fingers.\n\nYes, I really love the series and I really love this game but I do feel like I must complain about some things that made me frustrated. The controls are bad, sadly. And when you run, you're basically not so much running. So, the exploring part gets a little bit too slow. I'm not saying I don't like exploring, I would've ran around my favorite places over and over again. Well, running is more like fast-paced walking and the animation seems like it as well so I guess it fits. Puzzles are not enough challenging compared to TLJ but considering I was, at some point, randomly clicking on everything trying to find something that works in TLJ maybe this is for the best. Some animations look a little funny but the scenery makes up for it greatly.  Some objects are hard to interact with, you need to hover your mouse on them a few times before you can interact. There are some collision problems and I hate not being able to go up some stairs just because they're not important. They're stairs, they're right infront of me, they're wide open for me to walk on, but the game just won't let me. Yes, it is pointless to go up those stairs but I want to.","January 3","true","22.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That said:\n\nThe Longest Journey is still one of my absolute favorite games.  Combining a rich story and challenging puzzles, it should be in every adventure game fans collection.  The sequel, Dreamfall, didn't quite equal the first's success as it ended up being a lot of set-up without a satisfying pay-off and fans would have to wait almost a decade to see this.\n\nWhile I'm only in the second chapter and am intrigued to see where the story goes, I find myself less compelled to play again each time I exit.  The puzzles can be a bit of a grind when you are often given a task only to have to do another task to get the original done and it's not always clear what you're supposed to be doing.  There's also a lot of emphasis during play on your choices, particularly in dialogue, and you can see how others decided, but I won't know if it really makes a difference unless I go through a second time. I do like the story, but I don't feel like I'm "playing" so much as "watching" events unfold.\n\nOverall, I am enjoying it despite the flaws.  I guess this is more of a soft "not recommend" since I don't feel people who are adventure games fans will enjoy it, but if the premise sounds intriguing and you do like the more story-focused games (like Heavy Rain), you will probably enjoy this.  If you haven't played the original, do yourself a favor and pick it up.  Otherwise, it's just not the game that it used to be.","June 28, 2015","false","18.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's more of a storybook but you get to move the characters, 3D and make decisions to affect how your story progresses through the chapters. There are puzzles to solve and I have to admit I had to Alt-Tab out to find some of the solutions as they really do not give any hints. However be vigilant and not only see, but LISTEN to what the NPC's are saying they might have a key phrase that helps to figure things out. Other times it is just click all combos until you get it. But there were only 2 puzzles that seemed to work that way. This is a very clever game, beautiful to view. I can't wait for Book Five! I screwed up Kian though so make sure you find the infiltrator and remember some of the smaller details of a task are probably very important to be completed because they will have repercussions.

Also, because it's the first part in a series which will, hopefully, get better with subsequent chapters.\n\nI really wasn't blown away by Chapter I. I realize it's intended to set up the story and sorta introduce, or re-introduce different characters, but coming on the heels of TLJ and Dreamfall, it felt very uneven. Some really great moments, broken up by long, uninteresting ones.\n\nReally hoping this story takes off with Chapter 2.\n\n\nEdit: (updated 3/21/16)\nComing back to the game after some time, with RTG having added more chapters to the game and, disappointingly, I have to change my review to Not Recommended.\n\nThe last time I played, I got through a bit of Kian's story before I finally just got fed up and said forget it. I was in the middle of working through a to-do list for a NPC and it just bored me to death. Between that, and another puzzle type task I had just completed, whose solution was so arbitrary, with no logical train of thought leading to it, I decided to step away from the game for a while.\n\nI recently decided to play from the beginning again, having played through once before. Figured I'd start again, with a fresh perspective. I don't know if they changed the controls or what, but just getting past the first bit (with the falling girl) was a hair-ripping experience. After several unsuccessful attempts at  trying to slow them down, then grab them, I finally said "Nope. Forget it". I'd gotten through that bit with complete ease when the game was just released, and it was far more intuitive. So, I think they changed something with the controls or interaction since then, and not for the better.\n\nThe storyline, dialog, voice acting, everything else is great. If this were an interactive story, my opinion would likely be quite different, as Ragnar Tornquist and co. consistently turn out brilliant work in that capacity.\n\nHowever, as this is a game and intended to be interactive, I feel it falls short.\n\nAs much as I would have loved to, I can't recommend this.\n\nFrom now on, if I feel I want to visit Stark and Arcadia, I'll just play one of the first two games in the series.","January 25, 2015","false","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However since I am not from Norway, there was really no chance of me working with RTG when they started their own company.\n\nAll that being said, when I saw the kickstarter for this i gave as much as I could... and I couldnt wait to play it...

That said:\n\nThe Longest Journey is still one of my absolute favorite games.  Combining a rich story and challenging puzzles, it should be in every adventure game fans collection.  The sequel, Dreamfall, didn't quite equal the first's success as it ended up being a lot of set-up without a satisfying pay-off and fans would have to wait almost a decade to see this.\n\nWhile I'm only in the second chapter and am intrigued to see where the story goes, I find myself less compelled to play again each time I exit.  The puzzles can be a bit of a grind when you are often given a task only to have to do another task to get the original done and it's not always clear what you're supposed to be doing.  There's also a lot of emphasis during play on your choices, particularly in dialogue, and you can see how others decided, but I won't know if it really makes a difference unless I go through a second time. I do like the story, but I don't feel like I'm "playing" so much as "watching" events unfold.\n\nOverall, I am enjoying it despite the flaws.  I guess this is more of a soft "not recommend" since I don't feel people who are adventure games fans will enjoy it, but if the premise sounds intriguing and you do like the more story-focused games (like Heavy Rain), you will probably enjoy this.  If you haven't played the original, do yourself a favor and pick it up.  Otherwise, it's just not the game that it used to be.","June 28, 2015","false","18.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While other games try to include more extra points, coins and stars to be had per frame, Red Thread breathes fresh air into Chapters and isn't afraid to patiently flesh out the world skimming the brink of becoming long-winded, but never boring. It's not only the nostalgia that makes it a great game. No element is heavily repetitive making it anything but monotonous -- Chapters has a lot going for it deciding against multi-action-combos in the era of cashing in on user and playerbases as fast and much as possible (good on you, crowdfunding). It is ultimately an earnestly retro game, in a sense where you will get a lot out of it over time, if you let it.\n\n[mild spoilers]\nSarah Hamilton's (April from TLJ) voice comes through clearly especially in the end of Book IV, adding a totally different but complementary vibe to the voice acting of... well, Ellie Conrad-Leigh or Charlotte Ritchie or whichever actress speaks Zoe. Astounding performances on par with ex. Ashley Johnson's Ellie in the Last of Us (where, obviously, much more than a small development team were involved +acting +more time +huge sound departement etc).","January 15","true","36.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I never liked episodic games and I played quite a few.

There was so much backtracking.\nDreamfall chapters is just the same but you can make decissions which may have an impact of some sort but some of those decissions are really weird or the reactions you get are not fitting.\n\nSpoiler example:\nDecission: Torture a man or just question him\n-apparently torture makes him more reliable (which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t!)\nDecission: kill him or don't kill him\n- kill him and you'll make one of your teammates really happy\n- I didn't kill him because Kian is a rebel now, not a warrior and not an azadi.
