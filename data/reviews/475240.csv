But then again, this can also be considered a pro.\n\n\n1/10. "Stop playing video games and get a job"  :P","May 21","true","8.1"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","12","17","0","0"

Music is ok but gets annoying after a while but the combat is satisfying and throwing secondary weapons is fun.

The AI is frankly easy to read and learn but that is a good thing, because just like the older classics they place more of them and harder mobs as the game goes on to make things more challenging, and that is something that all of the classic platformers have in common and I think that is something that makes those games great. Players learn by playing not by reading some tutorial pre-game.\nOverall there are a few things I could say needed improvement but never-the-less I do see what the creator was going for and I sure as hell wasn't disappointed. 9/10 for nostalgia.","May 26","true","1.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I'm not sure what I expected for $2  but the game makes me want to conquer the next section even if the story line is a little lacking.\nWill update as I make more progress into the game.","May 24","true","0.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However, there is no way to map keys for use on other controllers. For example, a SNES controller. Archers are also way to over powered as they don't stagger when you hit them. Whilst not a major problem, it forms a major barricade in my progress.","May 24","true","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","4"

I am not a big fan of Mario but I love this game. Its is simple but a challenge to play. The fact that it has controller support makes it a great couch game or something you can play with out using a network makes it fun to play on the road or just waiting for something to download on your computer. I have looked at the bad reviews and I have to disagree with some of them. $1 is a great price because this game will provide hours of fun. Also, if anyone gives this game bad reviews just because of the archers you are a scrub at gaming. -_-\n\n(P.S. Just look at how much people who gave bad reviews actually played the game. They gave up after 30 minutes)\n\n","May 29","true","2.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
