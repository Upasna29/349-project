An isometric stealth game starring a feisty redhead who’s inherited art has been stolen away, it better understands the fundamentals of what make a brilliant stealth game than nearly anything I’ve ever played.\n\nIt builds itself upon basic but rock solid mechanics - hiding, running, and pilfering anything that isn’t nailed down - and then applies them to ingenious level designs to stretch them to their absolute limits. Miss Take is immediately accessible without ever feeling dumb, giving you tools you understand but finding endless ways to constantly force you to rethink how you can apply them to a situation.\n\nThere was never a moment in Miss Take where I was stagnant. There was always some guard I needed to avoid, some artwork I had to shove into my Mary Poppins-like hat, some pathway I needed to find a way through. It avoids making you feel as if you have to wait the way so many stealth games do, always urging you forward and forcing you to play better. I failed a LOT during my time with the game, but it was always do to a stupid move I’d made or an alarm I hadn’t taken into account, and never once did I want to stop because of it.\n\nMiss Take is so incredibly rewarding and satisfying that getting caught during a heist was almost inconsequential, causing me to lose a moment or two of playtime but in that showing me a way I could better approach a level. With the lack of preset guard patterns I also never got tired of replaying levels, as each attempt changed just enough to give me something new to worry about without completely casting aside the knowledge I had gained from previous attempts.\n\nAnd knowledge is never something Miss Take makes any attempt to hide from you. There’s a continual stream of information being sent to you from every object and obstacle in a level, from a guard’s field of view to whether or not you’re hidden to how much sound any action you perform will make. It’s all right before you at every moment of play, and it’s displayed in a way that’s instantly comprehensible and even stylistic, matching the games ridiculously slick art design as it all blends together under a fantastically jazzy soundtrack.\n\nMiss Take is the kind of game that shows why stealth games don’t have to be slow or tedious; how they can be fast and lively and organic, full of bright colors and delightful characters that were more endearing to me than games with tens of times more dialogue ever managed. The Marvellous Miss Take is as exceptional as its name declares, and it’s immensely depressing how few seem to have given it the chance so they could realize it.\n\nNote: The Marvellous Miss Take was reviewed having played exclusively with a controller.

Want to chase me around an art gallery with dogs and alarms? (London)\n\nYou:\nA bunch of chunky goons; 6ft+ only\nMust be radiating a translucent cone from your eyes to indicate your field of vision\nMen in uniform with random patrol paths\nMe:\nA lithe, classy redhead in a hat (you'll know me when I drop the hat and run when you spot me)\nInto toys :)  and I will bring them (glue, cat noise makers, teleporters; that's how I like it)\nThe stealthiest fun you will ever have!\n;) Catch me while you can, boys!\n\nIf you're into pure stealth experiences The Marvellous Miss Take certainly knows how to please.  I myself am often found crouched in the shadows, stuffing things into my pockets, being the creep that I am.  And, as such, I can tell you what makes a great stealth game.  An adequate stealth game gives you steady feedback on how visible you are at any given time and makes it clear how alert your opponents are.  A good stealth game is all about cunning movement, where actively removing threats is impossible or undesirable.  A great stealth game takes all of the above, adds a heap of character, and then does something you've never quite seen before.  Miss Take is a great stealth game.\n\nLike spitting into the hair of a tall guy a couple rows in front of you in a dark and crowded movie theater, The Marvelous Miss Take is a pure stealth experience.  You cannot incapacitate guards and your goal is to get the loot and get out without being caught.  If you get caught, you lose.\n\nHowever, where Miss Take really shines is in its focus on getting into and fleeing from danger.  You could take your time on every level and get through the game easily.  But if you want to get through well, you'll have to beat the par times for each level.  This might sound awful to old stealth hats, but the game doesn't punish you for being seen as long you can get away.  And as anyone who has run naked down a public street of a major city knows, that has some veracity (provided you have no obvious tattoos or weird scars).  In fact, being seen is a great way to get the guards to stop patrolling near the loot and come stomping to where you decided to give them a show (as most fellows will).  At least this is how it plays for two of the characters.\n\nWhat!?  Multiple characters and playstyles?  Take a minute to collect your popped monocle, reader.  Yes, Miss Take has three characters that play quite differently.  With the eponymous Miss Take you have to collect all the paintings in each level and you are usually given some sort of tool to help: smoke bombs to hide, noise makers to distract guards, a teleporter to move quickly to where you throw it, etc.  However, if somebody notices you and you run for it, she'll drop her hat, which you have to get back before you exit, making drastic evasion riskier.  Her extra goals are to beat a par time and collect loot behind display cases you have to smash (alerting anyone nearby).\n\nYour first ally is a more traditional thief, who can't run but has no par time to beat.  Your optional goal is to take your time and not be seen.  His inclusion was especially nice, since that's the sort of trimming-a-bonzai-tree, patient experience I play stealth games for and lets aficionados of the genre feel like they can ease out of their comfort zone.\n\nAnd finally, the third is a teenage pick-pocket who has to get up close to a guard, stay there for long enough to snatch a key and then unlock a safe that will set off a blaring alarm.  She has no tools, but she doesn't drop her hat when she springs into action like a kangaroo wearing moon shoes.  Once again, the goal is to do it quick (certainly not what she said).\n\nThis plays out over 25 levels, which you will go through once for each character with minor changes for each one.  Much like the interiors of our protagonists' purses, it's an impressive amount of content.  And the difficulty most certainly rises to meet your mounting skills (oh my!), with later levels adding threats like security cameras, dogs that will pick up your scent, and lasers that will limit your movement.  Add these to the basic threat of guards with random movement patterns, and you have yourself a challenge, sir.\n\nFortunately, the game also gives you tools to deal with the rising chaos.  Miss Take's tools are obvious, but each character can make a sound to draw guards to the area; controlling their movement for a time (and without breaking the stealth bonus for our traditional thief).  This is essential, since while random patrols provide a pleasant risk, it would be terrible if you had to wait for them to move into or out of the ideal position for half an hour while the RNG has declared the order of the day is back and forth like the ping pong savants' international tournament for obsessive compulsives.\n\nAnd if this extensive love letter to Miss Take isn't enough, the aesthetic of the game is perfectly fitting a game about art and the acquisition thereof.  The soundtrack is stellar, with a good selection of lovely hard bop jazz.  The models are fairly simple, but the animation is good looking and lively and the use of bright colors make sure Miss Take looks timeless rather than basic.  The characterization of our heroes is strong and - despite their seemingly misanthropic profession - they're made quite likable, like a bunch of posh Robin Hoods, in comparison to the completely deplorable villain.  The game isn't terribly verbose (unlike me), but the dialogue that is there is often witty and enjoyable.\n\nMiss Take does have her worts, they're just small and mostly out of sight (like behind the knee or something).  Despite the quantity of levels and the small efforts to make differences between them for each of the characters, the setting for every level is the same style of art gallery.  Only the layout and time of day changes.  Graphics options are pretty solid, but it gets a little funny about the resolution when alt+tabbing out of the game.  You can't fine tune the volume controls or rebind keys.  I found using pure mouse control to be less than smooth, but using the keyboard to walk fixed that (the 360 controller also works).  And the glue tool has some problems.  For some reason glued enemies would stay alert and constantly aware of my position until the glue ended, causing some problems.  But really, if Miss Take were a painting, the stain of these would only amount to a single drop of coffee from the spit-take at how otherwise amazing it is.\n\nSo, yeah, The Marvelous Miss Take is easily the best stealth game I have played in some time.  Worth twenty dollars?  Maybe, if you just need your skulking in shadows fix.  I'd probably recommend waiting until it goes on sale for ten bucks.  But absolutely get it then.  If stealth is your thing, you won't be disappointed.  If stealth isn't your thing?  Well, Miss Take won't go out of her way to court you, but if you meet her halfway, she might provide you a chance to get into it (ba-zing).\n\nOne Last Note:\n\nI read a couple comments to effect that some people were put off of this game by Feminist Frequency's endorsement of it.  I won't jump to any conclusions about those that might feel wary about that.  Frankly, if a group that is about a social/political agenda, even one I was involved with, was pushing a game, I'd probably be concerned that I'd just have to sit through a parade of their memes rather than a game I enjoy.  Don't worry about that.  The Marvelous Miss Take will appeal to feminists for obvious reasons (and good for Miss Take for hitting that demographic), but it isn't a feminist game.  It's a stealth game.  A really, really good stealth game.  A great stealth game.","March 4, 2015","true","12.0"," 43 of 54 people (80%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","80","43","54","19","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/327310/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","The Marvellous Miss Take is a stealth game set in the world of art galleries, but one doesn't have to be a painting connoisseur to appreciate the title. Although its control mechanics may seem perfectly suited for iOS and Android devices, it subtly finds its footing in the PC arena.\nGamers initially play as Sophia, an heiress who's seeking vengeance against the crooks who stole her great aunt's extensive art collection. Though she's a novice thief, Sophia is determined to reclaim all the stolen items that are housed in these high security galleries.\nTo evade and distract security guards, Sophia can whistle, run, and crouch behind objects within the gallery. During her missions, Sophia will also run into Harry, a gimpy yet experienced pilferer and Daisy, a pickpocket who's a bit more fleet of foot than Sophia.\nEach of these characters are playable, and since each hosts separate skill sets and weaknesses, The Marvellous Miss Take's gameplay variety is one of its strongest assets.\nAnother outstanding facet is the title's visual design. With its modernist and isometric aesthetic, coupled with its playful jazzy score, The Marvelous Miss Take is an adventure that would snugly fit into a 1950s heist film starring Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. The creative linchpin, however, is its top-down, isometric view and its insistence in not giving gamers a complete picture of the galleries.\nAs players move their characters throughout the floor, certain sections of the gallery will be revealed, but successfully completing each stage requires a somewhat photographic knowledge of the gallery as well as correctly predicting the movements of the security guards that hover throughout the area. In short, The Marvellous Miss Take is a nuanced stealth experience that is quite difficult to master. If keeping quiet, tiptoeing around a room, grabbing a treasure, and exiting stage left is the only way you can play a stealth game, then you've come to the wrong place.\nTo complete each stage, gamers must take down all of the great aunt's stolen artwork in the gallery without being caught. Since each alarm system and security guard has a cone sized line of sight, getting caught within these boundaries could signal one's doom. Catching the attention of a guard, however, is a wise strategical move to get him from one place to the next. Once he has a vague idea where the thief is located, players can quickly move their cursor to another room, and grab whatever treasure is located within that area.\nEach character has his or her own way of hiding in plain sight and confusing the guards. Along with running, Sophia can whistle, to distract the guards and send them off to their desired direction. Teleporters, which send Sophia from one section to the next, are also part of her arsenal.\nDaisy's pickpocketing skills give her keys to unlock safes, which are needed to complete certain stages, and although Harry's dexterity is non-existent, he throws noise-making balls for some much needed misdirection.\nI initially believed The Marvellous Miss Take would be a perfect tablet or mobile title since touch and tap controls would have made the gameplay a much more seamless experience. The limiting structure of the click and drag of a mouse makes, for example, throwing Harry's ball across a room or utilizing Sophia's teleporter, an often difficult proposition.\nStill, it's within these limitations that The Marvellous Miss Take shines. The idea behind a pure stealth journey rests within its sheer complexity, and the game's control scheme is far from clunky. Players who love having the cards stacked against them, whether it's the seemingly inescapable alarms or even Harry's all too frustrating immobility, will be seduced by this title's love for adversity.\nFor stealthy experts, The Marvellous Miss Take offers up par times to beat on most of its levels, and if you want to ramp up the difficulty level a bit further, you can steal encased masterpieces that aren't part of the great aunt's collection. Breaking the glass and grabbing these items results in the scream of a random art enthusiast, and if you're not fast on your feet, your thief will immediately be captured.\nThe game is also penned by BAFTA winning scribe James Leach, whose dialogue is imprinted on such video games as Fable, Dungeon Keeper, and Black & White. Though the Marvellous Miss Take doesn't have the most immersive storyline, its gift for snappy dialogue does shine through.\nThe Marvellous Miss Take may, considering its refreshingly light color palette and cutesy moniker, be mistaken as an all too easy stealth experience, but looks are definitely deceiving. Sophia and her partners are beguiling, artful dodgers, and along with stealing a ton of masterpieces, they will also capture a healthy chunk of your time.","September 6, 2015","true","15.6"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","25","28","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yellowlab/recommended/327310/","yellowlab","YellowLab","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yellowlab/","566 products in account","The Marvelous Miss Take is what the developers call an action stealth game. I would say this is about right. The story is that Sophia Take has had her family's art collection stolen from her by what she suspects is a forged will. Thus, she goes out to "repatriate" her collection. Along the way, she finds Harry Carver who is a well-known art thief and Daisy a young pick-pocket. They help Sophia uncover the plot and recover the art.\n\nYeah, it is cliche, but the game is fun. It is played through 25 levels (the first is a tutorial only Sophia can do). Each level is a multi-story building owned by Ralph Blackstock the wealthy magnate who took the art. Sophia must avoid the guards and the cameras as shown by a sight cone. If spotted, the guards will come and investigate. The cameras, they just emit a screeching alarm that attracts all the guards that can hear it. Along the way Sophia can use gadgets (a noise maker - used to create localized noise; a smoke bomb - to hide your movement; a teleporter - to, well, teleport; and a glue bomb - to slow guards and dogs). As you collect loot the gadgets will recharge. Dogs, have a scent cone along with the sight cone. If you are in their scent envelope they will become attracted to you and start following your smelly foot prints (there are actually smelly foot prints you leave behind). Get far enough ahead and you can loose the dogs. If not, they will bark and bark and bark until the guards come. In addition, Sophia can collect masterpieces. There is one on each level. However, when the bystanders see you break the case they will go get a guard.\n\nEach of the other two characters play differently. The building floorplans are the same; however, there may be gates blocking ways you were able to go with Sophia. Harry, known as the fox, has a bum knee so he can't run. To compensate, he has a bouncer gadget that has unlimited charges. When he throws it at an object it will make a noise. But Harry will never leave a level without it. If you can get through the entire level without a guard or a camera seeing you (the bounce and your cane tap is allowable) you are the ghost and receive and extra bonus. Harry also only operates at night.\n\nDaisy is a pickpocket. She first must take keys from the guards, then open up safes to relieve them of their documents and money. Problem is once the safe is open a loud alarm attracts the guards who can hear. She, like Sophia, also has a par time to beat for an extra bonus.\n\nWhat are these extra bonuses? They are more pieces of art that ordain the walls of Sophia's gallery. As she takes the main pieces and displays them, each of the bonuses will put a little picture (or two in Sophia's case) above the main portrait. This is a nice little touch by the developers. The gallery is also the level select menu.\n\nSo, how does it play? I used an XBox controller. The developers originally didn't have controller support - this was added in an update. Other than me confusing buttons occasionally, the control scheme worked well. I don't know how it plays using the keyboard and mouse.The graphics are stylized like comics and it does work well. Occasionally, there is an issue with the camera and not being able to see if you truly are out of the sight cone. But this doesn't happen often. The camera can be moved with the second analog stick (if you remember to do that).\n\nOne of the biggest challenges is that the guards do not have set routes. They have random movement. This may make the levels seem to be based on luck. While sometimes it seems the guards are attracted to you, other times they do turn the other way. If they see you, you start the floor over, no other penalty. Notice, I said floor. If you have cleared the first floor with an awesome time and get caught right before the exit, you only have to start the second floor over. Your time, masterpiece count, ghost all remain as they were. Nice touch to prevent unnecessary travels through a level. I had a hard time with Daisy. I did complete all her levels and was working on the par times. However, this became increasingly frustrating for me and I didn't make that the focus. Some of her levels took me a clock time of over five minutes and probably real time close to twenty. There are eight levels I didn't par with Daisy and I don't see myself going back.\n\nI had the most fun with Harry's levels because these were true stealth - no time limit and not be seen by the guards. Sophia's stealth is where the "action" comes in, especially trying to beat the par time. You are moving as quickly as you can grabbing the treasure and avoiding detection. It is fun, but in its own way.\n\nAll-in-all a very fun experience.","March 21, 2015","true","14.1"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","23","28","0","1"

The story isn't anything special but it's good for what the game is, and sets the background and reasons for what you do, which is stealing valuable art and the like. The stealth part of the game is pretty direct with a couple of enemies to deal with, with their line of sight and whatnot (also dogs), and cameras, lasers, you get the idea, and everything about those are pretty good with the enemy's movement being random and unpredictable.\n\nYou also get nice toys to play around with depending on the level and a noise maker that you can through, or a teleprompter, or glue to slow enemies or other NPCs. Just to make the playing through the levels a little (or a heck lot) more fun depending on how you use it.\n\nThere's also a handful of characters with different priorities when going through the levels, and different abilities and gameplay, which aside from the main campaign and getting three stars (or three frames), adds a heck of a lot more replayability to the game.\n\nThe one thing I found bad/annoying is the imprecise movement system, with how the area you click in to move is a big circle that results click on areas that I didn't want to click on, that and coupled with the locked camera angle leaves an annoying moment to have every now and then.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT1oYf94Rzc\n\nOverall the game is great and I loved my time playing it with it's cheerful and fun simple gameplay, good lengthy campaign that's fun to replay with different approaches and characters, with good and snappy level design.\n\nShameless link[www.ksalue.com] to original post.","November 20, 2014","true","9.5"," 39 of 57 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","39","57","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rubyeyepics/recommended/327310/","rubyeyepics","rubyeye","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rubyeyepics/","15 products in account","The Marvellous Miss Take has the allure of a great Caper Story set in London, where you play as the beautiful Sophia Take, a thief reclaiming her aunt's art collection. You stealthfully try to take back your aunt's masterpieces from a number of galleries utilizing quick strategy, an array of high-tech gadgets and the special skills of your fellow bandits, Harry and Daisy. Each level provides a range of challenging security from guard dogs, to lasers, and infrared cameras, requiring masterful forethought in planning your heist.  Each character has a number of achievements to unlock based on specific art pieces collected or how fast you finish the level.  When it comes to trying to beat the clock, it can be frustrating at times because the random path of the guards almost seem like they know where you are, leaving you no choice but to run and hide or start again.\n\nPart of the fun with this game comes from figuring out the fastest way to loot an area without drawing too much attention.  While you can scroll around a level to a limited diameter from your character, having a separate free ranging camera to look over each gallery before you loot the place, is remarkably absent. Sure you can see the entire layout of each building before you start the mission; however the angle is skewed and somewhat difficult to see all the key areas.  Like a real heist, we should be able to scan each floor and note where each treasure piece and security is located in order to plan our course of action as efficiently as possible.\n\n\nThe story of 'Miss Take' is enhanced with jazzy music, stylish animation and a colorful palette.  The narration is bookmarked with humorous newspaper headlines about your antics and simple text boxes spoken between your characters and patrons.  Given the setting, it would have been great to hear these characters actually speak with an English accent.  It would have literally breathed some personality into these characters and brought the game to life.\n\nGameplay itself is deceptively simple, using point-and-click mouse controls to run, walk, distract and throw objects.  Crouching is done automatically when you sneak behind tables and pillars. There is an option to use Keyboard controls but there is no indication of what those keys are, and no way to rebind them (WASD keys to move, hold-Shift to run, press Spacebar to make distracting noise). The latest update added an Action Camera function, the (C) key, to zoom-in on your character during gameplay.  Unfortunately this is nothing more than a close-up still frame for screen capturing; you cannot play while in this view.  While the official trailer shows clips of Sophia walking around at this lower camera angle, it's bewildering why this new feature locks the game as it would have added a whole new dimension and replay value.\n\n\nDespite some of these minor qualms, The Marvellous Miss Take is a refreshingly fun and unique ‘take’ on the stealth action genre.  You’ll spend hours sneaking your way through a minefield of puzzling obstacles, reclaim your aunt’s “stolen” masterpieces, and do it all over again just to beat your previous time.\n","December 1, 2014","true","36.1"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

I like the variety of challenges and the “easy to learn, tough to master” feel that makes it fun to replay the levels.\n\nThere are a few spots that could use improvement, though. The focus on aiming for better times is problematic due to the random movements of the guards. Pure luck often makes the difference between a good run and a bad run, and that can feel unfair. I think it would be better to eliminate the clock and focus instead on making larger levels and giving each of them a distinct “flavor,” since all the stages look and sound pretty much the same.\n\nOn the whole, I found The Marvellous Miss Take to be a very pleasant surprise. The visual/audio style, themes, and gameplay are very unique and elegantly presented. Fans of stealth games should definitely check this one out.\n\n(Rating: 8/10 “Very Good”)\n\nNotes: The mouse and keyboard controls felt awkward early on, so I switched to an Xbox 360 controller for Windows and never looked back.","December 24, 2014","true","13.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Click on a destination that's not reachable via a straight line, and you can find yourself in view of a guard or security camera.\n\nSpeaking of security cameras, these have a small "safe" area directly below them.  However, the controls are just vague enough that it's easy to accidentally click on a pixel too far and end up within view of the camera.\n\n\nOther issues to note:\n\n- Quitting mid-mission means you have to redo it from the start, there's no warning of this (as of Dec 1st).  This is particularly annoying for missions with three floors.\n- You have to complete all missions within a chapter in sequence.  There is no ability to switch to another mission in the same chapter if you get stuck.\n- The camera cannot be zoomed out to give you a view of the whole floor (though there is limited scrolling).  This makes it more difficult to plan your route in advance.\n\nWhile the game is clearly not for me, it has promise and might be appreciated by someone who enjoys games where a large element of luck is needed.","December 1, 2014","false","3.2"," 29 of 51 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","29","51","0","0"

The cartoony graphics style and animation, the non violence approach to the genre, the fitting music and the hilarious puns create a really lovely experience for gamers of all ages!\nThe main character is the charming Miss Sophia Take - a lady with a big red hat and a fiery hair. She's pretty new in the "business", so the first chapter of the game is kinda like a tutorial, as you learn to use your wit and different gadgets in this speedy theft affair. All of the levels I've played ( first 9 so far) consist of 2 parts and you usually have less than 2 minutes to complete them both ( for a noteworthy performance at least :p), so you need to be fast and and you need to be bold in your stealth action. There aren't any hp bars or something, as there is no violence - once caught you need to restart, but no worries, there is a savepoint for each part of the level.\nThe game offers one-hand-only-full mouse control, but there is a keyboard movement option if you like it, and I definitely used it. Playing with one hand has it's advantages :p, but the keyboard controls are tight and very useful in my opinion.\nI've only unlocked 1 character so far, so I have 2 to pick from. With the second one you play the same levels, but you have different objectives and quite different playstyle - with miss Take your nimble and fast, and there is a time goal, and with the dude I unlocked - your moving around like Dr. House, but there is no timer, instead there is a "ghost" goal (be completely unseen).\nI like the organized chaos approach - you really need to be fast and decisive, instead of staying still in the corners and trying to figure out guard's movement pattern. You will get caught once or twice, as you trial and error through the levels, making it so much more satisfying, when you achieve the perfect heist!\nI'm a stealth games fan, so this review might be a bit biased, but I really like this game and can only recommend it! Then again, I think the price tag is way too steep, so if you're not a fan of the genre like me, you might wanna wait for the game to go on sale!\n\nTL:DR or you wanna check out some gameplay - check my overview video as I complete a couple of levels with each of the first 2 characters :\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=344283722\n\n\n","November 20, 2014","true","2.5"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","16","27","0","0"

Throughout the game you learn how to beat certain levels and how to get around certain art museums.The challenge's to get a fast time and to get the bonus objects just makes the game so much better! I would reccomend getting the game while it is on sale at (50%) off. So far there arent any bugs in the game which I have noticed but if there are I will still love the game for what it is worth. Hope the developers keep updating this game and maybe in the future they could make free DLC which would extend the gameplay just an extra hour or so.\n\n- Simon","November 27, 2014","true","1.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

From the outset the presentation is delightful. The mechanics are simple but neat. The control is a little wooly (click on a destination and Miss Take will walk there - hold the button down and she'll run), meaning that you sometimes get spotted by a guard because you clicked one pixel too far around an object so you end up on the wrong side of it.\n\nAnd that gets to the meat of why I couldn't get on with this game. It's a problem not unique to this game, but to many stealth-based games. Random patrol patterns - the guards move at random, giving you no means to plan your approach or escape. What this means is that one of two things happens - you wait around forever for the guards to move in such a way that opens up an opportunity for you to sneak through, or, you get caught becuase all of the guards randomly converge on the exact place you are.\n\nIf you're a fan of retrying the same mission over and over again until you luck out into a run where the guards don't randomly screw up your plans, then this is the game for you.","October 22, 2015","false","3.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Miss Sophia Take needs to get back her rightfully owned art pieces from various levels. Might not look it, but the game is quite experimental and challenging underneath the top-notch poppy cartoonish presentation. The art design and jazzy soundtrack are sublime. It's a game designed around non-violence and ghosting, which is even lacking among the greatest stealth games that still allow you to knock out every guard but this game is all about getting in and out of a level sight unseen.\n\nThe control method is more like an RTS where it's mouse-only (although you can use WASD) but with one unit set against guards, cameras, dogs, and lasers. You move with the LMB and you can hold down for whistling to distract an enemy. with RMB, you can throw a gadget like a noisemaker or teleporter. My one gripe about the gadgets is they're not used in enough levels, and the glue gadget is almost entirely useless but is only required for just a couple of levels.\n\nIt's very arcade-y where you have par times to beat and short multi-tier levels to traverse, but the random enemy placements will make you act on your toes. Sometimes that randomness can lead to being boxed in by large vision cones but realise there are only 4 types of placements, so respawning multiple times after failures is not so bad. It's hard to get angry when Miss Take, the good version of Carmen Sandiago, is spotted and throws her hat and hands in the air as she flees from being captured. Dogs are usually the most annoying enemy in stealth games, but here not only do they look cute but their small vision cones allows you to literally make them trail around in circles which is useful in later levels when they can be an obstacle to your goal. The other playable characters make for different stategies and goals in their more ghosting-frinedly versions of the same levels, and even after 10 hours of completing 25 levels, I still found their epilogues left to unlock.\n\nI found the civilians really annoying when you're trying to round a corner and get a painting at the same time while they're gawking at it, slowing down your movement and possibly getting you spotted.\n\nThe story itself is quite light-hearted, with a good sense of humour ("You're Batman, I get it"). The characters are likeable, especially Daisy where there's a whole motherly thing going on between Miss Take and her. There aren't many surprises in the plot, but the character banter between levels in your house are appreciated that gives a more family atmosphere as you three try to help each other out along the way.\n\nIf you're up for a cute and challenging game, this is a steal.","December 3, 2014","true","16.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

After all, the main character wears a hat so cool that you literally can't complete levels without it. But what kept me playing it, all the way to the point of 100% achievements, was the gameplay. For the most part, the levels are designed really well, and the game's use of shadows to display when you are and aren't in an enemy's line of sight is both cool and instantly-understandable. The three playable characters each have their own unique feel to them, and the fact that each one steals a different set of loot really makes you feel like you've cleaned a level out completely once you've beaten it with all three.\n\nOverall I really liked this game! It had a good amount of content, and the story is a great example of something that's kid-friendly without feeling childish (which matters a lot to some people and can be very hard to do).

They'll go wherever they want with no pre-set path, but there are ways you can distract them to certain areas (whistling, walking into their line of sight for a second, etc).\n\nThe core gameplay is you are a thief who wants to steal things, and so you do.

This is initially a very good game with great stealth mechanics that, after its first half, actually feels too long and becomes a chore if you want to complete it. The global achievement stats are a testament to that, only 2.6% have completed it (normal "story mode" completion, not with all the extra stuff you can do in the game). That compares to 42.7% who have gotten the first achievement, which is not a trivial one. All this is almost one year after its release. Many people seem to like the game (for good reasons) and play it to a considerable extent, but only very few finish it. (The phenomenon is ofcourse natural and can be seen with other games, too, but much weaker. This game makes most people give up on it, much more than other games.)\nIf you are a normal gamer who doesn't mind abandoning a game at the point where it gets tedious, this is fun for a while.\nIf you are a gamer who likes to at least play to the end, this game drags on and the difficulty is far beyond the nice and friendly game that it seems to be in the beginning. Restarting and hoping for better random conditions will happen alot. The game is good enough to have kept me playing to the end, though.\nIf you like to complete the game with all achievements and extra stuff like beating par times on each level, then be prepared for some frustration over the imprecise controls when things become hectic, the randomness and the lots and lots and lots of restarting a level. I persevered and did even that, but was it fun? Some moments yes, alot of the times no. I feel a little sorry about the amount of time I poured into this, but I didn't want to stop at a 85% finished game. Now I'm glad to uninstall it even though there are some "pro" and "dev" time limits left to beat.Also I don't like how the game never stays at a smooth frame rate (probably for everyone, check the forums), even though I'm far above the system requirements. I'll have to assume this is due to bad programming and misuse of middleware. When you're running on too many layers of software, performance and timing problems are likely to happen. The slight stuttering doesn't ruin the game though.\n\nFinishing with the positive things, this game has nice stylish graphics, and great music that fits the style. And the gameplay is really nice, the stealth mechanics are well done and you are never unclear about what's going on and why a guard has "caught your scent". The difficulty ramps up smoothly, so the point where it starts to become tedious will depend on your tolerance and skill. But that point will come for most people, so know what you're getting into.","October 3, 2015","true","22.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game creates a vast sense of tension during your heist- with a game like this it really depends on your style of gameplay, as it is a stealth game- you have a few types of dealing with the guards; you can either lure the guards to investigate your current location as you swiftly move in the other direction, or you can simply wait for the guards to start to patrol- a very stealthy way to make yourself across the map.\n\nSadly, you cannot get the feel of this game by watching the trailer or gameplay videos on youtube; it is better to simply get hands on. If you have played other games like this then there is no doubt you 'll like it.\nThere are only two bad thing I have noticed with this game so far is that the tutorial lulls you into a false sense of security before you start the proper game- where it begins to make the maps more complicated and the guards' actions more unpredictable. Secondly, the avatar moves at a very slow pace, but it is not too much of an issue as so do the other characters- guards. As of yet I have noticed no bugs and there is no issues with the gameplay\n\nThe artwork is superb, it may not have the brilliant graphics of Crysis 3 at maximum, but it is very artistic and brightly coloured and has an almost cartoony look to it.  Full controller support is very appealing to a game like this as it allows people to easily work through the game if they tend to consoles more themselves.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who enjoys stealth games and likes thinking on their feet. If you have a slow mind and cannot cope with fast paced situations I do not recommend this game to you as it requires you to move if the guards see you, not just hide. If you have never played a stealth game before I reccomend this game as a starter for you amateurs.\n\n","March 15, 2015","true","0.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

There are also multiple characters that have different abilities/stages, adding to the replay-ability. The Marvellous Miss Take is a great little game.","September 8, 2015","true","1.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You then find out that Ralph Blackstock forges a new will and takes Sophia's Aunts entire art collection and your job is to get it back and prove he stole it from you.\n\nNow the game is split into five chapters and each chapter is composed of five stages, to start with the stages are very basic. There are some cameras and a few guards patrolling the art gallery but as you continue they start using dogs and motion detecting lasers to try and stop you. You'll notice right away that Sophia is just your average thief, nothing too fancy; she can nimbly get away with nothing but her wits and whatever gadget the stage gave to you. As the stages get more complex you'll meet two new characters, Harry the Thief and Daisy the Pickpocket. Eventually these two characters join your party and help Sophia try and get her art collection back. Both of these characters play completely different and also have to complete seperate goals than the other two. Harry the Thief walks with a cane so he's slower than Sophia and Daisy but he can throw his trusty bouncy ball to distract guards and his missions are literal stealth missions; don't get caught at all because he can't escape easily. Daisy the Pickpocket is the fastest of the three and can walk around guards without alerting them, her missions are also drastically different; you have to steal keys from guards to open safes for cash rather than just stealing art and leaving.\n\nThis game definitely builds itself on basic but rock solid stealth mechanics - hiding, running (or walking) and stealing anything that isn't outright nailed down and then applies all of that to its extraordinary level design. On top of that the game has extremely simplistic controls, you can play it with just the mouse if you wanted to; or keyboard for movement and mouse for actions; or even just your controller. One downside is that there are no remapping controls, so if you don't have a controller and the default controls for keyboard & mouse bother you than you are out of luck.\n\nGraphically there isn't anything to complain about, some might like the cartoony feel while others might hate it. I personally feel that it helps the game stand out amongst other games in the genre usually being dark rather than having that happy yet serious feel. Don't let the bright nature of this game fool you, it will take no mercy on you in the later stages.\n\nNow the soundtrack for this game was phenomenal, it has that jazzy down to earth feel while you're slyly prowling around an art gallery trying your best not to get caught while you pilfer paintings or other priceless treasures.\n\nHonestly The Marvelous Miss Take is a perfect example of how a stealth game doesn't need to be slow or tedious; how they can also be fast and lively, in a world of bright colours and memorable characters that don't need to have fifteen times the dialogue introducing them to be remembered. This game is as great as it's very own name states, it's just depressing no one really gives it the chance it deserves.\n\nIf you're into stealth games and have wondered "is this the game for me?" I can probably say without a doubt, yes it is. Highly recommend a purchase at any price; it has enough content to keep you entertained for hours and then some.","April 18","true","5.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is basically Volume - with a few changes. It noteably came before Volume.\n\nMiss Take is a stealth game whereby you play one of 3 characters attempting to complete one of the 25 missions.  You play from an isometric-ish standpoint and must sneak around the levels and steal stuff. While each character share the same levels as the others, the levels for each character have different layouts and challanges and merit playing as each characters.\n\nPROS:\n- Amazing art style. Really, really great.\n- Great sense of difficulty. It is never too easy or throw-your-controller difficult.\n- All 3 characters have their own play styles.\n------Take is the "normal" character and must steal around 12 paintings/objects per floor.\n------Hector cant run and has a ball used to bounce off walls to distract guards and dogs, but he must get it back.\n------The third charcter must pickpocket guards to get keys to open safes (which WILL cause an alarm).\n- Each mission has multiple floors per building.\n- A good amount of missions.\n\nCons\n- It is minor, but the menus are confusing as to what option you are actually choosing if using a controller.\n- Unlike Volume's 100+ levels along with an editor, this only has 25 missions x 3 charcters. Not really complaining though.\n\nAll in all a fantastic stealth game.

Really, it was just a delight to play not only due to the feast of visual communication (okay, disclaimer, I'm a graphic designer) but it was also fun and engaging. Plus it has a very fun and silly title.\n\nThe Marvellous Miss Take is a stealth game with no violence whatsoever. You fail if you are spotted and caught. There is no blackjack to hurt people with, no blood, no weapons. It's a breath of fresh air.\n\nMy time of 16 hours of play represents a game which I've finished all the achievements on. There is still more playtime on offer if one wanted to beat all of the Pro times and then all of the Dev times on two of the characters (which I will probably do over time because I love this game).\n\nGameplayThere are three characters which you play each level with, but each character requires you to play in a slightly different manner. You will find yourself trying different strategies and doing some gentle thinking. The objective is to pinch all of the loot without being caught!\n\nYou hide behind objects and walls from the guards (who have an area of vision cone). There are some little gadgets you will have on some levels that make life a little easier. Then there are also masterpieces to steal, dogs to avoid, laser beams, noise, safes, and miles and miles of red rugs.\n\nSome of the levels are really very tricky if you're trying to complete them within the par time. However, I should note that it is not a requirement to complete them within a set time if you want to be a really casual player. The times do count toward an achievement, but that's all.\n\nFinally, I really like the way that the levels work. Whenever you go onto a new floor (usually 2 floors, sometimes 3) and then you fail, or do something silly, or get really unlucky, when you hit restart you restart the floor and not the entire level. I've appreciated that an awful lot over the course of 16 hours.\n\nControlsAll done with the mouse. It can be a little tricky getting your character around tight corners at a run. Takes a bit of practice. Left click makes you move to that point, and holding the left mouse button makes you run towards the cursor.\n\nStorylineThere is a minimal storyline. It's not a deep story, but it does successfully set up a reason as to why you're going around pinching all this stuff.\n\nSoundFantastic. The music is very good, to the point where I know I'm ready to play another session when I start humming the music to myself. I played the entire game with the music on.\n\nGraphicsExceptional to my mind. Okay, so there could possibly be a few more little details and variety. For example, in the level selection house each level could have a unique painting instead of recycling graphics. However, the design is very good and everything fits together seamlessly to create a styalized world of house layouts to pilfer.\n\nPros+ no violence\n+ exceptional design\n+ engaging and enjoyable music\n+ simple controls\n+ play as casual as you want to, or challenge yourself with times\nCons- no obvious way to exit on the menu screen (press esc)\n- not as easy as I'd like to control a running character\n\nHelp Me Help YouIf you did not find this review helpful, I would really appreciate your constructive criticism - tell me why it wasn’t helpful for you.

They are in the posession of a villain who has several art galleries which you have to break in to retrieve them. In your journey you will meet two other friendly characters to help you out.\nThe controls are very simple and if you own a gamepad it will be even more enjoyable;\nThe audio are fabulous and entertaining;\nThe graphics are magnificent: colourful, cartoon-style with a lot of details, making the characters (from the protagonists to the dog that chases you) truly beautiful art-pieces (no pun intended);\nThe game starts easy but it is surprising how hard it gets and if you are an obsessive towards fulfilling achievements as I am, you for sure will be restarting the levels more than one time.

It has some political overtones and a bit of that pandering feminist flavor BUT the game at its core is pretty fun, and the story is what it is. There are 25 galleries with two floors each ( the final mission actually has three floors), and the 3 playable characters have a different objective to perform in each mission so there is plenty to do.\n\nStory\nThe characters are ok, likeable but underdeveloped.\n\nThe game is charming but lacks variety.\n\nThere is no way to go back and review the story if you accidentally skip over something. "Cutscenes" are one and done.\n\nProgression is fairly balanced, you have to do everything as the main character and a smaller number of levels as the two other playable characters.\n\nTechnical aspects\nThe controls are a bit sloppy which can make a good run turn disasterous in a frustrating instant. You will probably find the use of a gamepad to be to your benefit.\n\nThe game is locked at 60fps which is ok but not great if you have a higher refresh monitor.\n\nThere are not a huge number of graphics options, but the game is simplistic enough visually to not need a ton.\n\nGameplay\nLevels are well laid out and fun to walk around in.\n\nThere is very little motivation for getting all the side-acheivements unless you are trying to get every single one for the achievement in Steam. The DRM-free players will gain nothing from accomplishing the side missions which is disappointing. Unlockable costumes would have been a PERFECT reward for collecting these\n\nYou can learn the levels and improve based on skill for the most part, occasionally a random walking pattern from a guard will throw things off, but such is life.\n\nLevels are easy to fail, but they are short enough that you can attempt them in quick succession.\n\nThere are only four types of enemies (guards, guard dogs, cameras, and lasers), but the level design makes sure that these are all you need for enough variety. Some gamers WILL find it repetitive, while others will not.\n\nThe game is probably about 4-6 hours in length and probably 10 or so if you are trying to get all the acheivements. It may be much shorter if you are really great or decently longer if you are kind of bad.\n\nConclusion\nTMMT is a fun and lighthearted stealth game with simple mechanics that are easy to learn but difficult to master. If that sounds like what you are interested in, and the little bit of political griping isn't going to bother you (it's not as bad as I am making it sound) then this may be a game for you. I'd probably recommend the multiplayer Monoco over this, but Miss Take has a nice game on her own. At $20 the game is probably a little overpriced. I picked my copy up in a Humble Bundle, but in a Steam sale for around $5-7 I would say Miss Take is worth the price of admission.","October 27, 2015","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's like a cartoon version of a 60s British heist caper. I've unlocked Harry and Daisy so far, and it's a lot of fun revisiting the levels I've beaten with Sophia Take to use these alternative characters' abilities. [At the time of writing, while there is now controller support, the controller can be a bit tricky to use through the menus. It's easy enough to navigate menus with a mouse instead, but hopefully they'll fix that soon.]\n\nThe game is very easy at first as it teaches you how to play, and then ramps up the difficulty level and the enemy types to add to the challenge. I'm really pleased that the enemies aren't stuck on fixed routes, which means you have to constantly react and judge when to allow yourself to be seen and how to lure the guards. It's tough, but it always feels fair.\n\nI'm very glad I took a chance on this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/daeranilen/recommended/327310/","daeranilen","Daeranilen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/daeranilen/","62 products in account","Simple, slick, and stylish, The Marvellous Miss Take is the stealth-action-puzzle game I never knew I wanted.\n\nIn most stealth games, you have to sit around waiting while guards walk by, slowly memorizing their scripted paths. Being seen often results in either instant failure or a firefight, rendering the stealth gameplay frustrating or pointless. But in Miss Take, guard movement is randomized, so you're encouraged to think on your feet rather than watch and wait. Distract guards by whistling or throwing a noisemaker, toss a teleporter or a smoke bomb to dart past undetected, and even allow yourself to be seen to lure guards from their posts (then silently sneak over to steal that painting they were standing in front of). The cone-of-vision system and the "ripples" representing sound remove any questions about whether you could REALLY be seen or not, so getting spotted never feels unfair - heck, usually you're letting yourself get spotted on purpose! And even once you've been spotted too long and alarmed the guards, you still have a chance to hide or get away before being caught, so even failing a level feels completely fair and skill-dependent.\n\nThe game is comparatively short, but with the randomization, three different styles of stealth play, and the addition of challenges and par times, replay value is pretty high - not to mention its visual style and sound design are an absolute joy. If you love the Sly Cooper series, Monaco: What's Yours is Mine, or characters like Carmen Sandiego and Cate Archer from No One Lives Forever 2, give The Marvellous Miss Take a try!\n\nFinal Note: I found the mouse controls very intuitive once learned and great for my setup (I have a Microsoft Surface and the attachable keyboard can be finicky, so a game that doesn't rely on it is fantastic), but the game also supports WASD and controllers. So banish all worries about awkward controls - there's something that will suit you here!","January 2, 2015","true","9.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The controls are simple, and all the information you need is presented very clearly. You always know exactly what the field of view for all the guards, cameras and (eventually) dogs are. The levels are pretty different, causing you to really examine the best way to approach each challenge, and the three characters all play very differently, with different goals and methods to achieve them.\n\nThe art is great. Attractive, bright, colorful, fun. The only complaint I'd make is that the levels look pretty samey after a while, but that's a minor complaint, and perhaps keeping the same art style is good since it lets you focus on the elements you need to be focusing on in order to complete each level, as opposed to admiring the art.\n\nIt's a surprisingly hard game. Reviews I've seen make a big deal out of the unpredictability of the guards and that is one element of the difficulty, but it's all of the elements combined. Navigating around everything quickly and quietly to achieve your goal is difficult and the game forces you to take calculated risks at times.\n\nAnyway, this is very good and fun. Plus it stars a woman, a disabled person of color, and a young girl. Thumbs up all the way.","January 6, 2015","true","5.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The soundtrack consists of very jazzy heist-type music that gives it a fun but tense sort of feeling\n\n-The AI is great for the most part, they are for the most part predictable but every once in a while will do something totally random but still believable. For instance, if you distract a guard with a whistle or by walking into his line of sight for a brief moment he will check out the noise in the area it came from and then go back to his area. However, if you are in his line of sight for too long or make too many noises in a short period of time, he will then patrol that area, which isn't always good.\n\n-I love that the main protagonist is female, and it seems like we are getting more and more female protagonists which is awesome.\n\n-I bought this game during the humble bundle, and when I didn't expect much, I usually only do the humble bundle for charity, but this is a great hidden gem that more people should know about.\n\n-Buy this game, especially if you have a kid, they will love it.","August 7, 2015","true","0.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I've spent about an hour with it, and it was very enjoyable.\n\nI first became aware of the game from a screenshot, which showcased the cute, colorful, and stylized graphics. I think they work well with the game and they look great. I'm playing on a 280x, so I can't comment on how well it runs on lower cards, but there are options to turn off shadows, reflections, antialiasing, etc, so it should probably run fine on just about anything.\n\nCranked up to the max, the game looks beautiful. The style complements the game well. It even offers 1.5x-2x SSAA (Supersampled Antialiasing). I opted to just leave it at 1920x1200, but I found it interesting that they had such advanced features, especially since the game looks just fine with the standard AA settings.\n\nAs for gameplay, it's pretty much what you would expect. I've only experienced the first two characters, but their playstyles are different enough to make running through the same levels entertaining. The most surprising part for me was the speed factor. Particularly with Sophia/Miss Take, not only is there a par time you can try to beat, but the randomized guards and powerups really emphasize a quickness. This is definitely not a slow burn stealth experience.\n\nEverything is controlled with mouse. Click to move, hold left click on the character to whistle, right click to throw items, and hold left click to run (if the character is able). I picked up the controls quickly and started to have lots of fun doing speedruns on some of the levels. Restarting is quick and painless, and the controls combined with the play make for a very arcadey type of fun. I could see this being a blast played with a friend, passing the controller on death or seeing who can get the fastest time.\n\nThe pathfinding, as I've heard mentioned before, does leave a bit to be desired sometimes (Sophia got stuck on a few edges), but to me it wasn't an issue. With either character, I quickly got used to "setting waypoints," basically, guiding them exactly where I wanted to go. This isn't the kind of game where you click halfway across the level and expect them to make it there unhindered. There are guards to avoid and paintings to collect.\n\nOverall, I'm very happy I picked this up, and I recommend you do it too.\n\nMy only concern at this point is the difficulty (will it be too easy?) and the length.

In the game, you have to select a rival art gallery and raid it to steal everything inside it, in freaking full day, during opening hours. Every single gallery has two floors, you enter the first floor, empty it, take the elevetor to the second floor, empty it, and take the exit door on the back of the second floor: the most unrealistic art gallery architecture I can imagine, even I could think of one better. They decided for this silly one and used it for every single level of the game.\nYou steal things while visitors are loking at them, they are ok with it, but don't you dare to steal the masterpiece of the floor or they'll call the guards! All the rest isn't important, just take it, they don't care!\nSo, immagine this woman getting in an art gallery, buying a ticket, putthing on a mask, and start stealing things inside the place while people are looking at them, then take the exit with a cargo of stolen works of art in her arms. I mean, how immersive can this be?\n\nFeminists seem to like this game because, you know, strong female protagonist! Yay! What I want to ask is: if everything this thief woman does in the game is silly and unrealistic, maybe this is how the developers see a female thief, silly and unrealistic. I don't know how much feminist this can be.\n\nBy the way, I think something about the gameplay has to be said: it's insanely boring.\nFor starters, it's a gameplay suited for a touchscreen device, and, I mean, this is not a plus. Everything is repetitive, you do the same two things over and over in the same environments, the only thing which spice it up is the guards placement. I really don't believe that a difficulty only created by a different placement of enemies can make a game fun.\n\nConclusions:Do you ever dream about going in an Art Gallery during opening hours stealing everything that's inside it? Too silly? Well you can do it in this game! Yay!\nYou could even have fun if you like semplicistic, repetitive gameplay!\nSo come and fight for women proud dressing the part of a silly, unrealistic female thief!","October 16, 2015","false","1.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","6","11","3","0"

There are a few items and new gameplay elements (dogs, lasers) to keep things fresh, but the game does not have a big sense of progression/"levelling up" that many stealth games do. I think this is fine, but it does mean that it feels like a reasonably slight package for the $20 (Australian Dollars) asking price.

I wasn't overly surprised, but I can't say I was disappointed either. Clocking in at 8 hours for 100% Completion, it was a pleasant enough distraction, but little more.\n\nGameplay is strewn across three different art thieves (Sophia, Harry, and Daisy), across 25 different 2-level stages, which are ultimately different layouts of the same building.\nSophia is occasionally given a gadget at the start of some stages, such as a teleporter, smoke bomb, or glue bomb, which are even less occasionally of any use. Harry is unable to run, and has one thrown noisemaker gadget. He can't leave the stage without recollecting it if thrown, so it's usually easier to ignore it, as his stages are pretty easy anyway. Daisy is a pickpocket, able to run much closer to guards, cracking into safes, a distinct difference from the other two characters, who merely steal things off the wall or display stands.\n\nRandom guard behavior, while assuring that a stage never plays the same twice, has the likely unintended effect of making any strategy moot. For most of the stages, I personally found the greatest success just mad dashing as fast as I was able, with the occasional distraction.\n\nThe art direction is indeed appealing, if simple. I'd have enjoyed more variety in the stages, however. Aside from some day/night stages, they're all the exact same. The characters are all voiceless, and the music is essentially elevator music. While tolerable, there's very little of it and gets old quickly.\n-------------------------------------------------------\nWhile not a smash hit or a particularly deep game, The Marvellous Miss Take is a pleasant enough distraction for the 8-10 hours it's likely to last you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/recommended/327310/","thetitaniumdragon","TheTitaniumDragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/","776 products in account","The Marvelous Miss Take is a stylish stealth game which focuses on distraction and dealing with randomly wandering guards as its primary mechanics.\n\nThe game stars the Sophia Take, an heiress whose aunt’s fortune (and more importantly, her art) is all stolen (via a forged will) by Ralph, an evil megalomaniac whose focus seems to be hoarding the art for himself rather than sharing it with THE PEOPLE. Sophia’s goal is to steal all the art back and expose Ralph for what he is.\n\nJoining her on her quest are Harry, an older thief with a bum leg, and Daisy, a young, seemingly orphaned pickpocket who joins the team.\n\nThe game’s stealth gameplay is very simple – click to walk to a location, hold down the mouse button to run there, and use the right mouse button to throw a device (which varies by character and level) to distract or get around the guards. Ducking behind obstacles is automatic as long as you aren’t running, and the fields of view of all the guards are displayed via very simple and easy-to-understand visual displays.\n\nThe levels are all viewed from a top-down isometric perspective which is pretty heavily constrained around your character, meaning you’re exploring the level as you’re penetrating it. What makes this game unusual for a stealth game is that, contrary to most such games, the guards – both in the form of men and dogs – wander randomly through the level, meaning that you cannot rely on them to turn just the right direction or walk just the right way. This also means that waiting around can get you trapped between randomly wandering guards, so it pays to move quickly and to distract the guards to get them to go where you want them to go, either by showing yourself to them, making some noise, or by throwing a noise-making gadget.\n\nSophia’s goal in each level is to collect all the golden art pieces, set up on walls and pedestals, and then make it to the elevator or exit. Every level has two independent floors to it, and if you fail on the second floor, you start over at the start of that floor, not at the start of the level. On top of that primary goal, she has two secondary goals – she can break the glass around a special statue which appears once per floor, which attracts the attention of the nearest guard, or she can try and do a speed run through the level, completing it within a certain amount of time. In most of the levels, Sophia finds an item lying on a pedestal near the entrance that helps her clear the level – a noise-maker that can be thrown to distract guards, glue to stick them in place, a smoke bomb to obstruct their view, or a teleporter to skip past them.\n\nIf Sophia is spotted by the guards, she has to go hide before they catch her; if they catch her, you must start the floor over. Unfortunately, even if you are not captured, Sophia will drop her (very stylish) hat, which must be retrieved before she can complete the level.\n\nHer two allies have slightly different gameplay. Harry always has the same item – a noise-making ball which bounces off the walls – wherever he goes, but as it is his lucky charm, he must collect it back up before completing a level. His missions take place at night in the same rooms that Miss Take’s missions take place in, but with a different setup of guards, and various barriers put in place to obstruct his route through the level. Unlike Sophia, he can’t run, but on the upside, he only has to collect three paintings per floor. His alternate goal is to make it through levels without being spotted by any guards or cameras.\n\nDaisy has no special items at all to help her, but on the upside, she can walk right up behind guards without alerting them, and is the fastest character in the game. Like Harry, she plays in the same stages Sophia does, but with barriers up (though different ones than Harry, oftentimes), and with different guard setups. Daisy must pickpocket keys off the guards to unlock safes and retrieve deeds. The safes are alarmed, so Daisy must run away quickly after avoiding a safe to avoid getting caught. Her levels tend to be the most frustrating simply because the guards must be approached up close, and the safes always create intense situations. Like Sophia, her goal is to speed-run through every level, which is the hardest goal in the game due to the random movements of the guards, and can sometimes lead to extreme frustration.\n\nIndeed, the game’s greatest flaw is its randomized nature. At times, the enemies will turn around and completely screw up your quickly thrown-together plan, and there are occaisions where you will simply be forced to reset a stage because guards randomly wander in through both ends of a hallway. Such events are sometimes your fault, but at other times, the random nature of the game can be quite annoying – especially when doing speed-runs as Daisy, who is pretty dependent on a good guard setup at times to complete her run in time.\n\nThe game’s other flaw is its repetitive nature. There are 25 stages, and all but one of them is played through by all three characters, leaving a total of 73 stages in all. However, there are very few mechanics in the game. There are the basic guards who wander around and are the only thing which can actually catch your character. There are security cameras which move automatically back and forth over a field of space, but which have blind spots which can be taken advantage of to sneak around; if you move into their field of view, they will alert the guards to your presence. There are dogs, who will sniff out your character if you are close to them, but which have a very restricted field of view; these canines will at time track you throughout the level if you don’t throw out something to distract them, and can at times feel very frustrating as they home in on you. If the dog catches you, it will bark at you, alerting the guards. Finally, there are lasers which periodically turn off and on, which set off an alarm alerting the guards if you stand on them.\n\nThat’s all there is, and it really shows, as the games’ levels don’t really exhibit much variety. Once the mechanics have all been introduced, you’ve seen all the game really has to offer, and the final levels are hard simply because they throw a large number of things at you all at once. While they’re interesting enough, they’re also the place where the random movements of the enemies are the most frustrating, as the large numbers of enemies populating many of those levels means there is more opportunity for you to get cornered. Thus, the game varies from kind of samey to kind of frustrating, and Sophia’s levels are by far the most enjoyable, as it is the first time through a set-up and her broader skill-set and larger number of objectives just feel like they flow better.\n\nOverall, the game is pretty mediocre. The story is flimsy and not particularly interesting. The art style is quite nice – very deco – but isn’t enough to carry the game on its own, and while the core stealth gameplay is alright, it also starts to feel the same after a while.\n\nUltimately, this is a game best eaten in small bites – none of the levels are very long, with speed run times of four minutes or less which are readily achievable, and completing everything the game has to offer is likely to take only 12 hours or so. When the odd level is played here and there, it doesn’t wear on you so much, but when a lot are played consecutively, it tends to get kind of boring (or frustrating).\n\nReally, though, I wouldn’t recommend it - it isn't a very substantive experience. While the game encouraging you to move quickly and distract foes actually gets rid of one of the worst parts about stealth games – boringly waiting around for a guard to walk by on the right portion of its pattern – it replaces it with the frustration of the RNG occasionally spoiling your run.","January 13","false","12.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/solarflare/recommended/327310/","solarflare","squiddingme","http://steamcommunity.com/id/solarflare/","169 products in account","The Marvelous Miss Take is essentially a stealth game stripped down to its core elements, with a top down camera, vision cones reminiscent of early Metal Gear Solid games, and the slight flavouring of a puzzle game on top. This is wrapped up in a slick presentation, which is sadly the game's greatest strength.\n\nSophia moves at a fairly slow pace and will automatically crouch behind waist-high objects--it's better to think of any waist-high objects as walls, since they effectively block vision cones in a similar way, though also preventing Sophia from running. Running produces a noise radius that alerts guards to your location, so it must be done outside of a certain distance from a guard. Additionally, Sophia occasionally collects gadgets, and can earn additional uses for these gadgets by looting art. This is a fairly smart system that rewards skilful play.\n\nThe problem, then, is the game's randomized AI. Randomized AI does not work very well for a game with light puzzle elements and time trials. Guards move in random directions, sometimes leaving the rooms they are stationed in. This randomized AI can put you in very unfavourable situations, sometimes (if you are extremely unlucky) as soon as the level starts. Often, they can put you in unwinnable positions even after collecting all the trophies, or waste a lot of your time. Completing heists can require several attempts to get lucky. Getting under par time also happens because you were lucky; the AI didn't put you in any strange situations, or you restarted each floor until you beat it with time to spare.\n\nDogs suck up all the fun with their presence. Their scent radius is huge and they will follow your trail around the entire map if you let them, putting you in unwinnable situations that force a restart. Dogs are very often placed in rooms with security cameras, which further reduces your mobility options and makes dogs a nightmare to deal with.\n\nMiss Take isn't a very good stealth game. There are much better stealth games out there. Miss Take doesn't innovate, and it doesn't even iterate, either. It doesn't really have anything new to offer to the genre. Its presentation is its only redeeming quality. Get it on sale, if you're curious.","December 30, 2015","false","2.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The first is the patient methodical observing and memorizing of guard movements and behaviors, exploring and finding the best paths to the goal, the trial and error of taking a risk, getting caught, revising strategies, and trying again until I get it right. I love the feeling of having finally outwitted, out snuck, outrun every guard by the end of the level, the feeling of having conquered using wits instead of brawn. The second is gadgets. The stealth genre is great at giving players all sorts of toys to play around with--noisemakers, sleep gas, night vision, zip lines, disguises, hacking systems, teleportation, invisibility.\n\nMarvelous Miss Take is a stealth game. The goal of each ‘heist’ is to sneak through an art gallery, avoiding guards, cameras, and trip wires in order to steal and escape with various pieces of artwork. Levels are very small, consisting of only a few rooms, two floors, and a handful of guards. Most can be beaten in just a couple of minutes.\n\nThe thing is, the guards don’t follow any set paths, more or less randomly wandering about the level. On the one hand, this is cool, because it leads to every playthrough of a level going a bit differently. There is an unpredictability to guard movements that’ll keep you on edge the whole time, as no area is safe. They can find you anywhere. Unfortunately, this also leads to frustration. Finishing a level is almost always dependent on luck. At the end of a heist, I almost never felt like I’d expertly outwitted a group of guards, because beating levels depends on things as trite as Guard 2 just happening to not patrol the room full of trip wires this go around, or maybe because one of the guard dogs happened to get stuck in a corner.\n\nAll the other times you fail often have less to do with mistakes you make and more to do with getting unlucky with where the guards decided to wander. The player doesn’t have many options for escaping when cornered. Besides a few limited use noise makers and smoke bombs, Sophia, the main character, has nothing in the way of cool gadgets for players to play with (with the exception of a teleporter that unfortunately only appears in a couple levels), and most levels don’t even have those. Difficulty ramps up pretty quick, and you’re going to fail heists, and you’re going to fail them over and over. Levels are very short, so you won’t end up replaying much. But when every level has the exact same visuals, guards, dogs, cameras, and goals, the game is repetitive enough already. Everything is very expected, all as per genre. You won’t find anything new here.\n\nThe developers do try to inject some variety into the gameplay with two other playable characters. Both are able to replay heists already completed with Sophia, but with some added challenges and abilities. The first is Harry, who is much slower than Sophia and has nothing to show for it except a noisemaker that is made useless because it has to be picked up after thrown. With Harry, you’ll be playing through the exact same level as with Sophia, stealing the same sort of artwork, except more slowly. It’s beyond tedious.\n\nThe third playable character is Daisy, whose heists are easily the highlight of the game. Daisy is both faster and quieter than Sophia. Her heists strip down most of the extra fat in randomly wandering guards and dogs from Sophia’s missions, and instead involve her pickpocketing just two or three guards, and then using the keys to open alarm-rigged safes. I had a great time sneaking directly behind and beside guards to get their keys, and using strategy to draw them away from safes long enough to get in and out before the safe alarm sent the guards charging back to my position. It’s a shame her missions are so much shorter than Harry or Sophia’s. It’s the only time I felt like a professional cat burglar while playing.\n\nAt the end of the day, I’m not sure who this game is for. It has a cool style and soundtrack, the minimalism and bite-sized levels makes it easy to jump in and out of. But it has none of the things I usually look for in a stealth game. I expect casual players will be put off by the frustrating chance-laden levels, but I also expect fans of the genre will be disappointed by how limited the stealth gameplay is. And twenty dollars is an awfully steep asking price for the amount of content you’re getting.","November 27, 2015","false","2.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

They are casual and should be fun, not to easy but on a decent level of difficulty.  I'm a trophy hunter too, so I love to reach all kind of goals in a game but I respect games with achievements I can't get, which means I do not start a whine-thread on each unrivaled achievement.\n\nGameBack to that game... the storyline is a bit... meh, but would not disqualify that game at all.  In general it would perfectly fit in the role of being a casual fun game with some tricky try and fail situations, if there weren't such a bad controls. They s*u*c*k like there is no tomorrow and there are no settings... the only choice you get is playing by mouse entirely or keyboard. Guess what, I didn't figured out how to throw a bomb by keyboard, because there is no manual. You have to try it on your own (if it's possible).. AND there is also not possible to play with mouse and keyboard together.\n\nExampleI give you an ingame expamle. One of the main abilities, of all characters, is to make a noise, which attracts a guards attention. If you play by mouse you have to click and hold on your character and this becomes worse when you try to rush through a level just to be in time (with the char Miss Take) AND that causes frustration which is unnecessary.\n\nMaking a noise by keyboard would be much more comfortable, while navigating with the mouse. Yet I haven't tested the game with my x360 controller, so I can't give a feedback about that.\n\nIf my review wasn't helpful, just let me know why, in the comments. ;-)","July 8, 2015","false","13.1"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","3"

The difficulty curve isn't THAT bad, but it's just... unfun in the later stages. Depends way too much on luck; on one of the later stages, if a dog in the starting area went right instead of left, you'd lose a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minute waiting for it to clear the coast, which simply isn't ok considering there are collectibles based on time limits. The pickpocket's levels pretty much force you to cause alerts over and over again, defeating the whole purpose of going stealthy.\n\nFrankly, it all kinda sounds like nitpicking, but I simply didn't have fun with this and can't recommend it.","March 15","false","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The levels are all quite similar, a new element is just added every once in a while.\n\nAside from the repetitiveness, there are two main issues. The first is the controls - they use click to move and sometimes, if you don't cick the exact right spot, the pathing gets all wonky and Miss Take will run somewhere  you don't want her to go, like right into a guard. Second, the guards do not have set paths, so there's really no learning that takes place, it's just a matter of waiting them out and hoping they go in a direction that doesn't screw you over. There are abilities and items that can help you with the guards, but most have a long cooldown.

The top down stealth style works quite well as you can get a nice look at the layout of each level and the randomized movements of the guards make you react on the fly instead of just memorizing their movement patterns and exploiting those. This leads to some moments where you will lead to some moments where you get completely screwed over but adds more tense moments to the game as you pray that guard doesn't turn around and see you. With most levels having a "par time" to beat, this makes some of your encounters intense as you need to race around and avoid detection instead of just sitting around too much.\n\nThe level variety is good and having 3 different characters to choose from with different talents keeps the game from getting too stale. I was not overly thrilled with the enemy/obstacle variety (there are really only 4 kinds all game: guards, dogs, lasers, and security cameras) but the devs do a good job of mixing and matching those combinations in levels to keep you guessing.\n\nIt's the stealth game you probably missed but should definitely try.","June 4","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
