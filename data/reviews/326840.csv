Thus, as if there was already an answer to this question, I stumbled upon "Heart&Slash," a unique and dynamic mixture of action, combat, platforming and strategy.\n\nDespite being in its alpha phase (occassionally glitches will ensue), the game offers an intriguing amount of depth and variety with its simple but increasingly challenging combat and wide range of weaponry and obstacles. With up to 75 unique weapons to wield (each with its own set of attributes and upgrades), you'll find yourself pitted against a formidable variety of robotic enemies (occassionally equipped with destructible armour) in a bleak futuristic world.\n\nI've only played this game for about three hours on the alpha's release date, but I'm already enjoying it for its fast-paced action, dynamic combat and strong emphasis on variety and replayability.","October 7, 2014","true","76.9"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","21","21","0","1"

Stylish visuals, satisfying combat mechanics, a large weapon selections, and easy to access upgrades that don't feel hard to obtain.\n\nHeart&Slash is definitely a game you should buy, or consider watching at the very least. With only 2 levels, and missing aspects, it still feels very fun. While there aren't that many enemy designs currently in the game, it does have different TYPES of the same enemy that all require you to watch and figure out before going in to attack, if you slip up, you're going to die pretty quickly in a panic.\n\nThe ability to upgrade your weapons, swap them out in a fight at will using your bumpers, and trade weapons out when you find new ones in item rooms keeps the game feeling very dynamic in combat, and leaves a lot of room to design your play style.\n\nMy only problem with the game currently is that there aren't more levels, but seeing as this game is early access. I have high hopes that the game will be pretty darn big when it hits full release.\nIf you don't want to spend the money to get this game in early access, I urge you to at least watch the development of the game as it gets further, because as of now it is, at least to me, worth every penny.\n\n9/10, would, and will play for many many hours.\n","October 17, 2014","true","6.4"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jsshinoda/recommended/326840/","jsshinoda","Jsshinoda","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jsshinoda/","102 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI wanted to (early access) review this game not to just say how amazing it is, but to help support this game on showing how good, no, how ♥♥♥♥ing amazing this game is and how great it will become.\n\nFirst off, this is a big one for most people, is the amazing developers. They don't just make content, they listen to your ideas, your opinions, what you like about the game and what ideas you wish they could do. They may not be a massive team but they have so diiligent on not just working on the game but what you want as a group of people. They may not be able to update fast but they are doing what they can and besides, the content they already have is amazing.\n\nSecond, the gameplay. The gameplay is something that you would play dark souls for, it's hard, it's crazy, you'll have to learn to do split second actions and have reflexes of bruce lee (not literally), as you dodge, bob and weave, slash, hack, smash, and decimate your enemies. It's gauranteed you will die, a lot, I mean not everyone is perfect enough to go through all of this without dying. But that's what makes it fun, that's what makes it satisfactory, that's what gives you that feel good when you, the player, struggle to get through it, because this isn't one of those games where the fun is ruined when you can just save and then start over, you can do something stupid because you have a save, no, this is a game where works you hard but when you are done, you look at your work, once you finally beat that boss or clear that whole map with full health, it feels good, it feels victorious. As for the fighting, there are a variety of weapons to choose from. Some weapons are balanced, some maybe are not but they are still working on ways to improve them. You get a naga (blade on a pole stick), meat cleaver, thunder hammers, boxing gloves <3, O and S (I call them god gloves, they weild lightning and fire), and not just the weapons but the parts where you can turn invisible, launch missiles, smash people into the ground, get more exp to upgrade stuff faster. Each minion is tough in a way so you can't just consider them an easy kill (unless it's one all alone) as each one can hurt you greatly.\nAll in all, it's dark souls but actually polished, play for it's hardcore gameplay and badassery, have fun, but it's actually well made and great. (and it's still possible to beat)\n\nThird, there is a lot of stuff not there, of course it's early access, but that's where YOU, THE PLAYER, CAN HELP. Buying this game will not just help it, but will also help mold it. These developers want to hear your feedback, they want to make this game so good, it gets overwhemingly positive reviews. Maybe I'm just making up this stuff, but you can still help and they still listen and they do it.  You don't just buy it, tell them hey there's this glitch there, hey these robots are pretty powerful. Ever thought of this idea, hey maybe you might be there new Isaac Newton, make them realize something they never thought of to make this game even better than it's already amazing state.\nYes it is 25 dollars, but I can gaurantee you that this game is worth it, even when not on sales. As it does already have a good amount of content, (one to two levels has quite a lot of stuff to not just try but a lot of different robots to smash)  they still have more to add. It's like an investment you make, once you invested in it, you slowly watch it build over time. Then you come back to it if you got bored before and you think... wow. This has became so much more.\n\nFourth, just this game is amazing, buy this game if it appealed to you, if not check it out later once it has grown. It's amazing, it's kick ♥♥♥, I mean I could spout on how awesome it is. Did you know they have a chest piece where if you hold the buttons it launches a rocket (or rockets) out of your chest. Did you know that the bosses are actually going to be large and actually frightening, not the typical castlevania bosses where wailing on them is key to win, but dodging their missiles, attacking their weakspots is the way to beat them. Did you know there is actually plans, weaknesses, ways to kill most enemies. This is basically a megaman game, where the game isn't impossible and nothing is ridiculous or random, it's gauranteed you could beat the WHOLE GAME with full health. Just you aren't skilled enough to do so, because it's so much. Like you could have easily dodged the bullets in megaman. But not everyone does. That's how this game is. There's also a crap ton of weapons that just make it so much fun, the thunder hammer to crush your foes, the short gun, the boxing gloves, flaming slicers, and already wide variety of stuff. They plan on having 75 weapons in the end game (they have 25 at the moment) and already have a huge variety of enemies. Grunts, larger grunts, these super cop walker mechs with missiles, lasers, and electric explosions, mortars, worms, ninja robots, junk bots made out of trash and metal. The maps are random, they are always different but the layouts are always so interesting. Stage 2 is two different lands conjoined. So let's say you beat the first boss and go to the sewers, it's possible for you to reach the city through the sewers, so that's interesting. Just wow, this game is great, just please at least check it out and if you don't buy it check back later. There's probably so much I missed when talking about this game\n\nThank you for reading.","December 29, 2014","true","12.3"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

Each weapon and piece of equipment can be upgraded an average of three times with some being only two. Upgrades are your biggest key to survival as the Enemies from the get-go are relentless and just messing around is a sure way to chip away your already scarace life and heath is usually once per several rooms, and requires you to defeat a random enemy with a Heart over it's head.\n\nAs of later Updates the game also has boss enemies, I've only played the first area to completion so I only know of two bosses, one Is the Titular Slash and the Stage boss, B-OSS Knight. These guys hit much harder and faster so if you aren't treating them with more caution than regular enemies you're sure to get sent back to the start.\n\nAs with most Roguelikes and Roguelites, this game is built for Replayabilty as you will be seeing the game over screen quit a bit, parts that you don't end up using before you die will be transfered to your next run so don't feel pressured to use them up right away on weapons you might replace soon.\n\nIn Closing, this game is well worth the 25 bucks there currently asking for, at least for me, if Roguelikes aren't your style you'd might be better off looking elsewhere, but I feel this is definetly worth a consideration","May 22, 2015","true","27.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Beautifully composed, so elegantly played, the artist is a pure genius.  I sincerely hope that we will get the chance to buy the soundtrack when the game is released.\nFor an early access game, this already has a lot of content and surprisingly not as much recognition as it deserves.

I originally got the free Demo for this game (which contains a huge amount of gameplay compared to other demos), and after a long time playing decided that I needed to get the full game. I was definitely impressed by the smoothness of the fighting mechanics in this game, and the vast amount of equipment and weaponry that you unlock over time means that there's a variety of fighting styles to suit anyone. For a Roguelike, it can seem a bit on the more tame side after a long time of playing and learning enemy attack patterns, but for a newer player it definitely presents a great challenge and difficulty curve that lets people gain an understanding of how to take on certain enemies. There's a great amount of content in this game, and while many bugs are present, the developers are admirably active with their players and are always working to improve the game or fix bugs where they can. It's a trait that you don't see very often with some indie developers out there nowadays, and I'm thankful that they work so hard to make the game the best it can be. With a great and fairly lengthy story, excellent gameplay, and tons of content, this is probably the first game where I've felt really compelled to complete the WHOLE game and try out every weapon.

Got it quite recently and have been having a lovely time with it. Disregard a few bugs and polish/balance issues, and I think it's already perfect. The game is quite similar to Megaman Legends, or so I've heard. I haven't played Legends, so I wouldn't know. Like many other games of it's kind, it's a skillful hack and slash. A majority of the time, people wouldn't see both attributes together, but nevertheless, it works. Diablo or God of War are also other examples of "skillful hack and slashes". It requires to pay attention to when you have to dodge an enemy's attack. You can't mash buttons and expect to win.\n\n\nGameplay (8.5/10)\n\nNow on to the actual characteristics of the game. The game itself has many different weapons and clothing items (and more on the way). Each one has a different purpose, and all of the weapons feel different in some way.\nEnemies' "weakness" is determined by color, and depending on the color, you use physical or elemental attacks. However, it can get confusing at times when you encounter an enemy color you haven't seen before. Not being able to roll/dodge when you're in the middle of attacking is quite frustrating as well, but it seems as if developers have taken note.\n\n\nMusic (10/10)\n\nNext, the soundtrack is the most underrated part of this game, in my personal opinion. I have not heard anyone talk about it or praise it, but I think Michael Chait (composer) deserves a round of applause. If you would like a listen, I suggest going to M Chait's Soundcloud page or take a look at the trailer. I will definitely be following his work from now on.\n\n\nArt Style (9/10)\n\nNow, the art style is an interesting part of the game. The game decides to take a sort of "cell-shaded" look. It looks quite nice, but it seems to be quite taxing on your computer. Mine, at least. If you have a beefy computer, you should be fine.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nLastly, if you're not interested in the game by this point of the review, I really wouldn't recommend it to you. And to those of you still interested, I would only say that you should be wary and remember that the game is in early access. There will be bugs and there will be balance issues. Remember this isn't a finished product. If you can get past all of that and are looking for a pleasurable experience, I would definitely recommend this game to you. On a sidenote, the developers are very polite and listen to a majority of problems players have with the game if they report them on the Steam forums/discussions page. If you are playing the game, don't be afraid to offer some constructive criticism. I'm sure the developers would be interested in knowing what kind of issues players are having.\n\nAs of now, I would rate this game an 8/10","January 13, 2015","true","4.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

I love the Ratchet and Clank gameplay and the retro arcade feel.\n\nThe visuals are very nice and detailed, even though it appears everything is made of tiny blocks, there are a lot of assets and detail in all the surfaces. I loved all the desks, terminals and signs in the factory and I love all the debris in the sewers. I noticed a room in the city that had shelves full of books and even a Mario "?" box on a desk. Very nice attention to detail!\n\nI love the lighting! Each room in the factory had a red tint or blue tint and really enhanced the environment! Lighting brings this retro-ish game to life because it has to much character!\nI hope that there will be really dark levels/dungeons that require a special light accessory in the future.\n\nThe fighting mechanics are fun an intense. Your robot has many attacks at his disposal. Left click does a standard attack with combos and right click does random power attacks. Not to mention you can jump, then combo in the air! Nice touch! I like the avoid button where your robot can jump back to avoid hits. There is a lot of "eye candy" when attacking and its quite addicting to see what each weapon's power will do. Some have lightnight, some have fire...but its always fun hacking on minion robots with any weapon.\n\nI really enjoyed the varied robot minions on each level. There are plenty of robots to attack and each one has its own unique ability. The floating robots have to be attacked in the air, while other robots are best avoided all together.\n\nI didn't have any issues in Linux Mint 17. Game downloaded quickly, launched right from Steam and I was loading the first level in no time. The first load took some time and I thought it was crashing, but the intro video started perfectly!\n\nI noticed a couple of flickering textures, but it was random in the sewers.\n\nThe controls seem to be made for controllers or joysticks instead of keyboard/mouse. I was able to play the game and fight, but I was having a hard time feeling comfortable with my robots speed and camera. I messed around with the options and sensitivity, but I think his overall speed is a little too fast. I would rather have a slower jogging pace and then press a run buttong (Q is sprint) to run faster.\n\nI also had a hard time keeping the camera centered on my robot. Every time I jumped or slid off a ledge the camera would automatically move up over his head. Not sure why, but it was taking control of my camera making it hard to see at all times.\n\nOverall, this an absolutely amazing game!

Haha, no thanks. But when you buy this game, you aren't paying $25 for a game that isn't fully releaed, you are funding a developer that made an awesome 3-D brawler roguelike, which I have NEVER seen so perfectly executed by this game. The HUGE variety of weapons and a complimentary HUGE amount of parts! Oh! The combination! The unforgiving nature of having spent an entire day's worth of experience on one run only to have been overwhelmed and lost all that time... Bu~ut most likely after spending that much time and expereince you have unlocked a whole new set of armor, ten more weapons, and still ended with a few extra expereince to try again. All in all, it's worth it, and hats off to AHEARTFULOFGAMES for this awe inspiring title.

Ugh.  Okay.  Here we go.\n\nAs you can see, it didn't take me long of playing this game before I got sick of it and am regretting purchasing it.  It's not a bad game by any means--it's actually pretty good so far and has a lot of potential.\n\nJust don't buy it.  Do not buy it.\n\nIt's far too broken and far too incomplete to be worth its admittedly outrageous $25 asking price.  It is a cool game.  It is really, really cool.  It has a lot going for it.  But looking at it now, I wish I'd stayed away.\n\nFirst of all, I found that its mechanics were incredibly difficult to accustom myself to, and even after running through the tutorial three times I was still struggling with the game's basic functions.  That's not okay.  And speaking of things that aren't okay: The difficulty.  This game is WAY too hard for the state it's in.  Its difficulty is honestly deterring.  Rather than getting frustrated, yet determined to try to do better over my numerous deaths, I only found myself getting angrier and angrier until I finally just shut "this broken fraction of a video game" (in my own rage-induced words) off and haven't touched it since.\n\nNot to mention...  Heh, I couldn't even complete the first level.  Yeah, how's that for great game design when the FIRST LEVEL bugs out so that doors won't open and it can't be completed?  Level two is so barren and unfinished, and it doesn't even have music...  I haven't bothered to look at level three yet.  I couldn't get my patience to hold that long.\n\nSo I guess the point I need to make here before I get too much more ranty is that this game is good, but stay away from it.  It's WAY too early access for even Steam.  If you ask me it shouldn't have been put here in the state that it's in.  It needs so much work it's outrageous.\n\nAnd $25 is an ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS price for a game that's barely been started.  Right now this is worth $10 at the most.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEDIT: Oh, wow, the developer actually responded to my review...  I gotta say, I expected backlash, but they actually took the criticism pretty well on the nose.  Thanks for being so polite!  Of course I'd never write a review in spite and this means no disrespect whatsoever.  I actually am looking forward to the game being completed!  It has me interested, just not hooked.  Who knows, maybe later on in its development cycle I'll have more positive things to say about it.","April 22, 2015","false","1.1"," 7 of 26 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","7","26","0","2"
