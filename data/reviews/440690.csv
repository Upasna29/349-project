Now exploring an abandoned hospital isn't exactly new when it comes to horror games but its done well here. With just about everything you do in the game, the novel gets written and you can see what you have so far by pressing R. This is actually pretty cool but it gets old fairly fast as it updates so frequently that if you try to check it every time you get an update then you'll never get through the game and if you put it off too long then you end up with a crap ton to read, I don't know about you guys but I don't play games to read.\n\nIf you ignore the actual novel and just play the game then there's a lot to recommend. The graphics, while not world-beating, are very good and do a lot to create the atmosphere. The hospital is dark but not too dark. There are some technical problems (as with nearly every indie game) but none of them were enough to ruin the game. The story is very good. I won't spoil any of it here, but it really pushed me further into the game to find out what is going on.\n\nOne of the selling points of the game is that there is no combat. Don't take this to mean that you can't die. I have. Multiple times.\n\nAll in all, its a very spooky game. The story is very intriguing and told in a new way (the novel) and its definitely worth $5 (at time of writing) if you're into indie horror.","February 23","true","2.4"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","34","38","0","0"

Novel creation is quite an original idea, i like that everything i do turns into text.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is pretty good as well. It isn't only creepy but also mysterious.\n\nMy only critique is that the animations could have been better.\n\nIt also amazes me that this game was made by a single dev.\n\nI highly recommend it.","February 23","true","3.1"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","24","28","0","0"

Kudos to the developer for making this game all by himself on Unreal Engine.\n\nThe graphics and the sound effects of the game are really well, and help create a compelling atmosphere. You, the player, writing an ingame novel is a pretty unique concept. It adds to the overall feeling of the game making you bring up the story and read it. And if you are somehow stuck it will guide you through the game.\n\nThe puzzles in the game are fun to solve and not too hard to ruin the game experience and comsume too much of your time. There is an intriguing main story that unfolds its mysteries as you play.\n\nOverall I recommend Mesel for the original story telling style and atmospheric gameplay. If you like indie games and the horror genre, definitely check this game out!\n","February 24","true","1.6"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","0"

So I decided to give it a try.\n\nThough I haven't yet finished the game, so far it is just as I expected. It's story, environments and music surround the player so nice it is hard to give a break. There are few jump scares but that is not the actual way of the game to creep the player out. The animations, level design and puzzles are almost AAA quality.\n\nIt is so easy to get some nice screenshots while enjoying the captivating story of the game.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=632232744\n\nIt surprised me when I learned that the game is a one man project. Can't wait to finish this game, also I'm looking forward for possible next amazing projects from the dev.","February 26","true","1.8"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","16","17","2","0"

Doctor Ahmet is a man who would do anything for his family but has to come over extreme difficulties and beat his nemesis colleauge evil Altemur.\n\nGame play: This game delivers exactly what it promises. Hours of gameplay full of horror and challenging puzzles. It was one of the best indie games I have ever played with surprisingly good graphics. I don't recommend playing it at night with headphone like I did; as it might get too tense and make you jump off your chair few times.\n\nOverall I recommend this game to both fans of the genre and to players who are looking for a different experience. 9/10","February 27","true","1.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"
