Here, world's chance to redeem itself lies into Pep, the world's last and most brutal Special Forces' K-9, trained for terrorist takedowns and body dismemberment. Alongside Pep, there's his sidekick; Putt-Putt. Don't let Putt-Putt trick you down with his sweet 8-year-old voice, he actually is a trained war machine, initially to end Pep's life, but now teamed up in order for a major deed.\n\nPutt-Putt® and Pep's Balloon-o-Rama is a chance that MUST NOT be missed.\n\nGraphics - 9.8\nGameplay - 10\nVoice Acting - 10.2\nMechanics - 10\nExpand Dong -10\n\nTOTAL SCORE: 10\n=======================================================================================\n\nIGeeN - 9\nGameMaster - 10\nNintendo4lyfe - 11\nXBlife - 9.6\n\n\nDon't Miss.","May 2, 2014","true","1.4"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","22","26","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Connax94/recommended/284000/","Connax94","Connox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Connax94/","165 products in account","The best version (so far) of one of this generation's finest games, Putt-Putt® and Pep's Balloon-o-Rama is testament to how much difference a graphical overhaul can make. Humongous Entertainment's ability to render worlds with caricatures of real Balloons, yet somehow more authentic than shot-for-shot recreations, is based on details. With this edition those details have been refined, expanded, and improved.\n\nPutt-Putt® achieved everything that it needed to with Putt-Putt® and Pep's Balloon-o-Rama. It revitalised a series that had suffered real brand damage in Putt-Putt® and Pep's Dog on a Stick, and the second game in its Arcade series easily stands as the best game we've seen in years. There is absolutely no reason to miss out on this one.\n\n10/10","November 26, 2014","true","0.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I wanted some backstory between Putt Putt and Pep but unfortuntely many of my questions are left unanswered. I wanted to know why Putt Putt could talk and why Pep is okay with being kidnapped by a car. These questions still bother me and will continue to have a negative effect on me for a long while.\n\nGameplay - 10/10\nThe gameplay of this game is fantastic. I have never had more fun throwing a dog at balloons. It's even more fun than it is in real life just without having to hide the corpse afterwards. It's a bit unrealistic though as the police never knock at your door in this game and you never have to lie about you never seeing the dog that went missing.\n\nMusic - 1/10\nThe music is very bland and sounds a lot like the JoJo's bizarre adventure soundtrack so you know what to expect; trash. This low quality of audio does not suit this high quality of gameplay.\n\nGraphics - 4/10\nI really like the Minecraft look that these games go with nowadays. While I would've preferred the animation from the anime the pixelated Minecraft inspired look really gives it some charm.\n\n\nOverall: After 62 levels I called it a day. ?/10","May 4","false","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
