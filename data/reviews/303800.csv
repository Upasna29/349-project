It is playable as hot-seat or online and may give you many hours of enjoyable experience.\n\nBut there are some flaws that need to be fixed to make the game perfect:\n\n1. When a player have to do a choice, he/she can't access to the game map and/or any player hero sheet and resources including his/her own. This may easily lead to wrong decisions and waste fun. The board game is obviously free from this limitation. So, the possibility to "minimize" the choice and take look at the game state will make the game much comfortable.\n\n2. Some choices are not clearly described. For example, Triss Merigold has a spell to look at the two top investigation cards then put one on the bottom of the deck and the other back on top. When this spell is used, the game show two cards and say to the player just "choose one of them". What will be happen next with the chosen card is unclear.\n\n3. The rules of the game says that proofs can't be exchanged back to leads. So, the investigation successes of a hero converted to proofs must me "protected" from any bad events that force the hero to spend leads. But in the computer version proofs ARE exchanged back to leads every time a hero must spend more leads than he/she have.\n\n4. The AI is wery weak, so the single-player games are dull and not enjoyable at all.\n\n5. There is no russian language, sadly to many and many russian-speaking Witcher fans.\n\n6. In network games, when a player quits at the characters selecting stage, all other players are forced to quit and try to start network game again. That allows one player to abuse many other.\n\n7. Triss "Teleport" spell is mightly overpowered. It allows Triss to collect two leads in a turn without any risk. I think, this is not the board game disbalance but the wrong implementation in computer game. Some other abilities with the text "when you perform [stated action] {do something in addition}" also work weird in the computer game.","December 1, 2014","true","48.8"," 109 of 120 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","109","120","0","0"

If you do not meet either of these conditions, then this game gets a little hard to recommend at the moment.  The AI is fairly stupid which, for the first game or 2, is fine.

You have four playable characters, each with own strong and weak points. And you've got some quests to do, by travelling in the dangerous world, fighting and tricking monsters and politicians, helping and betraying other good guys around, to make a better final score for yourself.\n\nSurely, card game is looking better when you have 3 pals around, free evening and cozy place to gather. And maybe pizza to fill the list... But! Funny thing is that this Adventuring Witcher game is more suitable to the PC, than to such gatherings as a gaming party of good friends. It's a bit more on the digits side, than I'd really loved to see in my basement (or garage), when I meet my people.\n\nOn the other hand, for the multiplayer little session, game feels quite alright: fast, challenging... If only a bit too cold, though, during a little amount of real interactions between players. Still, for its current price, this game is must-have - if you ever were about turn-based games where you gotta think and calculate your steps miles ahead.\n\nMy mark is 8/10.

However, if you are expecting the next X-Wing or Arkham Horror, you'd better look elsewhere. But if you can put such hype aside and play it for what it is: a decent board game that, if played with friends either online with this digital version, or face-to-face with the physical copy (the way I believe all board game SHOULD be played if you're able to do so) is worth your consideration.\n\nThe Witcher Adventure Game is, in certain aspects, similar to Arkham Horror and Talisman - in fact to me it feels somewhat like a mish-mash of the two. Is it as good as Arkham Horror? In my opinion, no; Is it better than Talisman - if judging Talisman without all the expansions and basing the comparison simply on the base game itself - yes, to me at least it made for a more enjoyable experience, both online and face-to-face with the physical copy.\n\nIn terms of gameplay; it's kind of a mish-mash of Arkham Horror and Talisman, so, like I said, this game has a level of spontaneity, with random spikes of difficulty throughout the game - but it makes for an interesting story as you're playing. Taking into consideration all the different events (foul events and good fortune), monsters (leveled as bronze - easy, silver - medium, and gold - hard) and the war track, it really isn't suprising how you might find yourself at the bottom of the pack if hit with too many unlucky cards a few turns in a row; but if you play it smart you generally defy the odds and hold out for these few 'bad' turns and bring yourself back into contention for first place.\n\nThe characters are pretty well balanced. Having played with all but Triss, I've yet to find anything overpowering or game-breaking with any of the four playable characters. Each have their own pros and cons - not that I'll spoil their abilities; learning the playstyle of each character for the first time was half the fun!\n\nLast but now least, the artwork is pretty topnotch - and it should be, considering CDPR and FFG have sourced most of their material from the concepts done for the three witcher games.\n\nOverall I reckon it's worth a grab for witcher fans who also enjoy BOARD GAMES. This isn't a hard game to wrap your head around; you can learn the system within the first 10minutes; but it is enjoyable, and that, at least for me, makes it worth the buy.","November 28, 2014","true","13.1"," 38 of 45 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","38","45","0","0"

The price is right.\n\nTLDR: The game isn't terrible but also isn't great.  There's no meaningful interaction between the various players.  Constant status ailments can become frustrating.  3/5 stars.\n\nMy negative review is of the game itself.  It's a simple four-player "collect various resources until you have the right combination to cash them in for victory points" type of game, coupled with basic dice-based combat (versus the environment, not versus the other players).  The main problem I have with this game is that there really isn't any interaction between the different players.  For example, I might draw a card that affects all of the players, but it happens automatically, whether I want it to or not.  At no time in the game was I able to choose to influence the other players in any way, either to help them or to hurt them.  So basically it boiled down to four players, each playing a single player game on the same board.  It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't very enjoyable either.  I originally bought the game in the hopes that multiplayer would be fun, but considering the lack of meaningful interaction, it kind of seems pointless now.\n\nAnd this game is dark.  You will be negatively afflicted with status ailments every freaking turn.  Because of this, the game becomes a long, grim slog to complete your quests.  This is all very true to the witcher universe, I just don't know that it lends itself toward making a game fun.\n\nOn the plus side, the artwork is fantastic.  Having read the various Witcher stories and played the excellent RPGs allowed me to appreciate the lore that is depicted in this game.\n","November 29, 2014","false","21.3"," 149 of 233 people (64%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","64","149","233","6","2"

The singleplayer AI is absolutely horrible so offline mode isn't any fun after you learn the game.\n\nOnline is horribly unbalanced due to Triss being able to teleport around acquiring 2 leads per turn compared to the other characters 1, thus completing the quests 2x as fast as the other characters. Every 3 game match I get into with a halfway decent triss player completes the third quest in 14-20 turns while everyone else is finsihing their first or getting onto their second. This would be an easy fix to simply allow the teleport card to be used before travel only or limit only 1 lead from travelling per turn.\n\nIts also quite annoying how you can't directly hinder an opponent, You might draw a card randomly by chance to slightly hinder them but it's nothing significant and will likely hurt you just as much.\n\nOther than the balance and horrible AI it is a pretty fun game though","May 9, 2015","false","23.7"," 44 of 59 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","44","59","4","1"

Picking one of four characters that play quite differently, your  goal is to collect "leads" to solve quests which in return give you victory points. In order to get said leads you are free to roam the various cities of the Witcher world and do side missions / complete tasks, battle monsters and grab as many VP as possible. Of course there are events (called good fortune and foul fate) that can advance or hinder your progress as well as all sorts of items or companions (in card-form) that add their own little spin on things and can somewhat change your playstyle.\n\nUnfortunately, there is very little interaction between players apart from "support-quests" which will net two players VP and the deliberate placement of tough monsters in regions where your "friends" have business.\n\nCombat is interesting, but clunky to control and becomes a bit of a nuisance once you figure out which of your development cards basically let you win every fight. Especially Geralt will quickly hack and slash his way through the toughest of creatures (with a speed disadvantage, though) while the other characters can be stopped in their tracks quite effectively early on.\n\nIt all boils down to knowing each characters cards, the locations of the cities and how many quests have to be completed to win the game - fast games with just a one quest-requirement can be over within minutes, while a full "four man, five quests" game can take several hours with over 100+ VP earned per character (depending on the players and their knowledge of the game).\n\nI have but two complaints about it: first of all, it is very "tablet" in its UI design and as a result feels unnecessary clunky because you have to click EVERYTHING (the same mistake that Chainsaw Warrior made). We got keyboards and controllers - shortcuts would make everything so much more faster. Especially when you know what you are doing, all the animations and clicker-clacker with the mouse are quite tedious. The other problem are some performance issues - the game has a tendency to start running sluggish after a while and inputs are not properly registered, I have read in the forums that other people suffer from this as well - so it doesn't seem to be an isolated case. The game is pretty and all, but these stutters shouldn't happen.\n\nStill, I dig the game and it is definitely in my top three along with Space Hulk (the first release, not Ascension) and Elder Signs: Omens. So, if you can wrap your head around the idea of playing a digital board game instead of a "proper" vidgeogame adaptation - the Witcher Adventure Game is a great title to get started.\n\nPS: I do not know the actual boardgame this is based on, so I cannot compare the two and do not know how good the transition from real world game to digital adaptation is.","May 10, 2015","true","13.7"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","28","32","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/303800/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","The Witcher series is known for its fantastic storytelling, interesting characters, and solid action, all of which have permeated not only the stories by Andrzej Sapkowski, but also the hugely popular video games developed by CD Projekt RED. The lore is strong, the characters are deep, and the land is lush. Now the Witcher universe has been tapped for board gaming. And in a strange, but intriguing, turn of events, the board game has been developed as a video game.\n\nLike any good adventure game, gameplay revolves around quests. In this case, each player has a distinct quest that they choose at the outset of the game. Each quest also has side-quests and goals that garner victory points. Depending on what length of game the players want, they will denote an amount of quests that need to be completed in order to trigger the end of the game. When the game ends, players will compare victory points and the player with the highest amount will win.\n\nThe mechanics aren’t all that complicated, as the game mainly consists of traveling around a map and collecting clues that will turn into hard evidence and end up completing your quest upon arrival in a specific city. There is also a war track that essentially updates the monsters and obstacles in different regions. Die rolls determine victory among most challenges, with card buffs and special abilities that can modify the results. These die tests can spell the difference between taking down a prized beast and losing one of your abilities until you nurse your wounds via a rest action.\n\nMuch of the gameplay is fairly reminiscent of Eldritch Horror, another Fantasy Flight game, and, unfortunately, this becomes a detriment to the Witcher theme and experience. I enjoy the mechanics of Eldritch Horror and can see how and why the designers would decide to incorporate elements of them into The Witcher, yet I feel like the implementation makes the game feel more like a checklist and less like a rousing adventure.\n\nPart of the problem lies in a misunderstanding of what makes The Witcher exciting. Take combat, for instance. I don’t think the unpredictability of die rolls makes for good Witcher battles. Geralt is wily, studious, strong, and knows a number of fighting techniques. However, in the game, it seems as if none of this matters, because it all comes down to rolling some dice and maybe playing a card or two, hoping that the battle goes well. Despite the fact that there are four characters, each with semi-distinct abilities and dice, it all feels characterless. I think this symptom stems from a very basic design misstep.\n\nThe Witcher is very much a story-driven franchise that holds dear to plot development and character integrity, while weaving a tapestry of quests and events into the action. I don’t feel that weight and detail while playing this game. I feel as if the mechanics are meant to serve this notion, but they don’t cycle well together and everything feels like a series of other games that have been patched together in an attempt to make a cohesive design.\n\nThere is no doubt that the game feels smooth and methodical; that there is a sense we are in a world of intrigue and danger. Yet, I couldn’t help but feel like the things I was doing didn’t really matter and the things my opponents were doing didn’t really matter and that we were all just playing semi-interactive solitaire, with a swingy vibe.\n\nI think what this game needed was a different identity from the outset, or perhaps a mechanic that took the main gameplay and made it more impactful and interesting. A campaign mode immediately comes to mind. Something which ebbs and flows and allows for a little more logic and strategy – studying monsters, utilizing specific combat strategies, and slaying them with a finer attention to unique qualities rather than hopefully getting a good combat card and some decent rolls. I really view this game as little more than a whirling dervish with very little player decision.\n\nThe Witcher: Adventure game is a tough nut to crack. It’s not as if the elements to a great game aren’t there. It’s not as if there isn’t a somewhat compelling scheme. I found myself enjoying certain elements, such as seeking out the best path to completion of a quest. It’s just that everything is so distant feeling that there is difficulty being immersed and involved in the action. I suppose part of this is the natural outcome of playing a board game in a digital format, but nevertheless, I never quite felt the satisfaction of moving pieces around and developing a strategy or imagining an adventure the way I was probably supposed to.","June 5","true","27.6"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","0"

That is a huuge problem for me and my friends because without this feature we just can't see a way to finish a single session since the standard game takes quite some time to finish let alone the epic game.\n\nDespite my love of the franchise, and me being a fan of FFG boardgame in general, I have to give the digital version of Witcher the Adventure Game a thumbs down.

The characters, lore and combat tactics from the Witcher universe is well adapted into this pc version of a boardgame! I love the strategical elements, and it is a lot of fun to fulfill quests, travel the map, prepare for big battles by healing up, developing Sign cards and brewing potions, and the dice based combat is exciting and fun!\n\n- A good game to relax with after some intense hours of playing The Witcher 3.\n\nConclusion: 8,5 out of 10.","February 10","true","5.1"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

There's good music, there's a nice atmosphere, the encounters are cool and the interaction is nearly well excecuted. It's a very well thought out board game, with minor flaws and weird 'fast travel' systems that just robs you of your money.\n\nWith nearly well, I mean that the AI is A) dumb as hell, B) cheats.\nAs for the dumbness - the AI tends to just spend all their development cards for 1 fight, while s/he should only need 1. Then there's the endless 'fast travelling' that they're doing and making things harder for themselves.\nThen there's the fact that they simply refuse to complete their main quest. Dandelion for example, had 6 purple proof items and kept spending gold on 1 more every time he could, while avoiding the main quest area.\nThis didn't happen once or twice, this happens nearly every game I'm playing.\n\nAs for the cheating, I'm convinced that they don't cheat with the dice rolls, but there are cards like Dijkstra's thugs, that makes you have to cash in 2 investigation tokens. Or, if they lose a fight, to hand over 1 or 2 tokens. The AI doesn't have to do this for some unexplained reason. I've also seen instances where they become 'delayed' and still perform 2 actions, while not having a good fortune card to ignore the delay.\n\nAll in all, it's not a masterpiece, but deffinatly worth spending 1 hour per day for a round of fun and the price tag isn't too bad either.\nHere's to hoping that the patch removes these weird AI issues.\n\n****************\n\nI'm going to ADD to this review, rather than edit it with strikethrough.\nA new patch came out recently and fixed every single bit of gripes I had with this game. Now it's a challenge, the AI doesn't cheat with Dijkstra's Thugs, they don't derp around for an eternity and makes this game a HUGE challenge.\nThanks CDRP, for listening to your customers!","March 12, 2015","true","52.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

My only complaints are 1) that the computer AI is too easy overall, often seeming clueless as to what they should be doing and falling behind rapidly and 2) AI opponent turns can take forever (wait-fest).

I mean, I loved Talisman... and this looks even cooler! Sadly, no. This game PRETENDS to have three equal mechanics to it (diplomacy, magic, and combat) but the only thing that really matters is combat. Game ends when any player completes a pre-set number of quests, but the person who finishes the most quests isn't the winner -- the winner is the person with the most victory points. What's the most reliable way of making victory points you ask? Why in combat of course! Every turn there is likely to be a combat, and many of the combats give VP... because of this, it is possible for the combat characters (really just Geralt, because he's the best fighter) to lap all adversaries on VP even if he doesn't come CLOSE to finishing as many quests. This game is like going to a dance contest and realizing you're also going to be judged on your attire, which is okay I guess BUT WAIT... you're ALSO going to be judged on a juggling routine... and somebody else is an expert juggler.

This is an unfair review as I am slightly partial to CD Projekt Red's Witcher series. There are some flaws with the game design, such as multiplayer solitaire. I tried using Triss Merigold and she seemed fine. However, after playing multiple games, I've decided to vote it down, mainly due to the insane random events from dice rolling and card drawing.\n\nPROS\n1. Follows the Witcher Series\nVery accurate, all the main characters are inside. I was actually looking forward to using the Scoia'tael (Elves), Philippa Eilhart (Mage ♥♥♥♥♥) or Saskia (Dragoness) in the game.\n\n2. Intuitive\nIt's easy to learn. I didn't play a single tutorial to be able to understand the game.\n\nCONS\n1. Multiplayer Solitaire *****\nYou don't really care about any other player as none of actions matter to you. There is hardly any player interaction.\n\n2. Advanced Snakes and Ladders *****\nIt is just personal racing like advanced Snakes and Ladders. You just roll dice and play the game on your own.\n\n3. Random Monsters and Combat\nThis is so boring. The random monster generation doesn't capture the fantastic monsters that I experienced playing the Witcher 2. To defeat SINGLE monsters, you roll Swords and Shields. If you roll a sufficient amount of Swords, you kill the monster. If you roll a sufficient amount of Shields, you block its negative effect.\n\nIt lacks the skilled planning and excitement that the normal Witcher game brings since it all boils down to Sword and Shield.\n\n4. Random Bad Fortune and Investigation Cards\nSome just make you lose 2 VP just for drawing them and some just do nothing. The randomness is horrendous. The investigation cards are also full of negative cards called Setbacks which have no redeeming value. If you draw badly, you are screwed.\n\nSUGGESTIONS\n1. Traps\nIf you arrive in a location, you can play a card that leaves a surprise for the next player who crosses (not land) its path. It might be a nasty surprise or a simple challenge. That way players will look at where other players are moving to.\n\n2. Learning Other Player's Abilities\nCurrently, each player has their own unique development deck. No one will care about what another player develops.\nBased on the abolve design, one deck will likely be superior to the others. It would be interesting to take 2-3 developments that belong to other players as your own. This could create crazy combos and make player's more interested in what the others are doing.\n\n3. Global Quests\nThis will give something that everyone will fight over for VP. E.g. Save Ciri. Pay 3 Blue Leads, 3 Purple Leads and 3 Red Leads for 12 VP. Only completable once.","December 28, 2015","false","4.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Although it needs a lot of work.\nThe multiplayer mode lacks a lot of key features you would connect with multiplayer. For instance, you cannot start a public multiplayer game and then invite your friends. This is a huge minus. Same goes for creating a private game. There is no way to create a private and invite a friend and then open it up to the public. So playing with friends abroad is often a challenge just to get the game started.\n\nIt's a very interactive game in terms of collecting items, quests and spells and spending gold. Along the way you will face obstacles, evil monsters and other nasty things out for blood. These can at times be a little challenging and make it feel like you're being set back a little. As the game progresses, you will become stronger and stronger.\n\nThe game is based around questing. Currently you can pick between doing 1, 3 or 5 quests in order to finish the game. Who ever has the most Victory Points (VP) at the end wins.\n\nThe game lacks character player interacting. With the extreme weak AI it is often more beneficial to play against or with other real people, but even so it still feel like you're playing against the a slightly stronger version of the AI. It lacks some interaction elements with other players instead of an action tab where you can see their roles. While you get to see what monster they're fighting, you don't get to see the monsters strenght and benefits. This makes it a little tedious and most players just sit around and wait for their turn without really having to pay attention to what the other 1-3 players are doing.\n\nThe community is a little dead and it can sometimes take a while to find other players.\n\nThere's a HUGE lack of information on the forums in terms of what direction the game is going to such an extant that there's not even any sticky posts from the developers. It makes the game feel dead and when I take a look at other digital board games forums (on steam) their forums usually thrives of activity.\n\nThe 4 classes you can pick between are all different in terms of play style, which is a great thing. Downside is, there's just these 4 and there are no news about them adding more.\n\nAs much as I want to recommend this game to people I just simply can't.\nIt feels dead and tedious to play and I regret not only buying a copy for myself but also gifted a copy to a friend before I knew what hassle the multiplayer would be. Along we're having random disconnect issues to deal with as well, which is not making all the bad things look any better.\nThis is a game that you can acquire on most platforms but without cross platform, it should probably just have stayed on tablets.","December 14, 2014","false","92.4"," 15 of 32 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","15","32","0","0"

First full game I completed, I won with a score of 64 to the AIs 21 and 2. I'd never played this board game before, so had no particular strategic approach to it (beyond the basics), so to me this is a sign of bad AI, the huge gap between my ability and theirs.\n\nAdditionally, the character balance seems off. I'll probably play the game a bit more as other characters to see, but for now it seems as though the strengths of Geralt far outweigh those of any other character.\n\nSo while it's a no to recommend this game, it's not an outright no... it's more a 'be aware' of what you are getting. If you want it for the online mode only, then fair enough, you'll probably enjoy it.","May 10, 2015","false","2.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/taigoro/recommended/303800/","taigoro","Tai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/taigoro/","217 products in account","Not that great of a board game unfortunately. I like long adventure board games (such as Runebound and World Of Warcraft the Boardgame) and this was just kind of boring. Half way through the game I was just wanting the game to end and when it finally did end all I did was look to the ceiling and sigh heavily saying, "finally!".\n\nSome issues I specifically had:\n-Tutorial, it has you watch the first tutorial and that is all it tells you, next thing the game asks is if you want to play offline or online. Turns out there is like a dozen more tutorial videos in the main screen's menu though I didn't know that as it doesn't really make it easy to know.\n--At least the rule book you can access in game isn't that bad.\n-You can't tell what is going on in opponents turn. AI opponents take their turn really quickly with cards and effects happening all over the place but it still takes the 3 of them at least a minute to get through their turns, So the game might as well be single player game with 1-2 minute lag between turns because that is what it amounted to. What the opponents were doing didn't really matter other than the automated "bad stuff" that happens to you on the beginning of your turn from their Foul Fates and you don't have to pay attention for any\n--The activity log always being up on their turns would help, the monster that an opponent is fighting always being up on the left side of the battle screens would help too to know what is going on and what just happened to them. Especially on the battle results screen so I don't have to specifically try and remember what his negative effects for losing were.\n-SO MUCH bad stuff happening to you every turn, feels like you have no control over it because so much happens every turn.\n--It actually got to a point in my game where I had something like 10 turns where I was stuck unable to do anything but rest every turn from all the bad stuff I was suffering every single turn. Foul fates laying down more foul fates, wounds, deadly wounds. Foul fates from other players constantly. Monsters that have bad effects from just fighting them (more foul fates and wounds). More monsters spawning. On and on and on.\n-----90% of every turn was dealing with bad stuff happening from foul fates or other player's foul fates.\n-A few little glitchy spots where music cut out for a few minutes and sometimes the game wouldn't detect I had something I could do, had to restart the game once since it literally wouldn't let me take an action. And several times where I had a witcher sign but the game didn't think so then all of a sudden 30 seconds later it would say "oh, you do have one, ok you can use it now".\n-AI are really dumb at times, I'd see them use a spell/card that gives them more defense dice...then not use the dice and somehow fail the combat's defence section. Rather often too. I won my game but it took over 2 hours for a game that the main screen said should be 45 minutes, some of that may have been me not knowing how to best play but man is that a difference.\n\nWouldn't recommend the game. Maybe I just had a really bad first game but it certainly wasn't no 45 minutes long 3-quest game. Second half of the game really felt like it was dragging on. And the game didn't feel much like an adventure game, you don't really power up your characer other than from development cards and those you can just get every turn without doing anything (literally the only way to get them is using an action to draw 2 keep 1), no gear from quests or looting monsters, no new powers really from leveling up type of stuff. Just spam development cards to get what powers you want then move around trying to collect a dozen investigation tokens of certain colors and hope the piles of bad stuff happening to you ever turn doesn't hinder you tooo much.\n\nAnd hey, I only played a single-player vs 3 AI game, maybe when playing multiplayer with actual other people it will get better. Though I worry about downtimes greatly increasing in that case.","January 11, 2015","false","6.2"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

As a result of the dying/dead online community, i'm going to change the review to a not reccomend. It's still a fun board game and you CAN local co-op the game but is the solo experience worth 10 bucks? I'd say no when there are other options. I also looked at the steam charts and while the player-base has risen to 200 players, i'm still having trouble finding games. If you have friends to play with, this game may be worth the money. otherwise i advise saving the money for something else.\n\nso i just played a match against the AI as Triss and here's my detailed-revew-after-1-game for those of you that have that feeling that you just can't wait to play the game but are worried about the game being some sort of con.\nTL:DR\nThis is a fun board game and anyone that likes board games should probably pick this up and support it.\n\nThe actual explaination of the game in my experience during 1 round, since the info given is kinda bare-bones\nThis board game involves you playing as 1 of four characters and completing various objectives on a quest card to score points. The objectives often are either:\n1. go to some area and spend resources to get points\n2. Just go to some area and you get points\n3. just spend resources and get points\n4. go to another person and spend resources to assist them with THEIR quest and get points while they get half as many points\nIt's simple enough but what makes it difficult is the board itself and two kinds of setbacks.\nthe first setback is drawing a misfortune card. There are 3 ways to get misfortune cards.\n1. An effect of another card/monster\n2. fast travel (moveing 2 spaces for the price of 1!!!)\n3, move to a space and be forced to draw a misfortune card.\nThe misfortune cards have various effects from getting hurt, monsters and bad guys spontaneously spawning out of your rear to paying some sort of toll or even choosing between the last two options as I never really encountered the first with either of the other two.\nThe second setback is monster cards. Monster cards are ranked from bronze, to silver, to gold, each with increasing lethality each time. Monster cards can have various, previously mentioned effects as well, but they mostly just injure you. When you're injured you're incapable of using the action that's injured until it's healed. Some cards can heal you or you can heal yourself for the cost of one of your 2 actions. some monsters can make a quest much harder to deal with, with an example being a troll that kicked the AI's butt and I conciously avoided until i got strong enough to deal with it. You fight monsters by rolling a hero die, and a number of regular dice. the hero die tends to resonate with your development cards (next paragraph) while the regular dice have either a defense, an attack, or a blank face. meet the required amount of attacks or defenses and you succeed in either attacking or defending. attacking a monster successfully takes it off the board and can possibly yeild rewards while defending averts a bad effect from taking place. Monsters need to be killed in a single roll, their damage does not stay on between turns.\n\nSpeaking of getting stronger, you do so by drawing development cards. Development cards have various effects as well, in my case they alll had to do with rolling a hero die just right during combat, (i didn't encounter any development cards that ouright added the number of dice i roll or anything). you can choose, for an action, to draw 2 development cards and keep 1. Some development cards are much stronger than others and their effects seem to vary, (though as triss i only drew development cards that aided me in combat, which was lucky for me in this case, but each character has their own development cards by my understanding, though i think other characters CAN use other character's development cards. I'll edit this later if i'm wrong). Development cards need to be charged before they can be used and you can put a charge on a development card by using an action to charge it.\nYou cannot use the same action twice on one turn.\n\nFinally i'll touch on resource gathering. you gather things called clues which come in the colors of blue, purple, and red. you get clues by either:\n1. moving to an area and drawing 1 clue of one of the colors on the area\n2. investigating for an action and drawin 1 clue of 1 of the three colors\n3. getting cards which boost the number of clues you get. These cards tend to happen when drawing clues and can sometimes have negative effects but often have traits which resonnate with other traits and get you lots of clues in 1 go, if you're lucky enough.\n\nThere's also some war tick thing that never came into play when i used it either that or i didn't notice its effect... sooo i guess i'm lucky.\n\nI don't think i missed anything, so i'll now move on to the impression the game gave me.\n\nI enjoyed the game. somewhere along the line the whole thing started feeling very natural to me and i started making strategic decisions on where to go, which rout i should take to get to a destination, and what actions i can afford to spare preparing myself for what's to come and which actions i needed to use to collect resources or get the hell out of rivia (where the freaking harpy just landed!) Overall it's a very fun game and if you're a fan of board games i think you should get it. it's only about a day old so i haven't found a multiplayer match yet but I dabbled in the multiplayer options and i found a small chatbox on the top left of the screen, which is vital for games like this where playing the player can be just as important as playing the game.\n\nThe downside to this game that i can see so far is that the tutorial consists of a bunch of videos as opposed to a hands-on experience, so that may make it just a little annoying for some people to get into it but i found that once i started playing i eventually got the hang of it.\nAlso the visuals aren't too impressive. it's really just a board with pieces on it and some music in the background which actually bugged out on me once and just stopped. it didnt hinder the game at all, it was just less musical.\n\nI could give some arbitrary numerical score but overall i reccommend it and i definately hope a community grows around it so it can see further development.\narbitrary score:\npi x the square root of negative x where x is the number of sex cards available in the first game / something of slightly higher value... like actually getting laid.\n... dang this revew ran long, hope it was helpful...","November 28, 2014","false","8.2"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","3"

It's a nice PC interface. Everything works fairly well. (The dice are a little funky, but eh... whatever).\n\nI love the Witcher series. I was excited when this game was announced. I was excited to see this game hit the store.\n\nIf you you love The Witcher Adventure Game, and want a digital implementation, then stop reading and just buy it.\n\nIf you haven't played The Witcher Adventure Game, let me stop you right there and say "Don't". Go buy Merchants of Venus, Xia: Legend of a Drift System, Steam, Merchants & Marauders, Istanbul, or even Firefly: The Game. Those are all vastly superior Pick-Up and Deliver games - which is all this is. An unnessessarily complicated, frustrating, painful, lengthy Pick-Up and Deliver game.\n\nIt's a mean game. And I don't mean that in the way that Diplomacy or even Munchkin is a "mean game". Or even how "Ghost Stories is brutally difficult". I mean this game stabs you in the liver, and then deducts points from you because you're bleeding like a wimp.\n\nThe designer is a wonderful designer. He also owns the game publisher "Portal Games". Go check out all of his other games (Robinson Crusoe, Imperial Settlers, 51st State, The New Era, Pret-a-Porter). This doesn't even measure up to the worst game I've played from Fantasy Flight.\n\nThe interaction between players is awful. It's mostly a solitare experience. Which doesn't help when the game points how you don't have any friends.\n\nThe turns are very repetative. Especially when the game finally gets you into the fetal position, and all it leaves you to do is to rock back and forth as you bleed from your severed ankles.\n\nEver played Bunco? Where you just roll the dice, hoping to roll three of a kind? No agency. No decision making. Just luck of the RNG. This game wants you to roll a 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 of a kind with 3-4 dice - and that's not really an exaggeration.\n\nWhen when you fail, because - well - math, you take damage.\n\nNothing good really happens to you. And when it does, like finally completing one of your quests, you STILL get punished. For a good ol' fashioned "Good job. ♥♥♥♥ you." - like mom use to say.\n\nThe monsters seem incredibly out of balance. Rolling the dice usually seems like a wasted effort. There ARE things you HAVE to get in order to over come the dice, but those dont' seem well balanced either.\n\nThis is easily one of the worst board game experiences I've had in the last few years.\n\nThe only value this game has had for me is that I only spent $8 on this before foolishly spending $60 at my local game store. And for that, I'll look very favorably at it.\n\n10/10.","November 27, 2014","false","3.0"," 70 of 153 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","70","153","0","16"

Characters, environments and monsters all give it that excellent feel that the games have. Detailed and impressive art work can be found from it's map to the monster cards. It has the look and feel of an actual board game.\n\nI've invested a few hours of the game and have played a few of the "Complete 3 Quests" games. The pacing of the game is alright, though a bit of downtime between turns towards the late game. Be prepared to do something in the background while you wait your turn. A signal to anounce that your turn has come would be very helpful.\n\nOne major complaint I have with this game is it seems you are penialized for doing practically everything. I understand that the universe of The Witcher is a very unforgiving thing, but having to draw a fate card for almost every action (while having a fate token on an action) seems excessive. Most games I have played I have spent either trying to remove Fate tokens from my actions, or healing from wounds. I don't know if this is a major part of the game, dealing with Fate tokens, but it became more of an annoyance.\n\nThe quest system works well. Having to do investigations to gain resources works well and having side quests helps along the way to acheieving your quests. Side quests can give a bit more flavour to the game and is a great way to earn some extra Victory Points.\n\nThe battle system is alright, though it reminds me more of Elder Sign than anything else. Roll dice, match symbols, if you have enough, you win! If you don't! Bad stuff happens (if you don't defend).\n\nThe game has a lack of save system, which I find odd. So if you're wanting to play a long game but don't have the time to invest, prepare to be disapointed or to have the game run in the background.\n\nFor me, the game does a very good job of emulating a board game, but the mechanics are either ones I've played from other games, and does much better or just flat out annoy me for existing. I cannot really recommend this game.\n","November 30, 2014","false","3.2"," 14 of 44 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","14","44","0","0"

You will spend the first couple of games making some mistakes (unless you do your homework) but it's really that as difficult as it looks at first glace.  Don't give up within the first 15 mins, it will all come together after a couple games.\n\nI haven't played against random online or AI, so I cannot comment on that, however; if you have people to play with then it goes very smooth for the most part.

Right.\n\nThere we go\n\nPros:\n- Nice to look at (well, it will get boring, cause there's only one thing to look at)\n- easy to get into\n- adjustable game length, making it easy to play a 'quick' session\n- interesting cards and encounters, not to easy on you\n\nCons:\n- well, ♥♥♥♥ me, but combat is hard (don't even try it with anyone but Gerald)\n- it can get a bit frustrating, the game doesn't let you win easily\n- not sure if anyone is playing this online. better get a friend in front of the PC\n\nOnly if you're really into The Witcher or board games (and have the friends to support it). Else stay away.\nand even then: buy it on sale.","August 14, 2015","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But I'm guessing not a lot of people will be in this situation so it's a minor issue.\n\nOverall, it's a fun way to make friendships end, akin to a fantasy Monopoly.","May 9","true","19.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The best way to play it is with some friends, although it would never be as great as with actual board game. Nobody plays it online, so gather few friends around the computer and play it here. This game will mainly interest the people who like Witcher games and books, for other people it will just be board game with character, monster and places they know nothing about.
