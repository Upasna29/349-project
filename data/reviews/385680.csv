The movement method consistes of: Click ship,  drag a yellow line to your LINEAR ONLY destination, Right click.  Hope it "takes".  If it doesnt, (and normally it doesnt) repeat.  Until you get a green line with another yellow line next to is.  then right click and hope it doesnt change or erase your straight line flight path.\n\nCombat is also confusing.  I couldnt get my ships to fire on the first 2 tries at combat.  So I played the tutorial.  That was an exercise in frustration since 90% of the time I did what it said it wouldnt target the ship.  It gave no explanation why or hints how to do so.  then my entire fleet in the tutorial was obliterated on the first turn.\n\nthe main play screen looks alot like Galactic Empires 2 but less pretty.  (this is not a good thing since that is one of the worst of the genre)\n\nI sure hope this gets a lot better!","September 17, 2015","false","0.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","11","14","2","0"

Lack of features yet but lots of fun so far. Even in it's EA state this game is enjoyable for everyone who's interested in space strategy games.\n\nLeveling systems, upgradable buildings, research functions and competetive AI are missing to this date but I think they're gonna patch those things in the future.\n\nAs long as you're matchin up with some friends in a multiplayer game you'll really love its simple but deep strategic mechanics. One thing I don't like is the soundtrack, annoying as hell after a couple of hours. But thats just my opinion.\n\nLooking forward to a really good, yet addicting game.\n\n","August 22, 2015","true","7.1"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","0"

I am very optimistic, I like the cartoon Art style and the gameplay (while buggy as to be expected) is good. Just like the Forest and Subnautica, both were bare bones in the beginning but for those of whom played them on launch day, they had the makings of great games. This title strikes me in a similiar way!\n(No Cap'n Kibs were stricken in the writting/recording of this review)\n\n30 Minutes or Less, has potentail. Also If you get it do the tutorial the UI is a bit lack luster\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3XOFKIanUo&list=PLNtPp4M-LVW-RJYbhJha2iqZ7wSZOZI5H&index=2\n\nThanks for Reading, I hope this review gave you a better understanding of the game. Let me know your thoughts in the comments on what you think of this game?","August 22, 2015","true","0.4"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","13","20","2","0"

One thing I've come to realize is that if the game opens with the Unity settings box or with the "Made in Unity" splash screen, it's almost always going to be a piece of junk.  So it wasn't looking good for this one.  But then it started by asking me if I'd like to play the tutorial.  Yes, I would, that's a good sign that maybe the game's not total shovelware.  But then the tutorial launches, and I'm baffled at how a tutorial could fail so badly.  Is the "tutorial" intended to be a joke on purpose?  It just dumps you into a jumbled screen with no information on what is happening, what you are supposed to do, what the controls are, etc. and provides absolutely zero tutoring of any kind.  Quit, uninstall, into the "Garbage" category in my library, moving on.","December 28, 2015","false","0.1"," 19 of 35 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","19","35","0","0"

I know you can get it cheap on sale but unless you are so well off that you can throw money away I would not buy it, Just look at the forum. No activity from either developer or players -- its just dead, You get the feeling that the developer does just enough to meet the obilgations to the publisher (Iceberg) and nothing more. I can't condone a business practice of taking people's money and basicallly doing nothing.","April 24","false","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"
