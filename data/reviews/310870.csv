Wait a second, I can't get anywhere but via a guess.\n\nSo you might say "That's what this game is, you have to listen via the sounds"\n\nThat's the main problem, For a game pretty much 90% dependent on sound, the sound isn't that good. I think of games like Thief: Deadly Shadows and know what surround sound should be like and how good it can be. This game utterly fails with sound, even though good headphones (I'm not talking Beats headphones, I said good headphones.)\n\nAt one point you get a flashback to your farm... My God... The farm...  the amount of invisible barriers in this well lit, non threatening area is ludicrous. At one point I had to get a watering can from the shed, a shed with no door just begging to be entered. No can do, no way in heck you're getting in. Better idea go outside the shed, on the side of the shed where you see a watering can, get close to the wall and left click, left click like you never have before. Boom, I got it, now repeat with a shovel, an axe, and a hoe. And I can even describe the rage inducing harvest gathering, click on the poorly animated wheat until you get it. This game should be called "Rage Quit: Tales of the Anger Managment class."\n\nAt one point I see a enemy... If I had to sneak past or fight, I didn't care, I was just hoping for something fun. Instead you blow out a candle and a quick time event happens, which you don't get to see by the way. I have never seen a more lazy game then this.\n\nOn the short side of pros these are these:\n\nPros:\n\nVoice acting is great\n\nOriginal idea for a game\n\nThe graphics in some areas look pretty good...\n\n\nIn short, this is a game both so full of promise, and yet so full of teribad...

That aside, here's my general run down on the playable pre-"field from hell" part of the game.\n\n-The voice acting is interesting. Well done!\n-Most of the current content is non-interactive (most scenes are set in darkness, with an audio recording of you doing things. Occasionally letters pop up on screen to press, moving to the next recording)\n-The "field" is a nightmare of invisible walls and broken interface. Before this I was intrigued if a bit bored. As far as I can tell, only 10 minutes of the game are playable.\n\nOverall, interesting premise, marred at the moment by horrendous pre-alpha gameplay.","July 26, 2014","false","0.2"," 32 of 42 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","32","42","0","0"

It's not something I usually do, and I always say that a game should be finished before a review is written, but here I am. However, there is a good reason to why I did not finish this which I'll share with you guys.\n\nSo before getting into why I didn't finish it, I would like to talk about the actual game and what I've seen. The intro was good. It had good graphics, and had atmosphere building up. But that's it. It's too dark to see anything, heck I had to turn my brightness to maximum at times. The voice acting was really hard to understand, and there are no subtitles.\n\nAfter that, I got up to the first soldier, and died. This is when I had to quit. The load option did not work, and when I tried to quit the game it gave me a bluescreen. I tried to fix the issues for atleast 10 minutes and then finally noticed to reboot my computer.

There's was a post way back in JULY about a soon-to-be-released "2015 edition", but here we are in the New Year and this doesn't yet resemble a "finished" game in my humble opinion.  Was this the "2015 edition" I just attempted, or are there improvements to come?  No mention whatsoever on the Store page of it still being an Early Access title, so...anyway, let's attempt to review what I've played so far...\n\nThe Tower, from what I have thus far experienced/endured, is an awfully good premise which has been executed...well, I'm obviously tempted to say "rather awfully", but it's not ALL bad.  The idea of having to find one's way through some tunnels with MINIMAL lighting, and mostly sound to guide oneself by, is undeniably genius.  The problem here is...there's nothing "minimal" about it.  Much of the time, we're just talking a black screen with a tiny white cursor dot in the middle of it.  So in other words, unless you're Mr Precision himself with the mouse, you honestly don't even know if you're staring straight at the ceiling or the floor half the time.  And the sounds are...well, I'm not sure they helped ME that much, but I am admittedly the kind of person who needs his ears syringed of wax every so many years, so maybe I just need to visit a doctor sometime.  Or maybe...just maybe...the devs thought of a brilliant way to create a sellable "product" with very little need for, y'know...those things that they call "graphics" (which aren't particularly awesome when you DO seem some daylight, I might add).\n\nSo does this mean that this is yet another "walking simulator"?  Oooooh, GOD no.  We have COMBAT, believe it or not...in the form of pressing "quick-time" keys in aforementioned total blackness and hearing the guard we are allegedly attacking say things like: "Oy, would somebody 'elp me?  Somebody's ATTACKIN' me 'ere...oy, 'e's just punched me in the FACE, so 'e as...is anyone goin' to 'elp me?  Cor blimey!" or words to roughly that effect.  Fortunately the voice acting is fairly reasonable, so one must be grateful for small blessings, and yet...\n\nHonestly, it's hard to even review what it is we have here.  Even if this qualifies as a "game" per se - and not a "con", as some other reviewers on the Store page have posited -  it certainly doesn't appear to be a completed one, or even a semi-polished one.  It's more like a demo with (questionable) promise.  Henceforth I cannot, in all good conscience, give this anything resembling a recommendation, but who knows?  Perhaps one day this game will be: a. complete, and b. rather good.  Even on sale it's a pretty dubious proposition at this point in time...\n\nVerdict: 4/10 (for now, at least).","January 1, 2015","false","0.4"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","19","22","3","0"

I thought it looked really cool so I picked it up for three dollars. At that point, it looked like NM was actually putting out content for this game, and were looking at feedback found on the forum (which was minimal). They put out one major update and added a little chapter, know by many as the laggy garden chapter. That was Aug 21 2012. Then a few months after that I got a messages from Dante asking me if would beta test Polarium, a new game they were working on. I thought it was odd they were not going to work on The Tower, but as I found out Polarium was going to be on Xbox live Arcade. I know that sometimes you have to take funding where you can get it. So I thought maybe after they finish Polarium and get more money they would finish The Tower. Well after testing and sending my feedback on Polarium, everything went quite for a while.\n\nThen out of the blue I saw Dante has posted that there was a Kickstarter (or indigogo, I don't remember) for The Tower. Again I thought this was odd because I thought they would have more funding. I backed this though because I really like this project (granted this was a mistake on my end, not learning from the past). I was following the steam discussions on the game and NM was giving out keys for people to play test it. I said I would love to help (again me being a ♥♥♥♥♥). They sent me a key... and it did not work. So I posted that my key did not work. I didn't hear anything back and didn't see anything more posted from NM. It seemed the game was dead again.\n\nWith this whole Tower issue out of my mind, and me counting the game as a loss (which was a disappointment to me, and still is because the IDEA is great) I saw this private eye game on steam called Sam Glyph: Private Eye! (I'm a sucker for a detective Noir theme). At first Glance it looked interesting, so I scrolled down the page... then I saw it's developer was NM. I took a pass because from what I knew of them, and the posts in the comments it sounded like another unfinished game. I did happened to buy it when it was on sale for a dollar so later. I played it, and again, the idea is interesting, but I was correct, it is just another unfinished game.\n\nAgain I pushed NM out of my mind, and tried to forget them. Then one day I noticed that Dante had posted another crowdfunding project for The Tower (again I can't remember which one). I laughed and told myself I wanted to back this and help the project, but they lost my trust long ago, and it seemed like they were nowhere near reaching their goal. So I brushed this off and went on with my life. Then today I just happen to notice that The Tower was fully released on steam and I had it in my library. I played it, and it was different than the old game. New engine and voice acting and story. The idea seemed to be the game (which I still think is a good idea). The game looks ok and runs better than in the past. Though the game right now, just seems to be walk ten steps and have a dialog part where you do not feel engaged and feel bored about.\n\nSadly as Tryyton says in this review of the game, it seems NM is just trying to scam our money and I have been a sucker more times than I should have. Don't buy this game, don't buy any of NM games, they are just unfinished.\n\nAlso there is this... http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1094973/Musician-barred-selling-soul-eBay.html\n(Also sharing this link in no way condones my support of the DailyMail)","December 11, 2015","false","0.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","0"

Rather than using sounds to navigate the black corridors, I just blindly walk around until I find the right place to go.

So very different than alot of dungeon crawlers yet so very simplistic. I used a very high end headphone setup consisting of a $200+ tube amp, $100+ DAC, and $300+ headphones which makes this game shine greatly. During the dungeon sequences I just closed my eyes and listened to the sounds and when I found my way using the sounds the character even yelled out "oh thank god light" or something to that effect which was delightful because I knew then to open my eyes and continue on with a lighted sequence of events.\n\nThat being said I'm pretty disappointed in how far or rather the lack of how far the developers have got with this game. According to the Steam page this has been a work in progress since 2012?! Really?! I'm not sure if this is a development team of one or two people, but really that would be a mute point as games like Space Engineers have grown leaps and bounds in the last year with a scant development team. The game has alot, and I mean ALOT, of bugs still. I found myself stuck against a physics wall numerous times during the farm sequence that should not have been an issue; for instance when trying to head back to the crops to plant seeds or water if I came to close to the tree next to the crops I would hit said physics wall and would have to back up and take a more sceneic course.\n\nI really like the game and the what you're trying to do with it, but for now I'm going to have to go with a thumbs down for purchase at this time. The game is simply "not where it should be" for how long it has been in development. I'll continue to check in every 6 months or so and hope to right a better review then. As for some points on the other negative review, I found everything to be in place where I thought it should have been with a little bit of calculation, I don't think thats a point of development need. More effort put towards the bugs, gameplay, and getting the story to a solid length I believe would make this game more "complete" for more to purchasae. Crawling through the darkness on the edge of insanity and starvation was most enjoyable(such odd things we gamers find enjoyable).\n\nPS. At one point during the farm sequence I hit a physics wall in front of the shed and when trying to back up and reenter the she I fell out of the world and was left with the following screenshot. I was unable to enter the menu and had to alt+f4 and then reenter the game.

Audio in the game is ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL, the sounds of water trickling from the top of the cave or the sound of stabbing a guard in the head... Amazing.\n. Lack of sight makes you traverse the pitch black caverns entirely by sound, which is very fun and interesting.\n. Very intriguing storyline right off the bat, instantly had me drawn in.\n.

That said it seemed like a half decent idea for a horror game however completely flopped do to the neglect of the developer. This game really wasn't ready for release and should be tagged as an early access title. Leaving a lot to be desired gameplay wise this game shoves you into an unskippable seemingly 3 minute intro of you just hanging into a room before allowing you to move on your own volition on a set straight path with no branching alternatives. No problem there as it is only the first 10 minutes now the problems arises when you get to a man in a cage in a room where you can hardly see anything with a 1 hit kill guard lurking about. The mechanics leave no room for error whilst trying to evade this guard. (I found no way to). So this is essentially where the gameplay ended for me. You die and have to waste another 10-15 minutes meandering back to die again. And with the save function in a state of disrepair you are looking at a CHORE an absolute waste of your time and money.

Not so much the actual gameplay (it's still extremely glitchy, but playable if you have the patience) but the story is interesting and you want to know why he was thrown in the tower and will he ever escape?\n\nThe voice-acting is excellent and the games audio is superb.  Trying to find your way in complete darkness using only your hearing is a welcoming and unique challenge.\n\nThe protagonist guides you through the game as if telling a story, and sometimes takes you back to the "happier times" when he was a free man. (  Only one time in this early stage of the game but i guess we'll be visiting more of these "happier times" to maybe find out how he got in this prison to begin with  ) Where you get to fix things on his nice farm and stuff. (where the games glitches and bugs are most frustrating btw)\n\nIn these 30 minutes of the game there is only one "combatscene" and it was pitch black, you only  listen  to the fight (the grabbing of body parts, snapping of necks etc) as the protagonist explains the action; so you don't actually see the fight happen, but the voiceacting and the atmosphere is so great (even in this early version of the game) that i didn't mind.\n\nThis game has as ton of potentiall but is currently too expensive for only 30 minutes of gameplay so buying the game now for 10 bucks is not worth it in my opinion.

First off, I'd like to thank the team for building and continually adding to this game. It is much appreciated, from Developer to another.\n\nWhilst I didn't play a very long time from time constraints, I would like to point out, that the only "creepy" moments I had was the first hallway (because jumping into the unknown is scary) and every time after that, just the initial creepy effect of going from a lit room to a non-lit room.\n\nBut being in complete darkness with limited sound fx, no music/score, and I'm sure I hit every wall in the dark room at least 6 times, was not fun. I was not creeped out, it had no atmosphere to give a creeped out feeling, and it didn't feel like a "darkness of The Tower" so much as "The Annoying Bumping Into Walls and Pools of Water Tower".\n\nNow, I know, the whole relative point is to run around until you find the torches, which are your save locations. Might I ask, make the ESC key to bring up a menu to quit the game? I just had to quit now to go, and I had to tab out to hurriedly quit. Sure, I lost all the time I bumped around in the annoying darkness, but it's not like I'll miss it anytime soon.\n\n=====\nPros:\nBeautiful graphics\nRuns smooth\nGreat FPS\nThe torches are not cheaply made\nUnity was a good choice\n\n\nCons:\nThe heat simmer from the torches is a little much. It might look like that if a jet fueled engine were next to it: sure\nBumping around in the dark... I guess its the point of the game\nNo Score/Music during the running around to give off a feeling of space and atmosphere\n\n\nThe Pros outway the Cons in The Tower, and so, I will recommend this game.","July 4, 2014","true","0.2"," 7 of 28 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","7","28","0","1"

It has improved so much and I love it! It is a very beautiful game with a lot of things to do and explore. Also the voice acting is excellent, it is some of the best iI have ever heard in a videogame! The story is great and just goes well with it. So I would recomend this game to people who like a gripping story line and and love to explore all that this game has to do! I would give this game a 10/10","July 1, 2014","true","1.5"," 10 of 35 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","10","35","0","2"

Even if u look past the bugs the game has i would still recommend it because the game has so much going for it.It has a great story and u get a good sense of what is happing through the story as it is told of the unfortunate events that has lead him to the tower in the first place.The tunnels as they are described to the player its almost like i am there in the tunnel myself.\nThe DEV'S on here are just great they take notice of what you are saying they reply to you they give updates on whats going on in the game through out the day and as for the content.Well they have said there will be new content each week i think thats great how many of you guys have played a game burnt through the story and was like i can not wait for the next   one abit like a tv series it keeps you wondering what is going to happen next and keeps you one the edge of your seat.For me i kind of like that idea as i like to enjoy my games i like to feel like i am in the story and i feel that this game brings that.\n\nhope this helps you guys\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ-Lbj1wfDXRXNSzcvEVbNQ","July 1, 2014","true","7.0"," 13 of 46 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","13","46","0","7"

TERRIBLE.  Good concept, poorly executed.  You have to make your way through utter darkness with sound as your only clue to guide you.  Unfortunately, you don't even get the sound of your own footsteps to reassure you that you're actually moving and not just continuously walking into a wall.  When the game is trying to instruct you on what to do, it's all in text and you can't do anything during it, just sit and wait.  Then, there are times when the narrator is talking and you can't move on until they've done their whole spiel, even though it only took your about 5 seconds to get to the next area.  Also, there was this long combat sequence about 5 minutes in, also in complete blackness, where you do nothing except occasionally hit a key on the keyboard when requested.  To top it all off, the menu is only accessible at specific points, which means I had to force quit out of this stupid game when I got sick of it.  I'm SO glad I didn't actually spend money on this game.  Quit after 15 minutes.","December 29, 2014","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(Basically: You're a family of traitors...Maaaybe)  Once that happens you'll be stopped from proceeding many times so your character can unnecessary describe what he just did in a poetically long way. It feels like the game wants you to watch it instead of play it.\n\nThen we get to the techinal problems with the game:\n1. The game is too dark. I have my monitor's brightness up all the way and I still had to install a 3rd party software to increase the brightness further to get past the first bit of pure blackness. (And I still couldn't see anything but the cieling.)\n\n2. You have to crouch under so many things that barely graze your head. (The crouch button is C by the way, the game doesn't tell you.)\n\n3. Frequently when you get to a manual save point you can't actually move the cursor to save the game. Alt-tabbing in and out can fix the problem sometimes, but if it doesn't... expect to watch the long intro again.\n\n4. The game isn't optimized well, I had trouble getting the game to stay at 30fps. When you can't see anything due to the darkness, there is no excuse for this.\n\n\nI can sympathize with the devlopers because they ran out of money while making it, but it still no excuse to sell this.","December 5, 2015","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That completely kills the feeling of terror and immersion horror games usually give. And.... no subtitles! The store page says it has subtitles. I couldn't find it anywhere.\n\nThe gameplay is not good especially the level design. I ran into so many invisible walls and had to stop playing completely when I couldn't proceed to anywhere else because of an invisible wall. The controls are mediocre at best.\n\nJust don't buy. Utter garbage.\n\n0 out of 10","June 5","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
