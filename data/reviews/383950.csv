The game contains an incredible number of match 3 boards, getting increasingly more difficult as you proceed in the story. What I really like here is that the boards are not on a grid, instead they take several forms ranging from your basic "ball pit" to free floating boards in space that require strategic dropping to solve them completely.\n\nThe story is forgettable, told by static images. A mermaid has lost treasures which means the world will be destroyed, so she has to solve match 3 puzzles to get them back. Each stage contains 15 boards, and you return a treasure after every 5th board.\n\nThe match 3 puzzles can be solved relatively easily, even the difficult ones, but to get a 3 star rating on each board you do not only need to solve it (1st star), but also solve it before the time limit (2nd star) and also match an additonal challenge for the 3rd star. This is where the difficulty comes in, since it usually requires you to match three specific gems which are scattered across the board before the rest of the board is solved.\n\nThis added complexity of trying to get all three stars is what makes the game fun and challenging, and keeps me returning to it. I've already spent multiple hours trying to perfect the boards, and will probably sink in a lot more in this fun game.\n\nIf you're still not sure what this game is like, think of a cross between Bubble Bobble, Peggle, and a basic match 3 game. Add some relaxing music and cute graphics, and you have League of Mermaids.","December 20, 2015","true","20.5"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","0"

I didn't even play a half-hour before wanting to never see it again.  And yet I'm recommending it.  I'm not recommending it because I enjoyed it, but because it performs exactly as advertised.   It's a physics-based ball-dropping game with a match-3 mechanic -- rather like a combination of Peggle without the pegs, a match-3, and Bubble Bobble.  It's very, VERY casual -- a minute to learn, perhaps two minutes to master -- and will be best for those seeking an undemanding, repetitive time-killer.  Even though I found the gameplay tedious, it does represent a reasonable game concept competently executed, and I won't thumbs-down it just because it's not to my tastes.","October 8, 2015","true","0.4"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

But the actual full title for this is called League of Mermaids: Pearl Saga.\n\nThis is one of the kind match 3 game because of a special feature has implemented into the game. Physics is the special feature in this game. Whenever a match is made the nearby elements is effect by jostling them like a bunch of marbles in a jar.\n\nGame Visuals\nI want to mentioned that the visuals for this game is well done even its simplistic.\n\nGame Audio\nI want to mentioned that the audio for this game is well done even its simplistic and somewhat repetitive.\n\nGameplay\nThere are no game difficulty modes to choose from but each of the game levels has their own difficulty.\n\nThe game has a timer but all the levels still can be completed if the time on the timer has run out.\n\nThe story campaign mode there is total of three chapters with fifteen levels.\n\nThere are three extra chapters with fifteen levels each and they aren't related to the story campaign.\n\nThe zen mode provides untimed endless match 3 levels. Leveling up to the next level requires certain amount of stars. This mode can be seen as a stress reliever.\n\nThe bottomless trench mode. Is to see far the individual player can go until the time on the timer runs out. But there are some bonuses would help with the time and quickly help the individual player to go further.\n\nThe special puzzles mode features similar puzzles from the story campaign mode.\n\nThere are sixteen different achievements. But each of these achievements has certain requirements before they can be unlocked.\n\nMiscellaneous\nMy final thoughts, this match 3 game, is definitely enjoyable to play. I would recommend this game but not at the full price value.","February 19","true","25.0"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","15","16","3","0"

Instead of launching bubble here you allow them to drop into the correct position taking physic into account.\nThe idea is great and it could have been a great puzzle game but it isn't.\n\nWhat happened? You can't aim properly. Plain and simple: You. Can't. Aim.\nThe game does not feature any kind of difficulty it features randomness. I felt like flipping a coin trying to get ten thousands of tails in a row.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/astring/recommended/383950/","astring","every bae is halloween","http://steamcommunity.com/id/astring/","4250 products in account","A pretty creative match-3 wherein the board isn't set to a grid or anything, and the physics of the bubbles becomes the challenge as you go on. Completing the game's entirely doable without ever dealing with that, but the three-star challenges on each stage vary* and are where most of the replay will come in (also turning a few simple stages into hair-pulling nightmares). I only just discovered there's an entire second "story" of stages off to the side, doubling what I thought was already a pretty solid game's length. Without the endless mode, or the zen mode, or...\n\nI highly recommend it for anyone looking for a bit of variety.\n\n* Each stage has three stars: "complete the stage", the second is usually "finish under X time", and the third varies, and might be "match three hearts" (usually a puzzle), "use under X bubbles" (worst thing, hands down), "destroy Y bubbles in a single drop", or others.","October 4, 2015","true","44.4"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"
