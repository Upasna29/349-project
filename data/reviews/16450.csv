"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/16450/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is a first person shooter horror game, developed by Monolith Productions and published by Warner Brothers. The game was released on Steam, PS3 and Xbox 360 in February 2009. This is the second game in the F.E.A.R series.\n\nThe gameplay in F.E.A.R. 2 remains almost identical to the first game. The slow motion bullet time makes a welcome return, and the ever brilliant gun play. The AI has also been improved too, and will now be even cleverer when it comes to taking cover. A nice feature which is new though, is that you can knock over certain objects in the world to create extra cover, such as file cabinets, desks and tables. I also realised whilst playing F.E.A.R. 2, that the original didn't include down the sights aiming, since this is also a new feature here. Probably the best and most prominent feature is the addition of being able to control robot mechs. The moments in F.E.A.R. 2 where you are in control of a huge mean mech blasting through enemies and destroying buildings, is really something special, and is a memory I will carry with me for a while from this game.\n\nOne of the biggest problems I had with the original F.E.A.R game is that I didn't find it very scary. Thankfully F.E.A.R. 2 mends all those wrongs. This is a really scary game and had me jumping out of my seat at times. The game doesn't rely on jump scares to keep you creeped out though, there is genuinely some really scary moments, the eerie atmosphere in some of the levels creeped me out to the max!\n\nGraphically, F.E.A.R. 2 is only slightly better than the original which I found to be a little disappointing given that there is about a five year gap in release dates, but one redeeming factor here is, that the game can be played on various resolutions, going up to at least 4K so you can still churn out some decent looking moments.  I also cannot fault F.E.A.R. 2 in the audio department though, all of the characters are voice acted, sound effects are well made too - I enjoyed the moments of listening to the enemy radio chatter as well.\n\nF.E.A.R. 2 is by no means difficult, I played on medium and the only times I died was when I did something stupid, like jumping off the edge of a building by accident. FPS veterans should really be playing the game on hard mode right from the get go to avoid the game play becoming stale and repetitive.\n\nThroughout the game's seven chapters, each level has plenty of collectable items to find which will flesh out the plot and back story even more, it is well worth heading down a corridor which is off the main path just to get these little snippets of information as some of the information you get is really quite interesting if you are a fan of the F.E.A.R series thus far. On the topic of level design, F.E.A.R. 2 uses the same sort of concept as the original in that you can be roaming around a building for a good amount of time before you finally realize the way you are supposed to be going. The addition of some sort of map would have made this type of problem become minimal but it does add to the suspense as you don’t know what is around every corner!\n\nI finished F.E.A.R. 2 on medium difficulty in just under five hours. I felt rather disappointed to be fair; I was expecting a play through to last at least as much as the first. I may try playing through again on the harder difficulty but that is the only replay ability the game has with its completely linear level design and story.\n\nMuch like the first game too, I also had a small technical problem with the game's auto save function. This seems to happen at key moments in the game, but you will also notice a sudden frame drop, meaning you lose the immersion slightly and it just feels really janky. I am not sure whether it is an issue with the engine but like I said, I had the same problem with the first game so it may be a common issue with the series thus far. Apart from that, I only encountered one more problem, in that on one of the latter levels, the ground suddenly became see through, this was easily resolved by a quick relaunch, but I did end up losing a bit of progress on the stage since I must of not reached the next checkpoint which was rather annoying.\n\nF.E.A.R. 2 is really just an OK game. I would still class the first game to be a better game though, even though the horror aspects of 2 are a whole lot better. The shortness of the story is a real draw back and the lack of any proper replay ability means you should really be looking to get F.E.A.R. 2 when on sale for less than £5.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

This is the first game in a long while that I've wanted to play and finish because it was just that good. It also didn't matter that I hadn't played the first in the series and I wasn't left confused by parts of the story because you had to have played the first one to understand.

Game also makes good use of lighting\n\n+ Game has a variety of weapons and grenades. Certain weapons are very creative while others are what you would expect in a FPS\n\n+ The game has really solid level design. In addition, the game takes place over a series of different environments and locations. One of my biggest complaints in the first FEAR was that the environments were too similar and felt repetitive so it's nice to see this was fixed in the sequel.\n\n+The shooting mechanics feel good, going into slow-mo and shooting enemies is always fun.  The game also introduces sections where you ride a mech to change up the gameplay.\n\nThe Average:\n\nThe AI feels average compared to the first FEAR. The first game was renowned for its amazing AI and to this day I still think it sets the standard for AI in a FPS game. This game though doesn't seem to have that.  The AI is not bad by any means, however compared to the first game it doesn't feel close.\n\nThe horror elements are not as a good as the first game. Between finding a balance between action and horror the developers chose action.  There are certainly plenty of times the game tries to invoke scares but sometimes it just comes across as flat.\n\nOne of the most satisfying weapons in any FPS game was the shotgun from the first game. In this game, the shotgun doesn't even feel close to satisfying.\n\nI found the game to be very easy even on the normal setting, play on hard if you want a challenge.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- The dialogue in this game is terrible. It makes the story feel like a straight to home video release. It becomes difficult to take the story seriously or be afraid of what's around the corner when the characters are saying things that just make you shake your head.\n\n-The game has a certain flow to it but the entire ending gameplay segment feels frustrating and out of place.\n\n-Multiplayer is dead\n\nConclusion\n\nOn the one hand this game does things a lot better than the first, on the other hand it also doesn't seem to improve any of the flaws and in some cases makes it worse. What could have been a really great horror FPS game turns into you standard run of the mill FPS game.  For a FPS game it is very solid and should provide you with a 5-6 hours of fun.\n","November 2, 2014","true","5.3"," 40 of 46 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","40","46","0","1"

It is the direct sequel to F.E.A.R and besides of the two add-ons from F.E.A.R the second main game in the series. F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is available for Windows, Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.\n\nThe plot revolves around Alma, a supernatural being with powerful psychic skills, who wants to destroy those who experimented with her. The player jumps into the role of Michael Becket, a Delta Force operator who is sent to take Madame Aristide into the so-called protective custody just before the end events from the previous game happen. Alma tries to exchange the reality with that of hers, so Becket and his squad need to hinder and destroy her. A race against time begins and nothing is like it seems at the beginning. To fully understand and follow the complete plot it is necessary to play through F.E.A.R. 1. The add-ons can be skipped.\n\nGenerally speaking of the gameplay, the main elements were taken over from the original. This includes the now improved martial arts, vaulting over objects, slow-motion, improvable health and reflex time, as well as an enhanced A.I. The possibility to aim down sights is now added, which was in F.E.A.R 1 only limited to a general zoom by raising up the weapon a bit. New weapons, such as a sniper rifle, rocket launcher, lasergun and more found their way into the game, while the pistol, shotgun and new grenades got an overall more futuristic look. F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin introduces the player also to an ridable vehicle called "Armored Suit". This suit regenerates itself over time, has a primary and secondary weapon and is accessable twice in the game.\nSurprisingly though, leaning to left and right is now removed, for which now the character is able to flip over different objects to hide behind it. This is already known from the A.I. in F.E.A.R 1 and fairly well executed. Speaking of which: The A.I. is still as smart as in the predecessor. In groups they try to flank the character, search for cover behind walls and pillars as well as flip over objects to create the same cover as the player. From time to time they suffer from minor problems like rushing into the spread of fire from the player but are over all very challenging, especially at higher difficulty.\nOne negative aspect is the missing option to save manually in a game. In fact, F.E.A.R 2: Project Origin has a lot of fair placed checkpoints and the option to select a mission at the main menu but the possibility to save at any time is a huge factor in modern games for some to play through a game. Also, the character is now only able to carry around 3 medkits at once, a huge cut down compared to F.E.A.R 1's possibility to carry 10 medkits at once.\n\nGraphically, F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is not a huge difference to F.E.A.R 1, caused from the same engine both games are running on. Yet. through LithTech: Jupiter EX[web.archive.org] with a modified Havok Physics engine, the game uses two different mappings. The normal and parallax mapping, which give textures a little more realistic appearance and depth to e.g. bullet holes on the walls. Complex lighting effects were possible through a volumetric lighting plus pixel and high-level shaders, which are highly used in the second game. Different to the previous game are also destroyable surroundings, such as pillars and doors with the help of explosive barrels nearby.\nAlso, the HUD changed and appears like the player would look through special vision glasses from the character. Sadly, there is no option to turn it off or change it but does not interupt the atmosphere once the player is used to it.\n\nSoundwise the game scores with clean and thrilling soundeffects and music. A whisper here, a noticeable moaning in the dark corners there, Alma's speech and some objects falling down the ground behind the character let the hair stand on end and give the already strong atmosphere in some rooms the last polish.\n\nTo cover everything up: F.E.A.R. 2: Project glares with the same strong elements as F.E.A.R 1 did before. The A.I. gives the game the challenge it deserves and adds a lot of action to it, but never feels like it is too action-packed. At times Alma visits the party to drive terror in the heart of the player and refreshes the already deep atmosphere from this game. The story could be a bit deeper but for this, a third follow-up is awaiting the player.\n\nAbsolutely worth the buy for fans from the F.E.A.R series.\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ RÉSUMÉ]▬▬▬▬●\nWhile reading a lot of negative comments for F.E.A.R 2: Project Origin, I was a bit worried at first when I started the game. There was the talk of missing scare-moments, lack of story and way too action-packed compared to F.E.A.R 1. Now, after finishing both games I can't really say that F.E.A.R 2 has so much more action and even less thrilling moments. The contrary is the case here, caused from the deep atmosphere and even greater thrilling moments in the game thanks to the even oftener appearing from Alma and her friends. F.E.A.R 1 was, if I think about it again, also very action-packed and not a huge differents to the follow-up. The story was not the deepest I've ever seen, but stood strong while going through the game. I have to mention that I've played through it in one go, what is very unusual for me.\n\nIn my opinion, Monolith Production did nearly everything right with the follow-up and is absolutely worth the current price tag. For around 15$/€ the player gets 6 hours of action, thrill and an stunningly disturbing end that turns everything you know upside down.\n\nHighly recommended!\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ TL;DR]▬▬▬▬●\n[✔] Main gameplay-elements were taken over from previouse game\n[✔] Improved moves, such as prober vaulting over objects, meele etc.\n[✔] Added 'Aim Down Sights' and flip over objects to cover\n[✔] Enhanced A.I. that acts smart\n[✔] New weapons and one ridable vehicle\n[✔] Overall improved graphics and great sounds\n\n[✖] Missing option to save at any time\n[✖] Only able to carry 3 medi-kits at once\n[✖] Lack of deeper story\n[✖] Some moves are removed, such as leaning right and left and slow walk\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ MEDIA]▬▬▬▬▬●\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dowQX4Y9ZoQ\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=653564338\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you liked this review and want to see more from me, give this review a thumbs up!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/csabber3/recommended/16450/","csabber3","Green Lantern","http://steamcommunity.com/id/csabber3/","174 products in account","Project Origin is a direct follow up to the original game released in 2005. It took Monolith 4 years to cook up a sequel and they decided not to change much on the formula that has worked once. But 4 years is a long time and sometimes innovation is better than playing it safe. That's exactly why Project Origin falls short of its predecessor. The formula remained the same, but the audience has changed.\n\nThe game picks up right the time when the first games is about to end. To be precise, it starts a couple of minutes before the end of F.E.A.R. You are a part of Delta Squad and you're sent to place the head of Armacham Technology Corporation into protective custody. It's when sh*t starts to get serious and a nuclear blast bakes most of the city as a result of the original F.E.A.R. team's endgame. In the rest of the game you move in and out of underground facilities trying to achieve your ultimate goal. Even though the campaign lasts only around 7 hours the story is detailed and interesting. On the other side, you have to pay attention to every detail that happens around you or told to you on the comm because if not you'll find yourself lost in the web organisations and projects thrown at you in every couple of hours. At least if you do get lost eventually right before the end of the game everything will be cleared up in 5 short minutes.\n\nThe gameplay is very similar to the first game. Little has changed; slow-mo shooting is still great but the novelty has faded in the past four years. You will meet various enemies during your gameplay starting from soldiers, genetically modified monsters, mechs to ghosts even. The game will always try to throw something new at you which is nice, but eventually you'll immediately recognize the spacey room where a firefight is going to take place in 3...2...1.\n\nAI was a strong part of the first game and it returns in the second one too. However, it doesn't always work like it meant to be. Sometimes the enemies will be clever enough to kick over tables and take covers, but in other cases they will try to rush you through the same door where you'll stand and shoot them one by one. The Delta Squad, your mates aren't the most brightest either. Most of the times you'll see them splitting up and getting killed (because of the story) and the writers could've written better lines for the voice actors too. Being a psychological game you'll never feel surprised of your team members being killed off. What is worse you'll never feel pity for them because they're unlikable, two-dimensional dolls.\n\nVisually F.E.A.R. 2 is a real mystery. On one hand it presents a great world with some stunning lighting effects and great destructibility, on the other hand it's ugly. Everything looks sharp when you move, but stop for a moment a take closer look at minor objects, like consoles or books on desks. They look downresd, blurry and pixelated. The devil is in the details as they say. In the year when hardware pushing games like Modern Warfare 2, Resident Evil 5 or Killzone 2 were put on the shelves of retailers this kind of laziness is disappointing. One can look aside when it comes to these problems, but then there is the audio. The sounds of guns are just atrocious; every one of them sounds like they were taken out from an 80s Atari 7800 game. Every shot you have to take with the shotgun or machine gun irritates your ears. It's like firing with toy guns from the crappiest Chinese manufacturer.\n\nF.E.A.R. is a decent shooter with its flaws and assets. The formula that made the first game great has aged greatly and the horror factor is M.I.A. in most of the game. Great number of "tricks" has already been used up in the previous title or other games. When the horror is present the game feels like a real successor of the prequel, but those moments sadly end quickly. It definitely has its moments when it comes to shooting (the mech scenes are great), but drawbacks won't allow to have an experience like with the original F.E.A.R. game.\n\nRating: 68/100; Replay Value: 2/5; To Beat: 7 hours; Played on: normal.","November 30, 2013","true","6.4"," 30 of 35 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","30","35","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197980884019/recommended/16450/","76561197980884019","Cpt. Thought Process","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197980884019/","354 products in account","Primary from a cinematic standpoint in 2005, F.E.A.R. was an essentially innovative and distinctly competent modern shooter which elevated the genre and was reasonably enough considered the spiritual follow-up of pioneering Half-Life. Despite overall skills and significance in presentation and gameplay, the indisputable lack of variation in environments and fairly dull level design left a significant mark of an overrated first-person-shooter ovation. In response to certain issues, developer Monolith diligently implements a couple of noticeable changes in the inevitable sequel, however, not only are former flaws repaired, other flaws take shape while some are accelerated. All things considered, F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is still a skilful and spectacular first-person-sequel, operating within competent mechanics without the elevating relevance of the predecessor.\n\nThe first-rate atmosphere associated with the intense original unfortunately appears weaken as the objective of a Delta Force member (that would be you) united with squad mates is about to capture the unapproachable president of the suspicious Armacham Corporation that is currently being observed. However, as the objective backfires due to the nuclear incident previously witnessed by the original protagonist, mysterious events involving iconic Alma and Project Origin (hence the title) require some serious unravelling.\n\nAlthough original F.E.A.R. was hectic and spectacular enough in action, this beautifully keen and further expensive sequel boosts up the pace of dynamic visuals and sound more efficiently. While combat certainly is improved, the original game’s innovated bullet time appears further enhanced; as explosions of gunfire and grenades create additionally impressive visual and audio distortions, the masterly conveyed reflex time adds gruesome levels of bloody violence and enjoyable death animations. The superb audio direction continues the frame of reference mode and the excellent soundtrack provide the proper mood of excitement. The strength of the sly artificial intelligence seems preserved as well, offering plenty of unpredictability and enough challenges to evoke your alertness. As before, apart from the occasional change for the worse, enemies more consistently than not continue to response to your presence by flanking, covering and communicating with one another. Your weapons to encounter these opponents remain efficient and versatile, though with the exception of adding a couple of useful new models, the previous arsenal is fairly enough unaltered. A couple of armoured-suit sequences in which you enter a giant metal robot armed with machine-gun and rockets, similar to ED-209 in Robocop, have been added to bring some needful variety in chaos and destruction.\n\nUnfortunately unlike F.E.A.R., the story and atmosphere in the sequel is not as intriguing and dense as the up to date components of action, graphics and sound. Apart from an overall decent tension and a certain memorable elementary level, engaging narrative and dramatic devices is hardly founded, despite solid voice-over and half decent dialogue. A great number of readable items attached to the events taking place can be picked up and TV news reports can be seen, but there is rarely a penetrating moment that touches commitment and the unfolding of the story is distractingly abstruse. The occurrence of predictable jump-scares and basic clichéd creepiness has accelerated and become a bit tiring, but some of the attempts are at least decent enough to startle.\n\nRegardless of changes made to address certain issues of the acclaimed yet overrated predecessor, the final outcome of the sequel ironically still suffers from issues. As overall aspects of F.E.A.R. are reasonably kept intact, some elements are obviously improved while others unfortunately are impaired. The criticism of repetitive environments receive attention in variation and that mediocre level design is put to an end, however, exterior surroundings turn out to be quite illusory, reaching the silly corridor formula rather than opening things up. Furthermore, the strikingly tight atmosphere from the original is compromised since the pace of the action is picked up even further and the horror perspective is considerably downgraded into sporadic eerie pieces. Nevertheless, Monolith ambitiously creates a skilfully competent, partly enhanced follow-up that in most parts deliver a solid shooter without the essentials.\n\n7, 5 / 10","July 1, 2014","true","44.2"," 32 of 39 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","32","39","0","3"

At least for the most part.\n\n\nThe Pro's:\n\n-The graphics are quite good (player models, environments, etc), even by today's standards.\n\n-Similarly, lighting and shadows are similarly fantastic.\n\n-The voice acting is quite good as well. Notable actors such as Jen Taylor (Halo Series), Phil LaMarr (Halo, Metal Gear Solid Series) and John Patrick Lowrie (Half Life 2, Team Fortress 2) make an appearance in this game.\n\n-While I see that some disagree, I quite liked the story, and thought it elaborated more on Alma and the Armacham Corporation's backstories and helped make me more sympathetic towards Alma.\n\n-I also thought the environments were a bit more varied than the first, although there are still a couple cut and paste corridors now and then.\n\n-The physics and game engine are quite good, and you don't need top of the line specs to run a good looking game like this.\n\n-Several improvements were added (IMO) such as ADS, Sprinting, moveable cover, destructable environments (kind of), and more.\n\n-Sound effects (except for a couple weapons) and overall audio are top notch, easily some of the best I've heard in a game.\n\n-The sense of tension from the first game is still there, albeit toned down a little bit.\n\n-The Elementary School level 'nuff said.\n\n-Also unlike some, I enjoyed the ending, even if it was a bit WTF? at first.\n\n-There's also an awesome  mech suit portion , even if it is a little out of place in a "Horror" game.\n\n-There's a lot more, but those are the major things.\n\n\nThe Con's:\n\n-The game isn't as scary as the first, while I wouldn't call any of the F.E.A.R.'s genuinely horrifying (I'm pretty hard to scare however, not true for some people) the game often made noises, or flickered my HUD and either did nothing with it, or focused the scare somewhere where the player's attention wasn't designed to be focused.\n\n-Some of the gun's lacked the "Oomph" they had in the first game, particulary the Shotgun and the Sniper Rifle (The latter wasn't in the first game). I quite enjoyed the feel of the shotgun in the first F.E.A.R, the one in F.E.A.R. 2 though feels and sounds particularly lackluster. Grenades also lack that "Bam, Pow!" sound when they explode, even if the explosion looks cool.\n\n-The game is easier than the first one, which is caused by several things. On Moderate difficulty (a.k.a Normal) I often found myself just walking out and shooting enemies using Slow-Mo without even touching any sort of cover, something that you couldn't get away with nearly as much in the first game. Slow-Mo also lasts longer than the first game, at some points later in the game (after collecting reflex boosters) I could finish entire firefights in one use of Slow-Mo. I also didn't die very much, something I can't say from the last game either. Also, enemies aren't quite the bullet sponges they were in the first game (not a bad thing IMO), but this makes for firefights being a LOT easier, even with lots of enemies.\n\n-The game is also shorter than the last one, the last one took me around 8-9 hours to beat, this one only about 7.\n\n-The Enemy A.I. has definitely been tuned down from the first game, it's not awful, but many enemies will run out of cover, or rush you for no reason, which is a big change from how they acted in the first game. I've also watched A.I. blow themselves up with grenades and just not run away from them in general (Although this was rare.)\n\nPersonal Cons (less important stuff and silly nitpicking, but maybe these things bug you as well):\n\n-  Paxton Fettel  isn't in the MAIN game aside from being mentioned in documents. (I know he is in the DLC. But I liked him quite a bit in F.E.A.R  1)\n\n-They took out the option to lean in and out of cover.\n\n-The game has a more CoD/ modern shooter feel, rather than it's more unique first game feel.\n\n-Speaking of which, this game added QTE's, there's not a crazy amount and their done with a decent amount of taste, but I still think they were unnecessary.\n\n-The default controls are really odd, Shift to aim, right mouse to melee, V for thermal vision (which you use only once or twice in the whole game AND it's not necessary) the first game had similarly wonky controls, but it's still an odd thing to not change with a sequel. However, the controls are easily rebindable.\n\n-The film grain visual option is on by default, it adds a nice atmosphere to the look of the game, but after a while began to give me a headache when combined with the motion blur, so I turned the film grain off.\n\n-There's a turret section, two of them to be exact.\n\n-All  Armacham and Replica Soldiers  look pretty much the same, aside from the visual differences based on the "type" of enemy. They also don't sound as badass as they did in the first game. Hearing a Replica soldier yell "Flashlight!" in a gruff voice was kinda awesome.\n\n-The game also uses the horror game trope of somehow magically seperating you from your squadmates, and the FPS trope of having the environment become destroyed to become a perfect pathway to get somewhere.\n\n-For such a good looking game, most of the skyboxes in this game look pretty bad and you can even see that the skyboxes go under the level in some places.\n\n-You are also a stereotypical mute protagonist, which makes for a couple of odd "conversations" with your squadmates.\n\n\nNow, I don't usually give a number score with my reviews, (be it Steam or elsewhere), but I feel it's necessary with this one. Why? Because despite me having seemingly more gripes than likes about this game, I don't want you to feel that impression.\n\nI like this game quite a bit, almost as much as the first game, and would highly recommend you buy it. $14.99 is pretty good price to pay, or about 9.18 Quid/British Pounds. It's a good shooter overall, and a pretty decent horror game besides that, which makes for an pretty good game all around.\n\nFinally, for the magic number, I'd give it an 8.5/10.","September 24, 2014","true","7.7"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","26","29","0","2"

Monolith kept all the core elements of the original game (slow-motion ability) and they added some extra features, as well: occasionally you can jump into a huge mech and literally destroy everything in your path. These are great scenes - they are uplifting and bring some extra action the original game lacked. I know it is a psychological horror in essence, but there's nothing wrong with upping the action if you already have the slo-mo making combat fun.\n\nThe player can now push objects, e.g. you can now turn over tables and hide behind them. I think fast reflexes serve you better so I did not really care about the cover-based approach, at all. Overall, the game looks and runs better than the original and it uses more vivid colours - the psychological aspect they could still keep without having to apply too many dark colours and shadows. There are more enemy types, more supernatural encounters and - in my opinion - a more interesting story.\n\nInstead of Point Man you now take control over a member from a delta squad which is tasked to protect the president of Armacham. The first level takes place just before the ending of FEAR so you can see the explosion from a distance and then go through the city only to see the devastation caused by Alma. There are some interesting findings and many collectibles that further explain the background of the Origin project so I'm not spoiling anything further here.\n\nThe game wasn't exactly praised much upon its release. A lot of people from media considered it just an average shooter, a shooter that can easily be forgotten. I disagree with this - I believe FEAR 2 is a very good sequel and great care and attention was put into the making of it. I suggest you buy it and skip its awfully short DLC content.","March 14, 2014","true","40.0"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","25","28","0","0"

F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin follows a whole new cast of characters as they navigate through the ruined city of Auburn to stop Alma. You play as Sergeant Becket, a regular old military man who was sent in to rescue Genevieve Aristide, but unwillingly gets mixed up in a plan that involves cleaning up what remains of Armacham and Alma herself.\n\nF.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin takes the great gameplay from F.E.A.R 1 and improves on it. There are more guns to use, more grenades to throw, you can now flip objects to make cover, and they fixed the melee system so you can't speedrun by kicking everyone in the knee. My biggest complaint is that the Intel you collect is no longer in audio form, but written out. It's not really a big deal but I don't want to have to stop the game and read what is going on.\n\nF.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is only as scary as you make it, literally. The game relies a lot on events that are triggered by the player rather than being scripted. While this sounds great in theory, you can miss a whole bunch of stuff if you don't take the time to explore. The biggest fault with the horror is that sometimes Alma jumps out at you and you fight her off... with a quicktime event. The game itself runs some tropes with a hospital and a subway setting, but surprisingly avoids the little ghost girl trope by making Alma older.\n\nIt's not quite as good as F.E.A.R 1, but F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is definitely worth playing and is worthy to be called a sequel to F.E.A.R","September 19, 2014","true","17.3"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"

You can't lean or quicksave anymore, and the AI is notably worse (though still better than your typical FPS grunt), which isn't helped by the fact that the more confined level design generally doesn't give the enemies as much of an opportunity to show off their intelligence. It makes up for the losses by having generally smoother gameplay, better variety, and an increase of the weapon limit from 3 to 4, though, and remains at least about as much fun as the original game, if not maybe more fun.\n\nWhile FEAR 1 had two relatively lengthy expansions that added new enemies and weapons in their campaigns, FEAR 2 just has one DLC, Reborn, and while the main game is definitely worth getting, the DLC, which now costs nearly as much as the base game itself, is not. It basically just condenses a lot of the enemies and gameplay mechanics of FEAR 2 into a roughly 40 minute campaign, so if you just really liked FEAR 2 and want a quick encore of it then it might be worth picking up in a sale for a dollar or two, but it doesn't really continue the story or follow up on the base game's pretty bizarre ending in any relevant way except for explaining why a character shows up in FEAR 3 so if you don't plan on playing that you're probably better off just skipping it entirely.","July 16, 2015","true","10.0"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","20","25","2","2"

The first F.E.A.R. was so amazingly well-balanced and fun that I wasn’t sure if I was gonna like the sequel. Turned out I worried about nothing because the game was even better than the first one. They kept the stuff that made it fun and improved everything! The graphics looked super good, the atmosphere was fantastic, the weapons were fun, minibosses awesome, the mech parts glorious, and the shooting as addictive as ever. I loved the fact that they switched the levels around a little bit to make it more interesting. Like I mentioned, at one part you’re in a mech, another you’re traveling in an underground cargo platform 100 miles per hour shooting enemies jumping on from all sides. It’s really fun. Even though the atmosphere is a lot better than in the last game it still feels a bit cheesy and it’s hard to get drilled into the narrative. Also, you feel really detached to the main character which doesn’t help when you’re trying to get invested in the game.

That generally has a solid story line and to be expected in a game about the paranormal plenty of gore & jump scares. THESE ARE NOT BAD THINGS!\n\nF.E.A.R had you playing in the shoes of an unknown solider for the "First Encounter Assault Recon Team" or F.E.A.R for short, you went in and you were tasked to capture a test subject who was designed to control these "Super Soldiers" for a war. The project was a success except things went wrong & the leader went nutso & so you're here to clean up the mess.\n\nThe Review\nF.E.A.R 2 has you playing the role of a new solider named "Micheal Becket for the "First Encounter Assault Recon" who is in another squad & is deployed just before Harlan Wade released Alma in the first game, you were tasked to find & capture a doctor who was working on the test subject & then you are to eliminate the test subject & attempt to shut down project Origin by eliminate the main "Ghost" who was causing all the mayhem around the city, unfortunatly things don't pan out so well & then ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan & of course once more you're trying to battle your way out of the storm.\n\nF.E.A.R 2 starts off right before you're deployed into the field, the first conversation from your squad fills you in on the parts you may have missed or if you didn't play the first installment fills you in on what has been happening for the first team. From here you're given a good understanding of your team & then you're plopped into the game and off to start your adventure.\n\nF.E.A.R 2 focuses on it's story more than F.E.A.R 1 did & it adds even more into it's "creepy atmosphere" by giving you a lot more of the Ghosts you knew and loved in the first game, it also adds more fluent combat in the game by making combat seem more stable and flow well, unlike in F.E.A.R 1 where combat felt kind of chunky.\n\nF.E.A.R 2 also saw a huge improvement in the Graphics department with a better engine, more impressive textures & even better shadows than F.E.A.R 1. (That game had some very impressive Textures & Shadows & even games today (2014) have trouble matching.)\n\nThe Gameplay in F.E.A.R 2: Project Origin is based more on exploring & reading the many stewn about conversations & lab notes dotted throughout each map filling you in on the story & what has been happening with the Origin Project with a hint of action and a lot of Ghosts to spice things up from time to time. Expect nothing much different here as there was in F.E.A.R 1 where you were fighting Mercinaries, Super Soldiers & the occasional Mech, except this time you won't always be fighting on your own 2 feet, sometimes you get some help from your own Mechs.\n\nThe Verdict:\n\nWhile F.E.A.R 2 is very impressive & most certainly improves on every aspect of the first F.E.A.R it's not what i could call better if anything F.E.A.R 1 & F.E.A.R 2 are very much at the exact same level as each other and it's hard to recommend either of them over the other, you really need to get both of them.\n\nF.E.A.R 2 brings you better graphics, more fluent combat & more creepy ghostly moments than F.E.A.R 1 but it doesn't beat the initial feeling that F.E.A.R 1 brought to the gaming world, where it added the ability to carry a gun during moments of intense action & still managed to make you be ♥♥♥♥ scared of an unknown presence waiting to tear your face off.\n\nF.E.A.R 2 also brought you an expanded version of the first F.E.A.R's story & made it's self well preserved in the sequal.\n\nThe Rating:\n\nMy final rating for F.E.A.R 2: Project Origin is a 7/10\n\nF.E.A.R 2: Project Origin brings you everything i said above, improved graphics, more scares & better gun play but it also feels somewhat lacking of what F.E.A.R 1 brought us. It could just be me feeling nastalgic about F.E.A.R because it was nothing short of another DOOM 3 experience when i was younger.\n\nAnd now i ask myself the question.\n\nDo I Recommend This Game?:\nMy recommendation is most certainly a YES, this game deserves a playthrough at least once just because it's a good game & it expands on F.E.A.R 1's design flawlessly.\n\nBuy this & F.E.A.R 1 if you're able to and you'll most certainly have an enjoyable experience.\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nCheck out my Review on F.E.A.R 3: http://steamcommunity.com/id/Paddles01/recommended/21100/","May 17, 2014","true","5.1"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

Unsurprisingly these are not the complete list of games produced by Monolith however I'm highlighting the fact that their sequels are normally better than the first. FEAR was a huge blockbuster that captivated many players to the world of the unknown; things that goes 'bump in the night' for which a famous icon of 'who's afraid of a little girl' was born. Given the proven past performance, it will be a daunting task to see if FEAR 2 supersedes FEAR in action, storyline and able to stand on its own two feet.\n\nSo the choice here is that whether you prefer all-out combat and uncanny AI (a.k.a. FEAR) or a decent story (a.k.a. FEAR 2) yet the irony is that to truly respect FEAR 2 is to play FEAR first (like seeing Star Wars before The Empire Strikes Back). As a standalone FEAR 2 certainly brought dashes of horror and tries to break the 'story' barrier of introducing a new squad but it's not at all a replacement. Play it for what its worth however bare in mind that FEAR 2 is part two of the story hence really couldn't stand on its own two feet if viewed independently.\n\n(full review here: http://www.gamespot.com/f-e-a-r-2-project-origin/user-reviews/2200-466600/)\n\n7.9 / 10","August 6, 2014","true","24.2"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","2"

Its a shooter, its kind of cookie cutter but a kind of weird shaped one that is sort of intriguing so you play with it a bit.\n\nThis game continues the story from one but it doesn't really add much to me. Its sort of blasé. I didn't find myself engaged with it really at all. The horror elements are also lackluster. I don't recall a single moment where I felt much tension. In fact there was an area clearly designed to be scary in which the lights flashed on and off while apparitions bombarded the room only occasionally doing damage. In this cacophony of confusion I was not frightened, nor did I feel tension. The enemies had become a nuisance and I was unable to easily distinguish a path let alone the correct one.\n\nAs far as hallway shooters go.. its fine. The guns feel good. People die. Slow motion will always be awesome. There are more modern touches for this game than the first with iron sights. However older elements like leaning have been removed.\n\nTHE GIST\nAs a game on its face. Its still very fun. Shooting people in slow motion will be a staple of action games forever. But as a whole I feel very “meh” regarding the whole game. Especially in comparison to one.\n\nThis section isn't really part of the review per se, It's more of a rant\nI feel like this game has suffered the proverbial “consolization” process. I feel as though it has lost its soul. As in the developers had their original vision in F.E.A.R. 1 made the game they wanted and are now forced to take that vision and pull on and stretch it to create more content. I feel very strongly about Crysis 1 compared to Crysis 2 and the reason I bring this up is that I feel the same thing has happened here. Both sequels took away what made the original games so unique in exchange for a standard cookie cutter hallway shooter.\n\nAnd I get it. From a business standpoint no one is ever going to say throw away what makes a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of money for something more creative and unique. Unless the formula really has gotten stale and a new IP actually is the better risk assessment for staying in business. I understand that businesses need to make a profit in order to take risks.\n\nAt the end of the day I still recommend this game because it is fun. Its mindless and I hate to repeat myself but shooting people in the face in slow motion is really fun. There are also some mech and turret sequences with some really ironic music playing in the background that are sort of qwerky in an endearing way.\n\nIt just feels a little soulless.","May 4","true","6.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","1"

Excellent combat and gore added to this game, i think the gore even tops the first game!\n2. The campaign length was fairly decent and even managed to overtake the original game in length! (6-8 hours.) Whereas the first one could be clocked in 4-5 hours.\n3.

The game pieces together the characters only mentioned from the original game very well, well enough for you to have a clear understanding of where they slot in the story!\n\nCons\n1.

Later I was able to piece it together:  Both are about adrenaline flow, but only one actively tries to scare you.\n\nI bring this up because it's exactly what acts as a parallel between the original FEAR entries (all three of them) and FEAR 2 Project Origin (and the Reborn DLC).  The original FEAR entries were intense games of cat-and-mouse, skulking about in the shadows hoping enemies with flashlights or automated turrets don't spot you, occasionally broken up by moments of first-person perspective horror more akin to Silent Hill than anything.  FEAR 2 drops this almost entirely - it has only a little bit of the surreal horror, and even that is played more as climactic narrative elements rather than memorable filler.  Each one of these scenes tells you something about the story, and as such they're less throw-away, but because of this, they don't scare you as much as they did before.  It's no longer a horror - it's now a thriller.\n\nBut having said that, FEAR 2 is a pretty outstanding thriller.  There are moments of genuine tension (like when some troops are resurrected around you in small groups), but by and large, it's an action game with a greater emphasis on intensity.  The atmosphere is solid, the gunplay is less "fun" than in most FPS titles, and the horror thematic elements allow the missions to take an almost random turn at any point, sometimes outright breaking reality, and this keeps you on your toes.  The campaign is also rather lengthy, with an absolutely AMAZING ending sequence, so all in all I most certainly recommend this game.\n\nOn a side note, the Reborn DLC is an excellent 90-minute or so secondary campaign that actually expands the story considerably in interesting ways.  Yes - it's DLC that ACTUALLY MATTERS to the future of the story.  For that alone, as well as the fact that it's just as fun as the rest of the game, I recommend getting the Reborn DLC if you can as well.","December 30, 2014","true","29.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","0"

Game is plain simple, advance to next level taking down enemies and that's pretty much about it but you have nice weapons, different type of bad people along the way - not only soldiers but visions and monsters/creepy creatures. The setting is dark and there's plenty of blood, gore; visual effects are very well done too, vivid colors and spark lights contrast the black surroundings.\n\nGameplay gets entertaining from the beginning to the end because there are many cutscenes, the story is well told and developed: you could say this is a "complete" FPS which doesn't go down in any aspect - it may not be a masterpiece but I think it's worth playing, especially "if you already had F.E.A.R." :)","January 31","true","11.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

The combat is vastly improved and more fun than ever, but the horror element are not as effective as it was originally. The graphics have been buffed up significantly since the series debut, with better lighting effects, a deeper color palette, and some cool ghostly visual effects. However, the new engine the game uses seems to strongly favor a console design which is apparant through the enlarged UI, unnecessary quick-time events, and other additions to the gameplay design.\n\nSo let's get right into it, what makes FEAR 2's gameplay so different? For one, level design has been changed dramatically. In the original FEAR, levels were sporadic hallways that twisted around in an endless maze of confusing warehouse and office building design. Thankfully, FEAR 2 has more believable environments with larger outdoor areas that feature plenty of cover to play with the weapons you want. The game allows you to carry an additional weapon, now maxing out at 4 but reduces the amount of healthkits you are allowed to carry from 10 down to a measly 3. This never really bothered me though, I played straight through the game and probably died only once on the normal difficulty setting. Enemies are very easy to overcome thanks to the ability to slow down time whenever the situation gets out of hand. Unlike the original, enemies take a lot less damage to kill and all of the weapons feel effective including the SMG. The melee in this game is still terrible. I used it in a few situations, but never did it down an enemy in one hit, so I felt as though i had wasted time meleeing when I could have just been reloading one of my guns. The game offers quite a few large weapons like a rocket launcher, sniper rifle, laser gun, and even some experimental blue shock gun. But I never felt as though any of them were really necessary. The game offers these huge weapons but never really presents an enemy that they felt effective against other than the one or two big mechs you have to take down. There's also a few levels that give you access to your very own mech which is fun to use. You can mow down countless enemies with powerful miniguns and launch a load of rockets at heavily armered mechs whilst using a cool thermal vision. The horror element that the game's title would imply just doesn't seem to be there anymore. ALMA no longer appears as a little girl in creepy places, and instead the big jump scares in the game are just the teenage naked ALMA running at you and forcing you into another repetitive quicktime event. I kept waiting for a big scare but it just never happened.\n\nThe story picks up close to the end of the first game, right when the nuke goes off. You take the roll of a new silent protagonist who also happens to have the ability to slow down time and shoot people, which makes absolutely no sense because now you're not even remotely related to ALMA in any way. The game has some more interesting characters than the first game, but not interesting enough for me to even remember their names. They feel more like disposable puppets used to shock you whenever ALMA shows up and decides to kill them, and never did I feel emotional towards any of their inevitable deaths, despite the music and other character reactions implying that I should. Unfortunetly, FEAR 2 removes the cool answering machine background storylines that helped give more life to the world and instead replaces them with boring PDA text files that you are told to find in every level. I liked the answering machines more because they didn't interupt the gameplay itself and allowed me to listen while I was looking for the next exit. So overall the story, just like the game itself, does some things better but then does some things worse.\n\nThe graphics have taken an inevitable leap forward, with an engine that really gives me that "Unreal 3" vibe. Especially when you shoot enemies and they turn into ridiculous bloody red mists and yell out similarly to the "Boomers" in the "Gears of War" franchise. While the game as a whole has more interesting colors, especially in the Elementary School level, the game as a whole felt like a blur of red, gray, and a slightly darker gray. The UI is enlarged to rediculous proportions (most likely to make it more readable for console users) and large prompts appear on screen whenever you approach an object to interact with like a door. Everything about the game itself implied that it was a console port, but thankfully the game has aged well and performance is without any faults throughout the entire game.\n\nSo to summarize, the gameplay is more action oriented and more fun than ever, but the horror element behind the game suffers deeply because of this. The storyline is pretty uneventful, save for the ending that cliffhangs into the sequel, but it's easier to follow and more interesting than it was in the first game. The graphics are better, but there are many indications that this game is simply a console port and considering it came out in 2009, it could have looked a lot better had it not been held back. Definitely recommend giving the game a try as it was a fun simple shooter, but it certainly isn't the masterpiece that I've been told it is.","October 2, 2014","true","5.1"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","8"

FEAR 2 barely seemed like it tried to do better, but neither did it try to only be more of the same.\n\nThe gameplay took a bit of a turn for the generic, falling into the recent crowd of iron-sight shooters that encourage you to be a lightning-fast bulletstorming hero. The first game had realistically inaccurate weapons, but allowed you to lean from cover, both allowing and forcing you to be more delicate about how you handled each firefight. FEAR 2 has no lean ability, so cover is substantially less useful, as you have to expose half your hitbox to get the crosshairs on your enemy.\nMelee and slowmo are still there, hardly changed, except that melee attacks are no longer one-hit kills to common soldiers. Action-heavy sequences such as the giant mech suits essentially act as glorified turret segments, desperately trying to out-bullet your foes.\n\nAs far as horror goes, the original FEAR was a little in-your-face with a lot of the scare scenes, but handled the atmosphere with excellent subtlety and sensitivity. The atmosphere in FEAR 2 is far less satisfying, as it is, in turn, much more outrageous. Outdoor segments are often punctuated by blood red skies and outrageous ambience, failing to immerse the player the way the original did. Sections of the game relying on simple, tried and true atmospheric tricks such as low lighting and eerie silence are much more effective.\nSome of the enemies tend to be legitimately terrifying as well, often in conjunction with the superior atmospheres of the levels they appear in. Watching the Remnants idly try to act out their lives as they did before they died is deeply unsettling, and sneaking past open cell doors knowing Abominations stalk between the darkest corners slowed me to a stop even on my second and third playthroughs.\nUnfortunately, in keeping up with modern action titles, FEAR 2 undermines a lot of its horror by forcing you to escape scripted insta-death events with furious button mashing.\n\nNaturally, the biggest draw to a sequel to FEAR would be the pseudo-'antagonist,' Alma. After FEAR, I was left in eager anticipation to see what she might wreak upon the world. Everything that goes wrong in FEAR 2 is because of Alma. Her character is handled reasonably well in the sequel, even as she is far more apparent and active in trying to get in your way. Her comparatively bi-polar nature is unnerving, as you're never quite sure what she's trying to do to you, though this might instead be confusing to players who struggle to follow this considerably more disjointed plot. A lot of imagination went into furthering Alma's story, but its difficult to decide if that imagination came from the passion of the writers, or their desperation to be more unexpected and outrageous than last time.\n\nBottom line is, FEAR 2 is not the sequel I hoped it would be, and certainly not a landmark achievement in any of its genres, but it came closer than it could have. Many parts of the game toe the line in terror and storytelling drawn by its predecessor, but it never exceeds it, and fails to maintain that level of quality throughout. It's worth picking up on a sale for anyone who wanted more Alma, more FEAR, and more slow-mo scissor kicks, and if you're like me, largely unsatisfied by the so-called "Vivendi timeline" of Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate.","February 19, 2015","true","11.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/16450/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1599 products in account","Released in 2009, four long years after the first title, F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is the follow-up sequel to the highly successful First Encounter Assault Recon. Players will once again take on the role of a Special Force operative, although this time you're no nameless "point man" peon; you're Sergent Michael Becket, and Alma has a very special connection with you. This game takes place mere minutes prior to the blast that was unleashed during the end of F.E.A.R., and proceeds to play out through events that happened before, during, and after it.\n\nUnlike the first game, Monolith missed absolutely no opportunities to spoil gamers with buckets of gore and moments of horror that seem to last a small eternity. From hallways drenched in blood, random mutilated corpses littering the environment, even more intense fight sequences, and ambient lighting that sets the mood just right, F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin has everything that players were left wishing for from the original. The game has a brilliant balance of action versus horror, sometimes the two are intermingled, which is something that Capcom could really take notes on when it comes to recent Resident Evil titles. There is zero downtime in the game from start to finish; either you're about to get a shiver sent up your spine, or you're going to be blasting the brains out of an enemy.\n\nThis title reveals even more about the origins of Alma Wade, and the reason for her wrathful vengeance. As Sergent Michael Beckett, you start off on what seems to be an ordinary, routine mission; until the blast is felt from the other F.E.A.R. team. From there, things begin to go haywire, and you start experiencing what are mild hallucinations at first. As time goes on, and Alma gets closer, your hallucinations become even more frightful, and down right disturbing. Some of your other crew members are affected as well, although none as intensely as you. Your ultimate goal becomes to stop Alma, and seal her away for good; of course, she doesn't want any of that.\n\nAbove being a wonderful horror title, F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is hands down one of the greatest shooters of the last decade. The guns are balanced, and the variety within is plentiful; action shotguns, combat shotguns, assault rifles, sub-machine guns, lasers, pulse rifles... the list goes on. It's very satisfying when you down an enemy, and the hit detection is spot on; whenever you miss, it's nobody's fault but yours. At a few points, you even get to control a mech! The A.I. is dialed down a little from its predecessor, although not by much as the foes are still quite smart, and will flip environmental objects for cover to their advantage. Thankfully, this time around the flashlight is not limited and you can keep it on for the whole game if you like, even though it does cause a nasty reflection when zoomed in on some optical sights.\n\nIt's stunning how well this game has aged over the last seven years, not only in terms of gameplay but also in graphics. In retrospect, comparing F.E.A.R. to F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin, it's crazy to see how far graphics had come within a four year span. The game is on par with Metro 2033, prior to its redux of course, and it was released over a year prior to the aforementioned title. The environments are richly detailed, and as always the lighting plays an incredibly important role in visual immersion. As well, F.E.A.R 2: Project Origin comes with a soundtrack that, astonishingly, outdoes its former counterpart by a landslide. I wish that Monolith or Warner Brothers would've released it as a paid download, or perhaps even free DLC, as it's one of the most enjoyable horror and FPS scores to grace the ears of gamers.\n\nF.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin can be enjoyed without having played the original title; in fact, I recommend this game over the previous installment. The story is much easier to grasp, and all of the holes are filled in with easy-to-find intel scattered about the levels. Not to mention, the game clocks in at a longer lifespan; between 7-9 hours, as opposed to 4-6. It's in every way better than the original, which is not something that can be said for many sequels. For an older release, the game is worth every penny of its current price tag, but if you can grab it on sale that's even better. This is not an experience to be missed.\n\nRating: 5.0/5.0 - An astonishing achievement, this game must be played.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","April 15","true","9.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

Hell bent on vengeance, Lee injects roids, which combined with his natural ♥♥♥♥♥♥ strength makes him an unstoppable murdering machine. He later learns that the mysterious and sharp Pointy Man and his hoot of a partner Owlma flipped the bus over using magical powers and that they're gonna blow up the whole world if Lee doesn't stop them before snack time. Lee soon discovers that his friends are alive thanks to the bus driver being a closet necromancer, and sets out with his best friend, Woody Harrelson, to stop Pointy Man and Owlma's evil plan.

Whoever never played FEAR can't understand why.\n\nAnyway, FEAR 2 is putting you in the shoes of Michael Becket, a sergeant in a special unit, used to answer to any kind of special missions involving paranormal (F.E.A.R.). Unfortunately, he's sent to retrieve Aristide, the mighty CEO of Armacham Technologies, that has something to do with the current problem in Auburn district. After a powerful detonation (the ending of the original F.E.A.R. game), he wakes up in an hospital, with people trying to kill you and with Alma Wade, the powerful spirit, taking an interest in him.\n\nThe plot serves to erase Perseus Mandate (a weak link) and Extraction Point (one of the best add-ons I've ever played) and to make a continuity in F.E.A.R's universe by the original developers. While I find it interesting as it's focusing also on Alma Wade's personality and her conflicted feelings. It's true that in itself, Armacham is a company with many secret projects (Origin is one of them, hence the title of the game) but I'm more attracted to Alma's struggling and story than Becket's.\n\nAnyway, FEAR 2 is a FPS, like the previous game. While in FEAR, your HUD was pretty simple, in FEAR 2, it's more elaborated, like you have connected glasses or helmet on the head. However, Becket, during the story, will acquire a power that the Pointman in FEAR has: bullet time. True, Becket isn't Alma's son contrary to the previous hero and the previous antagonist. But trust Armacham to play with your character.\n\nAnyway, that bullet time is very useful when you have to battle strange creatures or Replikas, clones and soldiers that are controlled by telepathy. You're not alone to fight: the rest of your team is helping, though they're nearly all affected by Alma apart for your lieutenant. Anyway, you fight, you shoot and you take advantage of your environement. You choose which weapons to use, you improve your power thanks to syringues and you collect information in the form of folders. That's how the story is also revealing itself.\n\nFEAR 2 has some hard passages, mainly in the high difficulty (hospital, research center, the last fight). While it's well-balanced, you have to be resourceful. Even when piloting an EVE (big robots), you need to take into account everything.\n\nHowever, FEAR 2 is perhaps more tragic than FEAR in the sense that Armacham never hesitated to cross lines for experimentation. It was already creepy to learn Alma's story in FEAR, here, you're learning that she wasn't the only one to be exploited like a piece of meat. While it makes sense to explore an hidden hospital as you were operated, to try to find a way out of Auburn destroyed or to put an end in another hidden compound, it's shocking to find the truth in a school and mainly what's under it.\n\nWhile the previous game was mainly set during the night, this one, when outside, is a daylight game. However, as you're in a battlefield, the graphics are showing this world in chaos, whether you are. And they're pretty good for this game. You're not let down during your hallucinating periods (Alma's doing) or when you're in the real world. Alma herself is less creepy in her adult form but only because she wants to appear normal in Becket's mind - else, she's still the creepy young adult that seeks revenge on the world for what happened to her and her sons.\n\nThe soundtrack is also very good, fitting to the fights or to the important moments. The voice actings are also good. If anything, I've two favorite tracks that I've listened a lot when I used YouTube as my playlist.\n\nAnyway, I loved this game. I'm just sad that there is no Steam Cloud - the technology back then wasn't spread or existing for other games - though it's been a long time since playing but I remember when I changed desktops, that's how I discovered that I've to unlock everything again, as the game has ingame achievements.\n\nLike any FEAR, even FEAR 3 that I still need to play, the best is still the plot and Alma. FEAR 2 is an excellent sequel, though I wish Extraction Point to be still cannon - forget about Perseus Mandate. That game is a must-have.","November 19, 2010","true","49.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In the game you control a member of the anti-terrorist unit named Michael Becket. The plot is extremely addictive and the climate will keep you held the seat from the beginning to the end of the game. The main antagonist is the leader of a terrorist group but also a little girl (to be precise mature woman) named Alma. I have to admit, and even now the graphics in this game looks very nice as well as lighting. Opponents are mostly terrorists, Replica Soldier and sometimes, depending on the stage will fight with paranormal beings and mutants or something like that. As for the weapons, there are even a lot but it's more about the feeling when we use them. The biggest flavor is "Bullet Time" so that we are able to slow down time. The game I would recommend to anyone, the game has a cool story, atmosphere and soundtrack. Certainly you will experience dose of action but also and fear.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/16450/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","I’ve heard some people say FEAR 2 is inferior to the original game, but I actually prefer it over FEAR 1. Most notably, the graphics of FEAR 2 are greatly improved, now comparable to other Xbox 360 games/ports. There’s still an issue with default key bindings being weird compared to other modern FPS games, but you can change those easily.\n\nFEAR 2 picks up a little before the end of FEAR 1, ignoring the FEAR 1 expansion DLCs. This time your character has a name and you actually feel like part of a team, instead of just having a lot of people talk to you on the radio. However, similar to the first game you’re on your own most of the time when the bullets start flying. Your team is tasked with rescuing the CEO of Armacham Corporation, the private military contractor with more firepower than most first world nations. The Armacham leadership is trying to cover its ♥♥♥ by blaming the disaster from FEAR 1 on the CEO and sending in black ops teams to wipe out everyone and everything that could tie them to illegal activities. Not to mention *SPOILER* at the end of Fear 1, Alma was released, so she seems to have awakened all the replica forces around the city. You have a lot of visions of her wandering the halls and tearing people apart like Phoenix in the worst Xmen movie (you know which one).\n\nLike its predecessor, FEAR 2 is a first person shooter with a time slowing power that you can use to achieve tactical supremacy. The game seems a lot easier than FEAR 1 for some reason, possibly because the enemies don’t seem to have perfect aim anymore. There’re at least half a dozen new weapons, some of which are pretty cool (Lasers and electro grenades) and a pretty badass mechanized power armor that you can use to lay down the pain. Of course there are a lot of new enemies as well to soak up your bullets. This time around there are non-human enemies that have either been created by Armacham or were summoned by Alma’s psychic presence. You also need to fight some enemies with their own power armor (at least you have a missile launcher). A minor gripe of mine is that not all the weapons seem to have designated “roles.” For example the assault rifle and the submachine gun are basically the same thing. One is weaker but fires faster, that’s about the only difference. There’s also an energy weapon that is basically the same thing as the missile launcher. I won’t complain too much about it though since more variety is nice in a game with modern graphics. I wish there was better documentation of how enemy armor works. Most of the enemies seem to be wearing heavy armor. Does it randomly deflect bullets like in Rage, or just lower the received damage like in the Fallout games? The Hammerhead rifle is supposed to be great against armored enemies, but in a fast paced game like this, it’s really hard to see the difference. This is really kind of nitpicky though and it’s just something that stuck out in my mind, not a real problem.\nEDIT: I was wrong about the energy weapon being the same as the missile launcher. It seems to be more like a BFG 10k (from Doom) with lightning bolts shooting out of the main blast to fry people around it.\n\nPros:\n+Great visuals and some unique looking monsters. The ghost summoner is pretty cool\n+A lot of “intel” items can be found in the game, which give you a flavor for the game world. It’s disgusting the kind of things that Armacham has been up to.\n+Slow-mo + sniper rifle = fun\n+Good story and a lot of replay potential\n\nCons:\n-There’s this weird issue where each time a level loads, it seems to pause around 50% and not move until I alt+tab out of the game and go back in. I don’t know if this is specific to my computer but it also happened with my old non-steam version a few years ago.\n-The game has no Steam achievements despite having game achievements built right in (like 10 headshots or 10 melee kills).\n-FEAR 2 is kind of short. I went through it in about 6 hours on normal mode. It may take longer for someone who hasn’t played it before.\n\nOverall if you liked FEAR 1 you should like FEAR 2. I find it superior in pretty much every way. As much as I liked the first FEAR, I doubt I’ll replay it again because the outdated graphics really take away from the experience. With FEAR 2 I’ll keep it around to replay in a few months (smaller download size too). If you have this game in your inventory from the Humble Bundle, give it a try.\n","September 11, 2014","true","17.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Comparing to first FEAR and the addons, combat is waaay more exciting and fluent - I've really enjoyed the fact you can move things like tables to make covers.\nThe bad thing about this game is the lack of scary moments - I think I jumped twice or three times (prologue is the scariest part). This may be caused by forcing mostly on shooting. I'm also a bit disguisted by the lenght of the game - I finished it in 7 hours, could be a little longer.\nSome words about difficulty - it is harder than the first FEAR and PM/EP.

You have to defend yourself when she approaches you.\nBut actually she doesnt seem to want to kill you as other persons in the game tell you.\nOr maybe she is impressed that you are the only one who can resist her attacks.\nThere is something more, something pretty surprising. But you will get this after finishing the actual game.\n\nMultiplayer is down because of Gamespy being dead.\nThe actual playtime is around 7 hours for the campaign.\nThere is also a DLC available but im reviewing this seperately.\n\nPositive:\n- Bullet time\n- Good Story\n- Big amount of options ingame\n- Alma is one of the best game characters ever\n- No health regeneration!\n- Somewhat good graphics (2009)\n- Great play with the dark and shadows\n- More modern feeling\n- Good and fitting unique soundtrack\n- Great freaking hallucinations!\n- Some nice environments, especially more compared to the first game\n- Good Enemy AI\n- Shooting is a lot of fun\n- One of the best and most surprising videogame endings\n\nNeutral:\n- German Steam store version cut\n\nNegative:\n- Some questionable keys like shift for zooming with the weapon... Changeable\n- Multiplayer dead, gamespy down\n\nReplayability: Medium\n\nFor me this game was just as good as the first part. In fact I actually thought its even better, slightly. Mostly because it feels more modern and doesnt have problems with modern systems.\nI personally would rate it with 9/10 points.","October 18, 2014","true","13.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

You are again trying to find a little "scary" girl. FEAR 2 doesn't seem to have the atmosphere of the original game either, so it basically becomes another average shooter. Not even unsettling a little bit. Hence I couldn't enjoy it at all, although I liked the first game. I do not recommend it even to those who liked the original FEAR.","November 27, 2015","false","1.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The shooting, the weapons and the slow motion is nowhere near as satisfying or good as the original and it overall just feels like the average console shooter.\nThe enemy ai is also nowhere near as good as the original, they feel very scripted and don't react very well to your movements.\nI feel like the game also struggles with the difficulty settings. Normal is way too easy and hard is just ridiculous they give the enemy amazing accuracy, they never miss a shot and you only die in a few hits. I switched to normal around halfway through the game because it just became so stupid and unfair which is a shame because the rest of the game became a breeze because there is no challenge in normal. A game should never have such drastic difference in difficulty between two side by side settings. I love challenge in games but there is a difference between challenge and unfair it's why i love the dark souls games even though they are very difficult they never feel unfair. That’s my little rant aside about difficulty settings i felt like that needed to be addressed.\nSome of the scares work great and some feel cheap it's very mixed. Nothing much happens throughout the story of the game which is a shame because i think that the series always had potential to tell a great story and the first game started it off really well and the concept for fear 2 is pretty good its just the storytelling isn't handled well.\nIt sounds like i sh*t all over this game in this review but that's because it's the sequel to my favourite fps of all time so of course im going to compare it to the original and as it's own standalone game it's nothing better then the average shooter. It's only a 5 hour long game and i got sick of the gameplay just 2 hours into it. There are much better single player fps games out there, don’t bother.\n5/10 (Average)","March 25","false","5.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I liked this one a lot. The gunplay was very solid and responsive, the slo-mo is just as fun as the first one and I don’t think there is anything better than pinning a replica to a wall with a giant spike. Well maybe blowing one to bits but they are pretty close. Good shooting mechanics and a variety of guns, plus you get to ride around in a mech, who can complain. The enemies were relatively easy to I would crank up the difficulty and don’t bother saving ammo, you will have tons.\n\nThe story for this one is pretty good, it could have been fleshed out more but it does the job and advances the overall story arc for the FEAR series. The characters were relatively generic shooter fodder yet I was still intrigued to see what happened to them and compelled to get to completion. Also the collectables, although not necessary to get, add fun lore to the game. One more thing, Alma is as creepy as ever.\n\nAs for the DLC Reborn, it was pretty good. Fun to take on the role of a Replica for once. It doesn’t do anything new from the main game and the story is rather throw-away but if it’s on sale it’s well worth a couple bucks.\n\nOver all its an above average shooter with a cool mechanic, awesome world and great set pieces.\n\nHave fun ^_^","July 1, 2014","true","10.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There were answers and tidbits of information throughout, there was atmosphere, some occasional scares, sci-fi mystery, the action is far better than the first FEAR thanks to things like iron sights and select fire as well as the different grenades/explosives you have at your disposal. The story was, for me, quite engaging. I was very interested in finding out how things progressed, and the end had me looking forward to FEAR 3. Well, you can check my review on that if you like, but here's the several paragraphs of hatred summed up in 2 words: It Sucked.\n\nI find FEAR 2 to be by far the best in the series, FEAR 1 is 2nd best with monotonous but acceptable combat as well as great atmosphere, and FEAR 3 is... well, let's not ruin the moment by bringing that up again. I wholeheartedly suggest getting this game, and while I think it'd be good to play FEAR 1 first, I definitely think this game can be enjoyed without doing things chronologically. Just... make sure you STOP at FEAR 2, unless you don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about story or firearm realism, just wanting to blow stuff up with the occasional little needless spook from Alma or other unexplained monsters. Maybe FEAR 4 won't suck... but if it still focuses on that ridiculous 'brother' nonsense, screw that...","May 2","true","7.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I enjoyed it so much, even though it's still a warFPS (only human bots) for about 85% of the game. The first game seemed to me two games in one, a horror story adventure and a warFPS, and these two were not much in context. But FEAR2 is really ONE contextual game. Sadly it's a console port but still far better than some other i saw. Good work Monolith!\n\nPros:\n- Very hyped graphics. Millions of details and if you are carefull enough you can find many small references of Alma's past.\n- Weapon system is perfect. Four weapons can be held, and the weapons itself are very enjoyable (except the Napalm Cannon).\n- Weapon sounds are good, ambient sounds are perfect, music is better than perfect.\n- Alma is cooler than ever. No ugly Fettel, except for the built in expansion (Reborn).\n- The machine cannon and moreoverly the power armor parts are awesome, especially the thermal view of the armor.\n\nCons:\n- Still a warFPS for most of the time with boring human bots uses way too good aimbot hitscans. Nothing better than one-hit instakills by snipers!\n- Only ingame achievements, no Steam.\n- Some part of the game is needlessly hard. The fight on the moving freighter against countless Replica elites and the Reborn campaign 2nd level is unfair and frustrating.\n- Console port, though a better one, still cannot use more than 3 mouse buttons.\n\n8/10 Very good horror warFPS.","May 20, 2014","true","17.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This means the memory about F.E.A.R. 1 is still fresh in my mind. First of all, the one main problem with the first game were the boring, grey, office building type levels. On the plus side the AI was fairly competent, the guns felt good enough and the story while scarcely told was enough to motivate at least somewhat to continue. All in all it was a mechanicaly excellent game.\n\nGoing instantly to the second game after playing the first one (with expansions) was a bit jarring. The game certainly looks nicer and while in its core it is with no doubt F.E.A.R. the differences in the mechanics can throw you off a bit. First thing I had to realize was that there is no leaning anymore. At all. This was an often used feature in the first game which saved my sorry ♥♥♥♥ more than a few times. Secondly the guns don't just feel as good as before. Thirdly the AI might be a lot more competent than it is in other games but it just does not compare to the first game where the enemies constantly flanked me, and I went down in a few shots even in normal mode. Generally you seem to take a lot more hits in this one making it a hell of a lot easier. And lastly, one of the most fun aspects of the first F.E.A.R. the "kung-fu-moves" are reduced. Normal punching and air-kicking is still there but my beloved "sliding" seems sadly gone.\nThe story is told much better and the "scares" while still not really scary at least to me, do a fine job at setting the mood especially with all the fancy new effects. I don't know how you could comprehend what is happening if you haven't played the first one though.\nThe levels were much more diverse but had still that certain problem of "I just know when the enemies must be coming because I am suddenly just standing in this big empty room". Also there is the unnecessary addition of notes to find everywhere which feels rather forced.\n\nTo sum it up comparing to F.E.A.R. 1: Levels more diverse, story better told, mechanics went downhill towards an average shooter level.\n\nSo all in all a slighty above average shooter.","December 1, 2013","true","5.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

However, since I loved the first FEAR and it's expansions and since FEAR 2 was relatively cheap I decided to give it a whirl, and I'm glad I did.\nOne of the things I loved most about the first game was the dynamic gore system, FEAR 2 amps the gore up, almost making the gore on par with Left 4 Dead 2 despite it's engine age. Enemy dismemberment is still brutal and satisfying, especially with the tight-as-a-toigar shooting mechanics. The combat is fast-paced and sends your heart rate soaring, with level design and first-person animations that are immersive and with an inventory that can easily be depleted if you're not cautious. Just like FEAR 1, the combat is the top-selling point making the entire gameplay experience delicious. The developers also improved on the combat, granting the player an extra two weapon slots, more powerful firearms including sniper rifles and flamethrowers and even the ability to further interact with the world in the form of creating improvised cover against enemy fire, you can slide out couches, push over cabinets, and yes, even flip tables\n(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻\nWhile FEAR 2 improves on all of FEAR's strong points, all the weak points remain untouched. The story is yet again lacking, failing to grab my interest and any exposition to it results in my impatient finger-tapping, the characters all feel two-dimensional and seemingly only exist to die at a later point in the game. The worst part of FEAR 2 is quite easily the creepy little girl jump scares. Jump scares are cheap shots, with no build-up and having no need for atmosphere, they are a blemish upon this game. One thing I was dissapointed about was the removal of Q+E leaning, which left me more exposed to incoming fire that I felt was needed, as well as the removal of quick-saves, leaving me 100% dependant on the foul teet of autosaves.\nIgnoring my quips, FEAR 2 is a really fun game, with it's combat, music, level design and explosive action, I'd definately recommend any players of the first FEAR to give this one a go.\nALSO YOU CAN DRIVE A MASSIVE OVER-FREAKING-POWERED BATTLE TANK ARMOR SUIT OF SEXYNESS HOLY GUACAMOLE THAT PART WAS FUN.","August 13, 2013","true","7.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The best visual design in the whole series – something more than just gray walls of underground complexes. Not much of horror in it and AI behaviour is simplistic making the enemies easy targets.

This means the memory about F.E.A.R. 1 is still fresh in my mind. First of all, the one main problem with the first game were the boring, grey, office building type levels. On the plus side the AI was fairly competent, the guns felt good enough and the story while scarcely told was enough to motivate at least somewhat to continue. All in all it was a mechanicaly excellent game.\n\nGoing instantly to the second game after playing the first one (with expansions) was a bit jarring. The game certainly looks nicer and while in its core it is with no doubt F.E.A.R. the differences in the mechanics can throw you off a bit. First thing I had to realize was that there is no leaning anymore. At all. This was an often used feature in the first game which saved my sorry ♥♥♥♥ more than a few times. Secondly the guns don't just feel as good as before. Thirdly the AI might be a lot more competent than it is in other games but it just does not compare to the first game where the enemies constantly flanked me, and I went down in a few shots even in normal mode. Generally you seem to take a lot more hits in this one making it a hell of a lot easier. And lastly, one of the most fun aspects of the first F.E.A.R. the "kung-fu-moves" are reduced. Normal punching and air-kicking is still there but my beloved "sliding" seems sadly gone.\nThe story is told much better and the "scares" while still not really scary at least to me, do a fine job at setting the mood especially with all the fancy new effects. I don't know how you could comprehend what is happening if you haven't played the first one though.\nThe levels were much more diverse but had still that certain problem of "I just know when the enemies must be coming because I am suddenly just standing in this big empty room". Also there is the unnecessary addition of notes to find everywhere which feels rather forced.\n\nTo sum it up comparing to F.E.A.R. 1: Levels more diverse, story better told, mechanics went downhill towards an average shooter level.\n\nSo all in all a slighty above average shooter.","December 1, 2013","true","5.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Though they keep the two genres seperated by making each segment devoted to one, it is done extraordinarily well and I can't think of a better game than this one to scratch both itches simultaneously.\n\nThe story is enjoyable and the combat mechanics are well done as well. The variety of weaponry was an entertaining aspect of the game as well, each player might end up with a different arsenal at the end of the game based on their tastes. The horror scenes were enjoyable, and some parts were downright scary (I'm looking at you elementary school).\n\nMy only real complaint with F.E.A.R. 2 was that the story seemed to get a little slow right around the middle. Once I returned to the game after a short break and powered through another level, it got very exciting, though, and I'm very glad that I kept moving forward.\n\nI recommend this game to all fans of FPS and horror.

As I expected, F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin was a huge improvement both graphically and gameplay wise. I'd say it's still a great looking game and I could clearly notice how the gun handling was improved. I felt like on the first game the recoil was somewhat too much and needed more recoil compensation on the player end but on F.E.A.R. 2 I think they've "perfected" the shooting to better suit "casual players", while I think this is a good thing I understand if others think that the first game had more "realism", if you can call it that, to the weapons. One thing I still find to be rather "lazy" about F.E.A.R. 2  is that most of the guns are basicly just new skins of the older ones, you've got the assault rifle, the submachinegun, the "penetrator" but I gotta admit these new skins look pretty damn nice so I forgive them, one other thing, or maybe it was just me, I'm pretty sure they re-used the enemy voices and player and enemy animations from the previous game, I'm not complaining they did just the right job but I still find it lazy on the developers end. At the end of the day they did a pretty good job in keeping the shooting just as great as in the first game with improved visuals and gun handling, not to mention you can pilot Mechs on this one which I found out to present a nice variety of gameplay but, they did also put some turret segments in the game (I believe two), which I feel they didn't overdone it like some games. Still I think despite of having a great shooting experience, F.E.A.R. 2 wasn't that tense or scary as the first one, I think that's because of the improved graphics everything looks more "colourful" while in the first game everything looked kinda dark and sinister. In the end I think F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is a fine piece of work and definitely a great shooter with a nice continuation to the F.E.A.R. plot and the ending clearly gives you the clue that's more to come, I'm pretty sure you can't go wrong with F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin, either if you're looking for a great first person shooter single player experience or a first person shooter with a paranormal twist to it, F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is clearly the game for you.\n","January 1, 2014","true","8.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Personally I find both games to be about equally brilliant, but let's try to analyse the possible reasons for this, shall we, and see what conclusions we come to...\n\nFirstly, F.E.A.R. 2 is absolutely, unapologetically a more blatant "horror" game.  A large part of the charm and uniqueness of the original was the way in which it spent the vast majority of its time being a reasonably straightforward (if thoroughly excellent) first-person shooter, with only sporadic - but thereby highly effective - bits of supernatural horror creeping in; with this sequel the devs decided to turn that balance of action versus horror into a more balanced fifty-fifty split, with all manner of beasties and what-not galore now terrorising the player as well as the expected super-soldiers and giant robots.  Perhaps some naysayers felt this made the series less unique, or made the horror less "psychological" and more, well, downright physical I suppose.  I can see that point of view, honestly I can.  But...I also can't really see how they could have maintained the same super-subtle unpinning of horror without simply REMAKING the original, and this is of course where all manner of "art" / "entertainment" industry follow-ups encounter controversy; not just games, but movies, books, bands, you name it.\n\nHow many people bemoan the fact that their favourite band didn't "keep the same sound", and essentially just keep making the EXACT SAME RECORD, over and over again?  How many people believe that Aliens took the stripped-back purity of Alien and ♥♥♥♥ed it right up the pooper-shooter by turning it into a slam-bang, high adrenaline ACTION MOVIE?  Here's the thing: You can't please everybody.  EVER.  Some people want to recapture what they experienced the first time, more or less verbatim, while others want something which is sufficiently different to distinguish itself from the original product, though perhaps with just enough in common that there's some continuity maintained.  I personally belong to the latter category.  I would much rather play F.E.A.R. 2 than F.E.A.R. 1, MARK 2.  There is a difference between these two concepts, after all.\n\nSo what one needs to ask themselves, then, is what kind of person they are, or to put it another way...if you enjoyed F.E.A.R. 1 and are wondering if you will also enjoy this one, then perhaps THESE are the questions you need to ask yourself:  Are you the kind of person who enjoyed the first game, in spite of "not normally" being a fan of horror games?  If the answer is yes, then perhaps this one may go too far in the "horror" direction for your liking.  Or are you, like me, someone who actually HUMOURED the original F.E.A.R. on account of it appearing to be something of a horror game, in spite of the fact that most of the screenshots seemed to indicate otherwise?  If so, then you're probably gonna ADORE this one.  And if you're somewhere in-between the two types of people I just described, well...wait for a sale and take a punt anyway.  Why not?  You only live once.\n\nThere are other differences between the two games, of course.  This one is arguably a bit "harder", not least of all in the earliest bits where you don't even have the benefit of your slo-mo ability to make up for your ♥♥♥♥-poor marksmanship (I felt THAT one, believe me).  Your "health" isn't nearly as generous in this one, either; expect to get more-or-less "insta-killed"...a LOT.  The soldiers also don't tend to be quite as "vocal" as the earlier game...but given that the soldiers in the first game had virtual diarrhea of the mouth and a tendency to give away their location at every possible opportunity, this is arguably an improvement.  You also don't get to shoot two pistols at a time or perform those oh-so-impossible first-person jumps which suggest your character has springs instead of legs (in this one, you actually see your character's hand realistically propel him over obstacles, etc), so overall, a slightly "grittier" level of realism is definitely the order of the day here; and again, it's up to the individual whether they consider this to be a boon or an abomination.\n\nIf you ask me, this series didn't really start to go (and even then, only slightly) "downhill" until the third F.E.A.R. game; which I personally also loved to bits, though I would be inclined to agree with anyone who thinks it's the weakest of the three.  But hey, it gets harder and harder to stay "fresh" as a game series progresses, so what do people expect?  If you're happy to live your life in stasis, you have my blessing.  Me, I'll take a pinch of spice in my bowl, thanks.  Then again, I'm the kind of person who doesn't like to stay in the same boring old job for fifty solid years, either.  Each to their own, it takes all kinds to make the world, etc etc...\n\nVerdict: 10/10.","February 13, 2015","true","16.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Graphics are nice, sound is present, there is even some kind of story. HOWEVER THIS IS NOT A F.E.A.R. GAME AT ALL. All they have to do is to copy the first game and polish graphics - bam, another award-winning shooter. Instead of that devs decided that players like being tacticool - press ACTION TO CREATE A BAD COVER. Walking robot parts are plain boring - w+m1, stop to regen. Weapons feel light (probably because of reloading animations, especially sniper rifle which is made of paper. Speaking of sniper rifle - you can quickscope). At least the enemies seem to be as smart as before (on hard). Unfortunately they are just cannon fodder - walking robot and turret parts will make you yawn. Btw right before the last interval you'll be forced to sit behind the turret to shoot enemies while listening to some generic rock music ( Snake Fist (Instrumental) - look it up on YouTube). Oh, and your dudebro ally will be shouting some nonsense - like I am in CoD or something.\n\nLack of manual saving, weak story, short duration, casualisation - all of this killed the spirit of F.E.A.R.

I had a lot of fun playing Fear 2, it took me 7 hours to beat but it felt longer for some reason. The atmosphere is great, much more environment changes than Fear 1. Great lighting effects, but the textures are ugly. The first thing that came to mind when I played Fear 2 is how similar it is to Doom 3 - the Intels (PDA in Doom 3) laying on the floor, the jump scares, style of the corridors, those moments when a person is being swallowed by Almas darkness or whatever one may call it, and the guns even felt Doom 3-ish to me. Fear 2 also nails the difficulty curve quite well IMO, if you put it on hard its challenging but not frustrating. I think this is a topic often forgotten in many modern games, usually there's too many annoying difficulty spikes or the descriptions at the start about each difficulty are inaccurate.

I had a lot of fun playing Fear 2, it took me 7 hours to beat but it felt longer for some reason. The atmosphere is great, much more environment changes than Fear 1. Great lighting effects, but the textures are ugly. The first thing that came to mind when I played Fear 2 is how similar it is to Doom 3 - the Intels (PDA in Doom 3) laying on the floor, the jump scares, style of the corridors, those moments when a person is being swallowed by Almas darkness or whatever one may call it, and the guns even felt Doom 3-ish to me. Fear 2 also nails the difficulty curve quite well IMO, if you put it on hard its challenging but not frustrating. I think this is a topic often forgotten in many modern games, usually there's too many annoying difficulty spikes or the descriptions at the start about each difficulty are inaccurate. The ending is one sure to be remembered, it's unique.","September 9, 2014","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As with all sequels it enhances some things from the original but isn't as good as the original, and that is true here. The one of the small things that bugged me about this game was that the slow motion wasn't as, well, as slow, as the first game, just a little but it felt weird. The graphics were improved dramatically and I really liked how they looked. As with the first game it combines FPS action elements with horror elements, although not done as well as the first game it still does it adequate. I don't think it's really worth buying though, I got this game along with FEAR 1 and 3 along with the batman arkham games and few other games in the WB games humble bundle charity thing they did a few months prior to this writing, I payed I think 8 dollars (yeah I'm cheap, sue me I'm a high school student).

I purchased the whole FEAR series as a bundle and I have to say that in terms of overall satifaction, F.E.A.R 2: Project Origin was the best overall in terms of story, content, difficulty, and gameplay.  I know, I know, F.E.A.R was revolutionary for its time and there were alot of things Monolith did right that first time, but F.E.A.R also was extremely repetitive.  There's only so many replica soldiers you could have long drawn out shootouts with before you're looking for the cheat codes to move the story along.  It did set the stage for the 2nd game.\n\nThe character of Sgt. Becket was much more thought out and slightly deeper than the Point Man of F.E.A.R, who just received mission after mission with short cut scene here and there.  F.E.A.R. 2 really did a great job of communicating the deeper history of Alma and why she was who she was.  I can't say that I blame her for being as ticked off as she was.  Some of the NPC interaction was a little stiff and generic, but for my money the whole game was a great improvement over the first one.\n\nIt's worth a playthrough, just for the ending, which surprised me I admit, but made more sense in F.3.A.R when I played it immediately after.","January 28, 2014","true","12.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you've played FPS like Half-Life 2 or Doom 3, nothing about the gameplay will enthrall you. The story is even sillier than the first part, F.E.A.R., and ends most timidly and laughably, especially after subjecting you to quite an intense gunplay barely 5 minutes earlier. The game just can't make up its mind whether the chief villain, Alma, is a victim of a secret military experiment, an alien, or a ghost. How in the hell can hallcinations eat away one's health? But they do in this game. Go figure.\n\nJust like the first game, you are made to shoot your way through several office complexes, underground research facilities, and subway tunnels. There's nothing to do in the game except kill, kill, kill, the waves of enemies obstructing your progress. The game relieves you of all the brain-work and figures your way forward for you. Enemy AI, while not pathetic, is predictable and makes the gameplay boring after a while. You can foretell 8 times out of 10 where the enemy is hiding, from where it is going to emerge, and your best hiding spots. Environs and locations have dull colors and textures and look depressing. One may wonder what the 12GB download size of this game went into since the game is easily completable within 15 hrs. Background music is grating and a nuisance. During gun battles, it prevents you from hearing enemy chatter & movement, and is best turned way down. The sound-mixing too is completely screwed-up. While in the first game, all six channels of the soundtrack worked well and enabled one to ascertain the direction of enemy's approach from the sound of footsteps or radio chatter, sound in this game doesn't seem to have been configured for multi-channel setup. In my experience, a well-configured multi-channel soundtrack is absolutely critical in clearing major gun battles in any intense shooter by assisting in effectively taking out the enemies sneaking up on you. I hope sound mixing engineer was fired for not doing his job properly. Horror element is childish and the game uses cheap jump-scare tactics to shake you up. Difficulty levels are once again messed up, as they were in the first game. HARD setting is hardly hard and difficult to tell apart from the normal setting except for sniper fire and grenades which kill you in one instance. In fact, I found HARD setting easier than the NORMAL setting, but it may be because I played on HARD setting after having played the game on NORMAL, therefore having the advantage of knowing maps and enemy movement in advance. There are other minor flaws and irritants in the game design that further sour the experience, such as, grenades bouncing around like tennis balls, inability to load only the last save point and not the older ones, etc.\n\nNow that I've ripped the game apart, let me mention that the game is not too bad a product on a stand-alone basis, and a typical FPS lover can have fun with it. It's really in comparison to other FPS on the market that it appears dim-witted. Coming from a major studio, one expects a game to deliver a unique and unforgettable experience. Isn't that why we all play video games--because they 'virtually' put us in places & situations where we won't ever find ourselves in real lives? That's why at least I play 'em. This game does that alright, but via an unimaginative design and in a bland style.\n\nI know I won't be playing this game ever again. I also know I'd have at least 3x more fun repeat-playing any game of the Half-Life or Bioshock or Far Cry franchise.\n\nGame played smoothly without a stutter (except freezing twice during the entire gameplay and subsequently self-correcting on its own) on a Win 10 machine and a GTX 960 OC card.\n\nRECOMMENDED to newbie FPS players.

Unlike the legacy of the first F.E.A.R, the second game attempts to reestablish the horror elements and slowmotion gameplay as refreshing, but it leads to simple, generic, and typical FPS game. The game is very short as my first playthrough is 6 hours. The Alma sequences were not scary and relies very heavily on "jumpscares", which are very predictable. There is no psychological suspense or grave tension that the first game has. The "bullet time" in F.E.A.R 2 is not "well-spent", meaning that it's not necessary for you to use it. I find it as a negative aspect as the first game "recommends" you to use bullet time to ease off stiff, challenging, and difficult firefights; F.E.A.R. 2, not so much. And of course, there is no character development from any characters that you encountered as the high majority of them die off quickly and to be honest, F.E.A.R 2 is one of the very few games that I actually do not care about any characters or how they develop. It's too generic. Overall, it is hard for me to recommend this game to anyone, but I can only recommend to those who are interested in the F.E.A.R storyline. Lastly, the storyline of F.E.A.R. 2 does not follow the "Point Man" storyline. I strongly recommend for those who are interested to buy this game for $3.75; nothing more than that.","January 22, 2013","false","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

F.E.A.R. 2 is also made by Monolith. Starting off with this review, i think F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is a very short game. I played a few minutes in real life of this game, the rest 8 hours of gameplay wen't from one day only. Yeah it's a short game, but it's such a ride that i don't have much to say. The gameplay has been improved a lot from the first, so much that it doesn't feel like the same game, but in a good way. The storyline is ♥♥♥♥ing great in my opinion, and much better than the first, but less characters, but it think it works well that way, and better too. The voice acting is better than the first too, and let's be fair, the first game had cringe-worthy voice acting. The game contains much more scary moments and they're used much better, although annoying at some moments, while in the first, it was just the little girl going on a hall and it wasn't very scary, it was usually psychological horror. Continuing, the protagonist is badass. Sorry to say, but this'll get people murdering me and, i think Becket is more badass than Point-Man. And let's forget F.E.A.R. 3, since i don't think it's canon at all to the story. And possibly my best option to prove that this game has a better story is the ending. The ending was considered weird by critics, but i think it's a ♥♥♥♥ing epic and outstanding ending for this ride of a game. So let me tell you the ending. In the end, Becket enters the Telesthetic Amplifier, but as Stokes prepares to power up the machine, she is interrupted by Genevieve Aristide, who explains that she operated on Becket so he would serve as a lure for Alma. Instead of destroying her, Aristide plans to seal Becket and Alma inside the device together, so she can use Alma as leverage against Armacham. Stokes disagrees with Aristide's intentions, and reaches for her gun, but is shot by Artistide before she can defend herself. Stokes collapses, with her ultimate fate left unknown. Alma then appears and blows Aristide away from the Amplifier, allowing Aristide to reach the control panel and seal the chamber as the walkway retracts. Alma pays her no attention, instead focusing on Becket, who she sends into another "hallucination," where he fights off apparitions of a maddened Sergeant Keegan while trying to activate the Amplifier and destroy Alma. As Becket fights Keegan, the battle is interspersed with images of Alma ♥♥♥♥♥♥ him (I don't consider it ♥♥♥♥, but it technically is, so yeah, but it seemed pretty sexy, you have to agree). Finally, after activating the last switch, Becket escapes the hallucination to find himself sealed inside the device. The device is unsealed from the outside by Alma, who walks up to Becket and reveals she is pregnant, having ♥♥♥♥♥ him while he fought off the phantom image of Keegan. Alma takes Becket's hand and places it over her stomach, implying that the child is his. The game ends with Becket hearing the child whisper "Mommy" from inside Alma's womb. And my lord what an ending it was. Also, the graphics are great, they were amazing for 2009, and they still are great for 2016. Also, the gore is amazing. There is only one moment in the game where you control a robot mecha, which is a very good moment, which needed more sequences. The game is very glitchy at some moments by the way. So let's go for the pros and cons!\n\nPros:\n+Outstanding ending\n+Great Graphics\n+Better Voice-Acting\n+Memorable characters\n+Weapons\n+Gore\n+Badass Protagonist\n+Insanely Heavy Themes (Alma's ♥♥♥♥ Frames during final boss)\n\nCons:\n-Extremely Short\n-Not many weapons\n-Glitches\n\nOverall, F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is an amazing game, and a masterpiece, which is the best example of a sequel in a single video-game ever made.\n\nThe score for F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is:\n\n10/10 ~I knew it was going to be outstanding and amazing, but not a masterpiece!","January 13","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/m_friebe/recommended/16450/","m_friebe","m_friebe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/m_friebe/","650 products in account","Have you ever experienced the beauty of a "fine" game? Let me elaborate: What I mean is a game that is not utterly awesome, but still does everything right. A game you pick up for a second playthrough knowing you will get nothing innovative or mind-blowing, but in spite of this, you'll still enjoy every second. Hell, after finishing, you won't rule out a third run happening in the future.\n\nFEAR 2 is this kind of game.\n\nSure, FEAR brought some really impressive new stuff to the table, like mixing horror themes into an FPS setting, clever AI and FPS bullet time. But those were achievements introduced by the first game, and thus, FEAR 2 cannot claim them as its own. Actually, there is really nothing new in the sequel (with one notable exception, but more on that later), and stripped of the hallmarks of the series, Project Origin is a pretty standard FPS:\n\n...which is what makes it so great.\n\nA big part of why it succeeds is its pacing. FEAR 1 is a great game, without any need for great improvements. But what it lacked was proper pacing, a deficit also found in Condemned 1, another Monolith game. Many sections dragged oooon and ooooon without much variation. It was warehouse after warehouse after warehouse, and later bureau complex floor after bure- you get the point. Its scenarios simply didn't know when they wore out their welcome.\nFEAR 2 eliminates that weakness. Its pacing is just great. Just when a setting tends to get tedious, it switches to a new one or offers a new enemy or a nice set piece to spice things up. It never, ever gets boring, in my opinion. What's also great is that the graphics still are very good. It's a bit more colorful, but not to the excess of FEAR 3, hitting the sweet spot between the drab first game and the overkill of the third. It's another example of this "just fine" mentality I mentioned in the beginning.\n\nNo, FEAR 2 won't blow you away with a great story. No, your jaw won't drop to the floor every five minutes. No, you won't marvel at game-changing innovations. Will you have a good time all the way through? Hell, yes.\n\n...but my review would not be complete without addressing the one awesome new feature the game DOES introduce. You probably guessed it: Exosuit battles. There are only two sections in the campaign, but boy, are they fun! Nothing beats the feeling of gleefully raining down destruction with your gatling guns and missile launchers. Also, what could have basically have been just an overpowered reskin of the normal on-foot sections -and strictly gamplay-wise, it is - is helped so much by its presentation. You feel every step of the hulking mech when its lumbering steps shake your view, and the vision has a slight oversaturation combined with grain that completely sell the experience, A part of me wishes there would have been more of this, but on the other hand, its restrained use is another example of FEAR 2's pitch-perfect pacing.","December 4, 2015","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is puzzling as to why since the story is intriguing, the gameplay is solid and the graphics are up to par in modern day gaming. F2: PO's gameplay is similar to the original F.E.A.R. where "slow-mo" is still a favored featured that never gets old in its use. F2: PO has one piece of DLC called "Reborn" that is essentially a standalone addon that hardly contributes to the story. It's disappointing that the game never utilizes SteamWorks when the in-game setup seems so close to supporting features such as Steam achievements.All in all, the game is a solid shooter with a great horror-like atmosphere that continues the story of Alma.","September 8, 2011","true","21.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game feels like it was made to make the series more accessible for people. The guns are changed this time around to make the game feel easier when in gunfights. The A.I. is not as impressive as the first game unfortunately. It's not bad, but it has been toned down a bit. The grenade particle effects are also gone from the first game :(\n\nIt's not all bad though! The long cooridor filled levels from the first game are gone. This game is changing it up every level. You even get to control an awesome mech to go down streets blowing up everything. This game is more difficult than the first one, mainly due to not being able to quicksave anymore. It has a checkpoint system this time around, which balances the game a lot better. The scares in this game feel even more terrifying this time around. The school easily has some of the scariest moments I have ever seen in a game. The new enemy types love to pop out constantly when you are least expecting it. The graphics have also got a nice upgrade. The deployable turrets were a fun new weapon, but I wish I got to use them more.

It had a decent enough of a storyline that acted as a great vehicle for getting to explore a very Akira-esque underground facility. It's still visually stunning to this day (I played it a few months back).\n\nAll of those traits are dumped for F.E.A.R. 2. An alarming percentage of the enemies will stand off in the distance as you shoot them repeatedly in the head. If they aren't standing perfectly still, they will abandon cover and run straight at you. The storyline  is much more limited than the first. While I think the J-horror jump scares of the original were pretty dumb, the story was at least compelling enough to create a real sympathy for Alma. Alma plays a minor role at most in Project Origin, with the devs perferring you to have a strong bond with your mindless, soulless teammates while giving you no reason to feel connected to them except by telling you how close you all are. All of the imagination that went into the original facility is gone here. The sense of scale has been scaled down, if you will, to a couple of small buildings and an itty bitty underground lab.\n\nEverything about it feels more like an ambitious yet terrible expansion pack than a real sequel. If you adore the original as much as I do, I would definitely suggest you just appreciate it and it's second expansion pack, Perseus Mandate, and leave F.E.A.R. 2 alone as to not spoil your fondness for the original.","June 22, 2014","false","11.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emnii/recommended/16450/","emnii","emnii","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emnii/","1171 products in account","F.E.A.R. 2 takes place concurrently (only for a short time) and during the aftermath of the first F.E.A.R. You play a SFOD soldier named Becket whose team is grabbed by Armacham, juiced full of experimental drugs, and then sent on a mission to stop Alma while chasing down leads on the how and the why of it all. You get the gist of the story in radio communications and in-game cutscenes but all the details are in logs scattered throughout the levels, similar to the first game but there's a lot of more of them this time.\n\nF.E.A.R. had amazing graphics at the time and Project Origin doesn't disappoint. The effects are similar to the first game with lots of sparks and dust when the bullets fly. The best looking effects come when you're having hallucinations. Colors fade, return, your view goes blurry and sharp, lights flash on and off. It's impossible to describe effectively.\n\nA big complaint about the first game was the lack of variety in environments. It was a lot of offices and industrial areas. Personally it didn't bother me much, but Monolith took it to heart. Of course there's more offices and industrial parks but there's also a school, a medical facility, research labs, and the destroyed streets of Auburn. You never feel like you're walking the same corridors over and over and no one environment really overstays its welcome.\n\nF.E.A.R. 2 also has the same fantastic gunplay that the first game had. Enemies are quasi-intelligent in dropping for cover and flanking your positions. That said, on normal difficulty, the game never gets too hard. I don't think I died a single time. Between the abundance of armor and health packs, the whole game is just a little easy. The only nuance that threw me at the beginning is that when you hit the slo-mo button on and off, there's a little bit of a spin-up and spin-down. It was basically an on-off switch in the first game so having a second of delay really threw me off at the beginning.\n\nMy favorite part of this game were the areas where you get to stomp around in the elite power armor. It isn't just for the amazing amounts of firepower the elite power armor brings, or the carnage of the fights you get into with it, but the effects while you're in it. As it takes more damage, alarms scream, the screen gets distorted, and warnings flash manically. It's a hell of a lot of fun and really makes me clamor for Monolith to make good on the easter eggs it's put in recent games and make a sequel to SHOGO: Mobile Armor Division, a mech game they made a decade ago.\n\nThere's no easier way to put it: F.E.A.R. 2 is an awesome first-person shooter. I played through it all in a single day, which is a task I don't think I've ever done. It's basically amazing.","November 25, 2013","true","21.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In some ways, I enjoy this game. It's got elements of the original FEAR that I enjoy, but it's also got plenty I don't. Changes in the health system and the way armor and health works makes the game more artificially difficult because your character cannot carry 10 health kits and cannot take more than a single shotgun blast (From long range it seems sometimes). Which is annoying because FEAR 2 has automatic shotguns. It's AI is also not quite as intelligent, but it does have elements that seem to work with it.\n\nMostly I have to say the story is the main problem with it. FEAR 1's story was well told, through a mixture of speech and moment elements. You got a sense of Alma's motives by exploring the environment, watching her actions, and the like. But FEAR 2 seems mostly about just shaming Armachan and other stupid things. I dunno. It's just not as interesting as FEAR 1 in its story.

However it shouldn't ruin the experience too much, as those "brilliant gameplay facets," are really freaking awesome. Would recommend, definitely.\n\nSTORY:\nYou play as a man named Becket who, despite actually having a name, is as quiet and as the Point Man from FEAR 1. The game begins right before it's predecessor ends, with Becket and a team of soldiers trying to find and secure Armacham employee Genevieve Aristide. After a simple first level that teaches you the basics of gameplay and gives you a few good scares, the operation goes south when the entire city is levelled from the nuke Point Man detonates in FEAR 1. You wake up in a hospital and discover you and your teammates have been experimented on, against your will, and now Alma is drawn to you, as well as a very stereotypical sergeant with all of armacham's military might intent on wiping out Genevieve Aristide, you, and anybody else who could spill the beans on the company's bad deeds. The over-arching story is a little nonsensical but is presented dramatically and it's very, very well done (except for a few not-so-good voice actors along the way) so it is forgivable. The story also expands on Alma Wade, the figurehead of the series, and turns her from spooky ghost girl into a character you actually can feel very sorry for, until her naked, wrinkled corpse begins hunting you and trying to... do things to you... The ending of the game is actually really good though, and even though I knew what was coming, I couldn't help but still be a little freaked out. It WILL make you want to either replay the game, or go and buy F3AR (Yes, they spell it like that).\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe gameplay is pretty similar to the first game. It's a first person shooter with a heavy emphasis on strategic combat against squads of intelligent AI but also comes with levels that aren't just corridors (and encourage exploration), as well as some truly horrifying sequences. Unfortunately the game is a little uneven in some regards, as the action-shooty-shoot-bang side of the game feels rough compared to FEAR 1 with the AI seeming less intense and almost less intelligent , and a lot of the new features feel shallow and useless. However the enemies are still fun to fight, and are still much smarter than the average COD campaign AI. You won't use the optional "Flip cover" mechanic at all, however, as it's quicker and easier to duck behind something else than to press "e" and go into the slow animation of flipping a table. A few guns also feel stupid as well, such as the pulse gun. It's supposed to be like an energy bazooka thing that fires a big plasma ball that travels reaaaally slowly before melting anything it touches to bones, which sounds cool, but its clunky and awkward to use and doesn't even feel powerful, so instead of that I just used the awesome missile launcher as my heavy weapon, and it worked just fine. There is also an added feature of a giant mech walker ala Titanfall you climb into at certain points and wreck stuff with, and those two sections were amazingly fun and I loved them very much as it gives you the ability to grind through tough enemies like a hot knife through butter and blow holes through walls. It's empowering and a blast, and it's rare enough to keep from getting in the way of the horror.\n\nSpeaking of horror.... The horror lands on the side of horror that is a slow, creepy build up where your jumping at shadows and noises, to full on freaking the heck out when things escalate, and boy do they escalate. The first bits of horror you encounter in the hospital level left me horrified beyond words, then the ruined, nuclear waste of a city had even more potent scares and mutant enemies who could raise the dead to fight for them which was frightening, stressful, and a lot of fun to battle through. But, like the action part, the scary parts have their flaws too. The developers seem to have decided, "well there's a few parts in the game where you're just solving puzzles, or progressing through an area between firefights without shooting anyone... This'll be scary if just throw in a few spooky looking enemies, or those invisible ninjas everyone loved from the first game." Unfortunately, this was not a good decision. In the third or so level I got tired of blowing through the same enemies that once frightened me so badly, and while I loved the invisi-ninjas in FEAR 1 and was excited when they came back they too grew tiresome. Fortunately there must've been some devs who understood scariness, and after the third level those enemies were replaced by a much scarier opponent (and their scares lasted much longer) until much later in the game, when they were re-introduced and made very frightening again, and the invisi-ninjas don't show up enough to ruin the experience, but they will cause serious annoyance. Overall, the horror side is fantastic and can be downright terrifying as it makes you, the gun-toting soldier, feel weak and powerless as some young woman with godlike abilities is hunting you down.\n\nSIDE NOTES:\n- Alma is fully grown in this game, and she likes to wander around naked. There are also heavy forced-sexual themes, so this is especially not for younger players, or for those sensetive to those materials.\n- While not a very graphically intense game, it did give my ancient Radeon HD 5750 some trouble before finally ending its life. The replacement card (an HD 6850) did just fine running the game, but it built up a bit more heat than I would've expected.\n- While the game is fully enjoyable on mouse-keyboard, it is, unfortunately, a console port and plays better with a controller.\n- The save system is annoying when first starting the game, as it only saves at checkpoints and the first checkpoint in the hospital level is really far in and I had no idea, so I wandered around the hospital for at least 20 minutes, did some stuff and got off only to get on later to realize I had to restart that level because I didn't hit that one checkpoint. All the other checkpoints in the game are well placed and non-bothersome, but that one is a pain.\n- On the subway level I somehow fell out the map twice and had to restart from a check point. The rest of the game seemed rather stable on the bug-side.","December 30, 2014","true","8.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In some ways, I enjoy this game. It's got elements of the original FEAR that I enjoy, but it's also got plenty I don't. Changes in the health system and the way armor and health works makes the game more artificially difficult because your character cannot carry 10 health kits and cannot take more than a single shotgun blast (From long range it seems sometimes). Which is annoying because FEAR 2 has automatic shotguns. It's AI is also not quite as intelligent, but it does have elements that seem to work with it.\n\nMostly I have to say the story is the main problem with it. FEAR 1's story was well told, through a mixture of speech and moment elements. You got a sense of Alma's motives by exploring the environment, watching her actions, and the like. But FEAR 2 seems mostly about just shaming Armachan and other stupid things. I dunno. It's just not as interesting as FEAR 1 in its story.

Playing this game was still a disappointment. The levels were dull and uninteresting in design and layout. The characters all dull and two-dimensional, not to mention very stereotypical. What could be claimed as a plot and setting were poorly presented, badly paced and left me wanting it over not even half-way through. There was no scariness, no tension. Jump scares were continually accompanied by violin screeches, and were ineffective. The ending was disturbing, and didn't make much sense until I looked at some videos on youtube after about it. Even then it feels like it was mostly disconnected from the rest of the game. The possible attempt at adding atmosphere by having the HUD flicker was very annoying, bothered my eyes and since it didn't extend to anything besides the player's HUD and flashlight it felt like it was meant to punish the player more than be atmospheric.\n\nPlaying through on normal difficulty I found there were more than enough health and armor pickups to almost be constantly at full health. Weapons were frustrating because of the number found in game, the limit to the number able to be carried and their blandness, none really stood out for power or accuracy or usefulness beyond what ammo was most plentiful. At least one weapon had no other ammo besides the 5 shots it had when given. Grenades felt weak and mostly useless. (shock grenades were the only type consistently useful).\n\nThe boss fights were moderately interesting. The AI was interesting, the use of cover was fine, but the randomly running between cover spots, or the often indecisive movement of the AI trying to choose a spot to run to for cover were a pain. The powered armor sequences were even more linear and dull, and there was a greater tempation to not use the armor when available to try and give myself something challenging. I also went through most of the game without using the bullet-time ability very much. It didn't really seem needed for very much. There is also only about 6-7 different types of enemies, most of which are similar soldier types.","August 21, 2015","false","9.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","1"

Its not bad, I have played far worse but its definetly not good either.\n\nIt felt like they looked at F.E.A.R. and just made a casualised/consolised version of the game instead of taking the first game and building onto that.\n\nUnfortunately it dousn't take anything that was good from the first game and build onto that and feels more like a generic FPS of these days rather than anything like the, now classic, original. The great AI is gone and feels much more basic now while they still attempt to recreate the original they feel much more stupid. The maps have alot more detail but sit at either at being simplistic places to run through or overly complicated areas where you get turned around and confused where to go. The areas though do look nice and the graphics in general are a huge jump forward in fidelity but something is lost in the transfer. The 1st game had a very flat and empty graphical design (either due to intended design or hardware limits of the time) that added towards the atmosphere which is lost with 2.\n\nThere is also alot more involvement with NPCs but unfortunately the story isn't exactly the easiest to understand or make sense at all. Honestly with this type of story there isn't much sense to be made and its more of a thriller than a story book.\n\nThe scaryness isn't really there aside from a handfull of jump and other scares but its not a scary game anymore than the first and probably less so. Its mainly a shooter like the original game, but you end up fighting the same enemies over and over and scenarios reminiscent of the original game. Unfortunately the AI of the old game and feeling of a dynamic shootout escapes this one as the experience feels more canned than homemade.\n\nI would only recommend playing this if you just played FEAR and want more of that type of game or if you just want to play a generic style FPS and know what your getting into.\n\nThe cinematics and writing is pretty good, but if you wanting something super serious all the way through than the writing will fail you from the very start of the game.

It does nothing for the genre and all of its tricks are based in predictable jump scares and occasinally "oh, isn't this creepy?" sequences. All the weapons and explosion have a pithy impact compared to the first games (It's amazing how weak a frag grenade sounds like). Nothing here that you haven't seen in a shooter before beyond a couple neat weapons and a disturbing fascination with Alma - I think the overall idea is to make you feel sorry for her for some reason, but thats impossible when she's mutilating everybody and constantly trying to scare and attack you.\n\nDon't bother with this unless you get this with a bundle for completion's sake.

This sequel was a worthy continuation of the F.E.A.R. story. People who played the first part (as I did) will feel like they are coming home. If you played the first part everything will be familiar and you know most of the enemies and you will know most of the weapons that are available.\n\nThe graphics are a bit outdated, but WHO cares when the story is awesome. I have to admit, Almas jumpscares couldn`t get me as bad as in the previous F.E.A.R. game. Because they were basically the same....\n\nBut yes, I`ve seen parts in the game that made me really smile and think: Holy crap this is nicely done (school part) and some horror-movie directors should take this as example and maybe make better movies.

This takes a much more generic "run-and-gun" approach, it works and is satisfying for the duration of the game, but is a downside.\n\nHowever the phenomenal "experience" of the game makes up for it. The original game showed the promise of good storytelling, and this one realizes that potential. Much like the first I wouldn’t come for genuine scares but rather the eerie sense that pervades the entire experience, the terrible knowledge gleamed from what you’re allowed to know, and the growing tickle in the back of your head that things aren’t going to happen as they seem at first. It also succeeds in creating a doomsday apocalypse scenario that is somewhat unique, and at the same time actually manages to make you feel like the end of the world might be right around the corner.\n\nA good "game", a revolutionary adventure.","July 26, 2012","true","25.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Yes, it's scary, but when what I'd assume was supposed to be the biggest random scare moment comes attached to a QTE and pops up again and again throughout the game, you quickly get over the scare factor and just get annoyed at the QTE breaking the flow of the game.\n\nVisualy, it looks damn good, the story is decently written and the enemy AI lives up to the hype. However, you spend the early part of the game without the "Bullet Time" from the first FEAR, since this is not a direct sewual, but a story that takes place somewhat parallel the the first, so you are not playing the silent protagonist from the first game.\n\nHonestly, this game was good when it was released, but now it falls into the "decent" catagory.

If you enjoyed the first game this will be worth your money.\n\nDo not expect this game to be a better version of the original game – there is no such a thing!\n\nThis game got some improvements compared to the first F.E.A.R. game, but a lot of downsides as well.\n\nGraphic, controls, performance, & sound:\n\nGraphic: The overall graphics got enchanted to look shinier and more modern - I especially like the blood which looks a lot more like liquid compared to the first one, plus an added effect, bodies also drop organs sometimes when they explode - however I miss the random body part (like a arm or a leg) that could fly off into the distance from the first F.E.A.R. game. Generally effects like: explosions, bullet impacts on surface or ground and shotgun bursts, looks absolutely terrible in my option, its way to white/yellow and without any detail, looks like something done in a hurry and is very a shame!\n\nControls: All controls can be customized and is a great way to use your own key liking. Also a new thing in F.E.A.R.2 is the sprint mechanic, however one thing I didn’t like is that you cannot toggle it on and off; if you toggle on your sprint it’ll last as long as the sprint meter is up, that can lead to awkward situations where you just need to stop up in a hurry even a half second faster count, if trying to avoid incoming attacks or taking cover.\n\nPerformance: I haven’t had any performance issues at all running the game maxed out, always on a steady/capped 60 fps even on a low-end CPU and a small amount of ram.\n\nSound: The sound effects work very well to create the dark and creepy atmosphere this game is going for. A common thing in the F.E.A.R. series is a high pitch noise whenever a scare is coming up, if I like it or not is the question, one could say it is hard to be taken off guard with such a mechanic.\n\nHorror:\n\nScares in the world of F.E.A.R. is a great thing, and I like that Alma appeared this much in the second game, however, the same kind of scares appeared way too often which only made it annoying and predictable.\nAsides from the point on scares (jump scares) this game has a surprisingly large focus on the small and creepy details of the horror genre, if one is to explore around like I did on my second walkthrough. I found a lot of things that I missed blindly first time, simply because I didn’t notice it, and that’s something I admire of a horror game. “You may not even realize they could be watching yah, aye?”\n\nArtificial Intelligence:\n\nThe AI replica soldiers got a lot dumber compared to the first F.E.A.R. (or its expansions), their behavior is too monotonous, which makes killing them a little tedious and like a routine you go through.\nTheir awareness is also not working like it should: Moving from floor 1 and up in the right side by the stairs, the AI’s standing on the left side of floor 2 spotted me, because I had a flashlight on (they yelling: we got a flashlight over here) – even though a wall was blocking their sight on floor 2. Uh makes sense? I think not!\n\nOverall:\n\nEven though this review may sound rather critical and demeaning, I do not mean any of it in a negative manner, and the game does have its good moments. This review is simply based on my own perspective, from my experience and thoughts about the game and I’ll certainly recommend it if you enjoyed the original F.E.A.R. game or its expansions and couldn’t get enough.\nThe playtime value is about 12 hours.\n\n\nF.E.A.R. 2: Reborn:\n\nA very small DLC to the original F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin.\n\nI am not very impressed by the DLC due to the leak of new content.\n\nOne thing the DLC did provide was some missing information for the 3rd F.E.A.R. game, but that alone isn’t worth getting the DLC for, in my option.\n\nVery low playtime value, I completed the DLC in less than an hour.","January 2, 2013","true","17.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I'm putting on my serious face for this review, as FEAR is my second favorite FPS of all time right behind Fallout 3. FEAR 2, I should start out by saying, is not a bad game. It's decent compared to any other FPS you play these days, but what ends up making it a pile of waste to be trudged through is when you compare it to the original FEAR. For instance, a common theme in FEAR 1 is that when you kill a enemy in slow-motion, they often die still fireing the gun, allowing you to be clipped if you're not careful enough. In FEAR 2, I only saw that happen exactly 5 times. All the guns in FEAR 2 sound like BB guns, and aren't satisfying to use, whilst in FEAR 1 you actually fired bullets instead of what sounds like nerf darts. Also the shotgun got downgraded, and that is just a crime. The only part that I thought FEAR 2 did get right was the setting, but that was only for the School portion of the game. All in all, FEAR 2 is a okay game, but does not live up to the expectations of the FEAR franchise. 5/10.","June 17, 2014","true","6.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Short but sweet. While not entirely bug-free, it's a lot more polished than its prequel. The game also seems to be a bit more clever with its scares, making the scary bits a lot more enjoyable.\n\nThe level design is on par with the original FEAR, though a little more varied. Paths to objectives are unrealistically complex, but fun nonetheless.\n\nCombat is different. The AI seems to be less intelligent but can handle more damage and is more accurate when shooting. Some enemies towards the end can take a bit too much damage to my liking, but not to the point where it gets frustrating. There is no more peeking from cover, meaning you can't fight the same as you did in the original FEAR. On the other hand, it's much easier to flank enemies than it is in the original. While I prefer the original combat and enemies, I don't dislike the ones in FEAR 2. With the exception of fighting monsters, that is.\n\nThe game's biggest fault, is that they wanted to include more enemy variety and ended up with some complete BS monsters. There's the fast-but-weak creepy-crawly monsters that are just an annoyance because they do so little damage but are hard to hit and the puppeteer monster that takes a ♥♥♥♥♥on of damage, keeps running away and has the most annoying attack in the world. The latter monster is challenging, sure, but also a real chore.\n\nThe story is pretty fun, until you start to think about it and you discover some things that don't quite make sense (or aren't adequately explained, at least). The original game was the same, though.\n\nBoth FEAR and FEAR 2 are must-plays.","January 5, 2013","true","8.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

Short but sweet. While not entirely bug-free, it's a lot more polished than its prequel. The game also seems to be a bit more clever with its scares, making the scary bits a lot more enjoyable.\n\nThe level design is on par with the original FEAR, though a little more varied. Paths to objectives are unrealistically complex, but fun nonetheless.\n\nCombat is different. The AI seems to be less intelligent but can handle more damage and is more accurate when shooting. Some enemies towards the end can take a bit too much damage to my liking, but not to the point where it gets frustrating. There is no more peeking from cover, meaning you can't fight the same as you did in the original FEAR. On the other hand, it's much easier to flank enemies than it is in the original. While I prefer the original combat and enemies, I don't dislike the ones in FEAR 2. With the exception of fighting monsters, that is.\n\nThe game's biggest fault, is that they wanted to include more enemy variety and ended up with some complete BS monsters. There's the fast-but-weak creepy-crawly monsters that are just an annoyance because they do so little damage but are hard to hit and the puppeteer monster that takes a ♥♥♥♥♥on of damage, keeps running away and has the most annoying attack in the world. The latter monster is challenging, sure, but also a real chore.\n\nThe story is pretty fun, until you start to think about it and you discover some things that don't quite make sense (or aren't adequately explained, at least). The original game was the same, though.\n\nBoth FEAR and FEAR 2 are must-plays.","January 5, 2013","true","8.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

You are apparently the top of your class and team making you some kind of pro.\n\nThe horror in here seems to have been toned down and more "intensity" has been added. Basically they went Modern Warfare all up in this only you still have armor and health where they don't recharge because that's overrated. You can't quicksave anymore like you used to but checkpoints are there left and right. For me, the kung-fu kicks have been de-nerfed cause I can hardly hit ♥♥♥♥ when I do 'em. Oh, and you can sprint and you have a flashflight that don't run out of batteries.\n\nThe DLC is incredibly short.... like an hour worth short.\n\n♥♥♥♥'s still a great FPS, just not as horrifying and it doesn't leave me as paranoid as the first one. Plus, the First Encounter Assault Recon team aren't involved in this whatsoever along with the events of the first one (except the ending of the first one).","June 28, 2011","true","7.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Overall the story has a lot od depth and is interesting, the graphics were outstanding for its time and are still comparable to some more modern games.

The game has all the essentials that the first one did. It  may not seem to push the envelope technologically as its predecessor did, but  FEAR 2 isn't a slouch in that regard either. In all, I enjoyed the act of PLAYING much more with this sequel. FEAR was a great game, and it wowed us all with its chip melting tech, but it also felt flimsy at times, almost like being in a diarama, however beautiful. FEAR 2 is solid, like a rock. It has weight, and more importantly, it has colour. What was excised from the formula has, I think, done more to strengthen the gameplay than weaken it. And it's ironic that critics bemoan the perceived loss of certain atmospheric and narrative elements in favour of increased action. Let's face it, FEAR was never 'scary'. It was tense, sure, but Condemned - THAT'S a scary Monolith game. The FEAR series has always been primarily for the action, and this second game delivers.","April 17, 2011","true","16.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Slo Motion make the action so much sweeter in this game from simple gunfights to full blown wars with whatever the hell you feel like.\n\nAll the while your taking ♥♥♥♥ from noone on you high horse of dousche baggery, the game places little tidbits of story info and background data alll over the place for you to look at, ingest, speculate about all of the crazy s**t happening to your character.\n\nThe enviornments are heavily detailed and are able to be interacted with making no two firefights truly the same, and with a huger arsenal of brutal weapons ranging from simple pistols to high penetrating nailguns. This game truly shines in its one of a kind momennts where the action breaks and the player finds themselves isolated in very odd and peculiar places.

But it does the FPS thing very well.\n\nThe main thing is how atmospheric the game is.  The combat might be relatively fast (even with the slomo powers), but the game beckons you to stop and look around once it's over.  And for such a linear game, there is always quite a bit to look at and take in.\n\nI liked the first F.E.A.R. game because of the atmosphere and level of detail, as well.  But it suffered from a small budget.  The studio was able to make a lot more assets for F.E.A.R. 2, so the settings are much more varied.  So essentially, here, they did the thing I liked about the first game, but more.\n\nAlso, the game runs really well even on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hardware, despite how good it looks, so that's another plus.","May 2, 2015","true","11.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But it does the FPS thing very well.\n\nThe main thing is how atmospheric the game is.  The combat might be relatively fast (even with the slomo powers), but the game beckons you to stop and look around once it's over.  And for such a linear game, there is always quite a bit to look at and take in.\n\nI liked the first F.E.A.R. game because of the atmosphere and level of detail, as well.  But it suffered from a small budget.  The studio was able to make a lot more assets for F.E.A.R. 2, so the settings are much more varied.  So essentially, here, they did the thing I liked about the first game, but more.\n\nAlso, the game runs really well even on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hardware, despite how good it looks, so that's another plus.","May 2, 2015","true","11.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

They polished the game up only to sprinkle little particles of crap on top of it.\n\nList of crap\n\n1)Snipers\n\n2)Armor takes an eternity to whittle down but you can go from full health to dead in an instant. Once you lose all your armor watch the ♥♥♥♥ out.\n\n3)Psuedo-cutscene gemoetry movement that instantly kills you. Don't let the moving car tap you on the toes or you die\n\n4) The hammerhead gun is a piece of ♥♥♥♥. Enemies can tank 4 of these to the head and still keep coming. ♥♥♥♥ off\n\n5) The base shotguns are overpowered and of course the game doesn't give you enough ammo for it to go around\n\n6) You get your first sniper rifle, the only gun that grants properly damaging headshots, during the last hour of gameplay\n\n7) You can only hold onto 3 guns at once lol. Naturally you only pick up ammo for the gun you're weidling at the time\n\n8) No proper final boss\n\n9) The last two minutes of gameplay before the credits start to roll. 20 invisible, impossibly fast enemies vs 1 of you, and you don't have enough slomotion or effective bullets to go around and they can kill you in a literal instant anywhere since there's no effective cover.  I ultimately just ran past that screen and pressed the button-of-game-ending rather than combat them a TENTH time QUICK TEAM WE DON'T HAVE A FINAL BOSS JUST SPAWN A WHOLE BUNCH MORE ENEMIES THAN USUAL\n\n10) In fact just about every encounter can be skipped if you just run past and are clever enough to see/find the exit\n\n11) You can only hold 3 medpacks and a very finite number of grenades/ammo\n\n12) No minigun other than the turret\n\n13) Terrible mech-driving segments coupled with vasoline-o-vision\n\n14) Women in combat roles, let alone the 1st Seargant, AND the only one who survives to the very ♥♥♥♥ing end\n\n15) SHE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ OUT IN THE LAST SECOND AND DOESN'T KILL THE PERSON WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYTHING EVEN THOUGH SHE'S RIGHT THERE WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ IS CQC AND THEN DIES LIKE A ♥♥♥♥♥ SOMEONE PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD GET BOSS ON THE LINE\n\n16) ♥♥♥♥ every semblance of plot this game tries to shoehorn into reality. That's just what I wanna do is read a whole bunch of pdfs with worthless information in between gunbattles. At least the prequel was decent enough to give me phone calls I could listen to in the other room while exploring\n\n17) Nearly no incentive for exploring nor nothing to explore.\n\n18) the default grenade is a piece of ♥♥♥♥--good thing there's plenty of alternate ones that are useful\n\n\n\nThe game kept getting worse and worse as I progressed. For reference the hospital early on was amazing and the schoolyard about halfway into it was really great. It's just a little too tedious and samey. Thankfully this game improved the abysmal flashlight from the first game. I hated that ♥♥♥♥ so much. Huerp gotta wait in the dark 10 seconds before I can illuminate this dark-♥♥♥ hospital.

There's also a big deformed guy that can resurrect the dead, but those enemies appear very little in this game.  The game does have some cool weapons like a gun that instantly kills foe and deskin them as well as their flesh, but that doesnt appear until close to the end.  There isn't really anything scary or even startling in this game either, just jumps scares at most.  It doesn't help that when something that is suppose to be scary coming at you, you can just shoot it, even the ghosts.  The parts when your in a mec-suit are pretty cool.  Story wise it was just that you were  part of and experiment to make special telestetic soldiers like your character in the last game, which is why Alma is coming after you.  The other characters are just your standard soldier characters with no real personality.  You can get more of the story with logs and journals that you can find out throughout the game.

I love them. They scared me a few times and I enjoyed it. The story (specially the F.E.A.R. and the Extraction Point) was really good. The mixture between scares and fights was really good, and the notes on the story gave you a good perspective about what was happening. So, with that in mind, I began to play F.E.A.R. 2.\n\nOh, what an error.\nThe game is practically everything shooting, shooting, and more shooting. There are a few little low quality scares in the first half of the game, but the next hours is only bullets for everyone in really big (and boring) combats.\nThe notes are practically irrelevant. Some little details, or things you really pass to know.\nAlso, the story is... not interesting at all.\n\nAnd then, I finished it. So, I played my recently bought (in the Halloween Steam Sales) F.E.A.R. 2 DLC. It couldn't be worse.\nOh, yes, it can.\nThere's practically no story. Only more bullets for everyone. There are no scares. Only guns.\nAnd the final combat was really boring.\n\nSumming up, the only good points of the game were seeing (only a few times in the first half) little Alma with good graphics and the possibility to pilot (but only two times in F.E.A.R. 2 and once in the DLC) an armored robot. No more, no less.\n\nThat's all about this game.","November 7, 2014","false","15.7"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","1"

The weapons are fairly satisfying, although the energy weapon and laser are stupidly awkward.  Gunplay in general still feels right, but the AI lacks the level of skill and more believable squad tactics that made the gunfights in original so dynamic and enjoyable.  Things feel much more scripted now, which while not necessarily bad, certainly makes for less engaging fights overall.\n\nThis almost goes without saying, but the game looks far better than the original. but it generally lacks the same unnerving tension that FEAR managed to create so regularly.  It definitely has its moments, to be sure, but it's far more sporadic.  Put differently, a lot of the scares (jump or otherwise) felt extremely formulaic at this point, with even sightings of Alma being generally unremarkable.\n\nThere were definitely some good (albeit disturbing) revelations--like the purpose of the school, or the extent of the experiments on Alma, the prototypes, and all the would-be candidates for the Program--but a lot of it still felt a bit perfunctory to me.  Maybe it's because a lot of the mystery was gone by that point.\n\nI don't want to give it away, but I found the ending totally unexpected, disturbing, but also appropriate to the kind of dark, adult story being told--particularly considering its many troublesome implications.  However, my "liking" of the ending and FEAR2 overall was also predicated on FEAR3 finally connecting all the dots in a satisfying and sufficiently harrowing way, which it most definitely did not do.\n\nI'm seriously torn here, but I'm going to have to down-vote this one: I don't regret playing it per say, but I also can't recommend it with a straight face.  Come for the tight gunplay and lukewarm scares if you like, but if that doesn't do much for you then just play the original again and pretend that its progressively less satisfying sequels never hit store shelves.","October 30, 2014","false","11.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Its shooting physics and gun play are very well done. The campaign plays just like Half-Life 2, with the story being told in the same way. Only difference is that there's random hallucinations mixed in at appropriate times. These are very well-done and although not scary, they create a great, mysterious atmosphere. The biggest disappointment is that there are no ranked multiplayer matches (2011), with only 1 or 2 unranked servers online at any given time. It's a shame since the multiplayer has potential to be fun and perhaps more polished than F.E.A.R. Combat's. The story is short with a lack of varied environments and gameplay. However, what you do get is of fairly decent quality and there's nothing like it out there. I played the demo on Xbox 360 and on PC before purchasing and it's quite clear that this game was made for the PC judging by the wealth of buttons in this game. Overall it's a decent game but not good value for money.","November 26, 2013","false","10.1"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

F.E.A.R 2 is defintaly the best out of the 3. F.3.A.R was ok but strafed out of the horror segments too much and was just an all-rounder action shooter.\n\nF.E.A.R 2 has a good balance between fright and fight. Beefy accurate weapons with rate of fire options plus grenade types. The graphics are decent enough for a 2009 game and was quite demanding for PC power back in its prime.\n\nF.E.A.R 2 has outstanding animation in the enemies such as interacting with the enviroments to provide cover, dashing through windows or vaulting over ledges. Its so detailed if they set on fire near a ledge they will frail over and jump off in a panic or getting a shotgun slug to the chest, stagger back and think what the hell just hit them. Theres also the camoflague assassins that will roll around, backflip off walls and such to try and dazzle you before striking.\n\nThen theres Alma. The key character that will stalk and haunt you as you play. She seems to have techincal connections with your crosshair as where ever you look she will appear before you in rigid postions before leaping towards you.\n\nHowever there are things I am not happy with and thats the controls. The weapon selection can be quite messy, the ability to lean left and right from the original f.e.a.r has been taken out and also doesnt seem to be compatible with gaming mice as it only registers 2 mouse buttons which is terrible to say f.e.a.r could register 5.","October 31, 2014","true","24.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

FEAR1 had sprawling levels where squads could strategically engage you (or be engaged by you)- FEAR2 is all cheap spawn points in linear, uninspired level design. Ammo is dropped every two inches, it can't differentiate between left CTRL and right CTRL (fear1 could), it bugs out if you press too many keys at once (it often gets stuck strafing right, it often doesn't register keypresses, etc). Moreover the story is filled with cheap thrills and the plot is insanely stupid- they've never heard of "less is more". And the way alma is rendered is also less scary.\n\nFEAR1's plot wasn't a masterpiece by any stretch; it had some really good and unique ideas in the meat of the story, but the frame-plot / getting to the meat of the story was pretty blatantly stupid. However it was at least *paced*; seems to me like they just wanted to play with some neat horror ideas and didn't really care too much about the rest of the plot- any excuse to get the player alone in some creepy environments would do. The game is about exploring ideas, and it is about exploring Alma's backstory; clearly not a lot of effort was put into leading up to that. Knowing that the plot was largely bad, they interspersed truly intriguing elements along the way and approached the more interesting ideas *slowly*.\n\nFEAR2's approach to storytelling is to have some guy call you up and explain just about everything to you. There's no suspense or pacing. It's just... all bad.\n\n-------------------------------------\nF.E.A.R. 2 Reborn DLC\n-------------------------------------\nThis one really builds you up just to let you down- in the beginning, things look AWESOME. Several huge issues with FEAR2 are corrected! Points in Reborn's favor:\n\n- You control a replica soldier\n- without slow motion abilities\n- with health given in numbers rather than a bar (both are good but if you have to pick one, go with numbers).\n- working in tandem with a squad of ally replica soldiers\n- with a clear, concise, simple objective that isn't stupid\n- You pursue enemies across sandbox like maps- no jack in the box spawn points! Enemies are actually walking around!\n- You are actually made vulnerable at one point; you have nothing but your firsts and you must figure out how to kill a patrol of 6-7 enemies often walking in pairs WITHOUT SLOWMO! A challenge! Well not really, there's an obviously scripted opening in which a pair split up and one of them faces his back to you long enough for you to easily kill him, grab his gun and shoot his partner. But hey, better than any given situation in all of FEAR2\n\nThen fettel gives you hallucinations in which you shoot at ghosts in self defense. When you get back to reality, you see that you have killed your squad. That is a praiseworthy mechanic and story element- or it would be if it were in a different game exploring the effects of PTSD. Here it is simply a convenient way for the game to start being complete ♥♥♥♥.\n\nNow,\n- you have slow mo\n- you have no squad, and everything that moves is your enemy\n- enemies spawn at stupid predefined places as usual\n- You are never again vulnerable / without plenty of guns to choose from\n- it is basically just what FEAR2 was like\n\nQuite disappointing. And alma was in her child form again for some reason, trying to kill you. OK, what? To both points. Why is she a kid again suddenly? Why is she trying to kill you? Why does fettel have you kill your squad rather than just instruct everyone that you're going on a solo mission for a bit? He is a ♥♥♥♥ing commander of the entire replica army after all. Why is alma preventing you, both personally and by way of ordering replicas to kill you, from reviving her dead son? Her son who spent the entirety of the previous game trying to set her free?\n\nThis is really just a jumble of plot points shoved together with minimal effort, providing absolutely nothing new. It's just FEAR2 recycled in no particularly interesting way, and a deliberate "we want more money!" DLC.","March 29, 2014","false","13.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

This is a solid single player FPS gaming experiance.  THe mutiplayer is meh, and people who claim this game has horror is wrong.  I played FEAR 1 and all the DLC, then played FEAR 2 and DLC.  My opinion is not the same as everyone who claims FEAR one is better in every way... I disagee.  Both games are just FPS, kill the other guys shooting at you... then they mix in some scares and ghosts, but this is just shoot people who shoot at you.  I feel FEAR 2 does this better than FEAR 1.  Yes, you lose having quick save and mutiple saves, no lean.  HOWEVER, you gain better levels that look better and play better.  I enjoyed using all the guns, unlike part 1 with cheating AI, I just ran in everyroom with a shot gun, did slow mo and killed everything.  This game I actually liked hiding and shoot with all the guns.  Overall FEAR 2 is more solid and fun, Part 1 felt annoying towards the end.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SCiM/recommended/16450/","SCiM","Chosen One 41","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SCiM/","164 products in account","This is a surprisingly good shooter. It's got the old school health and armor system but there are always health and armor pickups in plain sight between firefights so you never have to backtrack to find more health. The weapons are really nice. You can hold 4 weapons so you can pretty much grab whatever is lying around and not worry about being poorly equipped for the next part and there are only really 1 or 2 weapons that suck and not worth grabbing. Enemies always drop plenty of ammo so you can just fire away. One thing that makes this game stand out gameplay wise is the slow-motion ability. It feels really nice to use, looks cool and helps to stop the game from feeling like a generic shooter. Then there are the spooky parts. While not necessarily scary they do really add to the environment of the game. The game looks very good at max settings and is very well detailed and surprisingly full of colour. While it doesn't massively deviate from the standard shooter genre at the time it shows that shooters can still be different and fun.

The level designs featured rich detail and I appreciated that both objectives and exits were more clearly defined. The makers also kept things from getting overly repetitive by staggering sequences where you use Avatar-like power armor and arenas where you're forced to use your sniping skills. However, the character dialogue was stilted and crammed with poorly utilized profanity, and you have no means to alter the progression of events. In the end, I thought it was a mixed bag much like the original, but still a genuinely entertaining experience and with some very impressive visual flourishes.","December 9, 2011","true","6.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The enemy gets to duck behind cover, blind fire, lean around objects but you don't.  I don't like the play style of more then 2 head shots to kill someone.  I will buy the fact that a helmet could deflect one bullet, but not more.  Most helmets would get knocked off if a high powered shotgun blasted it.  Not so here in FEAR 2.  Also I found myself laughing at the fact that the game tells you to move this heavy table so you can get through a door, but then a chair is glued to the ground and can't be budged.  I loved the atmosphere, lighting, and spooky parts of the game.  That is not enough to keep me playing.  I can't get past the unrealistic combat.  Hell the AI will come running at you while you are spraying them with a sub machine gun.\n\nBottom line: No good, pass on this one if you enjoy realism.  Buy it for some moderate enjoyment of lighting and the games ability to make you jump.","January 3, 2014","false","4.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

This game has all kinds of screwed up ♥♥♥♥ to keep you entertained. You spend much of it witnessing screwed up ♥♥♥♥ happening, or seeing the 'after' side of the picture. Want to nail army guys to walls? You can do that. Want to set them on fire, THEN nail them to walls? That too. Or just blow them apart with shotguns? Oh hell yes. The combat never gets boring. Grenades are good, too, with a very handy five-count GUI. There's a nice amount of different types, too, for an FPS. Standard frag, then shock, then incendiary. I do think there is stun, too, but can't remember. The story is awesome too!

You play as a Delta Force soldier named Michael Beckett who is sent to capture Armacham (the bad guys from 1) president.\n\nThere are some dramatic gameplay changes from the 1st game, and they are all absolutely terrible. No more awesome gunfights with smart AI. Now you just fight waves of dumb enemies. AI is really inconsistent. They go from not even noticing you after you've shot two of their team mates in the same room and circling around a grenade you've just thrown to having the reactions of someone who just snorted crack and with aimbotting accuracy. I will also note they have serious trouble throwing grenades.\n\nAnother change was the removal of peak buttons. This wouldn't ♥♥♥♥ me off so much if this game actually gave you a reasonable amount of health but instead you are forced to hide by corners and pick enemies off. No more running into rooms with slow-motion on. Try that and you better hope you kill all enemies before slow mo runs out. If I really need to manipulate cover, I need more than a press E to flip over a ♥♥♥♥ing table here.\n\nTo begin with the guns all feel incredibly useless. The SMG sounds okay at best, and the pistol sounds like it's less useful than harsh language. The combat shotgun's sound is laughable and pathetic. Even some of the better weapons like the assault rifle, (semi) automatic shotgun and sniper rifle don't feel extremely powerful. There aren't many new weapons. Most of them are re-skins. Only new are the automatic shotgun, sniper rifle and laser gun which are somewhat welcome additions.\n\nThe one thing I thought could save the game was the sections where you get to pilot a mech, but some idiot decided that there should be some grainly filter over the screen that gets even worse as you take damage. It absolutely looked horrible and I found it incredible distracting.\n\nAbout the only thing improved from the original game is the fact that there are more varied environments for levels, but that's nothing if I'm not enjoying the time spent in said environments.\n\nAll in all the gameplay felt like a cookie cutter shooter which needed to give the player one or two more health packs and armour pickups (at least on hard).\n\nStory wise this game is kinda like the first. It gets very predictable, especially if you've played the first game. The scares are the same, although I did feel this game was a little more scary than the first, it still failed to terrify me. Most of the jumpscares were fairly predictable, and there was only so many times that seeing Alma and bloody rooms could be even somewhat unsettling.\n\nAll in all, I'd advise you play the first FEAR game. It runs rings around this game. If you need something else to hit that slow-motion Hollywood badass fix go check out the Max Payne series. The only reason I could possibly recommend this game is if you've played the first FEAR and wish to see how the story plays out.\n\n4/10\n","November 7, 2014","false","13.3"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kinsmarck/recommended/16450/","Kinsmarck","Kinsmarck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kinsmarck/","244 products in account","I wanted to like F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin.  I really did.  As a fan of the original game, I was equal parts relieved and excited at the news of Monolith’s re-acquisition of the F.E.A.R. license.  The masters had recovered their legacy, and I couldn’t wait to welcome Alma back into my nightmares again.\n\nUnfortunately, after finishing F.E.A.R. 2, it became disappointingly apparent to me that in the time between Monolith’s loss and recovery of the F.E.A.R. IP, they forgot what made the original game a genre-defining game, as they have led its sequel into potential-dashing mediocrity.\n\nImmediately, players are introduced to the new player character, Michael Beckett (A.K.A. “Bucket.”  Seriously.), whom we quickly discover that Alma kind of has a thing for…apparently.\n\nBut more on that later.  The mainstay of F.E.A.R. 2’s gameplay is the series’ standout action elements, returning in all their bloody, hyper-reflexive glory.  Sporting smooth, polished gunplay and the return of F.E.A.R.’s standout enemy A.I., F.E.A.R. 2’s gunfights will rarely leave players wanting.  The welcome addition of several new enemy types, new combat mechanics, and the inclusion of a few mech-combat sequences help to keep combat fresh, but have a tendency to completely distract players from any semblance of horror for fairly lengthy intervals.\n\nComplementing these features are modernized visuals and several welcome deviations from the series’ previously monotonous environments. Certain set-pieces, especially the series’ hallmark hallucinations, are surprisingly well-composed, lending F.E.A.R. 2’s presentation a certain degree of artistry.  These features notwithstanding, it should be noted however, that while F.E.A.R. 2’s graphics and level design far surpass those of its predecessor, they only just meet the par of its contemporaries, and the same can be said for the game’s decidedly sub-par multiplayer.\n\nHaving established those things, I feel like I’ve written the rest of this review before.  Namely, Monolith has made a lot of the same mistakes with F.E.A.R. 2 that Timgate Studios made with the Perseus Mandate expansion pack before it.  From the odd choice of departing from the original game’s art style to F.E.A.R. 2’s nonsensical story, the game just doesn’t really feel like a F.E.A.R. sequel, in appearance or spirit.\n\nRelying more upon jump-scares than psychological dread, F.E.A.R. 2’s horror segments are more nerve-wracking than they are unsettling, and this trend infects the story as a whole.  Its departure from Point Man aside, the game doesn’t even seem to remember its own timeline throughout its disjointedly illogical narrative, and many of Alma’s actions throughout the game just come off as arbitrarily forced.   She has no reason, especially early on, to take notice of Beckett, and yet she harries, attacks, and molests him like something out of Navi’s darkest nightmares, keeping many of the game’s would-be horror sequences from feeling more than marginally threatening, and instead lending them an unwelcome atmosphere of uncomfortability.  Seriously, there are segments of this game that are just plain unpleasant to sit through, especially its “twist” ending, which really robs players of any sense of climactic achievement.\n\nAs an FPS, F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is a bloody good time, but as a horror game, much less a proper F.E.A.R. sequel, it falls disappointingly short.  Despite its solid action, its neutered horror and vague, paranormally hormonal storyline bar it from living up to its legacy, and its replay value is middling at best after single-player’s completion.  I can’t say that recommendations come easily for it, especially for fans of F.E.A.R., but FPS junkies like myself may enjoy this momentarily dark departure from the usual fare of run n’ gun action.\n\nRating: 5.8\n\nVisuals: 6\nAudio: 5\nControls & Mechanics: 7\nAtmosphere & Experience: 6\nEntertainment Value: 5\n\nFor more reviews, articles, and videos, visit LastLevelPress.com!","November 25, 2013","true","23.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Dimly lit corridors? check.  Warehouse/crates? check.  BOO! check,  bullet-time? check, Explodey tanks lying around waiting for you to make them go boom, crawlspaces? check! and let's not forget the bit where you're on a train and baddies keep coming at you from another track... etc\n\nEnvironments: Corridors, do you like dimly lit corridors?  I hope you do.  You might be lucky and get some warehouse/crate action!!!  You get released from the tiny outdoor areas a few, all to brief times, then it's back to corridors and subway tunnels (yes, we're back to subway tunnels etc).  There are some better zones later on, big factory settings that at least have some sense of scale, but you wait a long time for them.\n\nShooty Bang Bang: The guns work, not much interest, the assault rifle is pretty much the entire game.  The hammerhead is nice, but no other weapon than assault rifle is necessary for 99% of the game.  Shotguns are cool for the things that charge you like abominations and assassins, but assault rifle is fine for them too.  Weapons that might provide some variety are castrated by lack of ammo.\n\nTank bits are fun, of course, tank bits are always fun.\n\nThe Story: Spooky bits are pretty much eye candy, there's no serious effect on the game, it's a straightforward shooty game with gratuituous spooky effects seemingly tagged on at the last minute to remind you that this is a FEAR game. Yes it does make you jump from time to time, effective in the same way as a screamer video on YouTube.   The levels are strewed with pointless info drops, saves having to script an interesting game I guess, having your plot all scrawled down on little data pads.  Ignore them.\n\nEnemy AI: basic stuff.   You walk along, the game will auto-save to let you know there's a firefight coming, creep, crouch, bullet-time headshot them till they're all dead. rinse-repeat... in corridors.\n\nThe Ending:  Was that an ending? Ummm. ok...  I guess this was an Episode of something...\n\nOverall: Meh, dull, unimaginative, fails to make any use of the IP.","January 20, 2014","false","16.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It's Call of Duty with its only tie to the first game being the little telepathic supernatural undead psycho chick Alma.\n\nAll the highpoints of the first game, the atmosphere, the alternation between fast unforgiving gunplay and atmospheric level progression are not present in this sequel. The first game's expansion packs of Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate were weaker than the original game but far stronger in design + story than this. The Mech suits are interesting but the rest of the game is unoriginal as dirt.\n\nFurthermore, F.E.A.R. core gameplay involves the Replica soldiers, supernatural monsters, and the U.S. Army unit of First Encounter Assault Recon. This game starts you out with a lengthy section of fighting Armachan soldiers murdering Armachan employees. You're not fighting as the F.E.A.R. Point Man or operative (as in Perseus Mandate) but a Delta force squad practically taken from COD: Modern Warfare.\n\nIn conclusion, I would only recommend this game if you're a COD addict and need another cheap fix. The original F.E.A.R. with its expansion packs and F.3.A.R. are better than this. At least in F.3.A.R. you get some interesting gameplay  as Paxton Fettel, the undead brother from hell.","November 22, 2014","false","1.6"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

I can't believe how stupid this series is. I don't really even understand how this game got famous. I guess people watched "The Ring" and saw that this game had a girl that was supposed to be as creepy as the Attack-from-the-killer-TV girl was in "The Ring. (I thought "The Ring" was stupid). But in spite of my hesitation, friends told me to buy this game. I've played it, made the stupid choice to buy the rest of the series and hated every step of the way as friends kept saying "It gets better. It gets bettter."\n\nAnd it doesn't. It gets worse and worse as the developers released expansion packs, you later realize the story of one of them doesn't fit with the rest of the story. So you try to figure out why the story doesn't make any sense and read that the developers decided one of their expansion packs isn't "Cannon" (Meaning, that it's apocriphal. Though it's a story set in the same world, the story isn't accepted into the rest of the series)....\n\nOh -- WELL THAT'S JUST GREAT! So the developers didn't know what they were doing, wrote and made a game that's completely irrelivant, not fun, not interesting and then decides that it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child and that you shouldn't have wasted your money...\n\nDON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF CRAP! I'm going to copy and past this same review for every game in this series...\n\nWhat a HUGE disapointment.

Also, the unnecessary amount of variations for grenades and very poorly written story (or, lack thereof) is in this game, too.\n\nThat aforementioned many also say that this game lacks the fear factor that the first game has. It is an undeniable truth that this is not a good horror game, but the first game isn't, too. Voice of the many bashes this game for only having jump scares, but the first one does, too.\n\nVox populi is also that this game should be cleansed with the righteous fire of PC gamers because this game doesn't have the ability to lean, which the first one has. While it is obvious that the feature is removed for the sake of making the game for consoles along with PC, that feature is completely irrelevant to the first game, to begin with. There is simply no need for leaning, and it isn't even realistic, as nobody trained properly would peek-and-shoot from covers while making entries in as close quarter engagements as the two games depict. There are very few areas that call for leaning in both games, but they are too rare to warrant implementing it.\n\nThis is FEAR 2, a sequel to that mindless shooter.

It still felt like a F.E.A.R. game (unlike the abomination of the third one) with an interesting story (that unfortunately falls apart a little in the second half, and relies a lot on codex entries) great gunplay and A.I., some fantastic locations, great graphics, good atmosphere and scares. The multiplayer itself was actually also pretty decent, with some absolutely amazing maps, free DLC, simplicity, and a fun as ♥♥♥♥ mode called Armored Front (essentially a symmetrical Capture Point style game where each team unlocks a giant mech). Unfortunately, there were no true dedicated servers, an overpowered ASP rifle, and a ranked system that never worked.\n\nOverall, I'd give this game a 8.0/10. It's still a great game that holds up well both on it's own, and with the F.E.A.R. name. Honestly, the worst thing about it is that it just wasn't as good as the original, which is a perfect 10/10 in my book.\n\nI'd give the Reborn DLC a 4.0/10. It's mildly decent, but I'd get it only on a sale. The premise is cool, but it doesn't really go anywhere, so the story is really lacking, and there's like zero scares.

It's been greatly improved since the first game in the series in all aspects. The shooting is way more fun and feels really satisfying, the storytelling is really good and all the smal bits if extra informations you find really adds up to a great experience. The whole music and atmosphear is really improved since F.e.a.r.

Becket, a Delta force operative. The game starts a few minutes before the ending of FEAR 1. FEAR 2 is a lot more polished than the first game, with improved graphics, and interface. The sound effects are great especially with surround sound. The story doesn't really have much to it. It basically consists of you getting from Point A to Point B, while you meet a few characters along the way and pick up intel documents. The first game had a sense of mystery behind Alma in a way that you did not really know what kind of situation you had gotten yourself into. The gameplay in FEAR 2 is still great, with different weapons and grenade types, and AI that still has traits from FEAR 1 such as squeezing the trigger as they die causing their guns to fire off round until the clip empties, or jumping into the nearest body of water when they are on fire.\n\nBottom Line: If you liked FEAR 1 you should definitely get FEAR 2, but don't expect a great storyline.","December 5, 2014","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doommarine64/recommended/16450/","doommarine64","GRAYLEADER","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doommarine64/","7 products in account","F.E.A.R 2 is the second title of the F.E.A.R franchise (not counting the F.E.A.R 1 Expansions or the Vivendi versions), in which, unlike the original game, who's protagonist is the abtly named Point Man, you get to play as a different character, Michael Becket. Instead of Spoiling the entire game, I'll do a TL;DR version:\n\nPEW PEW!! PEW!!\n\nRAWR!!! SCRATCH SCRATCH!\n\nKILL ALMA!!\n\nThe enemies in this game are very interactive, though not on the scale of the god-like AI in the first F.E.A.R... These have been a little "Dumbed" down for more "Casual Players". However, they still have some form a teamwork and overall cohesiveness.\n\nNext, the level design... The beginning might seem boring and linear, but that's only because Alma is leading you... But once you get deeper into the game, you get into more expansive and labrynthine levels who's dark corridors make you wonder what's on around the corner.\n\nNow the "FEAR" factor. Though I am not easy to get frightened, this game did give me a "jumpy feel" like its predecessor... Especially those damn abominations that crawl around and jump like velociraptors.\n\nIf you want a good horror shooter, the F.E.A.R series has always been up to that rank, and F.E.A.R 2 is no exception.\n\nI give it an A/5 Stars\n\nPro Tip- Don't let your mom play it...

The horror element takes a backseat to fast-paced gunfights with the Replicas throughout the middle. However, the game still does well at giving the player plenty of suspense, as some areas (like the school) have excellent story pacing. You never know whether to expect a lot of action or another scare.\n\nThe game was much too short, and the ending was anti-climatic. It didn't feel like a challenge at all.

In the first game, the lead character was imaginatively named Point Man after Gun Man was rejected as being too specific since he can do Matrix style slow-mo kung-fu and kill without guns. Violent Guy was also considered but rejected as being too generic. Neo was already taken. This time you play a special-ops soldier named Michael Becket.\n\nContinuing the story from the first game, the incredibly powerful ghost Alma has just been released from containment. Alma had previous been locked up in a science lab for over 20 years. Naturally being surrounded by nerdy science types for over 20 years and having to endure their annoying and incessant chatter on Hadron-colliders, Star Trek and whether Anakin really had a father or not, has driven Alma completely insane. Her top priorities are understandably to kill everyone (especially nerds) and getting a (non-nerd) boyfriend. Being a violent and vengeful ghost she sees a kindred spirit in trained-killer Becket and falls madly in love with him. Not only is Becket a hunky special-ops type that's good with guns, he's also handy about the house and not a bad cook. Unfortunately Alma being out of the dating scene for over 20 years does not know that the rules of dating have changed significantly since her time. Instead of the more sensible dinner and movie, Alma proceeds to woo Michael by killing all his friends and scaring the bejesus out of him. Tragically this doesn't work out too well.\n\nFor those familiar with the first game, the narrative style is identical and predictable, vacillating between fast-paced action set pieces and slow-burn psychological horror. Slow-mo is back but Mechs are a new addition. F.E.A.R. 2 is a worthy addition to the franchise and fans of the first game will probably enjoy this one.

My main complaint is lack of enjoyable multiplayer and WAY too much Bullettime in singleplayers. You can use it all the time.

Stop sometimes and admire the details.\n+You will be able to take a ride in Titalfall like robot suit (Thermovision included).\n+You now can carry 4 guns instead of 3.\n+The difficulty is about right this time. 1st F.E.A.R was too easy.\n+Game is much more epic.\n\nNegative:\n-Atmosphere is not that great as in first F.E.A.R\n-Ability to lean over the corner removed.\n-Game is less scary. Basically it's call of duty with some scares.\n-Story is still not very involving.\n-Suprisingly AI is dumbed down in comparisson with 1st F.E.A.R\n-Explosions and slowmo somehow less satisfuying this time. Granates look weak.\n-They got rid of ability so save game whenever you want. That's kind of shame. Not because\nit's harder to play this way but because when getting new gun I like to fool around and when reaload game and play it seriously :))\n-A bit dissapointing ending.\n\nDon't get fooled by all the negative things.

The only one of these that really changes the game into a 'rush in the room with slo-mo' is a lack of lean. The first game you have to lean to live, if you don't then you die. although this could be exclusively applicable to the higher difficulties. You could get through the first game just using slo-mo but where is the challenge in that. It's not entertaining to be forced with this sloppy console port.

Great expectations and some slight disappointments. But the Pro's outweigh the cons this time. The game ignores the expansions (Extraction Point & Perseus Mandate) and begins approximately an hour before the climatic end of F.E.A.R. Now... go play F.E.A.R. if you want to know the details of the story. The gameplay is solid and the mix of slo-mo powers along with high levels of combat and gunfights are kept in F.E.A.R. 2 and the paranormal elements are still there, if not as frequent as in F.E.A.R. The story, music, gameplay is amazing, however the MP is lacking the funfactor that was present in F.E.A.R.\n\nBut aside from that, if you want a game with over the top, giant robot mech shooting, crazy slomo explosions and movie moment gunfights along with a sheer brilliant and well blended scare factor (Alma is really freaky) then go ahead and get this game!\n\nAlso!

There are a few instances where you just may get the CRAP scared out of you during gameplay.  It's a very unique blend of feeling fearful, being alone in the dark (lighting is pretty awesome in the game), and being surrounded by very intelligent 'replica' enemies and mutated psycho beings that are all out to get you.  Some really freaky cutscene AND action segments that are bizarre and eerie involving Alma, the weird little girl, so all in all the game is quite fun, can scare you good, and has great action.

However this game uses jump scares a lot so if you're not into that kind of stuff steer clear of it. Although the spooky scare parts are there the games rhythm is well balanced between them and the CoD style shooting stuff. I think I got this game in a bundle so I didn't spend too much on it, overall pretty solid shooter.\n\nI've noticed problems with the mouse sensitivity where the game sometimes ignores mouse movement when the framerate is higher than 60, causing a highly annoying mouse acceleration type of movement.","April 13, 2014","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All the good things from fear 1 were scraped and replaced with utter ♥♥♥♥.\n\nIn fear 1 you can lean. ( no leaning in fear 2 )\n\nIn fear 1 grenades shook the earth and caused mass mayhem as soon as you pulled the pin ( in fear 2 it feels like you're pulling a party popper rather than throwing a powerful grenade)\n\nFear 1 had an AMAZING hud. Every key was mapped out perfectly and it felt like a simple yet incredible game to play. ( fear 2 is antithetical to this and very dissapointing )\n\nFear 1 had good game mechanics and the AI were somewhat smarter then the latter game. ( in fear 2 the AI push over plants for cover. For anyone wondering plants do not make good cover. we're talking about little plot plants here )\n\nTo sum it all up Fear 2 is still a good game but Fear 1 fans will be dissapointed and ashamed to call this a fear game. Despite being an abomination it is still a fear game through and through and i would reccomend it to anyone looking for a good old game. BEFORE YOU PLAY FEAR 2 PLAY FEAR 1. READ THIS AND TRUST ME YOU WONT REGRET BUYING FEAR 1.\n\nYours Truly ( insert steam name here)\n\nEDIT: After finishing the game ( i was half way through when i originally posted) i would still reccomend this and even say its a tad better then i thought. Its still an utterly horrible F.E.A.R. game but its an excellent shooter. The weapons are pretty good and the mechsuits are a nice touch. ( they're possibly the one thing that i wish were in the first game) The graphics have been touched up heaps since the first game. Alma even makes reference to this -----------SPOILERS ALERT---------------------- during the school section-----------. This game feels roughly the average length you'd expect a shooter like F.E.A.R. 2 to be but compared F.E.A.R. it's very short. -----------Just a little note. With the original dlc it wasnt made by Monolith so it it isnt considered Cannon. The distrubiting company that distributed the game bought the rights to F.E.A.R. and made 2 dlcs. Which don't really add much but still werent bad. The dlcs are not worth it by the way however if there is a steam sale i would buy it. I got it for 15 Aus Dollars. Know onto the Reborn dlc. The reborn dlc is really short. If you tried you could complete it in an hour to an hour and a half. Seriously the dlc is only like 5 intervals long with no break ups inbetween each interval. I think in all F.E.A.R. games the intervals were a crucial way to make you feel like you've achieved something because basically most of F.E.A.R. 1 is just one big level which i surprisngly liked.\n\nThanks Again.","September 30, 2014","true","29.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I thought the game started out slow, but as I progressed further, the gameplay and tension drew me in.  Particularly enjoyed chances to pilot a nigh-unstoppable "powered armor" mech, which you can get a taste of in the demo.  If you liked the mid-2000's Doom, you'll find less weapon variety here but more atmosphere (also... fewer monster closets).","June 10, 2014","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Go play Modern Warfare 3, the combat will be more inspiring (if that is believable) and it will most likely be scarier.\n\nBTW, I finished the single-player in about 4-5 hours.

There's a decent selection of unique weapons, gunplay and similar mechanics are fine, walking around in mech suits is fun, and the visuals are pretty damn good if you ask me.\nHowever: The things that are supposed to make this game shine, don't quite manage to do so. FEAR 2 is not a scary game by any stretch of the imagination. It pretends to be on the cover, but it's really just an everyday power-fantasy shooter where you mow down waves of enemies. The occasional jumpscare and spooky halucination really aren't enough to make it feel like a true horror game. Aside from that the story is decent, if a bit cliché at times. Unfortunately any impact the story might have had is negated by its absolutely horrendous climax: A cutscene that strips away any input the player might have had and completely fails to resolve the game's main plotline.","June 18, 2015","false","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's shorter and more streamlined than Fear 1, and certainly suffers from trying to appeal to a wider crowd difficulty-wise, but at least it doesn't have that weird trying-to-get-with-the-times vibe that Fear 3 had. At the very least, the multiplayer for this is basically Fear 1's, but it actually still works because they didn't use a CD key algorithm that limited them to like 3 million keys.","January 31, 2014","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The CORE gameplay of the this game is better than FEAR 1 but the scare factor is waaaaaaay lower than I expected. Alma is not scary at all, there are a few jump scares which to me are just cheesy, I DO like how they have parts of the game where you cant use your flashlight and how some parts are PITCH BLACK, thats cool. I found myself getting goosebumps more than being startled. The first game had me sayng "holy ♥♥♥♥" when I got creeped, this game had me going "... ok" or "woo" dont get me wrong it builds suspense but TO ME it wasnt as scary.\n\nOh well, gunplay is fun and I love the modern version of the fear one guns. I like how you can AIDS but I found myself just hip firing alot since alot of combat is CBQ unless snipers are present. I DONT like the sprinting as I could not get used to it the entire game its stif and im not used to toggle sprint and I did not see an option to turn it off. The controls have changed slightly E is no action instead of F so that was weird and F is now more appropriately flashlight.\n\nI dont like how much easier it is as I only died a total of 3 times and they were all on me, grenade suicide, bus crushed me, fell to my death -_-. Ammo is everywhere and so is armour, I did not get below 2 health packs the entire game. If you are an experienced PC player I would say play on Hard! The game is also ALOT shorter 7 intervals and 7 is mega short, so really 6. The time listed on my profile, take that and subtract 2 and half hours because I was afk. and thats roaming around and stuff not even just run and gun.\n\nPretty solid game, its for sure more casual friendly and thats cool I guess. 8/10","September 20, 2015","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

F.E.A.R. 2 improves on everything and as a result, plays much more smoothly than its somewhat clunky predecessor.\n\nGraphics are crisp and clear, comparable to Max Payne 2, which means they are still holding up rather well today.\n\nSound is excellent, much better than the first installment. In particular, the score has seen notable improvement.\n\nGameplay still rewards a tactical approach to combat, though you no longer depend on your slow-motion ability quite as much as you used to in F.E.A.R. Gunfight are often winnable even without resorting to slow-motion, though using it definitely helps.\n\nF.E.A.R. 2 provides the same type of scares as the first game, so they may sometimes be fairly cheap. Due to the improved visual fidelity, the gore is much more explicite here, however.
