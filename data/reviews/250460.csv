It allows me to play as a slovenly, morally-void government contractor building really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bridges for vehicles for a nation-state consisting of several islands. They have really low standards as to what a bridge is supposed to do, just as long as a minimum of total vehicles get across. Did the bridge collapse after those two cars got across? That's fine, they've already cleared the check and the remaining budget goes right into your slush fund. Smarter contractors than I will take advantage of the game's really weird physics engine to launch cars onto the exit point, therefore saving time, money, and more money. The government finds this acceptable, presumably because they like a good show and will think you are some kind of bridge circus man or wizard. So if you feel like screwing the taxpayer, why not give this game a go?","May 5, 2014","true","13.1"," 111 of 136 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","111","136","4","0"

I remember playing a bridge construction game back in middle school and was insanely fun due to the fact how the player can remove all restirctions and make any bridge, anyway you want. That is NOT the case with this game. There is almost no creative input by the player. There is pretty much one way to make the bridge on each specific level and the game will very rarely stray from the design the game designers had in mind, the smallest change will cause the whole bridge to collaspe. I just wish I had the ability to make a bridge the way I wanted to make it, be free of logic and budgets to simply HAVE FUN, but that is not the case with this game. One might find enjoyment in the way how you have to figure out how to do it, but not me. It's like having a bunch of legos but I'm not allowed to make anything I want to make and I'm not given any istructions on how to make something from a set. For all I know, perhpas there's is a reward of unlimited freedom if one beats this game, but I have lost all patience with this game and refuse to play it anymore.","January 26, 2014","false","1.0"," 65 of 86 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","65","86","0","1"

This was the most frustrating of the three, mainly because a bridge may be successful one time in 10, but for different reasons - jumped funny, strange ramp effects, or tumbling incomprehensibly.\n\nThere are two parts, the main continent and the unlockable slope world.  The slope world is the twist on this version of the game that salvaged the review, as the main continent was simply three bridge designs in different lengths, depending on what supplies you were granted.  Slope you have to think about it, and deal with the crazy physics.\n\nBought in a bundle for about 75c US.  Played for about 18 hours, with 4 of that on just a couple of bridges (see my guide on the worst one IMHO).  NOT worth full retail of US$10, but if you can get it for 2.50 or less I think you will find it to be a pretty decent game.\n\n5.5 / 10","January 15, 2015","true","22.1"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","23","28","4","0"

Some fall under the category 'Games'.  Some fall under the category 'Art'.  But is there a category for an object that falls under both?  There is.  That category is called 'Bridge Constructor'.\n\nPerhaps you think, "No! Bridge Constructor is not an art game; it is an engineering game."  To which I say, "Non Monsieur/Madame/Mademoiselle, non!"  Then I finish my thought in English because that is all the French I know.  Remember, you are not actually constructing bridges in the real physical world (apologies if you thought that this game might let you do that).  You are creating simulations, models, dreams of your inner self.  What you create on screen is you; you are what you create on screen.  I repeat: once you play this game, there will be bridges inside of you.\n\nIt should also be known that this game tells the story of a world.  Do you wonder what drives the cars, the trucks, the tankers?  Wonder no more my friend: it is a race of little insect people.  Ants?  Bees?  Weevils?  I do not know: insects.  All I know is that they cannot fly.  If they could, they would not need bridges.\n\n-------------- The Story of JD7QW --------------\n\nDesignate JD7QW buckled the seatbelt around his carapaced waist, its legs quivering as it did so.  It tried to hide its fright, but even from outside the tanker truck the Planner noticed.\n\n"JD7QW," the Planner said, its mandibles clicking furiously, "this is no time for fear.  You are performing the function for which you were produced, as am I.  By testing this bridge we are expanding the reach of the Colony and celebrating the greatness of the Queen.  That is all we can do.  That is all we shall do."\n\nNot daring to look at the Planner, JD7QW nodded while fixing its gaze straight ahead.  The bridge in front of it was very wooden and very straight.  It also appeared very fragile, like sunlight on water.  How could it hold the weight of the enormously flammable tanker?  "I imagine that there are supports underneath?" JD7QW asked, doing its best to hide its anxiety.  "Steel?  Perhaps concrete?"\n\n"Such questions!" the Planner snapped.  "I will answer, but know that I will be filing a Protest when I return to the Colony."  It shook its engorged head.  "It appears that the Breeders are producing defective Designates."\n\nAgain JD7QW did not dare turn around.  Instead it looked up.  The sky was cloudless and blue, so clear that the ghost of the moon could be faintly seen even in the daytime.  I would like to fly there, the Designate thought suddenly.  Such wonders I would see!  But of course it couldn't.  Only the Queen was allowed to have wings.\n\nThe Planner continued.  "There is no steel.  There is no concrete.  There is wood and only wood.  But -"  The Planner's voice softened.  Surprised, JD7QW peeked over.  The Planner's mandibles had slowed, its multi-faceted eyes had grown clouded and dreamy.  "- but oh, the design, the joins and triangles and descending supports, the interlocking wheels of pressure and release, the. . ."  Caught up in the Planner's vision, it allowed itself to think: Someday I shall be allowed to dream as well.\n\nThen the Planner shook its head.  Its voice turned to jagged stone.  "No more!  You are impudent, JD7QW.  Drive now.  Go."\n\nIt stepped back.  Unwilling and unable to disobey, JD7QW depressed the gas pedal and the tanker truck rumbled forward.\n\nA short segment of paved road lay between the truck and the bridge.  It took both an instant and an eternity to cross.  Then JD7QW felt the wheels beneath him clunk as it rattled onto the wooden bridge, and right away it knew that it would not survive that day.\n\nThe bridge was already beginning to sway, the surface to buckle.  A series of grand snapping noises echoed within the ravine, each one like the shattering of an enormous tree.  The truck began to descend; frantic, JD7QW pressed the gas pedal with all its strength.  The truck jerked forward, and for a moment the Designate thought that the vehicle might simply plow through the air to the other side, an invincible and impossible metal beast.\n\nThen the wooden surface below him imploded, and the truck fell in earnest.\n\nJD7QW barely had time to squeeze its eyes shut, to gag at the vortex in its stomach, when the fuel tank exploded.  Free of its burden, the cab of the truck shot up into the air, and the sudden reverse in sensation caused JD7QW's eyes to fly open in surprise.  And what it saw through the broken windshield was blue, endless blue, with the ghost of the moon traced far above.\n\nIt knew there wasn't much time left.  With legs that were no longer trembling, it pressed the release on the seat buckle.\n\nThe Designate shot out of the vehicle immediately.  Below him, the truck cab had already slowed and was falling back to earth.  But not me, JD7QW thought.  Now I shall fly.  I shall fly to the moon.  And it began to smile as it dreamed of what it might find there.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nThere is a JD7QW inside all of us.  If not for yourself, play this game for it.","April 11, 2014","true","28.0"," 44 of 65 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","44","65","3","1"

It’s a simple premise: You build bridges. In reality it is a puzzle game with many solutions. Each level has a set of materials and a budget to work within, but it is up to you how you want to end up bridging the gap. That’s not to say most of your “solutions” won’t fail miserably. You are also constrained by physics and the properties of the given materials. In addition, it is not enough that your structure simply doesn’t collapse under its own weight; it has to be able to support traffic of different loads. I’ve lost count of the number of times that some trucks barely made it to the other side as my bridge built with spit and good intentions fell into a shattered ruin in their wake. This makes even the failures entertaining as you look what when wrong and iteratively adjust your design until it works. I definitely recommend it to the engineering-minded as it will occasionally force you to think outside the box to solve the problem at hand.","November 17, 2013","true","19.4"," 51 of 83 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","51","83","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/250460/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Bridge Constructor began its life as a mobile app and eventually found its way to Xbox One and PC. The object of the game is about as simple as it could possibly be. It's a literal "point A to point B" journey, but the road between these points, suspended upon whatever combination of triangles and wires you deem to be the sturdiest, is far more complicated. You're given a few tools with which to repair all of the bridges in the island nation of Camatuga, whose bridges were completely destroyed by a recent earthquake. Each level has a specific set of parameters and a budget that you must follow, limiting your options and forcing you to work with what you have.\n\nAs all bridges are different in real life, as are the ones you must build. Some must be supported by pillars, others by wires, your job is to figure out which works best for each scenario. You start off with the simple material wood, and as you progress you unlock the use of concrete, steel and wires. You are limited to the amount of supplies you can use for each bridge, so you must be careful to not go over this limit but yet make a sturdy enough bridge, this is where it can be tricky at times. Now if you don’t feel like building bridges, you can have fun constructing ramps and send cars flying to the other side. This isn’t a very successful way to move forward but it is entertaining to watch.\n\nRealistic physics play a huge role in Bridge Constructor. The player must use different materials, geometric angles, and support points to create a functional bridge that can remain intact once cars, trucks, and semis start driving across it. Each material has different properties, strengths and weaknesses. For example, metal wires are great for dealing with tensile force, but not compressive force, while wood support beams have the exact inverse properties. Players must use all of the tools at their disposal to build a bridge capable of sustaining massive amounts of weight.\n\nThis is a good thing, and no puzzle game should be easy. The only problem is that they're so complicated that you really need some guidelines for what you need to do. The game all too often will spring a level on you requiring a completely new type of bridge that you were previously unaware existed, or an extreme permutation of a bridge you've already made. Sometimes this works, and sometimes it doesn't.\n\nFor example, one level requires you to build a suspension bridge to cross. While never explicitly stating this, you are given several clues that lead you to figure it out. The water level is too high to build the necessary beams underneath. You start to look for ways to support it from above, and notice that you can build some steel beams going straight up from a secondary anchor point on each side of the chasm. These two clues will likely lead players to realize they must use these steel beams to run wires to the actual platform of the bridge. These are what the best moments of Bridge Constructor are: moments of innovation, and not moments of fine tuning and tweaking.\n\nThe biggest problem, in every level, is the allocated sum of money. Players have to build their bridge in a certain budget, and this makes things much more difficult. Not only has the bridge to be strong enough to permit traffic in order to advance to a new level, but you have to make it work by using as little building materials as possible.\n\nThe controls feel very mobile game based whereas it is your standard point and click style building game. When looking at the screen, you notice white dots on the grid lines, these dots are where you can connect your bridges and support. Connecting them together usually grants you a stronger bridge.  Your puzzle solving skills get put more to the test the further you go, where towards the end, trying to build a successful bridge with a tight budget and small amount of materials at times feels near impossible.\n\nBridge Constructor has pretty modest visuals and audio. Neither are bad and are perfectly serviceable and inoffensive, though the music could be better. The game begins with the music muted, actually, which I thought was strange, but after listening to it for a while I went back and muted it again. It started to get a little repetitive. The visuals have been remastered in high definition and though they are cartoony and simple, they're nice and colorful and get the job done. The water actually looks really good on some of the levels in the city.\n\nBridge Constructor is a game that manages to provide a different kind of gratification than other titles. When you build something that actually stands, the feeling is quite unique. It's not like finishing a puzzle, but something more.","March 15","true","58.0"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","0"

Half-finished collision boxes and clipart menu graphics leave a bad first impression, but play into it a bit, and at its core are a collection of solid and well thought-out physics puzzles.\n\nMy main problem with the game is that the physics are not consistent, which can be a severe detriment to a puzzle game (See Bad Rats), but here it doesn't seem to be a problem at all unless you're going for the "Your bridge broke but you still made it" achievement.\n\nI was surprised by the creativity of the puzzles. The first bridge that gives you a "Checkpoint", or a location your vehicles must drive through before reaching the goal, places the checkpoint almost directly below the starting location, forcing you to think up some insane motocross ramp to reach it safely. And it only gets wackier from there.\n\nOverall a thoroughly enjoyable puzzle game, if you like that sort of thing, with only a few problems that almost never seem to get in the way of gameplay.","March 28, 2014","true","4.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

For veterans of the genre who played some of the old hardcore bridge building games though, it not only has a nostalgic effect, but also kinda kicks yer butt in places if you get too cocky. If you have played bridge building games before, you will have an easy and reasonably fun time flying through the first playthrough of the main campaign, which only took me some 2.5 hours.\n\nThe main campaign maps then open up for testing your bridges using the "tank truck", which makes things pretty tough and you have to solve levels differently (with some more budget) compared to your first playthrough! In the Expansion/DLC part of the game, you find some rather different and creative levels that at least to some degree challenge your engrained senses for the rules.\n\nSo while the levels in the first run through the main campaign become very much "seen that before", especially if you're playing them quickly, I am still positively surprised by the game overall. If you like games like this and haven't played any in a longer time, give it a go! If you've played them all, then wait for a sale.\n\nNote: The game's difficulty often doesn't leave much room for errors or poor decision-making. Despite it's cutesy appearance, the game would potentially be frustrating for younger kids without guidance.","July 4, 2014","true","7.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Only three materials here, you can't go 3D here (in Pontifex you could join triangles right between road lanes, here you go only 2D), tehre are no hydraulic bridges (those were fun in the past!), but you can select difficulty in this one.

Each level tests your skills at being able to solve how to build a bridge in a means to get vehicles across. Anybody who knows of a program called West Point Bridge Designer will find this game to be quite similar, but the achievements and challenges presented will hook you right in. While you are able to build a sensible, well-thought bridge that will do the job perfectly, it's extremely fun to be able to build crazy bridges with massive jumps that still transport vehicles. The physics engine is so fun to play around with through each bridge design - launching cars off your "ramps" in the hopes of reaching the end - and the ability to do what you will when constructing bridges to finish each level is amazing.\n\nA game that I strongly recommend to anybody interested in purchasing this game.","July 7, 2014","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But it's a nice game! I've seen some other reviews talking about bugged physics but I just finished every level and nothing weird ever happened.\n\nThe definitely-made-for-mobile interface can be a turn off for some people, but it does its job very well, it's not a poor port. The fact that using the right mouse click is very useful goes to prove that, in my opinion.\n\nSome levels have a 'crazy bridge' sign, meaning you'll need to build some outrageous bridge to beat that level. These are very fun, of course, but the construction method start to feel weak in these levels. Feels like you should have more control over the building, like defining exactly what would be solid and what wouldn't etc (these things are automatically defined depending on the angle and adjacent pieces).\n\nWhile I do recommend this game, judging by the fact that it isn't anything new and it's fairly short, I'd say wait for a sale or something.

Sure you get to build bridges and test to see if cars or trucks can make it across safely or not but after a while it gets repetitive.\n\nWhile building the bridges you do have a spending limit which makes you choose your building material wisely unfortunately you are not granted all of the building material from the get go which is fine. When you do finish building your bridge you get to test it with either a car, trucks or semi trucks. If your bridege can support the heavier vehicles you get a bonus added to your score. If it can't support the heavier vehicles you get to watch your bridge fail, you also get to watch your bridge fail if you did not build it correctly. Another thing you get to see when you test your bridge out is where there is stress. After seeing the areas that have a great deal of stress you can go back and redo that aree if you would like or you can leave it alone. I usually went back and tried to redo the area.\n\nUnfortunately I do not recommend this game at all.","July 4, 2014","false","1.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/250460/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Welcome to Day Four of our Headup Games Gameathon. Today I have the privilege of teaching you how to build a bridge. If things go according to plan by the end of this review I will even have a bridge to sell you! I vividly remember when Bridge Constructor was first released that many gamers dumped it straight into the ‘just another simulator’ basket without ever giving it an opportunity. Then as more and more people actually played the game they realized that it was in actuality a pretty solid physics based puzzle game rather than being the pure ‘just another simulator’ game that had first been feared. Unfortunately, it never received the type of critical attention that the game warranted and so it languished sales wise until it was bundled multiple times.\n\nIt’s a game that is what the title says it is. You construct and design bridges in the hopes that when you test them that they can bear the weight of cars and trucks crossing them. But be careful in your design because if the structural design is poor then they can even collapse before cars or trucks ever reach the first part of the bridge. This is where it works rather well when looked upon as a puzzle game instead of just as a simulator. When looked upon as a puzzle game it works really well a majority of the time.  The bridges that you are required to build are solved logically. I have a friend who designs blueprints for bridges for a living. I asked him to have a play of the game. He couldn’t get enough of it. However, he did make a strong criticism of the game from a purely architectural perspective. He claimed that some of the puzzles, which he agreed is what this game truly is, have some solutions that the game expects you to use to complete the level at the most successful level (there are multiple solutions to (almost?) every level) that would be structurally unsound while some of the true solutions result in the bridge collapsing.\n\nHowever, the game doesn’t expect you to be an architectural designer of bridges and it’s just as much fun, if not more so, if you’re not. Probably the most enjoyable achievement that I’ve gotten in the game was the ‘stubborn’ achievement. In order to get the achievement you need to fail spectacularly 25 consecutive times on the one bridge. I’m not so certain if this makes me stubborn or stupid but I’ll take it knowing full well that I sent innocent little cyber minions to their grisly deaths.\n\nFor those of you who think presentation is everything the graphics, sound, etc. work perfectly well. This isn’t a title where any of that is significant. However, I do love the sound of the bridge breaking apart. I found it quite amusing. In all, however, the presentation is more than suitable for a game of this type and that’s all that really matters. It wont blow your socks off but it just doesn’t need to.\n\nBridge Constructor is an enormously fun game that can be quite challenging at times. But as I discovered with the stubborn achievement there’s success to be had in the most miserable of failures. Now, about that bridge I have to sell you….\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","February 3","true","3.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

You can play it in small doses, but the fun is there if you play it for hours, too. It's not a hectic game, you construct your bridge and press a button to see how it does when cars/trucks/tank trucks drive over it. Watching the physics simulation can be fun in itself, especially when the chaos of the collapse brings unexpected results. If the vehicles reach the goal even though your bridge is collapsing behind them, that earns you an achievement aptly named "throwaway bridge" and I got a broad smile when that happened the first time.\n\nIf you want to go for high scores (build using less materials, in perfection often resulting in a "throwaway bridge" situation) or compare your score on leaderboards, this game has that, too. It encourages experimentation with the construction options you have. And getting the achievements is also fun and 100%ing is possible with some effort but without pain.\n\nThe "sandboxy" character of the game shines when you unexpectedly finish a level because some weird accident happens and the truck gets thrown to the goal while your bridge collapses, or the explosion with the fuel tank truck happens in just the right way to propel its two parts across.\n\nFor the later levels that are tricky and require some experimentation, I found it enjoyable to watch other people's solutions on youtube, often even after I solved that level myself.","January 31","true","29.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

You have a limited amount of resources to create a sturdy bridge that spans a gap.\n\n\nThe good:\n\nI like the idea behind it. As I said, it reminds me a lot of the old The Incredible Machine games, but with bridges.\n\n\nThe ugly:\n\nThe graphics are passible, the music is okay, but a little bland and repetitive.\n\n\nThe bad:\n\nEVERYTHING ELSE.\n\nOh, ho, no. I'm sorry, I'm doing my best to be polite, but this game is entirely unplayable. The physics are just straight-up broken in a game about physics and engineering. Cars go flying for no reason, trucks are magnitized to debris, and the actual construction logic makes no sense whatsoever. You can brace a bridge as much as you want, but it's going to go everywhere.\n\nThis isn't fun. This is the opposite of fun. This isn't even good enough to be an app game.\n\n\nLast words:\n\nI wanted this game to work. I really did. This could have been a fantastic physics simulator. In fact, my friends specifically told me to not buy it, but I did because I believed in the idea. It's just too broken. Even if there was a patch (for everything), I would still doubt this would be playable. At ten bucks, it's a borderline scam.\n\n\nScore: 1.5/10 (and I'm being generous)\nCost: $9.99 USD","August 3, 2014","false","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I can only report this happening once because I instantly came here to point this out in a review, and before now I hadn't even tried such a boneheaded maneuver when things went wrong (I only did it this time to reevaluate what was wrong with the bridge!).  I'm having trouble recommending a physics based puzzle game where you can get different results by trying the same thing more than once (isn't that the definition of insanity?), so I will have to give this a thumbs down.\n\nHowever, I would also point out to prospective buyers that the game actually is a lot of fun, so I'm hitting "no" on a bit of an edge case.  If the game seams appealing to you, you probably should still buy this, it just cheapens the experience a bit to realize that there may be an (indeterminable amount of an) element of pure luck involved here.","July 28, 2015","false","13.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You'll get a little more budget but now there is this super heavy tank truck. Damnit I hate it when it explodes and rips your bridge off into pieces.

The Worst Physics of whenever this game came out. It's cruel that this game is a game you have to BUY WITH MONEY.\n\nAnother thing, the music and sound effects. Basic and annoying.

Theres only 4 matrials to build with (wood, steel, cable, and reinforced towrds) and not a whole lot of scenarios to go with.\n\nIf you just want to see every mission and pass them using the bare minimum of work using cars only the games easy as picking your nose. But it becomes very very frustrating when trying to pass using trucks and the repatition of levels does get a bit annoying in addition to this.\n\nBut its a very simple game with pretty poor but still workable physics simulation, but a problem results from these poor physics when stress points and failure areas sometimes change from run to run though by very small deviations, but enough to make you confused about what the solution should be.\n\nIts a bridge building game. These games are always casual fun and almost always stright forward. Theres a ton of these floating around too.","June 18, 2014","true","6.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\n5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

Gone were two-way traffic, moving bridges, and the ability to adjust the 3rd dimension (bridge width). Overall this version results in a polishes experience that gets it just right. Sometimes it's hard to build a nice bridge, sometimes you can get away with crazy cheap designs. I enjoy it quite a bit.\n\nSlope Mania was fun as well, containing a mix of both hard and trivial challenges.

The story in the game is very straightforward. There has been a devastating earthquake that has destroyed the bridges on the islands of Camatuga and the player is in charge of their rebuilding. The problem for the player is that the available budget for the bridge constructions is very tight, so it is not possible to make too advanced solutions or to use the more expensive materials as much as would be ideal. After building the bridges, they have to be tested by letting some cars and/or trucks cross and if the bridge collapses a rethink of the design is needed. When all bridges on Camatuga are functioning for trucks, the game opens up for tests using heavy tanker trucks on the newly constructed bridges, with an often sad and explosive result prompting a redesign of the bridges.\n\nSometimes the statics of the bridge constructions seem a bit off with collapsing at unexpected places, but usually some engineering common sense and experimenting will solve the problems. It would have been nice to be able to play some of the levels with unlimited budget in order to test some truly exotic bridge designs, but the game is good enough as it is.\n\nThis is not a game to spend full evenings with because of its repetitive nature, but it is a relaxing game to play for a couple of minutes now and then. Quite a bit like sudoku.","September 7, 2014","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's both, although decidely more puzzle than simulation.\nWonky physics and a relatively grueling level of difficulty leave Bridge Constructor feeling quite challenging, mostly due to an overwhelming requirement of imagination. There are many different solutions to each level and they only grow in intensity as the game progresses.\nOverall, a good experience if not a little drawn out. After the first stage there aren't any new materials involved in puzzle completion - just different uses of those materials.

It is very well made, and has beautiful graphics.  While it is a bridge building game, I'm not lying when I tell you it is intense and insane at times.  I have literally yelled at my computer several times when I was only a segment away from making my bridge work with trucks, but it was worth it.\n\nWhile it appears simplistic, it feels realistic.  Although realistic it provides the perfect amount of goofyness to the game to keep me relaxed after my yelling.  The goofyness does nothing to detract from the gameplay, and only adds to it.  I can not express how much I love to play it.\n\nOnly downside is the musical tracks, which pretty much becomes ambient after a while, which really makes it not a problem.\n\nOverall I give it a 9.5/10 due to the linear/limited gameplay aspect of it, but other than that, very well polished and well worth the money spent.\n\nI can dream for a sandbox bridge mode, right ;)?","December 23, 2013","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have your freedom of being able to complete each mission your way with your own custom made bridge but u also feel very limited because there are only 4 different materials to construct your bridge from and it's rare that you even get to use 3 of them at a time (2 in most missions).  but it can also be pretty humerous watching your little cars go flying to their doom or watching them desperatly trying to outrun the colapseing bridge behind them.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/juldans/recommended/250460/","juldans","Juldans","http://steamcommunity.com/id/juldans/","127 products in account","Bridge Constructor is a nice and simple way to waste some time. The story in the game is very straightforward. There has been a devastating earthquake that has destroyed the bridges on the islands of Camatuga and the player is in charge of their rebuilding. The problem for the player is that the available budget for the bridge constructions is very tight, so it is not possible to make too advanced solutions or to use the more expensive materials as much as would be ideal. After building the bridges, they have to be tested by letting some cars and/or trucks cross and if the bridge collapses a rethink of the design is needed. When all bridges on Camatuga are functioning for trucks, the game opens up for tests using heavy tanker trucks on the newly constructed bridges, with an often sad and explosive result prompting a redesign of the bridges.\n\nSometimes the statics of the bridge constructions seem a bit off with collapsing at unexpected places, but usually some engineering common sense and experimenting will solve the problems. It would have been nice to be able to play some of the levels with unlimited budget in order to test some truly exotic bridge designs, but the game is good enough as it is.\n\nThis is not a game to spend full evenings with because of its repetitive nature, but it is a relaxing game to play for a couple of minutes now and then. Quite a bit like sudoku.","September 7, 2014","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Didn't expect much, but it is way better than bridge project. Its almost as good as bridge it but lacking just a few features as far as I can tell. But its still great. Good that it has the finer grid mode so that you can make bridges more accurate just like in bridge it. Doesn't have hydraulics or interactive modes like in bridge it, but enough comparison, this game is great by itself. The world map going from bridge to bridge is nice. The physics are good enough for me. Basically Its nice to have a bridge game other than bridge it that does not suck (bridge project). I'm happy I have this game. Its simple but challenging. Its pretty easy to make a bridge that cars can cross, but when you get higher than that is when the challenge comes in. worth it.

Good that it has the finer grid mode so that you can make bridges more accurate just like in bridge it. Doesn't have hydraulics or interactive modes like in bridge it, but enough comparison, this game is great by itself. The world map going from bridge to bridge is nice. The physics are good enough for me. Basically Its nice to have a bridge game other than bridge it that does not suck (bridge project). I'm happy I have this game. Its simple but challenging.

The game does little to show you which structures you should be thinking about (other than triangles), and often you might not really see if something is working that 10% better than your other builds, and that's often a crucial difference. It also doesn't really explain what materials might fare better beyond the absolute basics of (steel is stronger than wood), and it would've been awesome if they did more to show how the rope can help to support tight budget bridges by connecting along the underside of your bridge from end to end. I only know it distributes weight better this way because some walkthroughs used it. Other materials can be a bit fiddly with load distribution depending on how you've arranged them.\nI have played through a bunch of this game and BC: Medieval and while I like both just for the physics puzzle challenge, I find the Medieval one's solutions end up making more sense than this one. It still barely guides you but at least those structures kind of make sense.\nIn this version you can build diagonal roads (which might be the only way to solve some of these bridges, it's certainly the only way I could find for some) and they end up letting you hold them up with ropes from nonsense structures on the sides because the stone pillars are too expensive or not available.\nI still recommend it because I've enjoyed it either way, the physics are simple but pretty consistent, and it's a good little brain work out, but if you want a well-paced puzzle game with some actual help on what to do, this game fails a little on that front. I personally looked up a few answers and still enjoyed trying to figure the level out before I gave up.","May 25, 2015","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My only complaint is that it is in some SERIOUS need of some new game modes or DLC. Namely, in the form of a campaign mode that allows you to earn money based on how much traffic your bridges receive. With the toll money you make, you could build new bridges capable of handling more traffic and larger vehicles, allowing you to earn more money. This game, however, has none of that. Sometimes, you are constrained by a budget that only allows you to build the most laughable of temporary throw-away bridges that crumble on the first use. It also limits your options for construction materials seemingly arbitrarily. It really limits the fun factor. I'm all for a challenge, but when you want me to build a bridge tp cross a 300 foot gap with no support columns in between made of wood that can support a multi-ton fuel tanker-all on a budget of 30,000 dollars-that's where i draw the line. All I'm saying is GIVE ME OPTIONS. Limiting the building materials and budget only limits my creativity. So despite all this, why am I recommending this game? Because you get to build bridges, fool!

Nothing special, but certainly not bad either. Only thing that made me not like it so much was the dangerous files that followed. My entire computer was at stake because of these files, and I just could'nt seem to figure out which. Then I found these 2 files related to bridge constructor (in form of a high risk threat).

There's poor feedback about where your bridge went wrong, and sometimes the bridges seem to break apart unexpectedly.\n\nAnnoying: If you want to exit, and goodness forbid you're building or testing a bridge when this happens, you have to go through 4-6 screens to exit properly. In addition, while you can turn off the annoying music, you can't turn off the annoying and quite loud sound.\n\nIn conclusion, Poly Bridge is still early access, but it feels much more polished than this.","December 30, 2015","false","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is fun at first.... then compulsion sets in and you NEED to make things work. I don't think the physics are too well done. My job is in construction. I like to think that after 10 years, I have a pretty good handle on construction physics. The arch means nothing to this game. The rest of the physics seem well done. You figure what the game wants to work, then mix and repeat, over and over and over.\n\nIf you can grab this for $5, Go ahead! But...... I don't think that it is fully worth $10.\n\nI was spoiled with World of Goo. Buy that instead.
