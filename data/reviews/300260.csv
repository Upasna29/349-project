It is worth approx $1.99 in its current skeleton state. This product is barely in pre-production Alpha stage.\n\nWARNING\n\nPlanetoid Pioneers is not a game in its current state it is not even a demo it is more of a Showcase of what can be done in the future and has very limited liability and almost no content.\n\nWith that said, the game is beautiful and I have high hopes for its future if the developer and the community can unite and build a wonderful game together a game that is what Cortex Command should have been.\n\nI cannot write a negative review of this game because you are clearly warned in the intro video not to buy this game therefore I must give a positive review using forward-thinking and hoping that this game will eventually become good, I pray to God that it will one day be finished, unlike its predecessor, Cortex Command.\n\nYou may wonder why does my review not contain specific information about the gameplay well the reason is there is literally so little content that I have nothing to say because there is almost nothing there.\n\nWARNING\n\nDo not buy this game unless it is two to three years from now and you're reading this review and the game is actually completed.\n\n","April 17","true","17.9"," 39 of 52 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","39","52","5","6"

This is a game engine.  A wonderful 2D game engine that has that Cortex Command physics, pixel eating magic, kind of procedural character movement.  From the guides looks like easy to make objects and characters, LUA scripting, sharing via workshop (embedded in PNGs), level (terrain) editing with all kinds of deformations to make your round planets with caves and radial gravity (I think that's what it's called with gravity in the center of the planet), or regular gravity to make a side scrolling game or level, or no gravity for a top down game or level.\n\nThere is a learning curve, maybe more because of the LUA scripting if you are dumb like me, but so far having fun just blowing up stuff, playing with the rovers, the grappling hook, the jet pack, the different guns that are already in the game (like the bee gun).  I am going to try to learn some scripting and make something terrible.\n\nIf you like playing with game engines as much as games and have $40 burning a hole in your pocket this might be for you.  If not, just wait a couple of years for the game this engine creates.

Currently, it doesn't have ALOT of content, but still fun.\nThough, buy now if you want to make mods and get access to the editor.\nAnd please do not complain 'this game is soooooooo barebones, why did you even release it' on the forums.\nI also got it by being in the pioneer program and making good stuff.","May 14","true","1.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Easy to use, feature-rich interface, along with a large programming library.\n\nI went into it to collaborate and to get myself drawing more. The $40 tag is a bit high, but I figured it keeps the millenially challenged out. hehe","May 15","true","43.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

You can create things from flying Donald Trump heads that drop acid money bombs, to tanks with AI. IT'S JUST CRAZY. The engine is easy to learn, but (maybe) hard to master. I have had so fun making things for the game and I encourage everyone to do as well (or at least try) . The community is very nice and helpful so if you need help making something, don't be afraid to ask. The devs are also really cool people and have worked very hard on bringing this to life. Also, if you are planning to buy 'Planetoid Pioneers', please read the "About This Game" section. Anyways, great game, tools, community, and devs.","April 16","true","10.7"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","11","24","0","0"

At another point, I was almost at the end of the tutorial level when my gappling hook smashed my head into a cliffside,  then my eyes rolled into the back of my head.  I watched as my body dangled back and forth.  I tried the starting planetoid again, I set myself on fire and lost.  The rest of my adventures include me being blasted in half and crushed.\n\nI reccomend this game because of the endless possabilitys.  I got into the blueprint editor and made a creature from scratch.  Now all I have to do is learn lua script.","April 17","true","4.5"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","45","9","20","3","0"
