In this case, “Age of Mythology: Extended Edition” is nearly identical.  Everything from the character models to the level design remain the same.  Don’t get me wrong, it looks much prettier than I remember it…but aside from the extras, you’re getting the same game you played years prior.  Same scoop of vanilla ice cream if you will, but with jimmies and chocolate syrup on top.  Shadows, lighting, water effects, time of day, antialiasing, ambient occlusion…all great additions, I just wish there was a bit more.  Twitch users will be pleased to know that there is Twitch integration, though I personally haven’t tried it to know if it works.\n\nWith that being said, I do appreciate the remake, even if it’s almost the same game as I played years ago.  Seeing the updated graphics was nice, though I admit the appeal was mainly centered around the fact that I didn’t have to enter my blasted serial key each time I wanted to install the game.  I also don’t have to worry about managing discs…all three products (“Age of Mythology”, “Age of Mythology: The Titans”, “Golden Gift Campaign”) were all condensed into one nice, easy to boot up package.  It’s hard to justify that convenience into a thirty dollar price tag however, the going rate as of 4/29/14.  If you’ve never played “Age of Mythology”, love RTS’s, and don’t mind the outdated character models/interface, then picking this up is most certainly worth your time and money. If you have your own playable copies of the game from years ago and want to know if buying the extended edition for the effects is worth thirty bucks, then I’d have to say (with heartfelt regret) no.\n\nFull Review:\n\nhttp://www.dadsgamingaddiction.com/age-of-mythology-extended-edition/\n\nGameplay Video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLKUz_BB5bo\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyoGGGBm_ug\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REM2eLhoi0Q","April 30, 2014","true","3.9"," 1,808 of 2,070 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","808","2","0","158"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shafatR/recommended/266840/","shafatR","Raysh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shafatR/","655 products in account","Age of Mythology is the classic, mythology based spinoff of Age of Empires, and boy was it fun. But does Age of Mythology  Extended Edition live up to the original? In many ways, very much so, though the price tag might dissaude you unless you're a huge fan, (like I am).\n\nIf you've played Age of Mythology before, you know exactly how this game works. If not, here a basic gist of it. It plays much like Age of Empires 2; you have to collect resources, specifically food, wood and gold, in order to fund your armies, economies, technologies and advancement. sounds basic enough, and all the races work similarly in regards to these resources. The difference comes in the fourth resource: Favour. Favour is generated differently depending on which race you are playing. For instance, the greeks generate favour through worship, the egyptians through building monuments, the norse through heroes and fighting, and the atlanteans through having more settlements.\n\nFavour is the special resource, which ties into the major mechanic of Age of Mythology: Gods and God Powers. There are 12 major gods, 3 for each of the races, and these determine starting bonuses for you when you start the game. the gods also have minor gods to choose each time you advance an age, with a total of 36 minor gods, each offering different bonuses and god powers. For instance Hades gives you the Sentinel God Power, that creates stone sentinels to watch over your town centre, but in the second age, you can choose Athena, who allows you to train minotaurs and the Restoration God power which can heal your units.\n\nAside from the new favour mechanic, for the major part it plays like the age of empires games. Build Army, upgrade, and take care of your population cap and economy. Rock paper scissors, for basic units, (cavalry beats archers who beat infantry), but add heroes and myth units which can turn the tide of battle. Both the singleplayer and multiplayer are fun, and with the new release, there is a rebirth in the multiplayer, though not as big as the heyday of AoM.\n\nAs being essentially a remake (a la Age of Empires 2 HD Edition), AoM:EE is actually fairly bug free, and while it definitely shows its age, the added subtle lighting effects, water and shadows do help to make look better. It is definitely very playable, and for fans of the original, it shouldn't even be a bother.\n\nThe campaign is just as memeroable as always, a hunt through Greece, Egypt, Scandinavia and finally Atlantis in order to stop a power hungry cyclops from releasing Kronos, King of the Titans; followed by A New Atlantis, set a number of years later,  where you are tricked into releasing the Titans, and must stop them at all costs .\n\nOverall, Age of Mythology: Extended Editon is fun, unique and offers up plenty of value, with 50 singleplayer missions, skrimishes, and now revived multiplayer, though for those who still have a copy of Age of Mythology and The Titans expansion, it might not add a great deal. Definitely recommend everyone else (who's a fan of older RTSes).\n\n","November 16, 2014","true","49.6"," 261 of 288 people (91%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","91","261","288","6","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OriginalC/recommended/266840/","OriginalC","John","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OriginalC/","52 products in account","Ordinarily, I don't write reviews - but I've always been pretty invested in the Ensemble Studios games and seeing what Microsoft and Skybox have done with one of their all-time legends has pushed me into comment.\n\nAge of Mythology: Extended Edition. Ordinarily, to extend something means to prolong it or make it bigger somehow but if you're hoping for new content, this game does not have any. It's just the same game you played back in 2003 - but that's not so bad, because that game was great. This however, isn't - and there's some vital reasons as to why:\n\n1 - The Multiplayer.\nThe most important aspect of any Real Time Strategy game is its multiplayer community and Age of Mythology has always had a creative and thriving one. This Extended Edition would too - if the multiplayer actually worked. You don't need me to tell you, just go check out the Support forum for this game. The game suffers from consistent crashes, desync, stuttering, framedrops and lag when attempting an online game. The developers blame "ancient bugs" left over from the original game despite the fact that none of these bugs were actually present in the 2003 release and accusing the now defunct Ensemble Studios (thanks Microsoft) for being responsible for your own mistakes is downright cowardly. disrespectful and lazy especially seeing as you're now flogging their product to an unaware market.\n\n2 - The Single Player.\nThe AI during Single Player matches is bizarre, eclectic and at often times completely incomprehensible. Prone to suddenly stopping all activity halfway through a match for completely banal reasons (there was no food in their line of sight, you spawned too close to them etc) every Random Match is essentially a roll-of-the-dice of whether or not the AI feels like playing along this time. This problem has only been made worse by the addition of the new, COMPULSORY DLC which has 'updated' the AI to coincide with the introduction of a new civilization. Unfortunately, those who don't purchase the DLC are still obligated to download the patch, meaning they suffer from all of the bugs whilst receiving none of the reward.\n\n3 - The DLC.\nMost likely what drew you to this Steam page in the first place seeing as this game hasn't seen a real increase in playerbase in almost a year. I followed the development of the DLC for a good few months and have been heavily invested in it. The attitude of the developers and their 'effort' as far as producing quality content goes is detestable. Aside from the rather invested and community-involved attitude from those at ForgottenEmpires (a small team of fans), comment and involvement from the lead developers (Skybox) has consisted of grade-1 ♥♥♥♥-all. They spent a good few months assuring us the DLC would contain strictly new, fresh content without any reskinning, repackaging or rebranding of existing content and that turned out to be a complete lie. They also lied about having playtested the game for balance - admitting during a public streaming of the game (you can find it on Youtube) that they purposefully left the DLC broken and unbalanced as a means of making people have to play it. The DLC itsels is incredibly broken as of writing this (again, check the Support forum), with half the playerbase unable to access the DLC at all and the other half jokingly trying to laugh off the regret of their purchase.\n\nOne of the developers admitted on the Subreddit that they are currently "using the public to beta test the game" - meaning that if you buy this DLC you are not getting content, you are buying into the opportunity to test unfinished content. This coupled with the fact that the developers openly laughed at the idea of fixing the Multiplayer (again, check the stream) tells me that we aren't dealing with incompetent developers - we're dealing with scam artists.\n\nI don't like having to write this sort of stuff about any Ensemble Studios IP because it sucks seeing their legacy ♥♥♥♥ on by untalented coat-tail riders, but if it means discouraging people from wasting their money on what is essentially a gigantic bug test, then it feels somewhat worthwhile. Only buy this if you absolutely *must* play Age of Mythology again and don't want to go through the effort of pirating the old copy and getting it to work - but know that this is not the Age of Mythology you played ten years ago and it certainly is not a well-supported or active game.","January 29","false","98.9"," 447 of 526 people (85%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","85","447","526","14","15"

Definitely had to re-write my review since my other one was made after 30 gameplay hours.\n\nAge of Mythology takes you into one of the most unique and timeless RTS experiences I have ever seen. You have to pick between 4 civilizations: the Greek, Egyptian, Norse and Atlantean - each have 3 major gods to pick from. There are 4 ages to guide your civilization through, each of which unlocks new buildings, upgrades and units.  Each of these presents you with two choices for minor gods that you can worship. Every time you choose a god(including the major god), you will unlock a god power that can be used only once (up to 3 times if you're Atlantean) as well as a mythological creature or two that are associated with your god choice + unique upgrades. These god powers can change the tide of the game entirely.\n\n\nEach civilization is completely different in their design, and there can be differences between identical major gods as well thanks to the minor god system.\nThe units classes featured are infantry, cavalry, archers, siege, heroes, mythological creatures and ships. The game makes these interact in a rock-paper-sciccor mechanic.\n\nThe campaign is very high quality for its time, it can be highly entertaining even now, though. A total of around 50 missions is more than any RTS game will give you. The voice acting is great, though the dialouge and the plot get cheesy at points.\n\nGraphically, the shadows, the water improvements, the map texture improvements are nice, but they cannot hide the dated models and textures. I wish those had been areas of focus when it comes to visual improvements. The lighting is terrible in a few cases, so I would recommend turning the "lights on units" option off, as it's the worst of all new features. FXAA and water refraction aren't too helpful either, but to each their own.\n\nThe multiplayer is awesome design vise. A multitude of game modes, custom scenarios (aka minigames), supremacy(standard mode), deathmatch(high starting resources, all upgrades researched) etc will definitely keep you hooked for months, if not years. Multiplayer performance, while improved via patches, is still not perfect, but definitely playable. Just make sure you don't run on an integrated graphics card. If you have both an integrated card and a dedicated one in your system, make sure the game defaults to the dedicated one via your driver.\n\nAs for the competitiveness of multiplayer, ranked games are available via a matchmaking system that will attempt matching you against player of similar skill. Most, if not all methods of abusing the system have been dealt with by the developers.\n\nOverall I am happy with the game, but it could have been so much better.

The campaign and its storyline is great, the factions are unique and well fleshed out and balance, for the most part, is achieved with some minor discrepencies/exploits which with experience can be learned to be countered.\n\nI will say that the game is not in its glory days anymore as this IS a re-release of a fairly old title. But the multiplayer is also active enough to have a competitive community and there is a revival in the scenario community to experience a taste of the legacy of AoM mapmakers, I suggest looking on http://aom.heavengames.com/downloads/ for more or the Steam workshop downloads provided.\n\n\nBut lets start with the actual meat of the game for anyone reading for determining whether to buy this:\n\nThe Extended Edition brings many new improvements over old Age of Mythology and the Titans expansion included, water and other graphics are overhauled and improved significantly. Graphics in general have been improved over the original and the game looks much more vibrant and detailed. This makes playing the singleplayer campaign, which is still one of the better campaigns of an RTS I have played, much more enjoyable.\n\nA new online server is also available for multiplayer gameplay and while its nowhere even close to the glory days of ESO in terms of activity and the amount of scenario makers, some old faces are there both in competitive gameplay and with old mapmakers, and some newer map makers such as myself have been sprouting up. In terms of connection these days it really depends on whose actually in the game but as long as you're computer isn't a toaster your connection and running of this game should go forward without a hitch.\n\nHowever there is still some bugs that are highly irritating that remain. Desync errors still happen too frequently for my tastes and this wouldn't be so much a problem if it didn't lower the rating of those involved in ranked matches. When someone is on the verge of victory and then a desync error occurs to make them lose rating... its understandable someone would be angry.\n\nThere is also more visible lag and connection issues between players then there was on the old AoM in certain instances, such as on certain scenarios or with people with very bad connection to begin with. And the Extended Edition is notable in how it actually lags your computer- some of us may remember we could browse the internet with Age of Mythology running in windowed mode or running other programs while we wait for a game; while this isn't prevented and is still possible the speed of which you do so is stifling and I would not recommend it at all now. (Nor would I recommend it in matches even back then, but if you're in lobby just idling, waiting for your friend to host that game...)\n\nI suggest if you are buying this, do not play on your toaster or similar dinosaur computer, this is an updated version of Age of Mythology meant to be played on semi modern machines.\n\nAnd as for scenario editors who wish to return to making maps for this game: The online multiplayer community is in desperate need of scenario revival. There is scenarios still being played from time to time but the newer population of competitive players is either unaware of most of the maps or simply do not host them, mostly the former. As for the editor itself, for all intents and purposes its more or less the same as what we know, but there is some notable differences now.\n\nThe differences boil down to some old trigger techniques not working, and now causing horrible lag. The old trick of looping Move Army To to move your spawned units to a location, looping it within the trigger editor now causes horrible lag and no longer just simply makes them keep moving there. It acts as if the computer stops their units and tells them to move there, acting as if the loop was just restarting and stopping the order instead of merely continuing it as it did in the past.\n\nThere is also UI changes to the editor, and while the function is largely the same it takes a bit getting used to. I can say with confidence though the editor is still fairly user friendly and easy to learn, though trying to find experienced mappers to help you with your project is a little difficult in terms of looking on the lobby- you'll have to consult various forums like AoM heaven or pitch it on the steam forums for this game somewhere. I myself can help with things too, and even old legends like Nottud are still around if you look...\n\nSo it boggles down to this, overall: Should you buy this game if you are new, and should you buy this game if you already have age of mythology, the original and its expansion, to relive your nolstalgia?\n\nIf you are new, refer to the top. Yes.\nIf you are an old and musty returning player like me, Yes, but don't expect it to be total brass and shine throughout the entire game. There is some grime to be worked out with this still but I can say with confidence there has been legitimate work and attention on this game to improve it and fix bugs.\n\n(p.s Potato, if you review my review im going to shoot you and feed you to a chimera, not only was your review pointless, it was awful in its critique and if anything uninformative. No one cares about grammar to that extent, it's all about presentation, and the clarity of my review was fine. That is all :D )\n\n","October 1, 2014","true","287.1"," 126 of 139 people (91%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","91","126","139","8","0"

If you are at least marginally into RTS, this is a game you shouldn't miss.\n\nIf you are new to AoM, you're in for a good old real-time strategy experience that shaped the world of RTS gaming, all in a fun mythological setting. Specific mechanics like god powers and mythological units make the gameplay unique and interesting, bringing different style, but with the same basics, to the whole of "Age of" franchise, the paragon of strategy gaming.\n\nIf you played the original, you're going to get the same great gaming experience, but with some extra goodies. Obvious are enhanced graphics and support of today's resolutions (I've been playing on 1920x1200 with no problems) - the graphics take a while getting used to as there are some harder to discern things due to the new lighting and colour scheme of map backgrounds, but overall the change is nice and adds to the game, making it more attractive for first timers.\n\nThe most important addition is revitalisation of multiplayer through Steam, which looks just like old ESO. You have Quick Search for random matchmaking, advanced games for all your fun and scenario games, chat lobby and they added Leagues and Events. They've also included Treaty mode (ceasefire until certain amount of time) and the option to disable Titans (the unit). You can check the video I made about the Multiplayer Online Lobby\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqrHJFDpsa4\n\nAnother fun thing is the Steam Workshop and the fact the game has been made more friendly to modders. AoM community has always been full of talented people producing fun and useful content like various UIs and custom scenarios, and even before launch, there are mods already trickling in. Plus most of the original custom scenarios should work even on AoM:EE, so no real way to get bored with this game :-)\n\nLast thing in need of mentioning is improved support of Observer Mode and streaming - you can now see various in-game stats of players like resources, upgrades in process and similar in an easy to navigate table to give you a better idea of how are the players doing, and you can also switch to players' perspectives. This same interface works in recorded games, so you can analyse even those.\n\nAll in all a nice remake of a great game. If you loved the original, you'll enjoy this, if this is your first time with AoM, you'll enjoy it, too :-)\n\nIf you'd like to see the game in action, check my livestream http://www.twitch.tv/blackaddersplays and the videos on my YouTube https://www.youtube.com/BlackAddersPlays\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBzu-iC5B44\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSACbmGcOA","May 8, 2014","true","113.4"," 263 of 340 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","263","340","0","5"

The expansion added campaign following the original is fantastic as well. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=353515278\nYou can live without the dwarves focused one, while it has some fun ideas for maps it's short, easy and lacks any real depth . The main problem I had with these in the newest steam version was that the graphical quality seems to have been dramatically reduced.\n\nThe day and night cycle is over rated and really serves no point, if anything I found it broke the game up more and turned it off.\n\nMultiplayer is fun but expect to play against strong players.

They knew there were going to be problems with this game upon release, it is disgusting to think that any company would release a product which is not up to scratch especially since the game was already released. I didn't pay the already expensive price to play a beta of a game that already exists. They have not delivered in my opinion, the AI is still terrible, the Multiplayer is lagging (reason I bought this game) and the frame rate is questionable for a game like this, the lighting effects are nothing special if not distracting and the menus are different (compared to the originals) but either way, re-mastered or not, the menus fulfilled their purpose, to be menus. I don't see how this warrants at £20 price tag. To make matters worse me and my friends are encountering problems with the steam overlay which is hindering our multiplayer experience. The steam workshop is also not working.\nI do not recommend buying this until the price drops and the problems with it are fixed, I will not trust this company again I thought AOE2 should have been a good indication of how they handle projects like these, I feel silly to have used the benefit of the doubt.\n\nAge of Mythology (when it is working) however is an excellent strategy game for competitive play, the multiplayer is excellent and the different civilizations are unique in terms of units, technologies and strategies that can be applied, it makes for a fresh experience on an age old formula, If only they continued after Age of Empires 3.","May 9, 2014","false","15.7"," 218 of 312 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","218","312","0","8"

I feel like the features it has does not suit the $ 30 , if you are planning to get it I recommend getting it during a sale. It is fun, especially playing with friends and having to pretend to talk to the AI, they say some of the ugh.. stupidest things sometimes lol "JUST SHUT UP CORNITH" (god I hate Cornith lmao) The game is pretty basic too, collecting your basic rescources like wood, gold and food, building up your army to massacre other teams. One annoying thing is as soon as you take over a team you have to make sure to destroy their buildings and kill EVERY unit they might have. this is especially annoying due to the fact that sometimes they have one stupid fish boat swimmin' around somewhere in the ocean and you have no idea where it is.\n\n*Overall, I`d say this game is worth your time but not worth the full price!\n\nTL;DR : annoying wierd AI, really fun, basic game and ♥♥♥♥ you Cornith\n","January 5, 2015","true","9.6"," 72 of 91 people (79%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","79","72","91","17","5"

That said, if you are interested in single player or have amazing internet connection, go right ahead.\n\nIn Short - There is a compounded latency issue. Animation quality is directly proportional to connection quality. One player with a bad connection (Or a large number of players) will slow your game. And when it slows down your game, it slows down everything causing animations to lag and glitch. They’ve updated the server client code in the Extended Edition, where they didn't need to (causing terrible bugs).\n\nIn Long: Instead of a dedicated server setup. AOM now uses a peer to peer connection. The Pros are that you don't need to create servers, or port forward. But the downside is that the next iteration of the game cannot continue until every player has received information from every other player.\nThis means that with more players, more information is required to be sent before a game iteration occurs. Additionally, with one player with a high latency, that latency affects every single player within the game. Currently with this problem, AOM game speed slows down, affecting EVERY SINGLE ELEMENT OF GAMEPLAY. This includes MODEL ANIMATION (Imagine bad connection = laggy and glitchy character models).\n\nHowever, this game would have been fine it they either:\nWhen the game speed is slowed down, change the timings of the model animations to match the new game speed (Just play on lightning speed to compensate).\n…Or just kept the old dedicated server engine for AOM.\n\nIt saddens me that I cannot play this game reasonably with my friends, and I don’t want others to be disappointed. Considering that we all pre-paid, none of us can get a refund for the game we bought.

As a game, it's wonderful and has stood the test of time. You have a wide array of very different strategies and tactics you can use, the different races all feel substantially unique from one another, and you can pick various major and minor deities to worship which each tweak your play style to suit your individual preferences better!\n\nThe units are fairly unique from one another, there's lots of interesting mythological things like giants, pegasi, sphinxes and so on, and the economic aspects are rather enjoyable as well, which is rare for a strategy game. For an example of the economic stuff, look to the egyptians who can have their pharoah empower a building to make it build faster or boost the resources given to it, or that the atlanteans carry carts with them so they don't have to wander all the way back to town to drop off resources.\n\nThere's always sort of a rock/paper/scissors thing going on, and no one unit is overpowered... buuuuut. Ah, yeah, there's always a but isn't there? It's a big fat butt in this case. Several of them.\n\nWell, some of what I just mentioned isn't super accurate. A lot of the units are very, very similar with little difference at all other than their stats - special abilities are pretty much reserved for mythological units and the god powers can only be invoked once per game instead of on a cooldown so they're not that impressive most of the time. Generally speaking, your units may look different and be better tasks, but one soldier is pretty much the same as any other soldier, other than what they do bonus damage against.\n\nThat's another issue... the "balance" of the game, if you can call it that, is kind of wonky. If you look to other strategy games, such as the blizzard games of warcraft 3 or starcraft 1 or 2, the difference between being "good" against another unit or "bad" is generally 150% normal damage vs 50% normal damage in return. It's a significant difference and makes it possible for masses of units to fight things they're not that good against so long as you severely outnumber them. In AoM... well, you get things like a x15 damage multiplier... it's kind of absurd. If you aren't fighting something you deal bonus damage to, you may as well not be fighting at all.\n\nThis balance also has the problem that the "rock, paper scissors" moteif that AoM has going for it kind of breaks down with mythological units. Oh, you like your sphinxes? Too bad. Sure, they look big and strong, with much higher stats than normal infantry... but if the enemy has even a single hero, the bonus damage from heroes to myth units is so absurd that you may as well never bother making myth units. Especially against the greeks who have some of the most powerful and cheapest heroes which take forever to kill since nothing does bonus damage against heroes. The game claims normal infantry are the counter to heroes, but they really aren't.\n\nThe AI and mechanics make turtling not an overly useful strategy as well - all, literally all defensive structures deal piercing damage, and siege weapons usually have 80-99% resistance to piercing. Walls are easily destroyed, and the AI just sends wave after wave after wave of the same small units over and over so you'll probably never be able to rebuild a wall once it's damaged, even with the silly fast building speed in the game. So if you like to turtle and just tech up for long periods of time, you're going to find it's a nuisance - not difficult, just annoying, especially since the AI tends to ignore military units to attack peasants mindlessly. You can work around those things, but it's irritating instead of fun.\n\nStill, the game is fun as a whole. There's no denying that. As strategy games go, even for the minor nuisances it has, it's still one of the best, and by far the best of the age of empires series by leaps and bounds over any other. Yeah, the game balance is a bit wonky, but it sorta kinda works still. Really, it's fun in a way that more serious games like starcraft aren't. Starcraft II has by far a better campaign mode, but honestly I'd say the skirmishes in AoM are vastly superior to the skirmishes in SC2 surprisingly enough, and I have a platinum rating on SC2 so make of that what you will.\n\nSo if the game's still very fun after so many years... what's wrong with it? Why the downvote?\n\nWell... this version... sucks, to put it mildly.\n\nExample: do you have a computer that can run Evolve at 120FPS? Well expect to have dips below 10FPS on AoM.\n\nThe "new features" are things that honestly have no real impact on the game. A tiny little mini campaign is kinda... nice I guess? But let's be honest, the vast bulk of a strategy game's lifespan and value comes from its skirmish mode which this doesn't change in the slightest. The day night cycle is... negligible, as is much of everything else.\n\nThe glitches that are brought, such as crashes, freezing, framerate drops, and actually a significantly reduced AI kind of diminish the game. The original was better because it actually worked. This version... you've got a 50/50 chance of finishing a mission without it being finished for you by a glitch of some sort or another. These bugs have been around for over a year now, so don't expect them to ever get patched.\n\nThe price point is also a major issue - I was annoyed enough as it was that AoM was still trying to charge $20 when it was a decade old. Then they came out with the "extended" version... and now they want over $35 for it. Yeaaaaaaaaaaahno. Get it on sale, but that's it.\n\nActually, you know what? Buy AoM: extended edition on sale... and then download a hacked copy of the original after you've paid for this one, and play the hacked one instead because it's flat out going to play better than this. That's right, I just told you to pay for the game but play a hacked one. That should tell you something about the quality of the game - the game itself is fine, but this version isn't worth the paper it's printed on. Oh, it's a computer title. It's not printed on paper. Yeaaaah it's worth less than $0 as it is.\n\nOh well.\n\nBut I didn't get the chance to pay for AoM when it first came out years ago, and honestly, AoM as a game is worth paying for to encourage further development of games such as this. Seriously, support AoM:EE simply because if enough people do, maybe they'll make a sequel. Yeah, the extended edition sucks, yeah, it doesn't deserve your money, and yeah, a hacked version of the original is simply the better game... but AoM itself deserves a reward for existing, even if they dropped the ball on this one. Into the sewer. Sorry, I don't have hip waders, I'm not going to go dig it out of the slime and sewage.\n\nIf you do, however, have the hip waders? It's a magnificient game beneath a veneer of crap, so if you can wash it off, it's well worth it. I just can't recommend this release is all. Even at -75% off.","November 29, 2015","false","24.4"," 37 of 46 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","37","46","3","1"

It is a perfected version of the old game Age of Mythology and Age of Mythology: The Titans.\n\nAge of Mythology: Extended Edition gameplay are pretty much the same as the old Age of Mythology and Age of Mythology: The Titans made into one game. In addition, the Golden Gift add on are also included in this remake. Unlike Age of Empires II: HD Edition, Age of Mythology: Extended Edition doesn't have population cap increase, everything in the gameplay stays the same. It's quite nostalgic to replay this old game with improved graphics, I remember almost all the god powers I used, the meteor rain, tornado, earthquake and more. Age of Mythology: Extended Edition also comes with Steam Cloud support and Steam Workshop support, which is a great addition into the game.\n\nAge of Mythology: Extended Edition however, have improved graphics than the old game. New improved global lightning, widescreen support, new water shaders and the new day and night cycle in skirmish play. It looks prettier now and more epic to play. With all these improved visuals, Age of Mythology: Extended Edition still retain its great performances and runs very great and smooth.\n\nAge of Mythology: Extended Edition exact same gameplay can be its good side or bad side for some people. But for me, it's very nostalgic and fun. I prefer this kind exact same gameplay rather than some of those next generation game with many promises which turn out to be a disappointment. Age of Mythology: Extended Edition is indeed a great remake. I recommend this.\n\nRating 9/10","July 1, 2014","true","28.3"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","29","34","0","0"

The whole thing...it's not even close to a rework. Why would you make a reboot of a 12 years old game and still not make any major changes except the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ water? The only things that are new are some trading cards and twitch integration that has no point in this game. Why not? Well, it's because the multiplayer is barely playable due to the massive lag in any kind of server. Even when it says it has 50 ping. What impressed me was that I had read about a guy complaining about lag in LAN! Can you believe this? The developers - Skybox Labs just ruined the whole conception of gameplay in the Extended Edition.\nDo you know what else is arrogant about the game? The price. Who would pay 28 (I can even say 30) euro for poorly developed reboot of a 12 years old game? It's worse than the original one which is much better and even cheaper.\nAside from the horrible reboot, Age of Mythology is a great game. It's a RTS game with the similar gameplay of Age of Empires. The game can be very competitive as almost every RTS game and the gameplay is amazing. The campaign mode has an interesting story with almost every element of the mythology. The game was my childhood game and I love it but I deny anything good in the Extended Edition since it's only playable vs bots.\nDon't waste that much money on a reboot. It's even slowly dying every day after people saw what a tragedy it is.

I am Odin, and my thunder god son had the audacity to attack me during the opening 30 minutes of this random map skirmish.The ludicrousness of this scenario, as mythical creatures of various origins trundle in over peaceful farmland to murder everyone in sight, was Mythology's strength over Ensemble's Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings when it was released in 2002. Mythology's colourful range of high-level fantasy creatures make the final act of any skirmish much more exciting than units of historical repute did in Age of Kings. Kraken trouble the seas, dragon-like nidhoggs circle the skies and hydra grow a head for every enemy they slay.Age of Mythology does feel antiquated, but it is still a lot of fun. It wasn't a notably innovative RTS at release, mostly built on '90s ideas, but it did take Ensemble's blend of Civ-style city management and more conventional military RTS ideas to its creative peak, as well as making the series fully 3D for the first time.The upgraded effects of the Extended Edition, most noticeably the shiny-looking water, help contemporise Mythology, but the character models are the strongest signs that this is a decade-old game. AI is a bit of an issue, too. On a moderate difficulty, the enemies attack predictably in medium-sized waves while rarely putting up an overwhelming defence of their own territories.I don't hold that against Mythology, though, because it is still cathartic to steamroll the AI on random maps. The online multiplayer, too, means you won't be short on smarter opponents, and it seems to be running well, even if the process of finding a game you can join feels a bit arduous.The Extended Edition isn't short on single-player content, either. Collected here are the Titans expansion and the shorter Golden Gift DLC campaign, in addition to the original's mammoth story mode.Each campaign level is prefaced by in-engine cutscenes of hilariously low production values. Voice acting sounds like the product of three almost-drunk friends being handed the keys to a recording studio for an afternoon. This shortfall is probably another sign of its age and the industry standard of the time, but otherwise I think this is one of the better RTS campaigns of its day in the variety of the mission structure.You rarely feel like you're doing the exact same thing twice, and the parameters can change from survival to deathmatches and surprise ambushes. The impressively in-depth Scenario Editor helps to extend the singleplayer's lifespan, and with Workshop support, there's no fear of running dry of stuff to do.Age of Mythology still has a lot of value beyond nostalgia.This isn't a total remake, so don't go in expecting one. The Extended Edition is still a really well-paced and entertaining RTS, one that revels in over-the-top imagery and remains a one-off in subject matter within the oeuvre of the sadly departed Ensemble.","December 11, 2014","true","188.3"," 34 of 49 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","34","49","0","0"

The amateur developers have completely destabilized and destroyed the game.\n\nLong version - I've never written a review before, but my recent experience with Age of Mythology has driven me to it.\n\nLet me start out by saying that I've been playing this game since it originally came out and I've loved it the whole time. The campaign is incredible, the graphics are great for their time, and the strategy gameplay is the best I've ever seen. It's rare not to get bored of a game after playing it for 14 years, and I'd go as far as saying that AOM is my favourite game of all time.\n\nThe old AOM that is... Recently a set of wannabe developers have released DLC that is absolute crap, or at least that's what I've read in reviews, which is why I haven't bought the DLC. I figured I just wouldn't buy it and continue to enjoy the same game that I've enjoyed for years.\n\nOf course, the old AOM had some bugs, but they were minor and the game was stable over all. Everything was fine until the fascist developers of this new DLC started screwing around with the original game! They've removed some technologies and units and added new ones, they've reskinned some things (and did a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ job), and they've introduced a ton of bugs to the gameplay. For example, god powers show up in the area for researching upgrades when you click on buildings like the wall and temple, technologies that you research show up in the wrong buildings or not at all, and when you drag to select units, the bottom area of the screen which shows who and what you selected either shows the wrong number of units, the wrong units, or nothing at all.\n\nI paid to get the original Age of Mythology and the Steam version worked fine before, but the bugs these ameteurs introduced have turned the game into a steaming pile of you-know-what. If you want to add units and other new content, that's fine. Release it as a mod so that when people install it and it completely destroys the game, it's their fault they ruined it and not yours.\n\nTo summarise, even if you are a fan of the old AOM, don't buy this game, because sadly it's not the game you played back in the day. I really hope the developers get their ♥♥♥♥ together and stop ruining this classic.","April 15","false","147.3"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","20","28","0","0"

It has quite a BIG pricetag, especially keeping in mind that it's a 2002 game. A few months after release a sale came, I took a deep breath and bought the game.\n\nI have to admit I was quite surprised and astonished. Despite all the bad critiques the remake is getting the game works like a charm. The visuals are beautiful, the gameplay is fluid and bug free. Even though there are known performance-eaters like SSAO and FXAA/BLOOM added to the game Age of Mythology still runs like what you'd expect from a 2002 game, except with better graphics. I'd put it between AOE HD (which looks horrid in my opinion, despite the "HD" tag) and AOE III.\n\nHowever the looks aren't everything.\n\nGameplay-wise (surprisingly) it's very much like the Age of Empires games, you can plow through several campaigns which mainly consists of gathering supplies, building a city (or two), fending off smaller enemy attacks, garrisoning a huge army and then defeating the enemy. It's a bit like Civilization on a more smaller "local" scale.\n\nHowever the main difference from the Age of Empires games is the addition of:\n\n- Epic Gods\n- Magic powers\n- Kickass monsters, mythological creatures to add to your army!\n\nThe workshop is filled with great content, great texture pags to further enhance the looks of the game, small fixes and additions to the UI etc. The integration of the mods into the game is seamless. I heard that it also has a great mod development kit (I haven't tried it yet). Probably the only negative thing about the game is that many people are having issues with the multiplayer, server lag. I like playing strategy games at my own pace so I can't reinforce these criticisms, I haven't tried the multiplayer.\n\nTo keep a long story short I think the developers really added extra "oomph" to an old classic spicing it up enough to be appealing even after 12 years. It's really up to you if you think the price-tag (which I admit is quite thick) is justifiable or you'll wait for it to go on a sale like I did.\n\nRight after I bought this game I played four hours straight without even noticing the time. I think that's enough recommendation, especially today when we (including me) just hoard up dozens of games without even trying them.","June 22, 2014","true","22.5"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

Worst $30 I've spent for a game I currently still own on disc from original launch and know that I love to play. Within my first 2 games of online play, which is the only reason I re-purchased this game for the steep price of $30, I cannot even play. Literally. Can. Not. Play. The lag is terrible, horrible, pathetic. Freezing for 5 seconds at a time, every 20 seconds. Both games I played stalled out at locked screens forcing a resign. I will be honest that I don't know the source of this lag, but I can conclude and deduce that it isn't Steam and it definitely isn't on my end (isp/pc/graphics). For someone that is re-purchasing this game because I already know it's great, it's sad that this issue isn't already fixed on a game that is so old. The main audience you that is thrilled to play this would be that such as myself, returning for the glory days of this game when it was one of the best. Get yourself together. This is a disgrace to a game as good as this is. If this was fixed I would recommend AoM in a heartbeat, but for now, don't waste your time or money if you want to play with other people online. If I wanted to play solo I would pop in my AoM disc and be happy.

Picking and sticking to an 'overpowered god' from the start is not really possible, as gods are very much rock-paper-scissors with each other. You can pick a certain god that counters the Norse (Gaia, for example) which would be destroyed by the Greek. You do get the feeling as you go along that certain Gods have better abilities than others, although I feel this is largely down to personal perference. Loki for example, has the ability for his Hersirs to randomly spawn Myth units into the battle, which maybe considered 'OP' by those who are in a militaristic war against them. BUT, Hersirs are very weak to arrows. Gather a few archers and you're back in the game. But then they can build calvary. But then you can build spearmen, and it continues.\n\nIn terms of units, there isn't that much variety however it is not necessarily the units that you pick, but how you build the groups. When playing as the Greeks, two horseman, two archers and two infantry will survive longer than six archers.\n\nI played this game many years ago and am happy to see it make a HD relaunch, however honestly there really isn't much difference. My main 'pet peeve' with this game is the online play which, to be brutally honest, frustrates me to no end. There are three aspects which irritate me, those being;\n1) Sync errors. You can be 40 minutes into a game and you will suddenly get a pop up saying 'Saving: Sync Error' which is an 'oh ****' moment. Your 40 minutes is now worthless, as you will now be back at the Main Menu screen. What a waste of time. They offer no explanation, no 'just kick the out-synced player', EVERYONE is put back to the Main Menu with nothing to show for the last 40 minutes. Oh, and did I mention that some players use programs to force sync errors if they are losing? Yeah.\n2) There's no option to vote-kick players midgame. The only option you have to kick a player is when they're about to disconnect, at which point the ENTIRE game comes to a halt for 30 seconds while you all vote. The voting, by the way, is pointless. Regardless of which option you pick (Continue or Wait) you will be forced to wait the full 30 seconds, even if the vote in unanimous.\n3) The program itself. The program itself can randomly just shut down. You can be destroying the entire map and then your game will just suddenly shut down with no warning as if you've pressed Alt + F4.\n\nBesides the above GLARING technical errors that I am in absolute disbelief haven't been fixed after x years since the game's release, the gameplay is actually very good. This is one of the most played, soon to be the most played game in my library. I would recommend, but I wish they'd sort out the gaping holes in their ship.","June 27, 2014","true","131.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

I expected at least some testing within the long 2-month lapse of the early copies already being handed out. Mostly good, like the original, but the amount of additions to this game is equivalent to the amount of bugs. Of course, I am no official tester, so I am not leaving a list behind me. However, I will say that there is UNBAREABLE lag in multiplayer games (stutter-lag), and I have extensively played the original well enough to know that neither my internet connection nor computer would be causing such.

Played it religiously when I was a kid. That is why it is so hard to give this a no in reccomendation.\n\n\nTo be brief:\nThe devs of this rerelease do not give a crap. On some PCs the game won't launch despite numerous user attempts to fix it, it simply won't launch. From countless posts on forums this has been a problem ever since this rerelease was.. released. Yet it has not been addressed and many players aren't even able to play the damn game.\n\nThere are a number of ridiculous bugs that were not present in the original game that appear present here. The most annoying and angering one is enemy units sometimes being able to glitch through your walls making them useless.\n\nI could ignore all this and not even bother with the "no" reccomendation if they hadn't rubbed salt in the wound - I was livid to see these useless devs have released "DLC" for this poorly coded game for things that are not DLC worthy!!! For example, to play on a "giant" sized map you need to buy the DLC whereas in the orginal this was always available. THEY WANT YOU TO PAY MONEY TO PLAY ON A BIGGER SIZED ORIGINAL MAP. There are a number of new maps with the DLC, which is great! But guess what, I don't want new maps, I want to be able to play as I did before without having to give you MORE money just to upgrade the map size. It is a very basic thing thing that they are using to shill money out of people.\n\nThere are worse devs, but these devs have particularly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off because of how much I loved this game when I was younger. I get all rereleases are money grabbers, but at least have some dignity about it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/StarSide/recommended/266840/","StarSide","Psychedelic Adventurer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/StarSide/","422 products in account","FOR THE RECORD; Most of the negative reviews on the game aren't due to the actual mechanics and gameplay, but more to do with the terrible pricing, and the poor online netcode. If you're wanting to buy this game, DON'T BUY IT ON STEAM. Or at least wait until it's on a massive discount. Or better yet, buy a retail copy. That's the short version.\n\nNow, about the game.\nIt's Age of Mythology. Which means it's a classic. Nuff said. The campaign is still amazing and holds up very well. The extended edition includes the Titans expansion which includes the Atlantean race, and the patched in content 'The Golden Gift' campaign. It's important to remember however that the campaign is also there to get you acquainted with the multiplayer mechanics.\n\nThe multiplayer is ok, but the Netcode is wack. Lag is inevitable, and the only people who play the MP now are either vets from the original retail version who will wreck your sh**, or the odd random. My advice.\nBuy the game for the excellent singleplayer, and maybe jump online with a friend and get to grips with the unit intricacies, then have a go.\n\nPRO's:\n•	HD textures (not really noticeable)\n•	Excellent campaigns\n•	Solid balancing\n•	Classic\n\nCon's:\n•	Dev's have abandoned the game. Horrific follow on development\n•	Multiple glitiches in MP. Also crashes sometimes\n•	AI is stupid as hell\n•	Insane asking price\n\n\nConclusion: In my opinion, at this time the game isn't worth the Steam asking price. If you're willing to pay however, you'll have access to 3 campaigns, an editor, MP with all races, and skirmishes. All with a few HD textures.\n\nIf you're not short of a few quid, you could do a lot worse than this.

There are very few servers and most of them are running mods, so, very often, the only way to have a standard game is by using the matchmaking system, which will put you against anyone it finds (yes, anyone, be him 100 mmr points ahead or below you).\n\nShortly, this game is definitely not worth its full price, as its litterally worse than the standard AoM: The Titans on every point of view.

I'd say now that I haven't encountered the save problem or any FPS drops, this is the game I remember playing as a youngin and loving, and it's still super fun yet I also still think it could use MORE upgrades both visually and added material, because it's pretty much the same base Mythology game (plus titan exp pack or w/e) with added steam fun stuff (badges, multiplayer). So if you loved this game/love RTS games, get this, but if you're on the fence about it wait for a sale, because you won't find 30 bucks worth imo. :D\n\nAgain if you'd like to see more, visit www.BalsacandJenniferLawrencePlaySteam.com and check out our WORLD EXCLUSIVE XXX Video Premiere "Zeus ♥♥♥♥s Athena in the ♥♥♥ while Hephaestus is at work") *NSFW*\n\nI give this functioning Age of Mythology game a 4\n\nout of 5\n\nOriginal Post:\n\nAs of right now don't buy this game.

I don't know what "Extended Features" means because I don't really notice a whole lot extra, and was expecting a higher visual upgrade tbh. AoE2 HD worked right out of the gate (except multiplayer which I hear in AoM is even worse) and this has been nothing but trouble, which sucks since I was really looking forward to this. Hopefully they patch this in the next week or so, otherwise this could be 24bucks (30 for new buyers) down the hole. I tip my fedora to the devs for cashing in, but smh if these problems aren't fixed. Of course there are people who have had no trouble with the game (curse them) but unfortunately many bugs plague it atm. I love the idea of remaking these classic games, but a little overhaul to some textures and steam trading cards doesn't justify 30 bucks.

I feel sorry for the people that find £30 games expensive, I would be really angry if I needed that money after buying this game. New troops and gods are cool though, pretty much the only positives.","February 8","false","300.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I've spent hours playing it and have enjoyed it for years. But, this Extended Edition is a piece of garbage. The game is completely glitched. One of the more innocuous glithces occurs when you click on, say a tree, and drag toward a unit the game will think you clicked on and are commanding the tree; thankfully though the commands will be of the unit, not of the tree. Then, there are the abominable graphical glitches which can, at times, make the game unplayable necessitating a reset. At times the map won't load. These glitches first showed up months ago, it seems the Microsoft Studios are trying their best to make their intent of milking the Age of Mythology till it's lying motionless sprawled across dead grass as obvious as they possibly could.\n\nThe most apt description of this version is schizophrenic. It will reset in the middle of a game, the entire game will close, the graphics will disintigrate, and all other assortments of frustrations. If anyone is curious my computer can handle games with superior graphics with no issue, the problem is rooted in the version of this game itself.\n\nIf you want to play this game then buy an old version of it on CD. This version isn't even worth the $4.99 that it'll occasionally be sold for let alone the regular 29.99; it leads to too many irritations. After all, the "improved graphics" are meaningless when the entire Christ forsaken game can't handle them to the point where it glitches to Hell!","March 31","false","479.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/L-DIP/recommended/266840/","L-DIP","Luke the Duke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/L-DIP/","234 products in account","Age of Mythology: Extended Edition is an RTS that has in my opinion stood the test of time.  First and foremost this game is related almost directly to the Age of Empires collection. The big difference is the injection of Mythology and Gods instead of historical civilizations like in Age of Empires. A few different things have been changed but you will see about the same formulas being practiced.\n\nWhen I first started playing this game it was almost ten years ago. I had very slow internet but thankfully found this solid game on disk. I was amazed with the quality and the single player replayability. One of my favorite things is the simple and fun editor where you can make your own maps or your own challenges. I would mostly roleplay in which I would make up different battles and very own campaign. It was very satisfying when I could put time into my own ideas.\n\nI have always liked the resource race in this game as well where you start by hunting then move up to farming or knowing when to get that next woodcutting or mining upgrade. Managing your economy with your military plays a very large part too. There are many small things in this game that make it feel very well done, as an example when your units are upgraded it updates the armor and weapon textures. Little things like that have always appealed to me while playing because it makes me feel like the developers really cared about this game. I read about how the developers argued for days over the god powers to make sure they were balanced. I believe that's called making a good game to were you care so much about the fairness you push yourself and others that hard.\n\nSkybox is another story. I enjoy the fact steamworks is now into the game and instant modifications can be applied that enhance the way I play the game but they have done an "ok" job. The price is a little to much for a game that is this old. Right now is a sale for around $7 and I would recommend you buy it at a time like this but $30 on the other hand is just too much when the disk has been in the bargin bin for half a decade. I could go on about the desync issues but in the end I will recommend this game in its current state.\n\nHonestly I am just really happy this is on Steam. I have met so many of die hard fans that I would have never met playing offline so very long ago. It really makes me glad that the community still cares and likes to have a good time with this awesome relic.\n\nThanks for reading.","February 9","true","96.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

However, the singleplayer gameplay is just as good as the original version and the graphics updates and steamworks support are nice additions.

While I may seem a little over the top in my effusive praise, look here; Ensemble is my favorite developer of all time, Age of Empires II and Age of Mythology are among my favorite games of all time, and these updated versions of those games tick every box I need them to tick and then some.

Apart from the fatal crashes half way through single-player random maps where the game just restarts for no reason, the graphics additions actually make things worse. With the new water, you can barely see fish through it, or units hiding in the water on the shore, the bloom is bad quality (even if you have a GTX Titan), the models (which haven't been HD'd) just don't suit the new lighting, they look all bubbly/oversmoothed and horrible, and the dynamic shadows look bad. I'm usually a graphics nut but I had to turn it all off and it's still ugly / hard to read. It's like some guy had this great water shader and was like "hey we could stick it in AoM and call it HD, and we'd better shoehorn in some other crap to make it seem worth it".

At first we were 'iffy' about these but after playing for about 20 minutes we realised they made the game far better than Age of Empires 2 HD was. The thing is, Age of Empires 2 HD isn't very driving, it's quite slow paced and the only real strategies are to either rush them early or build your economy up and attack them in one final push; basically you only really have one properly battle in Age of Empires HD but Age of Mythology on the other hand - you'll have many. You'll find yourself fighting over these Settlements purely for the fact that they give you 15 (+3 from an upgrade) which is enough to turn the entire game into your advantage.

What I'm trying to say is that this game is better than Age of Empires 2 HD!\n\nThe Civilisations though - these are fun! You've got 4 main groups of Civilisations; Greek, Egyptian, Norse and Atlantean.

The main point are the Gods though, each Civilisation has a total of 9 different gods which you have to choose from in tiers unlocking you God specific creatures such as Hydras and Manticores (Greek Myth Units - Myth are basically a type of Unit). This just makes up for so much customisations from your type of early-game economy build, to the overall God build you pick from, to the creatures you decide to fight with, to the buildings you decide to build, to the upgrades you decide to pick first, the list goes on and on - no doubt there's meta-builds somewhere though if you're that kind of person.\n\nLike I said, the graphics are nice but there's no excuse for them not being better, this is 2015 and these graphics don't look any near that!

I don't see anything. HD textures? Didn't see any difference.\n\n- 30 bucks? Are you serious? I can get the old version for 5 bucks in litteraly every store.\n\n- Servers? Every time you play with friends this game crashes during gameplay. Imagine being in the middle of an epic battle when suddenly you get kicked.\n\n- LAG. Even if you manage to play a game without errors, you get lag. And that's not because of my connection.\n\n- This is actually just a downgrade compared to the old version. So many features are not working, just like shared resources. (Shared resources allow you to share them with your team however once you add another team it disappears, like WTF?)\n\n- The "chinese DLC" is just some carelessly created textures of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t-units. Dragons which make no sound, a garden that has textures of some buildings from the Atlanteans, just poor...\n\n- Unfinished things in the menu, don't even know what's going to be there somewhen in 13 years since the developers tend to release things after a really long time. (AoM was released 2002)\n\n- Annoying chinese music in the menu since the update was released in January. I think they want to leave it there forever.\n\n- there are so many more negative things but im tired of writing them down.\n\nJUST GET SOMETHING BETTER THAN THIS FOR ♥♥♥♥ING 30 BUCKS LIKE WTF\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nRest in peace 30 bucks.

I read of crashes when launching the game since the DLC is out, Multiplayer is laggy since teh release of the base game, random desyncs in MP and the list goes on to save files beeing corrupted and crashes when starting a SP game. Also the AI seems to be even worse from what I've heard.\nIf I haven't already played 5 hours I would get a refund just so the devs didn't get my money (even though the game is working fine for me)\nNow to the fun thing. They recently deleted the Steam Forum. But after the ♥♥♥♥♥torm they got and about 90% of the threads are about crashing we have to assume that those amateurs can't even take responsibility for their product they just threw out despite it beeing very buggy. The Dev's are the worst. I like the idea of remaking an RTS classic in an age where this genre seems to die out or at least lose a lot of popularity, but if they can't even make it work and even make it worse with the new DLC they shouldn't have done it from the beginning.\nThat beeing said. Don't buy it. You have no reason to do so. If you actually like the devs screw you, they are just as lazy as early acess devs which just quit their game.\n\nIf you actually read all this, I hope I could help you. Just buy the original game and not the Extended edition, it runs better has no bugs.\n\nEDIT: The Forum wasn't deleted sorry for writing that it was only out of business for some time\nEDIT EDIT: The game stopped working for me. Can't start it. I tried every "solution" and nothing works. I don't know what changed but I would suggest to not turn off your computer or update any program if you get this game to work.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ErDiddly/recommended/266840/","ErDiddly","Not a girl like Aquaman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ErDiddly/","22 products in account","Summary - The Chinese expansion is rushed, copy-pasted from existing things, and glitchy. The people who profit from this are not the ones who made the original Age of Mythology.\n\nIcons for Chinese buildings are re-used existing ones.\n\nChinese god powers and soldiers are like copies of existing ones, just changed a little bit. For example, the chinese monk is the egyptian priest with a different model, texture, icon and description, and instead of converting animals he converts enemies. He waves his arms and makes the exact same chant, and the cursor turns into an Egyprian Ankh when you mouse-over enemies.\n\nIncorrect descriptions - The two Chinese heroes we start with are given Arkantos's description of special powers.\n\nPoor story-telling - Unlike the original campaign, the beginning of the Chinese campaign has very little story-telling. You are not introduced to the gods, and you just start already in the second age. We only have a brief introduction to the heroes.\nAt the beginning of the campaign...\n/(SPOILER)\\nThe heroes have to travel across China because when they realise there's evil afoot, a random peasant tells them to cross china, and so they do with no questions asked.\n\(SPOILER)/\n\nGraphic glitches on my new-ish computer - You can see flames if the ground is behind them, but not if the sky if behind them. When placing walls. the wall segment that is behind another is drawn in front of what is actually in front of it.\n\nGlitched first scenario in the Chinese campaign - You start in the Second age, but if you restart you are in the first age.\n\nIt runs slowly.\n\nYou can drag a box to select four soldiers and it will tell you you've selected only two, or the "bamboo tree" nearby.\n\nMy fortified wall upgraded to an earthen wall.\n\nI got a steam card of Thor with a really bad picture on it, with the description "The Norse god of lightning". Thor is the god of thunder, not lightning. Loki is the god of lightning.\n\nThis is my review after only getting to the second scenario in the Chinese campaign, because waiting to finish it to write the review would make it too late for the review to be helpful, because it's only just been released. Perhaps it's not their fault that the Chinese are so similar to the other ones, because there are only so many possibilities, and the three original races have already taken a share of the possibilities, but the lacking story-telling and the obviously reused artwork and code make it seem like the people who made it rushed it, or did not enjoy maknig it, or something like that. If it was released as a free mod then it would probably be well recieved, but it's been named an official expansion.","February 3","false","7.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you're a super competitive gamer and love trying a bunch of various strategies I would totally recommend this game, this is for you. I haven't played the other Age of Mythology games, so I can't say how accurate this one is, however this was recommended to me by a friend who says it's very accurate. Take that as a third party source, though.\nThis is by no means a bad game, and it excels in what it does. It provides a challenging RTS experience that you can enjoy with friends or on your own. The problem for me comes from the game being a tad too competitive. This might not be a problem for you, and it might actually be a good thing. If that's the case you should get this game, probably when it's on sale. If you share the same opinion as me in this area in that you would rather spend your time goofing off than strategising and micromanaging resources, I would say no, you'd be better off spending your money on something else.

I just finished playing all three, and I can't get over how they overlooked the idea of having 3 distinct player races have separate strengths and weaknesses that accomodate most playstyles to an RTS. Of course, its "easy" campaign option makes the campaign a rewarding experience as you play through all three classes in 48 scenarios. I haven't really dug into the multiplayer yet, but if I did I would feel more than prepared after such an engaging campaign.\n\nIf you were thinking about getting into franchises or RTS in general, this is the one in the series to get. AoE 2 is much too difficult for me to recommend right away, and the story in the third is far too bland and uninteresting. If you're struggling or you find it boring, play it on Twitch. If you're lucky, you'll have nice viewers help you through it - it definitely made it more interesting for me to play.","January 10","true","21.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's easy and intuitive to learn with an amazing soundtrack, varied gameplay and awesome campaign, context, story etc. The game design is flawless. I bought this just to re-experience the campaign. However, I did expect that, given it's "Extended Edition" to have updated graphics and some more features. The game does NOTHING!! I have no interest in the multiplayer but from what I hear it's broken - thus defeating the purpose of its revival. The only hope is improved graphics which it does NOT offer AT ALL. The screenshots are deeply misleading. If anything, the game is worse because of framerate drops and poor optimisation, non-functioning V-sync and other issues. If you haven't played Age of mythology, I strongly urge you to do so, but not at the extortionate price of this wannabe remake.","February 5, 2015","false","20.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Age of Empires II was just known as being "HD" so what does it mean here? Honestly, very very little, for some nothing at all even. But does that stop it from being worth it at all? Asking this old fan, I'd like to think so... depending.\n\nPros:\n+ Classic gameplay intact\n+ Readily includes The Titans expansion and Golden Gift extra\n+ New visual updates work\n+ Steam workshop\n+ Online interface and scenario sharing simple\n+ Developers keen to update\n+ New Tale of the Dragon expansion coming over a decade later\n+ Prostagma!\n\nCons:\n- Multiplayer servers regularly don't display properlly\n- Online lag, sometimes difficult to know who has the connection issue\n- Visual updates minor at best\n- Nothing has really been "extended", Age of Empires II HD had a better, more reflective title...\n- ...and as a result the full price tag is too high\n\nSummery:\nThis new version is at the end of the day is still classic Age of Mythology and has aged very well gameplay wise (despite some obvious old graphical quirks) in a landscape where real-time base building strategy is not as prevelant as it once was. Being on Steam and the perks that it brings with it (intergrated online community, workshop, future updates) with all the content is the easiest way to play today. However, even after a some time, the multiplayer issues are still noticable, in fact for some it may even be a deal breaker. Speaking of which, despite my overall praise, the game is not updated all that much making the 20+ price tag for most regions outright steep so even if like me you are a long time fan, a sale being your best option. Thankfully that does come regularly.\n\nOverall the package is worth a buy for the right lower price by your own standard and the developers do have plans to update the game beyond simply another expansion (visuals, balance, servers), I myself will update this review a period following the release of the expansion as some of these issue are very important and should have been ironed out sonner, in the case of online. Still, in the meantime what we've got at the end of the day is classic Age of Mythology.","January 16","true","63.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","6"

Seeing this expansion has really been a knife in the back of the game I once loved so much.  The new content is lack luster the campaign is repetitive, poorly balanced and boring. And the new civ pretty much reuses previous models to create every new unit. But the worst part is the bugs. This game not only crashes itself but my entire computer multiple times aswell and aswell as messing up the new content they have also ruined the existing campaigns. Why can my walls cast earthquake??? Why do my units get stuck unmovably on cliff faces??? Why are upgrades moved to buildings that are not supposed to be able to research them??? Why are units able to be garisonned in buildings if the rally point is set to them??? The answer a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ effort from the game developers who not only managed to ruin the new content but also the existing game. . .

At first I didn't have that problem, I was even able to play a few levels of the Chinese storymode, NOW IT'S DOING IT FOR NOT JUST THE STORYMODE BUT NOW FOR EVERY FACTION AND EVERY RANDOM MAP I TRY TO PLAY!!! WTF!!\n\nLet me be clear that I love Age of Empires. It's the best real time strategy game of all time, but compared to earlier entries like Age of Empires 2, AoMythology feels like it's lacking. The growth and movements are a lot slower than I remember them to be, and despite the game being remastered with better graphics of the environment and buildings they are still really poor in terms of units (they're basically a few crude shapes with arms). the system of heroes and myth units put a difficult wrench into the mix of unit advantages, and it seems no matter how much you upgrade they die very quickly unless you have an overwhelming force. The buildings compared to AoE2 are also much weaker. Whereas in AoE2 castles and towers could protect you from all sorts of forces, the defenses in Age of Mythology are practically made of cardboard. It almost makes artillery pointless because so long as you're willing to lose a couple of cheap units you can stab whole fortresses to death in a matter of moments, something you and the enemy could rarely do in Age of Empires 2.\n\nThere is one thing Age of Mythology has that is better than other titles and that's the learning element. It won't teach much history, but when you click on unit icons it opens up a short description of the unit's stories in mythology for myth units or if it's a human unit it will have a small explanation of that unit's weapons or place in ancient history. Even clicking on a wild animal will bring up it's scientific name and other facts about it. For learning purposes, this is the best part of the game.\n\nSomething I loved about Mythology is that it had much better and much crazier cheatcodes. I'll never forget the glory that is WUV WOO and O CANADA which spawn a flying purple hippo and a superhero bear with the Canadaian flag on it's back. Yet for some reason, I can't get any of them to work anymore. That's reall disappointing for me because those cheats were amazing.\n\nAll in all, I bought this game for the nostalgia and the new Chinese faction dlc, but feel it was not worth buying again. I much more recommend Age of Empires 2 because it is faster paced, more balanced, slightly cheaper, and has a lot more cultures to choose from.","January 30","false","50.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The growth and movements are a lot slower than I remember them to be, and despite the game being remastered with better graphics of the environment and buildings they are still really poor in terms of units (they're basically a few crude shapes with arms). the system of heroes and myth units put a difficult wrench into the mix of unit advantages, and it seems no matter how much you upgrade they die very quickly unless you have an overwhelming force. The buildings compared to AoE2 are also much weaker. Whereas in AoE2 castles and towers could protect you from all sorts of forces, the defenses in Age of Mythology are practically made of cardboard. It almost makes artillery pointless because so long as you're willing to lose a couple of cheap units you can stab whole fortresses to death in a matter of moments, something you and the enemy could rarely do in Age of Empires 2.\n\nThere is one thing Age of Mythology has that is better than other titles and that's the learning element. It won't teach much history, but when you click on unit icons it opens up a short description of the unit's stories in mythology for myth units or if it's a human unit it will have a small explanation of that unit's weapons or place in ancient history. Even clicking on a wild animal will bring up it's scientific name and other facts about it. For learning purposes, this is the best part of the game.\n\nSomething I loved about Mythology is that it had much better and much crazier cheatcodes. I'll never forget the glory that is WUV WOO and O CANADA which spawn a flying purple hippo and a superhero bear with the Canadaian flag on it's back. Yet for some reason, I can't get any of them to work anymore. That's reall disappointing for me because those cheats were amazing.\n\nAll in all, I bought this game for the nostalgia and the new Chinese faction dlc, but feel it was not worth buying again. I much more recommend Age of Empires 2 because it is faster paced, more balanced, slightly cheaper, and has a lot more cultures to choose from.","January 30","false","50.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A lot of players quit playing the game because of desyncs.\n\nThere's also good news. There is active work on the desyncs and a dev seems to publish statistics and his approach on the issue.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HORRIBLEPANCAKE/recommended/266840/","HORRIBLEPANCAKE","Bernman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HORRIBLEPANCAKE/","204 products in account","I was excited when i saw that this game was getting an HD remake for the modern day of PC Gaming. I remember play this AoM with my friend at his house since i didn't own the game. Of course i loved it so much i bought my own copy and installed it on my computer. I spent hours playing this game, day and night i would play. So naturally, when i saw that this game was being released on steam with an texture update, i was excited! And after playing this game for 52 hours, i thought i give me take on the game.\n\nWhen you first load up the game, the game is different from the start, Having used a moving background behind a new menu layout gave it the feel of a new game, even though it wasn't. I loved the feel of the new menu (although some people didn't, as their a mod in the workshop for the old one, i didn't see a problem with the new one). and the world in the background was an awesome idea.\n\nNow as i said before, it did recieve an texture update, and yes it looks completely better then the old game, it still has the old game feel to it. They achieve the new look while keeping the way the orginal AoM looks and feels. I'll admit, when i first heard of AoM: EE i was thinking they overhauled the graphics on it and have the characters working mouths! Sadly, they didn't, but that doesn't mean they didn't update the game. The water and land textures (Greek, Norse etc.) have all been updated.\n\nGameplay was as just much fun as it was when i was a kid. Building huge armies and storming the Gates of Troy was just as exciting as i remember it being. Of course not every game is perfect, at some points, when moving an army they would get stuck or move in a direction i didn't tell them too. When this happend, i would have  to kill some people or make the army smaller (by killing them) so the rest of the army could move, then i would have to rebuild the lost men and gather then up for battle. Yet, this was the only real problem i encounter in the game. With the edition of steam groups to the game, any bugs or glitches that come up and brough to the developer and are fixed quickly. Thats right, the developer actually cares what the people say and fix the problems that are bothering their fans!\n\nThe campaign in this game consist of three storys. Fall of the Trident follows Arkantos jouney to appease the God Posiden,  Even if it means storming the Gates of Troy, or chasing his villian across the world! The campaign that comes from the Titan expansion follows Kastor, Arkantos son, as he struggles to lead his people following the events of the first campaign. A campaign i can't recall if it was in AoM is the Golden Boar. This campaign follows two dwarves on their wacky adventure to retrieve their golden boar! (It's not really wacky but it has its funny moments). Nothing new in the story section, the game keeps true to the old campaign leaving it how it was.\n\nWith the steam groups added also comes Steam Workshop. Adding this to the game makes the content of this game seem limitless now. Adding mods to the game can change your gameplay (either with new maps or new scenarios etc). Allowing mods to this game just makes it even better to play by adding more hours of gameplay.\n\nOverall, the game was great! I missed playing this game and now that i have it on Steam (making it easier to keep track off, i lose disk a lot) just makes it so much better. For my first review i give the game a 9/10. I gave it a 9 for great gameplay (even if its nothing new from the old game), fresh new textures (which look great!), the story was awesome too ,and only one glitch that i could find. And most importantly, keeping the feel and enjoyment of what the AoM had. Extented Editions of games sometimes lose what the original game brought, and AoM: EE kept that while improving the game. So if you're an old fan or a newcomer, AoM: EE is the perfect RTS for you!","October 18, 2014","true","68.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I would have clocked up at least 500 hours in this game in my time. Just stating that in case my hours of game time will help you hold my review to a higher validity.\n\nThis game is absolute favourite game from the "Age Of..." series. In my opinion this game is superior to any Age of Empires game available, even the second. In fact, this game is honestly superior to any RTS strategy game I've ever played.\n\nIt has every feature from all of the other "Age Of" games and more. Mythical units? ♥♥♥♥ yes. Fantastic campaigns? ♥♥♥♥ yes. Amazing map editor and scenario creator? ♥♥♥♥ yes. TITANS? ♥♥♥♥ yes! Heroes? ♥♥♥♥ yes. 4 different unique races? ♥♥♥♥ yes. A new resource? ♥♥♥♥ yes. I could go on for ♥♥♥♥ing ever but I won't because spoilers. (I'm too lazy.)\n\nIn my opinion, AOE2 is only more popular because it is simpler. This game has many, many more features than AOE2 and if you go from AOM to AOE you will start to miss a lot of the amazing features that you start to take for granted once you play AOM.\n\nAlso the multiplayer in the game is very active.\n\nI whole heartedly recommend this game.

Bought the original edition in 2005 and a love affair began. This game is really one of the top RTS of all time with it's unique universe and time setting. The Ancient world has been never made before so nicely and I think several years after it's debut we can still say exactly the same. You have the stunning game modes, you have the outstanding editor, modding is pretty easy, just have a look at the biggets fan site (http://aom.heavengames.com/) where you can find plenty of help and of course the actual products of the hardworking modders.\n\nThe Extended Edition brang back one of the things that I missed for a while, the Multiplayer mode. ESO was shut down and the game lost it's playerbase a bit, but the revival is finely made and hopefully we are going to see many new faces and of course the old ones. :) Other pro is the fantastic graphic effects. I never imagined that this edition will look that good after I saw the press release pictures. I can only recommend getting it as it's a game that you cant miss before you die.","May 8, 2014","true","45.6"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","15","28","0","0"

Since ESO was disconnected by Microsoft  the classic AoM can only be played with gameranger, which odes not contains a very wide variety like it used to on the in-game matchmaking system.I did like this port and I didn't have any issues other than poor framerate (even though i can play most games on mid-high with 60 fps) and the fact that people aren't doing those fun multiplayer games anymore (like cyclops throwing minigame, minotaurus arena, rpg scenarios, tower defenses, which i miss a lot :'( )  I also feel like they could have made better improvements like adding community mods (rotate buildings, more maps, etc.) or added a new campaign or game mode, but it's okay cause it's got workshop plugged into it, which saves the time and effort of installing mods.  But anyway, i only bought it cause it was on sale, I wouldn't spend 30 dollars on this even though I love the classic game :/\n\nTL;DR: It's pretty much a graphics overhaul and bug squashing, buy it only if you miss playing ranked or if you like to play LAN with friends, it's not worth 30 dollars though.","December 21, 2014","true","41.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Now that im so many hours into playing I have a few things that I feel I should let you know about (These are just cosmetic issues FYI):\n\n1.) The devs of this version added in a new "workers counter" Which displays how many workers are gathering each resource, which is great EXCEPT when you get into the 10,000's of a resource, where the UI doesnt compensate and resize; the counter and the resource value overlap. Not an actual issue it just looks ugly.\n\n2.) The graphics have been played with and tweaked slightly and I run them at highest quality. The problem is that where in the original the environment looked lovely and smooth, sometimes in this vesion it can looks very square, again not an issue it just looks ugly.\n\n3.) In the write ups there are a few spelling mistakes I've found I dont know if that was this company or the orginal but still.\n\n4.) The day and Night cycle seems pretty pointless to be honest with you, it doesnt really get that dark (obviously) and it often more than not doesnt work properly, instead of fading into darkness it just makes my game flash for a few minutes.\n\nOkay thats all really. As it said all cosmetic as I've had no real problems with the game, I just feel like they should be mentioned as they're only issues that exist in the Extended Edition.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nI could write a 6 million word praise of this game, but I'll save us all the time and say this:\n\nMY FAVORITE GAME FROM CHILDHOOD HAS COME TO SSSTTTEEEAAAMMM!!! :D :D :D :D\n\nYeah, I love it!

The Workshop grants great accessibility to Mods and the recent Updates, the Ranking system, the events and the loads of achievements guarantee long-term playability.\n\nThe big question: Is it worth the money?\nIf you enjoy real-time strategy and haven't played Age of Mythology before, I would highly recommend buying AoM:EE. It is THE classic real-time strategy game, which is, in my eyes, even better than Age of Empires and the EE with all its features is pretty cheap for a brand new strategy game for you, comparing it to other strategy games on the market.\n\nIf you have already played AoM, I would not recommend buying it at its current price. It has many new features, but if you know the game already, it's just not worth the money.\nBuy it, but wait for a major sale.","June 10, 2014","true","48.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It can be tedious at times, but managing the economy the right way to get your units out and be aggressive has some appeal.\n\nThe multiplayer somewhat good. The lobby is easy to navigate, and matches are quick to find. The games are RUINED by the TERRIBLE lag you get.

I played it first on my notebook expecting to run nice and smooth, but it lagged alot, when i changed it to my desktop it stopped lagging, the game is not that beautiful to need a gaming computer, i dont understand why you need such great hardware to run it smooth. 8/10 still recommend","July 24, 2014","true","37.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Age of Mythology was one of the best, if not the best, real time strategy games of all time.  The expansion was incredible, and the extended edition adds some really cool stuff (the day/night cycle is beautiful!)  But to release a 12 year old game for $30 and not bother to fix bugs before releasing it?  The word scam comes to mind...  What possible explanation could there be for 'rushing' the re-release of a game from a dozen years ago?  If it were only Steam integration issues, it'd be less shameful, but things like memory leaks and texture issues should have fixed BEFORE charging anyone money for it.  I'd wait until they fix more bugs and it goes on sale for 75% off.  That said, if the thought of playing a modernized version of such a spectacular game is just too tempting to wait on, you won't be disappointed.  I haven't found the bugs to be too bad and the Steam Workshop is, as always, full of amazingness and growing quickly.","July 13, 2014","true","73.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Workshop grants great accessibility to Mods and the recent Updates, the Ranking system, the events and the loads of achievements guarantee long-term playability.\n\nThe big question: Is it worth the money?\nIf you enjoy real-time strategy and haven't played Age of Mythology before, I would highly recommend buying AoM:EE. It is THE classic real-time strategy game, which is, in my eyes, even better than Age of Empires and the EE with all its features is pretty cheap for a brand new strategy game for you, comparing it to other strategy games on the market.\n\nIf you have already played AoM, I would not recommend buying it at its current price. It has many new features, but if you know the game already, it's just not worth the money.\nBuy it, but wait for a major sale.","June 10, 2014","true","48.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It adds a whole new challenge to the game, anyway, I aim this review at people who have never played the game before and are wondering "is it for me?"\n\nFirstly, a huge part of this game (so huge they put it in the title) is mythology, it has rich, historically accurate features that really add to the game, you can train myth units, and you can also wield God powers, (send lightning down on enemies, and even make an earthquake right in your enemies base.) Before you start a game you have to choose a Major God, such as Zeus, Thor, Loki and others (a total of 12) your major God will determine what units, God Powers, and upgrades you will have.\n\nGameplay - This is a Real time strategy game, one of the very best, you start with a few villagers who can build and gather resources (wood, food, and gold.) There are four ages in which you must advance, the archaic age, the classical age, the heroic age, and finally the mythic age. As you advance through the ages you'll unlock new military units (infantry, archers, and cavalry), as well as myth units (minoutaurs, centaurs, cyclops and loads of others.) Ultimatley your goal is pretty simple... Beat the other guy. Advance faster, make bigger armies, or win in other ways such as building a wonder and defending for ten minutes. So it's quite a tactical game. You can also, right at the end of the final age, build a titan, it is like it sounds, a massive thing that tramples cities like godzilla.\n\nGraphics - they're perfectly fine, and nothing more. There is violence in the forms of armies battling it out for domination, but nothing very gorey, and there is no bad language, unless you count "Shkeepan" (you'll understand that joke if you play the game"\n\nThis is a great game, it has a little bit of a learning curve but can be picked up pretty quick, the best part is that even after so many hours, you still have so much to learn, it provides hours of fun.\n\nA couple of down sides - Price: £22.99 is a lot for a game that is 10 years old, don't get me wrong, I've paid more for newer games that aren't as good, but I think it's a little steep. Online games can be a little tough to come by, perhaps if they had a sale then more players would realise the quality of this game.","June 9, 2014","true","531.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not just graphically, but in the way it works. The way you build your economy matters. It can be tedious at times, but managing the economy the right way to get your units out and be aggressive has some appeal.\n\nThe multiplayer somewhat good. The lobby is easy to navigate, and matches are quick to find. The games are RUINED by the TERRIBLE lag you get. Everything lags, and the more players you put in, the worse it gets. 1 v 1 has the game stuttering, 2 v 2 has the game going slo mo.\n\nGet it if you want a deeper RTS game that is dated, but still good.\n\nPass if you want an action oriented RTS, with as little base building and economy as possible.\n","May 8, 2014","true","14.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For anyone with real power in their computer, I expect this would look amazing, so that's nice.\n\nThe gameplay is still fantastic.  Best RTS in my opinion.  I haven't tried the multiplayer, so I don't know how good or bad it is.  Sorry.  The original multiplayer was quite fun.\n\nIf you still own the original game, don't buy this.  Go to Voobly and have fun there.  This new edition adds...basically nothing, other than smoke and mirrors.  I wish you luck with your decision!  Maybe we can play sometime =)","May 9, 2014","true","42.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is a fantastic RTS with a twist. The addition of mythologic units, deities, and powers adds a lot of depth to the game.

It adds a whole new challenge to the game, anyway, I aim this review at people who have never played the game before and are wondering "is it for me?"\n\nFirstly, a huge part of this game (so huge they put it in the title) is mythology, it has rich, historically accurate features that really add to the game, you can train myth units, and you can also wield God powers, (send lightning down on enemies, and even make an earthquake right in your enemies base.) Before you start a game you have to choose a Major God, such as Zeus, Thor, Loki and others (a total of 12) your major God will determine what units, God Powers, and upgrades you will have.\n\nGameplay - This is a Real time strategy game, one of the very best, you start with a few villagers who can build and gather resources (wood, food, and gold.) There are four ages in which you must advance, the archaic age, the classical age, the heroic age, and finally the mythic age. As you advance through the ages you'll unlock new military units (infantry, archers, and cavalry), as well as myth units (minoutaurs, centaurs, cyclops and loads of others.) Ultimatley your goal is pretty simple... Beat the other guy. Advance faster, make bigger armies, or win in other ways such as building a wonder and defending for ten minutes. So it's quite a tactical game. You can also, right at the end of the final age, build a titan, it is like it sounds, a massive thing that tramples cities like godzilla.\n\nGraphics - they're perfectly fine, and nothing more. There is violence in the forms of armies battling it out for domination, but nothing very gorey, and there is no bad language, unless you count "Shkeepan" (you'll understand that joke if you play the game"\n\nThis is a great game, it has a little bit of a learning curve but can be picked up pretty quick, the best part is that even after so many hours, you still have so much to learn, it provides hours of fun.\n\nA couple of down sides - Price: £22.99 is a lot for a game that is 10 years old, don't get me wrong, I've paid more for newer games that aren't as good, but I think it's a little steep. Online games can be a little tough to come by, perhaps if they had a sale then more players would realise the quality of this game.","June 9, 2014","true","531.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was one of my favorite games, with tons of hours of content. It had a massive modding, and map making support and a huge number of people took advantage of this. I would always rebuy it because I wasn't paying 10$ for one game, I was paying 10$ for an infinite number. That praise isn't even mentioning the base game, with a large number of civilizations and different strategies for each. Age of Mythology Gold is an excellent game and I strongly recommend you pick it up.\nThe Extended Edition that steam sells is not. There has been a little bit of confusion as to who actually is running the servers and support for the Extended Edition, although the latter may be a bit of a misnomer as Age of Mythology Extended Edition is rife with errors, bugs, and inconsisntencies. There are a kalidescope of problems that can occur during a game session to cause it to crash, from disconnections (which effect a single person) to desync. For the most part the cult following on Steam has bore these burdens with resignation. They make jokes at the expense of the servers and MS Ryzon (Ex-Developer for The Extended Edition) is actually featured as a boss in one scenario. The bosses' talent? He cause lag and steals money.\nWe were however content to have a medium which we could play our game on once again even if this medium was buggier than an anteater's lunch infected with crabs. This changed with the recent release of the Tale of the Dragon DLC. For 10$, one could unlock the Chinese Civilization. The quality of this expansion is such, that MOST players believe it simply to be a monotized mod for the game, and a poorly done one at that. The mod plays like already existing civilizations and brings little unique to the table. What it does bring however, is a host of new errors to the game. Chat in pregame lobbies no longer work, desyncs have become far more common, and players are constantly reminded by game breaking pop-up ads to purchase the expansion pack every time a player of the Chinese Civilization does, well, anything.\nThe most serious problem however has appeared. Custom games no longer appear on the list of available games as they are constantly being "retreived". This has rendered the largest attraction to the AoM experience completely unplayable. When I went to report this error to the support page, I found it broken. The Support page. Purchasing DLC is still entirely functional but attempting to to get game fixing support is impossible due to a broken link. That's the real reason for this review.The reason the player base is so frustrated isn't the errors in the game, it's the complete contempt of the paying consumers that is ultimately driving players from this game. I've asked dozens of people in the base if they have a favorable opinion of the hoster of this game. Not one single person has a favorable opinion or at very least neutral opinion of this game's hoster. The real kicker? This game was hosted 10 years ago by Ensemble Studios Online (from the makers of Halo Wars) and ran much smoother then. A company that has since collapsed was objectively more sucessful than both Steam and Skybox when it comes to smoothly running this game.\nSkyBox, if you're reading this. You need to apologize to the players of this game for bad support, bug fixes and a DLC that has only exacerbated the problem. AoM is not a difficult game to run, and it has a lot to offer to all bases. But if your inability to fix basic game errors keeps driving off old players, you'll end up with a game that has no replayablity whatsoever especially when compared to the new generation of turn-based strategy.","February 13","false","429.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Some stores (like office depot) are still selling the original disk with the titian expansion just go buy that.","February 28","false","166.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played some of the campaign and a lot of the sandbox/custom game setup. If you are playing "conquest" mode, then it devolves to a zergfest to see who can crank out the most units and overwhelm the other. If you are playing in other modes, the IA isn't much of a challeng until you have it on the 3rd or 4th setting and then it become overwhelming.\nUltimately the biggest drawback is that there is no autosave. The game crashes (I'm running Win10), often only an hour or so after you've been playing and it is too easy to slip out of the habit of manually saving your game every so often. You lose a lot of progress and getting back to where you were is disheartening.","February 6","false","13.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For those like me who have played the original and looked to this expecting something more refined, even if nothing new, you came to the wrong place! Most of the bugs in the original seem to still be around. I personally bought it to play with my friends online, but that is probably the most laughable thing there is. The application seems to use a client-side host with the steamworks intergration to connect players to eachothers servers. This alone isn't a bad thing, but the server seems so poorly optmized it feels that even the best of IPS will probably still have pretty bad lag. Simply put, steaming a YouTube video in HD is probably less taxing on your internet. Probably the worse part is the game has MEMORY LEAKS! Numerious times have myself and other players I know had there entire progress eradicated because of a memory allocation error which completely crashes the game. Rule of thumb in software development: critical bugs should not exist in finished products. Crashing to you desktop with a "Memory System Error" pop up is less than graceful and definitely counts as a critical bug.","December 1, 2014","false","64.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

A friend of mine wanted to buy it and asked me if I wanted to share the four pack. I agreed and plled two more friends in...\n\nI loved playing Dota 2, but now, even when I miss racing around the map as Bloodseeker, I'm more willing to play AoM, because I loved it.\n\nI always play with a friend of mine, one of the two I pulled in, and he had already played it long eons ago, so he taught me the basics and we play cooperatively, almost like one civilization with two players... except our civilizations are never the same.\n\nFor issues about connection, I admit there are some, but issues from Dota 2 are far worse than these, and mostly, I know it isn't the game's fault, but my friend's poor connection.\n\nThe only real problem is... this game is just a ilttle expensive.... just the price to eat for a month... depending on how much you eat of course.\n\nSo I suggest: put it on your wishlist and wait for steam's crazy discounts. The 4-pack we shared was for a bit more than $10.00 ... divided by four people. Plus, my share of the price was given as birthday gift.","December 3, 2014","true","90.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

While it did not capture me quite like Age of Empires II did, AoM was still pretty good. In this remade version... well I don't really see any changes from the original, except for stuff like Steam support, being able to run on modern OS', and the usual stuff you see when an old game is remade for the present day. All important, of course, but for those who have already played AoM, there isn't really anything new here.\n\nAs usual, I stuck to single-player since I'm a terrible online RTS player. The main campaign here drags on a bit long, but it is still plenty good and worthy of the Age RTS series. The expansions' campaigns, which I had never played until now, were also pretty neat in their own way. I still prefer AoE II's campaigns, but... nothing really beats those in my book. I am biased. XD\n\nUltimately, it's just good old RTS fun, except this time you can literally storm your enemies with Hydras, Anubites, or Valkyries instead of the usual hordes of spearmen, archers, and cavalry.

Mind you this was back when AoM was first released back in 2002. I loved it then and I loved it now.\n\nThe game plays like your standard Age of Empires styled RTS game. Gather resources, build an army, topple your enemies. This game introduces a unique resource known as Favor which is generated differently across the 4 factions of the game. The Greeks require villagers to worship at the temple, Egyptians build up to 5 monuments, the Norse gain favor through battle, and the Atlantians gain favor by controling Town Centers. Favor can be spent to purchase specific god related upgrades or train myth units which can give you an edge.\n\nEach facton can, technically, be broken down into three subfactions divided up by the major god the faction uses. Greeks can worship Zeus, Hades, or Posedeon, Egyptians worship Ra, Isis, or Set, Norse worship Thor, Odin, or Loki, and the Atlantians worship Kronos, Oranos, or Gaia. Each major god carries their own unique god powers and other benefits upon their faction. For instance, following Thor grants you access to a Dwarven Gold Mine which, depending on the age in which it is used, acts as a free bonus Gold Mine for players to use. Similarly Thor allows for the construction of a Dwarven Armory which researches cheaper upgrades than average armories.\n\nEach major god also has a select list of minor gods for you to choose from when advancing from one age to the next. You can only pick one of two gods to worship and will gain the benefits from that god once you reach the next age. Each minor god grants you a special myth unit to use and each myth unit has its own unique traits. For example the Egyptian Scarab is a living siege unit designed to destroy enemy structures, the Greek Pegasus is a flying scout, etc. Each of the minor gods includes unique upgrades that can be researched that affect specific groups like cavalry, villagers, infantry, etc.\n\nThe god powers for each faction also differs. The Atlantians have a slight advantage with their god powers as some of them carry multiple charges and can be used more than once after a cooldown period. Up to 4 god powers can be acquired at a time, with your initial power coming from your major god and three subsiquent powers being gained from the minor gods.\n\nIn addition to basic units, there are also hero units. Hero units are the counter to myth units as they're meant for just that purpose of eliminiating the myth units. Each faction has their own hero units. Egyptians have Priests and the Pharoh, Norse have a hammer wielding melee hero, and Atlantians can promote any one of their infantry or cavalry units into heroes for a price. Greeks seem to have the short end as they only get up to 4 heroes at a time and these heroes may vary between infantry, cavalry, or archer. However the Greek Heroes have their own unique abilities such as Ajax being able to bash enemy units away with his large shield.\n\nAnd then there are the Titans! The Titans were introduced with the Titans expansion and AoM is probably one of the first games to introduce a game changing uber-unit. Upon reaching the mythic age, each faction can place a Titan Gate which, once it is uncovered/constructed by the faction's builder units, releases a Titan which is a massive and powerful melee unit that deals unbelievable damage and in most cases can obliterate an entire army singlehandedly. The only drawback to the Titans are that their health is finite and any health lost is lost forever and if the Titan dies, you don't get another one. The most effective counter to a Titan is another Titan or a host of ranged hero units. The Atlantians seem to have a slight advantage here as if the minor goddess Hecate is worshiped, a special bonus of hers allows all myth units to gradually regenerate their health, and Titans are concidered myth units.\n\nThe only real drawback to the game is that you're fixed to only one camera angle with a top down view. This is from 2002 so that can be forgiven as a "dated mechanic." Your army size is limited to 200 population points max and most units take up at least two or more population points so you're not going to have armies numbering in the thousands. You'll be lucky to have an army in the dozens. Villagers also count against the population cap. Another frustration with the population cap is that population is determined by the number of houses or town centers you have. Greeks, Egyptians, and Norse can build up to 10 houses to increase their population while Atlantians can build up to 5 Manors which offer the same benefit but can also be garrisoned by other units for defense. After that, the only way to increase your unit cap is to build additional town centers and those can only be built on top of pre-existing settlements in the world and those settlements may or may not be in an optimal position. You could easily find an availible perilously close to your enemy's camp. If the map has a water feature such as a large lake or a chain of islands that isolate you from your enemy, be ready to use up half of your population to building naval defenses as ships count against the population count too. And don't bother summoning your titan from the safey of your base if you're on an island because then it becomes a glorified watchdog as Titans cannot board transports and cannot go across the water. They're landlocked so if you use up that titan gate, you're stuck with a titan at your base. Great for defense if the enemy makes it to shore (No ranged attack on the Titan, remember) but besides that...\n\nAlso be very careful on where you use your titan gate power because if you demolish it by accident or it gets destroyed by your enemy, you don't get it back and its gone forever along with all chances of your getting a titan, especially if you've got one baring down on your base.\n\nStill, Age of Mythology is an RTS that should be played by every RTS fan.\n\nThere is also an interesting piece of news. Age of Mythology may very well be the first game ever to recieve an expansion pack update for the first time since the last official update 13 years after the game was released. The Tale of the Dragon Expansion Pack is supposed to include an all new faction: The Chinese and include figures and deities from Chinese mythology.

Basically the same delectable game (and one of my favorite RTS games of all time) as it was back then, with a few bugs in transition, but largely nothing game breaking, since last I remember they fixed the Steamworks issues I had with inviting my friend.\n\nFor nostalgia buyers, you're going to get exactly what you think you're getting.  My only complaint is the rather high price tag for literally the same, old game, but eh, whatever.  Perhaps some of the magic is lost from when I played this as one of my first "actual" computer games when I was younger, but it all still holds up, and I can now appreciate the competitive and game design side of things, even if I am too chicken to play matchmaking.\n\nFor newcomers, I like to think the game has a very welcoming feel.  The art style is appropriate and iconic, the units are unique and every one of them has unique voice lines and voice effects, and the music is some of the best ambient tracks I know of.  Units respond snappily and intelligently, the interface is clean and streamlined, and I can't think of a single gripe with the resource management and building.  Er, well, the walls are sometimes a bit annoying to construct, but I rarely used those.\n\nThe game also comes with a concise and bite-size encyclopedia (accessible at any given time - even in game) of all of the gods and units included in the game and their usage and role in their given society, which is actually fascinating to read and largely attributed to my modest knowledge of the mythologies today.  Overall, I have no regrets buying the same game at a probably higher price than I got it before.","May 18, 2015","true","64.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Mind you this was back when AoM was first released back in 2002. I loved it then and I loved it now.\n\nThe game plays like your standard Age of Empires styled RTS game. Gather resources, build an army, topple your enemies. This game introduces a unique resource known as Favor which is generated differently across the 4 factions of the game. The Greeks require villagers to worship at the temple, Egyptians build up to 5 monuments, the Norse gain favor through battle, and the Atlantians gain favor by controling Town Centers. Favor can be spent to purchase specific god related upgrades or train myth units which can give you an edge.\n\nEach facton can, technically, be broken down into three subfactions divided up by the major god the faction uses. Greeks can worship Zeus, Hades, or Posedeon, Egyptians worship Ra, Isis, or Set, Norse worship Thor, Odin, or Loki, and the Atlantians worship Kronos, Oranos, or Gaia. Each major god carries their own unique god powers and other benefits upon their faction. For instance, following Thor grants you access to a Dwarven Gold Mine which, depending on the age in which it is used, acts as a free bonus Gold Mine for players to use. Similarly Thor allows for the construction of a Dwarven Armory which researches cheaper upgrades than average armories.\n\nEach major god also has a select list of minor gods for you to choose from when advancing from one age to the next. You can only pick one of two gods to worship and will gain the benefits from that god once you reach the next age. Each minor god grants you a special myth unit to use and each myth unit has its own unique traits. For example the Egyptian Scarab is a living siege unit designed to destroy enemy structures, the Greek Pegasus is a flying scout, etc. Each of the minor gods includes unique upgrades that can be researched that affect specific groups like cavalry, villagers, infantry, etc.\n\nThe god powers for each faction also differs. The Atlantians have a slight advantage with their god powers as some of them carry multiple charges and can be used more than once after a cooldown period. Up to 4 god powers can be acquired at a time, with your initial power coming from your major god and three subsiquent powers being gained from the minor gods.\n\nIn addition to basic units, there are also hero units. Hero units are the counter to myth units as they're meant for just that purpose of eliminiating the myth units. Each faction has their own hero units. Egyptians have Priests and the Pharoh, Norse have a hammer wielding melee hero, and Atlantians can promote any one of their infantry or cavalry units into heroes for a price. Greeks seem to have the short end as they only get up to 4 heroes at a time and these heroes may vary between infantry, cavalry, or archer. However the Greek Heroes have their own unique abilities such as Ajax being able to bash enemy units away with his large shield.\n\nAnd then there are the Titans! The Titans were introduced with the Titans expansion and AoM is probably one of the first games to introduce a game changing uber-unit. Upon reaching the mythic age, each faction can place a Titan Gate which, once it is uncovered/constructed by the faction's builder units, releases a Titan which is a massive and powerful melee unit that deals unbelievable damage and in most cases can obliterate an entire army singlehandedly. The only drawback to the Titans are that their health is finite and any health lost is lost forever and if the Titan dies, you don't get another one. The most effective counter to a Titan is another Titan or a host of ranged hero units. The Atlantians seem to have a slight advantage here as if the minor goddess Hecate is worshiped, a special bonus of hers allows all myth units to gradually regenerate their health, and Titans are concidered myth units.\n\nThe only real drawback to the game is that you're fixed to only one camera angle with a top down view. This is from 2002 so that can be forgiven as a "dated mechanic." Your army size is limited to 200 population points max and most units take up at least two or more population points so you're not going to have armies numbering in the thousands. You'll be lucky to have an army in the dozens. Villagers also count against the population cap. Another frustration with the population cap is that population is determined by the number of houses or town centers you have. Greeks, Egyptians, and Norse can build up to 10 houses to increase their population while Atlantians can build up to 5 Manors which offer the same benefit but can also be garrisoned by other units for defense. After that, the only way to increase your unit cap is to build additional town centers and those can only be built on top of pre-existing settlements in the world and those settlements may or may not be in an optimal position. You could easily find an availible perilously close to your enemy's camp. If the map has a water feature such as a large lake or a chain of islands that isolate you from your enemy, be ready to use up half of your population to building naval defenses as ships count against the population count too. And don't bother summoning your titan from the safey of your base if you're on an island because then it becomes a glorified watchdog as Titans cannot board transports and cannot go across the water. They're landlocked so if you use up that titan gate, you're stuck with a titan at your base. Great for defense if the enemy makes it to shore (No ranged attack on the Titan, remember) but besides that...\n\nAlso be very careful on where you use your titan gate power because if you demolish it by accident or it gets destroyed by your enemy, you don't get it back and its gone forever along with all chances of your getting a titan, especially if you've got one baring down on your base.\n\nStill, Age of Mythology is an RTS that should be played by every RTS fan.\n\nThere is also an interesting piece of news. Age of Mythology may very well be the first game ever to recieve an expansion pack update for the first time since the last official update 13 years after the game was released. The Tale of the Dragon Expansion Pack is supposed to include an all new faction: The Chinese and include figures and deities from Chinese mythology. The expansion pack is set to be released on January 28th of this year. And just to give you some perspective, The original Age of Mythology was released in 2002 with the Titans Expansion releasing the year after in 2003. Now we're getting an expansion pack in 2016. That's almost 14 years after the game came out. For a game to be this old and recieve an update like this 14 years later is definately something worth noting.","January 19","true","10.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game is great and i love it. There are many, many problems with it though. The majority of the people on the game are terrible. There are so many bugs now, that its not even worth playing at this stage. You will desync the majority of the games, and the games that you don't will be quick. The only way to get a good game is to find friends that are at your skill level. To be honest, I only recommend this game to those who will take the time to deal with the bugs. Hopefully, the AOM team haven't given up on us, and are working to fix these bugs, but it doesn't really seem like they are. Good luck, and if you get the game, I hope you enjoy","March 4","true","972.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I started out with the demo of the game before I bought the psychical copy but I was too late, the multiplayer was dead, or at least I didn't know about Game Ranger and Garena at the time and I played the game by default, and now a few months before EE came to Steam I started modding and doing stuff with it, and now I can continue doing it and have a wider audience at the game's workshop which I am very glad, but again, the price tag which was put on the EE is pretty high if you ask me, I mean, 15 or 20 dollars yes but not more. Don't get me wrong tho, I enjoy the game and I will continue to enjoy it, and I am glad that I bought it, I have always though of it as the Mythological Starcraft kind of game and it has always felt like it, but I want to do great and epic battles in the game so I'll see what I can do to make it happen so if you see my review and buy the game make sure to check out the workshop, you'll find some great mods there, go see aomheaven.com too, they got some pre EE and pre Steam stuff for the game there too, heck you might even find some of my mods on the workshop here.","June 15, 2014","true","40.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

It\'s very accurate in terms of mythology. If you\'ve played Age of Empires then you\'ll no doubt love this game. It\'s very hands on. I enjoy the graphics and sounds. The buildings are well done along with the story. The AI can seem a bit broken at times, but it\'s way nicer than Age of Empires AI, so that\'s a sight to see. Though there are parts that can get rather boring, it makes up for it with quick-play matches, and even a multiplayer system. The units are very ranged and it\'s interesting when you play as different groups like Nords, Egyptians, Greeks, etc. The system is very easy to learn and understand so even if you\'re new to these kind of games it\'s nothing to be scared of. Overall, a good strategy game.","June 1","true","14.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The graphics just look the same like the good old of the game. The only thing they advertised for was improved water and day/night cycle. In my opinion that's nice, but not a graphical revolution. The units aren't refreshed at all, they look exactly the same like in the old version.\n\nAbout the campaign: Why would you need to buy this game if you still have the old version laying around anywhere? As I said there are no impressing graphical improvements.\n\nAbout the online mode. If I buy something "extended" I can expect at least a well designed online mode, can't I?\nWell, through quick search I just find no match at all with an ELO score from ~1'600, I use the best settings as possible at friday evening (European time). After like 10 minutes of waiting I still don't find a match.\nBut if you find a match, after about 2 minutes the game quits and a message appears: "Game out of sync". And you lose your ELO points, that why my ELO is 1587, without even playing a real game.\n\nAbout Steam Workshop. I think that's indeed a good idea, also it seems like modding has been made a lot easier with this version. But there are still plenty of mods left on HeavenGames for the original Age of Mythology version.\n\nHowever, the quality of the game stays the same, except that the Extended Edition is totally overpriced.","August 29, 2014","false","1.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

This was a MARVELOUS game, but Microsoft has proven it likes to take games and mold them into a money printer. And that's what this game turned into. This game has almost no support form my recent beginning to play the game. There is much to despair over multiplayer and this is very unfortunate.\nMy reasons Extended Edition should not be bought:\n-Lag across the board in multiplayer, regardless of how beefy your computer is, online or LAN\n-God Powers can desync Online games and make it easy to abuse ranking\n-Conversion of old maps is made incredibly difficult due to the addition of some stupid 'Alfred' unit\n-There is no report button anywhere, so if you're getting trolled/bashed, you have to cope or stop playing online\n-Single Player shows it's problems in cutscenes.

At the moment I still hold my stance on the game, But I will re-pick it up when the expansion comes out and change my review accordingly.\n\nAs a long time fan of both Age of Empires and Age of Mythology, I'm going to say that unless you have an extreme attachment to Age of Mythology, go with the HD Remake of Age of Empires II for now. I'm writing this on the 2015/2016 christmas season, so maybe in the future this review will become outdated, but at the time of writing there is little support for this game compared to the other HD Remake of the same series.\n\nFirstly, Age of Empires has gotten 2 DLC packs that are both great. Expansions and improvements to a 15+ year old game. Rebalances and slight tweaks all the way to adding brand new techs to change the viability of certain kinds of play. I'm not expecting Age of Mythology to get anywhere near adding new expansions to the game as Age of Mythology is a much more advanced and complicated game with more going on, which takes quite a lot more time and materials to get it running- but the fact of the matter is that Age of Mythology EX hasn't gotten nearly any updates that mean anything since it has come out, in both gameplay aspects and technical aspects. Age of Empires II HD was extremely laggy in online and broken in multiple ways when it first came out, and so was Age of Mythology EX. The difference is that Age of Empires II HD actually fixed most of it's problems through patches, while Age of Mythology EX still chugs on some systems by managing to run worse than the original game even with lower graphical settings and online is still a buggy mess. There are apparently memory leaks within the game too, which make it slowly stutter as the game goes on, especially when the unit cap increases too.\n\nThis isn't really an offensively bad port, otherwise. I can't really say I am downright angry with this upgrade to steam, actually I'm kind of glad it happened so I can at least play half of a match (before it randomly disconnects) with friends again without having to go through confusing game channels. The game is still the same as before, nothing awful has changed... If you don't like the Day/Night cycles you can turn them off as far as I remember, and the updated water gets turned back closer to what it was like in the original if you have you graphics turned down low enough (at least from my testing). Overall, I am still going to play this game and enjoy it, and if you're a huge fan of this game you will enjoy it too- but if you're just considering this or another Age of XXXX game, AoE2HD is a much, much better upgrade currently and will not eviscerate your system if you're running something mildly old.","December 18, 2015","false","23.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

So going back to it after all these years would be great right?\n\nWell...no. Unfortunately the game hasn't aged all that well. At all. Gameplay is far slower and clunkier than I remember it being, which is strange since it feels slower than Age of Empires 2 (Which has aged far better than this game).\n\nThe graphics arn't stylistic enough to still look good, it looks more like Nintendo 64 level than anything that was the standard at the time. While the environments and buildings tend to look pretty good, the units just look fairly lackluster. Gameplay is just so god damned slowed, even the battles feel so slow and clunky you would think you were running it at the slowest speed possible. In concept units all have counters for one another, some units are better are killing certain units than others, but unless you're an expert at micromanaging in practice it just proves completely worthless.\n\nEven when I tried micromanaging my units according to their counters, combat was still slower than molasses and just felt overall unsatisfying. Defenses feel almost worthless in this game as well, no matter how well constructed your base defenses are simple infantry can just break through it in no time. The myth units are still overpowered as ever, even if you counter them with heroes.\n\nAlso the new expansion doesn't add anything particularly worthwhile. The idea is awesome! Ancient chinese units and myths all integrated into a new faction! In practice, it's nothing special at all. It feels like Greek-Lite more than anything. The campaign it adds is just so bland and uninteresting as well. Speaking of, the main campaign of the story is bland and uninteresting overall, with only a few levels that really rise up to being great (Arkantos' Dream being the most prominent). All of it boils down to "Build up base, take down X." with very little variation or story bits in the middle.\n\nWhile this would normally be nothing to really complain about (since that's the core of an RTS afterall), the slow and uninteresting gameplay piled on top of that makes the Campaign feel like a complete and utter grind.\n\nThe concept is still fantastic, but in practice it's really just not all that great a game. I've went back and played quite a few older RTS' and sadly AOM just doesn't hold up like its brothers and sisters of the time. I loved this game once, but going back and playing it? I can't really remember why I loved it.","April 20","false","24.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Even though the graphics look old, outdated and haven't been improved much at all, the game is ok to play.\n\n\nI find the game mostly enjoyable to play even though it is an ugly game with graphics from 2000. And with AOM  Extended Edition, doesn't seem like much  has been added or changed/improved. It says improved graphics, but it doesn't look like it, all that seems to have improved is a bit of water texture, shadow and some lighting and it's still ugly old outdated textures.\n\nI like how there is a mythological aspect to the game, it makes it more interesting for me, to choose a god and have various powers you can evoke, though rather limited, powers such as call down a bolt of lightning to instant kill a enemy. And a devastating meteor that will destroy a small area. These powers are very limited though, only being able to use once per map, so should be used wisely.\nI also like that there are heroes and myth units, creatures like minotaurs and hydra that become stronger and grow another head after a kill.\n\nI get bored playing too much, usually after a couple of hours, as all it is, is fighting and nothing much else. And I feel happy when I complete a campaign scenario and then feel disapointed that there's another one to complete. So I probably don't like the campaign game much as it drags on and on.\nThe campaign takes way too long to complete, usually I like lengthy games, but not when the story involved is rather boring and the scenario missions don't differ much as every one is mostly just build your base up, build army, attack and defeat. I just want it to hurry up and be over already. The campaign should be 15 to 20 scenarios at most, not 32. I prefer to play just random maps in short bursts.\n\nAnd it's frustrating when you get halfway through a scenario, only to have the game crash and you try and reload a recent save but the save file is stuffed and wont load so have to start the scenario from the begining again.\n\nI liked the game over all and say it's worth getting and playing at a discounted price for $10 or less, but not for full price as it's just an old rehashed game which has outdated graphics and not many improvements. Nothing that modernises or makes it feel worthy of the so called Extended title.\n\n6/10 ok.\n","January 13","true","111.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

Ensemble, in case you're wondering, is an old PC dev that published under microsoft then went bankrupt.  This game?  I've heard good things about it.  Will I ever know if it's good or not?  No.  Why?  Well, this isn't actually the game we knew.  It's a copy-and-paste remake by Skybox Labs, but one part was changed [for the worse]-- the netcode.\n\nIts netcode is ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  Let me just tell you about ONE match, one that was in LAN... 17 out of sync errors, an army that recognizes orders up to 2 seconds later than you clicked, a screen that only renders enemy armies on the minimap, but doesn't show you the actual army until 5 seconds after they've supposedly come close enough to see, in which they lag-teleport forward.\n\nI don't know why I trusted these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s at Skybox a second time.  This is the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t they pulled with Age of Empires 2 "HD Edition," a fake HD edition (looked just as old as classic, textures that were changed I changed back because they looked like ♥♥♥♥) with a terrible netcode as well.  This time, perhaps they didn't sell off somebody's modwork as paid DLC, but it's still just as unplayable as AoE2.\n\nDo not recommend under any circumstances.  Final verdict: Go buy it on disc from Amazon for around $8, new condition.  The original game's only from 2007, so compatibility issues are only a problem on Windows 8 in which case some have fixed it and I'm sure there are directions to fixing the game for Win8.","December 23, 2014","false","2.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rafaelmorais/recommended/266840/","rafaelmorais","Rafael M.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rafaelmorais/","444 products in account","Age of Mythology: Extended Edition is the enhanced version of the classic RTS game Age of Mythology (2002). It plays a lot like Age of Empires series, but with the use of god powers (spells alike), mythycal units and the controversial Titan, an extremely OP unit used to crush entire armies.\n\nThose accustomed to Age of Empires II (like me) will have to develop new strategies. Rushing and spamming units is a lot less efficient in AoM, because you can't build a lot of houses before claim new settlements (town centers) and the power of gods adds spicy situations that can turn the table in a favor of a player. Also, AoM has a lot less nations, but they're extremely different and will take you a lot of matchs to master them.\n\nThe Extended Edition has graphics improvements, HD support, new online features (like the observer mode and Twitch integration) and steamworks features, like the Workshop, where you can download new maps, texture packs, etc. It comes with the Titans expansion (2003) and the extra official campaign "Golden Gift". To beat all campaigns it will take 20+ hours. There's a lot of map types and game modes to play in Skirmish and Multiplayer. The replay value is high enough to keep you hooked for a long, long time.\n\nIMO, some things needs to be addressed, like the mediocre pathing and some MP issues with players from different countries (if you play with someone near to you, the match will be smooth).\n\nWhile I enjoy this game a lot, I think it's a bit pricey for a 10+ years game with minor improvements. Thankfully, AoM: EE receives great discounts from time to time.

Fun fact: Some beta testers are paid by the game devs to say good things about their game no matter how much of a crapstain it is. By now you're probably wondering when I'm gonna get to the specs. Well, I'm doing that now.\n\nGod portraits are even WORSE than the original, and so are the graphics. THE GRAPHICS! It's common sense that when a 12-year-old game is given a new HD rerelease, it's in HD. This isn't one of those rereleases.\nIt takes an incredibly high-end computer to run this game; Most laptops suffer either hard crashes or unplayably low FPS (less than 10 FPS). The FPS is even worse on multiplayer. Most of the time people lag out and your game's over.\nYou can buy the Gold Edition of the original AoM (AoM + Titans expansion) on Amazon  for less than a third of the Steam price [i.imgur.com]. If you're asking "But what about m-muh Golden Gift?" Golden Gift is a 4-level "mini-expansion"  available for FREE on the Microsoft website [www.microsoft.com]\n\nBasically, Microsoft's ripping you off right now.

For those unfamiliar with the game, it is essentially a Real Time Strategy game, much like Age of Empires - but with heroes and mythical units too. While their are only four main factions to choose from (greek, egyptian, norse, atlanteans), each faction has numerous gods to choose from, and the diversity of not only the mythical units, but the standard human units as well, is impressive.\n\nThe single player campaign is very well designed, with good level design throughout, and you will want to play it through more than once. While the Multiplayer is where the true fun lies, the single player is still worthy as a stand-alone game. Do not be afraid of trying out multiplayer though. Sure - there will be some very good people playing online, but do not be disheartened. Soon you will be (and I'm sure many of us have already experienced this) spending countless hours trying different game modes and developing new strategies to crush the heathan(s) opposing you. Also if you can get some mates together to play then all the merrier!\n\nEven though there appear to be some technical issues with the steam edition, let us just hope that they work out similar to those that were present in the Age of Empires Steam edition (which have since been fixed).\n\nIf you have not experienced Age of Mythology, then I would whole-heartedly recommend it. If you have already played it then you may be a bit sceptical about handing out money for something you already own. What you are really paying for is the steam support for multiplayer. Finding games to play will be much simpler, because I can assure you that there will be a lot of people playing this game. A great game with an active and passionate community should not be simply passed by.\n\n9/10 would nostalgia again.","May 9, 2014","true","40.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

It allows multi-player via steam which makes playing with friends and online in general much easier, still it is a bit pricey for such an old game with its issues and understandably too much for some.

While an old game now I still have fun jumping on it here and there and having a few games with friends of against the AI. For people who have yet to play this game, don't be put off by the mythological theme. This is still a great game that will give you the same satisfaction that you have gotten from the other titles.\n\nThe campaign is fun and quite a lengthy investment. The expansion added campaign following the original is fantastic as well. You can live without the dwarves focused one, while it has some fun ideas for maps it's short, easy and lacks any real depth . The main problem I had with these in the newest steam version was that the graphical quality seems to have been dramatically reduced. I played the old version less than six months ago on a ten year old laptop and it looked better than this version on my new $3k rig.\n\nThe day and night cycle is over rated and really serves no point, if anything I found it broke the game up more and turned it off.\n\nMultiplayer is fun but expect to play against strong players.\n\nRandom AI matches are the same as before but with two new game types. They can be fun but I've always been a conquest or occasionally supremacy fan.\n\nOverall it's basically the same game that it was in the past. The steam community seems to have produced a nice array of new mods to enjoy and I've had fun revisiting this game once again. If you are considering repurchasing this game, wait for a sale and pick it up cheap, it's the same game. If you are looking at this game for the first time and enjoy similar games in the "age of" series you should enjoy this title and get your money's worth from it but it may seem a little dated at first. 7/10\n","April 2, 2015","true","65.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I didn't know how to do much in this at the time, but it was amazingly fun.  Then the disc got scratched up.  My friend fixed it 7 years later and found it to be as much fun.  Once I saw the extended edition come up on Steam, I got excited.  Finally, the water isnt just a blue slime that it looked like whenever I played the original.  This game is great, but its very pricey for $30.  If you want some fun strategy, get this on sale.  If you a mythology geek like me, you may find the campaign to be a bit weird, but they stay true to most of the mythology.","January 10, 2015","true","12.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Seems like the same memory leak that was around when it first came out. Sometimes it happens randomly, other times it crashes out if I play 1 AI game after just playing a game. Sometimes I can restart the game, then play another match with no issues, other times it will crash anyways. I mean who wants to pay for a game that cannot even be played half of the time, who wants to put hours into a match to see it crash and lose all progression???\n\nWhat is weird is, when I bought the original AoM and the expansion I never had it crash at all, not sure what is up there, maybe it hates windows 10 as much as the rest of us do? Which brings up another fun thing, I had one hell of a hard time getting this game to install, ended up doing a system restore just so I could even play this game.... For a bit at least, then I see my desktop backround again :p\n\n\nAfter my latest crash, I just don't have the energy to go back and replay however long ago it was from my last save point I had to make, just in case.....

It's basically Age of Empires in 3D and with monsters and god powers.\n\nWhen it comes to the Extended Edition, I like how they updated the visuals without changing too much, because of this, most mods for the original game work with this version. (Mods which replace rextures are not compatible and need to be converted, which is a pain.)\nOne thing I don't like about the new effects and graphics is that you can't turn them off, which will make some older, less powerful systems that could run the original (like my laptop) struggle to run this version.\n\nObviously this version comes with The Titans expansion and The Golden Gift mini campaign, which is great.\n\nFinal note: As great as this game is, it's a little dated and is a little expensive for an old game. If it goes on sale for under 20$, that would a good time to buy it. That said, there aren't that many RTS games coming out these days and it might be worth paying a little more for such a great RTS.","January 20, 2015","true","39.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pataislive/recommended/266840/","pataislive","Sourgrapes.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pataislive/","361 products in account","Gameplay is virtually unchanged since its original release in 2002, leaving the balance (or unbalance) of the game intact. Because of this, and since the original game still runs on modern computers in HD resolutions, I'll be focusing entirely on what this installment brings to the table.\n\n1. Improved visuals: But not really.\n\nMuch like the AoE2 re-release, Mythology was given a visual overhaul by the new studio. What this means is that they've tacked on new graphical features, without much considering of how this will benefit players. You'll see things such as GLOBAL LIGHTING and BLURRY WATER FILTER. Whether these really improve anything lies mostly in the eyes of the beholder; but for those who played the original, the new look will be discomforting and sometimes hindering (on certain maps, your units will be difficult to see).\n\n2. Social gaming: A.k.a. the "Steam Experience".\n\nBecause custom maps is half the fun, right? Again, highly subjective, but unlike the visual improvements, this is actually a feature that is only beneficial, and does not hinder anyone who's not interested in it. So, in that sense, this is the best thing to come out of the Extended Edition. However, it does not - and will not ever - weigh heavily enough to be worthy of the 30€ price tag.\n\nBut what about all the other awesome Steam-exlusive features that you won't find in the original 2002 release? Because a PC game without achievements and trading cards doesn't belong in 2014 - said no one ever, probably. You were fine without achievements in 2002, and you were fine without Steam trading cards in 2012. But the cloud saves! The clooooouuud saaaves! Oh god, yes! Finally I can sync my save files to the web, for instant access. No, it's a decent feature, but like the workshop, hardly a worthy selling point.\n\n3. Extended Features: Watch other people play.\n\nJust as Age 2 HD was given Twitch Integration, Mythology was as well. This is a rising trend in video games, and I can't see anything wrong with it. Is it a necessary feature for the re-release of a 12 year old game? Probably not; but it doesn't hurt. But - and this seems to be the theme of this review - it is hardly worth the 30€ price tag. Streaming to Twitch is free with software like OBS, and also provides tenfolds more options than any integrated feature ever will.\n\nIn conclusion: Don't waste your money\n\nUnlike the Age 2 re-release, this one is not needed - unless maybe you're among the relatively few hardcore Mythology players, that has also grown tired using 3rd party applications for online matchmaking, enough so that you are willing to throw 30€ at the unstoppable Remake-All-The-Games machine. If not, then pass on this one. It's an older game that still works fine on modern machines, and supports larger resolutions out of the box. Pick it up at a local game shop for a couple of bucks instead. You'll be better off.","July 10, 2014","false","31.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

It's gotten so much publicity that it's even got a new expansion coming out after over a decade of silence.\n\nFrom the same minds that produced Age of Empires, Age of Mythology puts you in charge of ancient warriors and pantheons in a struggle to conquer the map. Gather food, wood, gold and Favor from your Gods in order to expand, conquer and acquire. New to the format are Myth Units and God Powers: use your accumulated favor to obtain unique improvements and powerful creatures from legends. Call upon your Gods to create food from nothing, plagues of locusts or rain fire from the skies on your enemies.\n\nIn the game's 13 years of existence, it has seen 2 expansions: The Titans, and more recently Tale of the Dragon. The Extended Edition comes with The Titans expansion, which grants access to the Atlantean Civilization, an offshoot of the Greeks who have been abandoned by the traditional Gods and choose to worship the precursors to the Olympians, the Titans. As well, the Extended Edition has new online support, allowing you to play games with people from across the world and upload to Twitch immediately.","October 10, 2015","true","136.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game has some bugs and frame drop issues that were not in the previous disk versions. Though I absolutely love this game, I am not sure if the $30 price tag is worth it for essentially the same game you could have gotten in 2003. For all Veteran AoM players, this being brought back is amazing, regardless of the limited changes. I would still suggest it to any new players also, though, it is extremely fun and dynamic.

All of them Were all fun to play and learn about, along with the Minor Gods, and all of the Mythological Beings such as the Phoenix (Egyptians)\nor the Automatons (Atlantians) and of course the Minotaur (Greeks).  If You buy this Game, I hope You will learn as much about it and enjoy playing it as much I have in my past.","March 9","true","6.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I used to paly this back in the day when it was new.\n\nThere are 4 cultures to pick from: Greek, Norse, Egyptian, and Atlantis.\n\nI like it because it uses real-world mythological creatures (although Atlantis is just a whole bunch of Pagan stuff mashed together) in the ways that warrior cultures would realistically use them: For instance, Hydra are used in a simliar fashion that Hannibal (NO, NOT THE DUDE FROM THE A-TEAM) used elephants, but they grow heads sometimes when they kill a unit, and each new head give them a more powerful attack.\n\nPros:\n\n- Fairly simple to understand and start playing\n- The campaigns are fun, and also teach you a little about mythological history (e.g. you have to collect a piece of Osiris in one of them)\n- The Single/Random maps can be a great way to kill a few minutes, or an hour\n- This version includes all the expansions/DLC\n- Voice acting is pretty good, even if the script's a little cheesy\n- The Devs are pretty active compared to a lot of other game communities\n\nCons:\n\n- Last time I played this over LAN (and I mean THIS edition of the game), it was incredibly jerky. It didn't lag, but it did stutter. Totally playable, but not entirely fun. The latest patch apparently deals with this, but I haven't had time to test it and don't know when I will be able to again.\n- The extra lighting effects, while excellent, MAY mean that the game has a much higher 'minimum spec'. Having said that, most modern computers should be okay.","November 6, 2015","true","91.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pataislive/recommended/266840/","pataislive","Sourgrapes.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pataislive/","361 products in account","Gameplay is virtually unchanged since its original release in 2002, leaving the balance (or unbalance) of the game intact. Because of this, and since the original game still runs on modern computers in HD resolutions, I'll be focusing entirely on what this installment brings to the table.\n\n1. Improved visuals: But not really.\n\nMuch like the AoE2 re-release, Mythology was given a visual overhaul by the new studio. What this means is that they've tacked on new graphical features, without much considering of how this will benefit players. You'll see things such as GLOBAL LIGHTING and BLURRY WATER FILTER. Whether these really improve anything lies mostly in the eyes of the beholder; but for those who played the original, the new look will be discomforting and sometimes hindering (on certain maps, your units will be difficult to see).\n\n2. Social gaming: A.k.a. the "Steam Experience".\n\nBecause custom maps is half the fun, right? Again, highly subjective, but unlike the visual improvements, this is actually a feature that is only beneficial, and does not hinder anyone who's not interested in it. So, in that sense, this is the best thing to come out of the Extended Edition. However, it does not - and will not ever - weigh heavily enough to be worthy of the 30€ price tag.\n\nBut what about all the other awesome Steam-exlusive features that you won't find in the original 2002 release? Because a PC game without achievements and trading cards doesn't belong in 2014 - said no one ever, probably. You were fine without achievements in 2002, and you were fine without Steam trading cards in 2012. But the cloud saves! The clooooouuud saaaves! Oh god, yes! Finally I can sync my save files to the web, for instant access. No, it's a decent feature, but like the workshop, hardly a worthy selling point.\n\n3. Extended Features: Watch other people play.\n\nJust as Age 2 HD was given Twitch Integration, Mythology was as well. This is a rising trend in video games, and I can't see anything wrong with it. Is it a necessary feature for the re-release of a 12 year old game? Probably not; but it doesn't hurt. But - and this seems to be the theme of this review - it is hardly worth the 30€ price tag. Streaming to Twitch is free with software like OBS, and also provides tenfolds more options than any integrated feature ever will.\n\nIn conclusion: Don't waste your money\n\nUnlike the Age 2 re-release, this one is not needed - unless maybe you're among the relatively few hardcore Mythology players, that has also grown tired using 3rd party applications for online matchmaking, enough so that you are willing to throw 30€ at the unstoppable Remake-All-The-Games machine. If not, then pass on this one. It's an older game that still works fine on modern machines, and supports larger resolutions out of the box. Pick it up at a local game shop for a couple of bucks instead. You'll be better off.","July 10, 2014","false","31.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Someone who rates this game positive is making a giant mistake. People actually think of the original game, which came out in the early 2000' and not the so called "Extended Edition" which is now available on Steam. If people were held to rate only the "new" EE, all the thumbs would go down. Dont get me wrong, the original AoM aswell as AoE II were briliant games which i truly admire.\n\nPublishers take an old and sucessful game, dont change anything at all and call it afterwards "HD" or "Extended Edition" to resell it for 10-30€\nThe graphics are the same like in the original game, the resolution of 1920x1080 doesnt fit to the rest of the game.\n\nThe multiplayer is a complete mess with tons of bugs, crashes, laggs, etc.. It takes forever to start a game cause you cant find other players online and if you get a game finally started, you got 50% chance that you, or anyone else drops or crashes and disc.\n\nThe game is in no case worth its price of around 30,00€. My recommendation is to get this game on sales for a max. price of 5-8€ or find the original one and install it again.","November 30, 2015","false","53.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Seems like the same memory leak that was around when it first came out. Sometimes it happens randomly, other times it crashes out if I play 1 AI game after just playing a game. Sometimes I can restart the game, then play another match with no issues, other times it will crash anyways. I mean who wants to pay for a game that cannot even be played half of the time, who wants to put hours into a match to see it crash and lose all progression???\n\nWhat is weird is, when I bought the original AoM and the expansion I never had it crash at all, not sure what is up there, maybe it hates windows 10 as much as the rest of us do? Which brings up another fun thing, I had one hell of a hard time getting this game to install, ended up doing a system restore just so I could even play this game.... For a bit at least, then I see my desktop backround again :p\n\n\nAfter my latest crash, I just don't have the energy to go back and replay however long ago it was from my last save point I had to make, just in case.....

I would absolutely recommend this game. This is one of the best old school RTS games on Steam along with Rise of Nations and Age of Empires 2 & 3. I can't praise this game enough and I am truly grateful that I can play this game without any issues or hiccups as well as having a fresh aspect in achievment which make you want to play even more and adds even more replay value to this already extraordinary game.
