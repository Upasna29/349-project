The game’s pixel graphics, the way in which it tells its story, its presentation and its sound remind me of the type of games that I played on the Commodore 64. As an occasionally proud retro gamer this can be a very good thing. In the case of Renegade Sector Games’ title I have to admit to being more than a little torn. In a number of ways I am deeply attracted to the game yet in others I feel detached and questioning whether I made the right choice in featuring the game.\n\nThis may be because I never did get around to playing the under appreciated Venusian Vengeance even though the game has long been in my Steam library. As such I have no connection to the game – which is an indirect sequel, arguably more of a spin off. Therefore there is an understandable disconnect to the game even if I have been advised that you don’t need to have played this game in order to have a good time playing this one. There is a genre difference between the two games as well as this is a classically styled survival horror game.\n\nIf you are the type of player that retrieves most of their story through cut scenes and prefers not to read journal entries, computer terminals and the like then you would easily be forgiven for having ignored the storyline. But there is one and it is up to you to find it. As this could be a game breaker for a large number of players it is something that has to be stated. I am personally on the fence in regards to stories being told in this fashion. It works very well as a tool for games that the player finds deeply engrossing because you want to investigate everything and read everything while for other games it can have the opposite effect.\n\nThere is something on the in game sounds that I wanted to make a mention of but it was more of a candid observation than anything critical. Have you ever played the original Ghostbusters game that was on the Commodore 64? I haven’t heard that typing sound in a video game since and the sound as writing comes up on the screen in dialogue reminds me of it.\n\nThis is a game where you are going to die a lot and will appreciate the save points when you find them. It is also a game where you are going to want to be someone who conserves their ammunition because it can occasionally be very few and far between. You wont necessarily know when and where it is scarce so it is in your best interests to be both a scrounger and less trigger happy. Enemies can prove to be ruthless and you may at times feel as though the AI is too strong but it’s not supposed to be easy – which it is at other times.\n\nNinja Outbreak has the potential to be considered an outstanding game for some players. I know that several of my friends who played it when it was in Greenlight were as eager to play the full release as any game that they had come across in recent times.\n\nVisit Steamified[www.steamified.com] for more reviews and our epic giveaways","April 7","true","9.0"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"
