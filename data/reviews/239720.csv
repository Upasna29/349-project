It came out of nowhere and I didn't know anything about it. At $40 I didn't want to chance it but when I Amazon had it briefly on a price mistake for $10 I snapped it up and I'm so glad I did!\n\nIt's a 3D platformer (a rarity for the PC these days) along the lines of Mario 64/Sunshine but with a decidely Pac-Man spin. All the basics are there, chomping ghosts, power pills, fruit etc but much expanded on of course.\n\nAnd it all works really well to make for a ridiculously fun game. I never though I would be playing Pac-man in 3D in a chameleon costume trying to shoot a long sticky tongue at ghosts while being on multilayered conveyor belts moving in different directions but it was great!\n\nAdmittedly, I'm still early on so I'll have to see how it holds up but I'm really enjoying the ride so far.\n\nThe game is laid out with multiple areas each with a map with levels that you progress through, very much like a Mario game. You can also go back to the school (a home base basically), talk to the various characters and when you earn enough fruit by completing levels play various mini-games on arcade machines.\n\nSpeaking of school, the story. Pac-man is in high school. And he's friends with Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Clyde, and a few other assorted characters. Don't think about it too hard. Actually, it's supposed to be based on a new Pac-Man cartoon series which I haven't seen and the game just sort of assumes you are familiar with the setting and characters which by the way can be a bit hokey in a kids show sort of way at times. Still what the game lacks in expository dialogue or deep story it more than makes up for in gameplay and fun factor.\n\nUnlike so many games these days it's not ball bustingly hard which is great for people like me who want a fun game you can play leisurely with a moderate degree of challenge without being frustrated. It also would be great for kids and there's absolutely nothing objectionable in the game. That being said, people looking for a very high degree of challenge might not be satisfied. I'll have to see how the game goes in the higher levels but for right now for me it's in a Goldilocks spot of being just right for challenge without being too much of a cake walk or too excruciatingly hard.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint the options are very scarce, as console ports frequently are, however the game looks excellent visually for the style it's going for, runs very smooth and I had zero issues with it all unlike some other console ports I've tried.\n\nI've used a (360) controller and the game handles great that way. I'm assuming it at least has token keyboard and mouse support but I can't even imagine playing it without a controller. It would feel odd to me.\n\nWould I pay $40 for it? Probably not, but that's only because I'm a PC gamer spoiled by all the insane deals we get. Having said that, it's a really well put together fun, fresh game and I wouldn't hestitate to, say, buy the console version as a gift. Actually I'm probably going to get it for my niece and nephew for Christmas.\n\nI definitely recommend getting this game if you have and interest in light hearted 3D platformers. I totally get that PC gamers would balk at paying $40 for this and I did too but keep an eye out for a sale.\n\nThis is a really well made fun game that looks and plays great. Much higher quality than most games I've played lately, though admittedly I tend to play a lot of indie stuff.","October 31, 2013","true","4.0"," 100 of 125 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","100","125","0","0"

As a gamer who is almost 40 years old I grew up on the PAC-MAN arcade game as a kid. The original game swallowed more than enough coins of mine than I care to admit but it was always a solid good time with school mates when looking to kill an hour or two. Goodwill prompted me in the end to purchase PAC-MAN World 2 and all I remember of it was that it was a dismal game that failed on almost all the levels it tried to attempt. This was the period when platforming was king on consoles and everybody and his dog was trying to ensure their mascot became the champion mascot - the mascot that got to sell consoles ala Mario. However, PAC's transition to 3D platform hero was a horrid affair with terrible 3D graphics and even worse platform mechanics. It was a game that was quickly regulated to the bargain bin.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=253550751\nUnbeknownst to me I soon found out that PAC had been busy in the interim since I last saw him. Starring in his very own short lived cartoon show (seems the yellow chomping dot just can't get a break with today's modern audiences) and yet another attempt by Konami to make a platform star out of him with his newest adventure - PAC-MAN and the Ghostly Adventures. I bought this title with great hesitation because when you have Nintendo and Mario in one corner and Ubisoft and Rayman in the other and then Activision literally dominating the space with its Skylander figurine's and game, a platform title emerging into this market has really got its work cut out for it because the market is already saturated with other middle-tier heroes such as Jak and Daxter, Ratchet and Clank and Sonic the Hedgehog. Very little breathing space when all things are considered.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=246201800\nOne can't help but feel sorry for poor Namco Bandai who haven't seemed to be able to get it right when it comes to branding and delivering a platform PAC that is a PAC for the ages. PAC-MAN and the Ghostly Adventures is not a bad game by any means - it certainly plays and feels like a platform game but Namco is a little behind the curve here, about 20 odd years behind the curve to be exact. If ever a game was made from an early blueprint of what a platform game should play and feel like then this is that game. It has the all the obligatory levels you would have expected to find in a platform game circa 1990 from levels made out of ice to levels set in molten lava. The game is so old-school in its design and implementation that you would think it was literally an artifact dug up from that time period. When you have platform games like Rayman Legends pushing the boundaries in literally hundreds of different creative directions it becomes much harder to recommend a title like this one.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=248652975\nWhilst certainly not bad in terms of PAC-MAN World 2 kinds of terrible - it's certainly not top tier stuff either for the gamer who demands just that little bit more from his platform games. It's all very middle of the road but despite itself it's still fun to play in small bursts. In fact this may be the perfect game to get for the little ones and I would heartily recommend you do pick it up when it goes on sale if you have bambino's running around but if you are an old time gamer like myself who has seen and done it all, PAC-MAN and the Ghostly Adventures will offer you nothing new. You will get a solid, short little game that can be played through in about 5-8hrs and then when you are done with it you will have already promptly forgotten it. Get it on sale if you must pick it up. Already within the month of purchasing, playing and writing this review the game has dropped from $29.99 to $19.99. I wouldn't pay full price like I did for this but it appears that some old childhood icons will die hard. Well for me at least.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","April 5, 2014","true","14.0"," 69 of 91 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","69","91","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeektheyoshi/recommended/239720/","zeektheyoshi","Zeek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeektheyoshi/","273 products in account","This game feels like something that would've been put out around the time of the early Playstation/Nintendo 64 days.  It's a 3D platformer, with a bit of a collect-a-thon going on.  If you've played Mario 64, you'll have an idea of what you're getting into.\n\nPros:\n-Controls are tight\n-Voice acting is pretty good\n-Graphics are bright and beautiful\n-Cheaper price point than other new games (at this time)\n-Interesting power-ups\n\nCons:\n-Encounter the same enemies over and over (you'll be hearing, "Get the Pac-Man!" so friggin' much)\n-All levels are generally the same\n\nThis game is meant more for fans of the show, than it is for people new to it.  There isn't any introduction for the characters you meet, or anything of that nature, so if you aren't acquainted with the show you won't understand the relationships between characters, or anything.  However, that doesn't really get in the way of the game (I went in knowing nothing about the show).  The graphics are very nice, and the worlds are bright and colorful (so, playing this on a big screen looks great).  Only problem is that, while the levels look like nice are appear big, they're pretty bare.  Gameplay-wise, you run, jump, chomp ghosts, and collect power-ups and other collectibles.  Most of the platforming is fairly easy, aside from a few random hard sections.  The chomping function works like the homing attack in the modern Sonic games (so, watch out if you use it over a pit!).  Aside from the main quest, there are a few minigames, but I haven't bothered with them.\n\nThe primary issue I had with this game is that I was somewhat expecting a game similar to the Pac-Man World games, since those were pretty fun.  However, while this game is definitely not on par with the Pac-Man World games, it still isn't a bad game.  Since it's geared more towards a younger audience, it functions as a nice introduction to 3D platformers (something that's missing these days).  I can imagine it would be much better suited, and offer a bit more difficulty, to younger players.  Only real oddity that sticks out to me is that Pac-Man can eat ghosts without consuming a power pellet.  I'm assuming they're some reason, detailed in the show, for why that is; same goes for why Pac-Man is friends with all the iconic ghosts from the arcade game.\n\nI played this game with an N64 controller mapped as a Xbox 360 controller; this game is fully compatible with a 360 controller, and does have keyboard/mouse support (however, I haven't tried the latter).\n\nFor a better experience, I'd recommend getting a USB device to hook up an N64 controller, since it just feels right.\n\ntl;dr: if you crave a 3D platformer that feels like something out of the Playstation/N64/Saturn era, this game is a good fit.  If you know someone younger that isn't a big gamer (and also a fan of the show), this game is also a good fit.","December 31, 2013","true","4.2"," 36 of 47 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","36","47","0","0"

Personally I'm not a huge fan of the show, but how is the game? I paid around 3 euros for it, and my ex-PAC-tations(puns) weren't exactly high, but let's see if the game delivered.\n\nThe game follows a teenage Pac and his friends Cylindria and Spiral along with the ghosts Inky, Pinky, Blinky, and Clyde(who for some reason are heroes in this series), and they all are joining together to put a stop to the evil Lord Betrayus, the Lord of Ghosts and the Netherworld, who wants to take over Pacopolis and turn everyone into ghosts.\n\nThe story here is completely silly, the script is even less engaging than staring at paint dry for six hours and...the puns OH GOD THE PUNS SONIC BOOM WASN'T THIS BAD\n\nSpeaking of Sonic Boom, at least Rise of Lyric attempted a decent story, as it had good voice acting, some funny jokes here and there and some decent boss fights. This game did not make me chuckle. NOT. EVEN. ONCE. Oh it tried, but "tried" is the keyword here. These writers couldn't come up with a decent joke to save their lives. Puns puns puns puns puns PUNS PUNS PUNS PUNSPUNSPUNSPUNSPUNSOHGODPLEASENOMORE\n\nTo put it short,the writing is abysmal.\n\nVisually, the game looks nice. The level designs are simplistic but get the job done. You've got your token lava world, ice world, dark world, and town world, so nothing too original, but hey, it works. Character models look good, the animation is a little stiff but it's serviceable.  30FPS frame lock is a bummer, but at least it's consistent I guess.\n\nAs for audio, the voice acting is alright. No one is awful here, however those puns that Pac-Man never stops spewing out of his mouth during the game help make him the most annoying to listen to. Doesn't help that they are incredibly repetitive... As for the soundtrack....pretty forgettable. Can't remember nearly any of the songs, except the hub world theme.\n\nAnd of course, there's the gameplay. It's pretty derivitive and unoriginal, but on the other hand, it's very competant and the controls are smooth and fluid. I found the game pretty enjoyable to play through from beginning to end, and the tight controls definitely helped.\n\nThere a variety of power-ups to use through out your adventure. There's Ice Pac, where Pac can freeze enemies, Fire Pac, where enemies can be set ablaze, Chameleon Pac, where Pac can swing on poles and swallow foes with his tongue, Granite Pac, where Pac rolls around in Super Monkey Ball esque level design, and Metal Pac, where Pac can gravite on metal platforms and pull enemies towards him. None of these concepts are that original, as they have all been done elsewhere, but they are still fun to use nonetheless.\n\nWhile playing through the game, at the end of each stage is a fruit, of which there are four varieties. These are cherries, pineapples, lemons, and zucchinis, and collecting 7(6 if Zucchini)of each will unlock an arcade machine that can be played in the school hall. None of these are incredibly fun, but they are interesting little diversions from the main game.\n\nThe only real problem with this game for me(besides the puns) is the fact that the game kind of lacks an identity of it's own, instead borrowing a lot of its concepts from other games like Super Mario Galaxy and Pac-Man World 2. It gives the game a "been there done that" sort of feel, and though I enjoyed my time with it, it's hard to argue that the game just isn't very original.\n\nBeating Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures will take around 7-8 hours, and gathering all the achievements will take around 12-ish, as you need to play all the levels again to unlock the Tokken Effort achievement, but since the layout will be more familiar to you on the second run, it shouldn't take very long.\n\nThe game offers a decent challenge but extra lives will be in abundance so getting a game over will be difficult,I had around 60-65 lives at the end of the game, although I did die quite a number of times, so take that for what you will.\n\nThere's also a multiplayer mode where you and three other friends can be the ghosts and take on Pac-Man, but it's fairly mediocre and not really worth bothering with.\n\nOverall, Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures isn't phenomenal nor will it change the world, but it is a surprisingly pleasant little gem , as in spite of its flaws, it delivers an enjoyable 3D platformer of which not many are found on Steam, so if you are looking for a new platfromer to play, you could do a lot worse than this one! I'd recommend it at a discount however, as the base price is far too high, but at 50% off or higher I'd say give it a look.\n\nPros:\nCharming visuals\nTight controls\nFormulaic but well crafted level design\nFun power-ups\nLong length for a platformer\nNice little side minigames\n\nCons:\n30fps lock\nPUNS\nBarebones story\nForgettable music\nMeh multiplayer\nSuffers from an identity crisis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","August 8, 2015","true","10.2"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","95","18","19","7","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/239720/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","PAC-MAN and the Ghostly Adventures is a platformer for all ages. At least that's what Namco-Bandai wants you to think. Truth is, when I played this game i constantly asked myself: "Who is this for?" The level of difficulty is too low for someone with even a minimal talent for gaming, but the controls (specifically the need to rotate the camera) might be too much for small children. No...wait...I take that back. Kids today can handle complicated control schemes. I've gotten my ♥♥♥ kicked by enough toddlers in Call of Duty to figure that out. Hell, one of the levels in this game is actually called "Gears of Warning". So maybe the developer knows their audience, but they were just too busy coming up with hilarious puns to design a thoroughly enjoyable game.\n\nThis is one of those games where there's nothing distinctly PAC-MAN about it. The main character could have been Super Jump Kid. He explores traditionally-designed levels based on "City World", "Ice World", and "Ruins World". Along the way he jumps around, collects coins, and punches ghouls. Occasionally he'll get powers that let him use different attacks or solve problems. But nobody would buy Super Jump Kid and the Ghostly Adventures would they? So we get a tie-in game based on a cartoon.\n\nMainly what I'm getting at is that there isn't enough PAC-MAN in this game about PAC-MAN. The original arcade game has a simple concept. Pac has to eat all of the pellets, but he can't touch the ghosts or else he'll die. If he eats a power-pellet, then the ghosts will get scared, and then Pac can eat them. In Ghostly Adventures, Pacster simply eats the ghosts. I guess it's an improvement over the other 3D platformer Pacs, because in those games he smashes enemies with his butt, like nearly every other platformer hero. Also, I can see how having Pacster being vulnerable to ghosts could be frustrating in this kind of game. The problem is, allowing Pacster to circumvent the need for power pellets, gives the developer an excuse to load the levels with padding.\n\nEach stage is filled with ghosts, and they tend to spawn in wide-open areas. This is a recipe for boring game-design. To defeat a ghost all you have to do is get close and press the "X" button, Pacster takes care of the rest. While each ghost is capable of performing various attacks, they aren't a threat in the slightest. This is due to the constant presence of ability-pellets. As I mentioned before, Super Jump Kid aka Pacster utilizes various powers to reach the end of each level. He loses these powers whenever he takes damage, but since ability-pellets disappearing could make for un-winnable situations, they simply respawn immediately. Also, even when you lose your power, you don't lose any health. This is how you game-design yourself into a corner. If that wasn't enough, Pacster can scare all nearby ghosts by making a goofy face. Using this ability requires a meter to recharge, but if you grab an ability-pellet, then you'll have a full-charge the next time you lose said ability. To sum it all up: When you walk into an area filled with ghosts, your first instinct will be to bump into an enemy, lose your ability, scare the ghosts, then mash away until the area is clear.\n\nThis is exactly why I suggest the alternative. By not putting forth the effort and creativity to design thoughtful ghost encounters, the developers behind this game end up trivializing the entire concept. Pacster is just way too good at ghost-eating. His poor old man had to carefully ration those precious power-pellets, just to survive the increasingly adept ghosts. The platforming isn't anymore difficult, due to the very generous jumps and prevalence of extra lives & checkpoints. In the rare cases that you die, it's most likely due to dropped inputs. A 30 fps lock is one thing, but when the game starts at 30, chugs to 10-15 fps, then slingshots to 60 for a millisecond, your double-jump might not register.\n\nBut this game is for kids right? It's not supposed to matter if it's too easy. However, if children today are capable of figuring out games like GTA, Call of Duty, and so on; Wouldn't PAC-MAN and the Ghostly adventures be an insult to their intelligence? Let's take M-Rated games out of the discussion. If kids today can play games like Mario 64, Sonic Generations, and so on. What's the point of giving them this? It might draw their attention for a few hours, but they'll realize how mind-numbing it really is. That's not to mention the awful writing. This game has some of the worst jokes in the world. If your son or daughter plays through it, I guarantee that they'll grow up to be a few cans short of a six-pac.","November 16, 2015","false","5.9"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/239720/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","I have some things to say about Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures. The sort of things you’d expect to be discussed about a 3D platformer, be that on the topic of level designs or how every 3D platformer is essentially Super Mario 64 redubbed. I promise we’ll get to those things, but first there is something more important I need to touch on, and that is: what the bloody hell is going on with Pac-Man’s lore?\n\nI know what you’re thinking. “Pac-Man has lore?” At some point what was once a sparsely animated, power-orb munching arcade game would appear to have been wholly transformed into all manner of mass merchandise, chief among them now an animated kids show bearing the same name as this new entry in Pac-Man’s gaming catalog. What exactly goes on in this show remains a mystery to me, as the game itself offers not so much as a cursory explanation for some of the most bizarre developments. At some point Pac-Man appears to have made peace with his age-old ghost antagonists and is now…attending high school with them? Whatever truce was made though only seems to apply to the four most recognizable ghosts of the series, as Pac-Man is more than ready to devour each and every other ghost he encounters on his journey to do “something”.\n\nThe plot is of Ghostly Adventures remains entirely unclear to me, but it would seem to involve ravaging ancient temples for anything not nailed down, to then be immediately consumed by Pac-Man. For however altruistic Pac-Man would profess himself to be (proclaiming himself at times to be a super-hero), his entire purpose for being seems to solely revolve around gorging himself. On fruits, on ghosts, on historic artifacts, Pac-Man doesn’t care! The only thing more present than ghosts in this adventure are burger dispensing vending machines, though if need be Pac-Man seems just as happy to rummage through a trashcan for a bite to eat. His insatiable appetite is perhaps on the surface innocuous, but there is something deeply disturbing about a world that seems to exist solely to appease the hunger of its most famous resident.\n\nSo too is Pac-Man’s relationship with the ghosts that for some reason are both accepted and outlawed, simultaneous friend and foe, or more accurately, food. At one point it is revealed that collecting the eyes of ghosts will allow Pac-Man to generate more lives, calling into question just what exactly pac-people are. Were ghosts once pac-people too, or did the pacs evolve by devouring and multiplying through the consumption of ghost eyes? Is the real reason for the eternal war between Pac-Man and ghosts actually the result of pac-people enacting genocide upon the already dead for the sake of some disturbing means of reproduction? How many thinkpieces will it take before we arrive at the conclusion that Pac-Man was the monster all along?\n\nThere is a layer of Ghostly Adventures that I would love to believe is inexplicably aiming for subversive surrealism. So much of this kids show spin-off feels odd and unnerving compared to the Pac-Man games before it, that to have it finally reveal itself as some deeper commentary on an industry that refuses to let old icons die would be incredible. But the truth, as is so often the case, is far more mundane and expected. Ghostly Adventures ultimately isn’t the abstract arthouse Pac-Man game I never knew I wanted (and probably do not actually want to play, but only to exist), but merely the inevitable result of a series that has long since fallen out of relevance. Aside from perhaps Sonic there are few greater gaming has-beens than Pac-Man, a character who never really got to be one, but was almost immediately repurposed into a brand icon. At this point it seems fair to say Pac-Man is more popular within the realm of phone cases than videogames, and Ghostly Adventures isn’t going to change that. It’s a feeble attempt at regaining interest in an outdated mascot, breed from an even more misguided ploy to appeal to an audience that is likely too young to have ever even had an affinity for Pac-Man as anything more than a recognizable face of gaming.\n\nGhostly Adventures exists in the realm of so many TV and movie spin-off 3D platformers, which are at once entirely inoffensive and unremarkable. Remove Pac-Man and the ghosts and this could just as easily be any N64-era inspired platformer, replete with the requisite abundance of meaningless collectibles, and a camera that is often nauseating even when it’s working as intended. Levels are standard fair straight shots, relying mostly on an abundance of ghosts to slow you down than anything approaching clever platforming. Ghostly Adventures would almost be obnoxiously easy and trivial if it were not for how easy it is to die from slipping off a ledge or clipping on the edge of a platformer you ought to have been able to make. I never died so often as to have anything less than an unreasonable amount of extra lives, but each death brought with it enough repetition to still be an absolute chore to deal with.\n\nEvery platforming standard is accounted for in Ghostly Adventure, but it somehow manages to make genre conventions even more dull than they already were. There are ice levels and fire levels, spooky levels and colorful levels full of interconnecting tubes (the exit animations for which are probably the most variety to be found in the whole game), but it’s all so astoundingly boring. And maybe it’s my fault for hoping this game would be even slightly more than it appeared to be. It’s possible I am simply, as a friend put it, “kicking a kids game in the shins,” but even then I have to wonder what kid is going to play this over the likes of Mario or Minecraft. Perhaps judged solely against other games likely to confuse grandparents and disappoint their grandchildren on Christmas, Ghostly Adventures is far from the worst you could do, but calling it acceptable mediocrity hardly seems much of a compliment.\n\nGhostly Adventures is so utterly typical that it is too mundane to be legitimately upsetting. It falls perfectly in what seems to have become an established trajectory for videogame mascots (pioneered primarily by Sonic), where upon reaching peek obscurity developers then resort of inserting their iconic hero into games they were never designed for and which in turn do little to regain the status these characters once held. Ghostly Adventures isn’t bad, per say, it is just exceptionally uninteresting. It is not unreasonable to say you might enjoy parts of it, but even in its normality Ghostly Adventures finds a way to grate on you. Maybe it’s the way Pac-Man ends every level with an enormous burp which sees a swarm of ghost eyes escape from the bottom of whatever is inside his spherical body. Or it’s the realization that you’re playing a Pac-Man game that is in no way Pac-Man, but is rather the cold, inevitable result of a game designed for the sake of marketing potential. Or maybe it’s just that Pac-Man was always more cultural icon than game character, and that’s probably for the best.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","April 1","false","5.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

I'm a big fan of the 3d platformer and collectathon genres, so when I saw this game on sale for $10 I knew I should pick it up.  I went in expecting a poorly designed budget game that was only made to get money from kids that are fans of the (bad) cartoon Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures.  Instead I was greeted with a cheery, well designed game with a great style overall.  The soundtrack and level design is solid, and the different forms of Pac-Man keep the gameplay interesting.\n\nIt isn't a very long game by any means, nor is it difficult in any way.  But considering there aren't many 3d platformers being made anymore, this is a must buy for any fans of the genre.\n\nFor fans of achievements, completing this game also isn't hard at all but will probably involve a little grinding and playing some absolutely dreadful minigames.  Seriously, the minigames are horrible.  Why were they even made?  Come to think of it, my biggest complaint in this game is the lack of an arcade version of the original Pac-Man.  Why spend development time on crappy arcade titles when you could just port over some old ones and give an actual reason (besides achievements) to play the minigames?\n\nOverall though , great title.

Pacman controls just fine for the most part, with a double jump and a very satisfying chomping mechanic that gives combat a great sense of flow. Level design is fairly solid, and the game is bright and colorful and fun to look at, and has quite a bit of variety in its visual design. While the game has flaws, it does enough right that I can give it a reccomendation.\n\nLet's discuss the flaws then, shall we? First off, I actually watched (and liked) the show this game is based on, and the show basically feels like a great big ad for this game (and any future installments). Weirdly, then, the game feels like a cheap tie-in, the kind you'd get on the PS1 or something. The game establishes absolutely nothing about the universe or characters, and just assumes you know who everyone is, and even then doesn't really do much with the characters. A bunch of them from the show are in here, but they don't do much besides act as a cameo (including a criminally underused Dr. Buttocks). Entirely not helping is that they couldn't get the VAs from the show, and the new ones just sound kind of amateurish.\n\nAlso, I wasn't a big fan of the powerups. They're kind of situational and inorganic, and Pac's normal chomping ability is already really fast and satisfying to use. They feel less like enhancing my ability to play the game and more like deliberately sawing off a leg to use the handicapped parking. Some (like the Chameleon and Balloon powerups) seriously hamper the flow of combat but are required to traverse the stage. Others (Fire and Ice) are kind of fun to use, but largely unnecessary for the most part, except against a few BS enemies they make you use the power on before you can eat them (IE, melting ice ghosts, or putting out fire ghosts, both of whom hurt you if you just chomp them). There's some that are pretty cool (Metal Pac, Boulder Pac, Rubber Pac), though, so powerups aren't totally useless.\n\nOverall it's solid. I'd say it isn't bad at 20 bucks, but you might want to wait for a sale.","September 5, 2014","true","5.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Like an unaltered version of a Grimm fairy tale, the Pac-Man games exist in a world in which he must constantly consume ghosts until he is eventually overwhelmed by the relentless determination of his poltergeist pursuers. But it was easy to ignore this endless endeavor when abstract visuals shielded you from the worst of Pac-Man's deeds. After all, how could a yellow circle eating colorful doodles possibly be ominous? And the eyeballs of your eaten foes--those shocked, disembodied eyeballs--drifted back to the ghost hideout like a silly gag. Prepare to have your happy memories turned on their heads. In Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures, the abstract barrier has been removed, and in the process, there's a surreal wrinkle to this entry-level platformer. Who knew that Pac-Man had a dark side?\n\nA benign introduction welcomes you to the city of Pacopolis. Characters loudly enunciate their lines as if they belong in a Saturday-morning cartoon, and the dialogue never ventures outside of the dry exposition that pushes the plot ever onward. For those who enjoy A Game of Thrones, it can be funny to imagine that Sir C is really Cersei Lannister, though the big-nosed professor isn't quite as ruthless as the queen regent, at least not as far as we're shown. A school serves as a hub world for Pac-Man, and though that's hardly strange given that he's just a boy in Ghostly Adventures, the company he keeps begins the surreality that flows throughout this game. Pinky, Blinky, Inky, and Clyde--the ghosts from the original Pac-Man--roam the halls as if they aren't spirits, and you talk to them instead of trying to eat them. It's nice to know that even the fiercest of enemies can make nice.\n\nAt this point, it seems as if Ghostly Adventures not only caters to a young audience incapable of discerning thought, but doesn't even respect them. Because the dialogue lacks any semblance of wit, there's nothing more to the plot than a remedial MacGuffin hunt, and the by-the-numbers platforming continues along that brain-dead path. Early levels set you loose in 3D worlds with nary a hint of interesting obstacles or clever level design. You simply walk along the constrained route, collecting pellets and hamburgers just to have something to do, and then mash a button to eat ghosts who stand before you. There's a certain appeal in chomping a group of ghoulies in a flashy display of your insatiable hunger, but everything is so by rote that it's pretty dull. It's as if the game expects the inherent fun of playing to drive you forward, even though there is nothing worthwhile going on.\n\nAnd then, things start to get more interesting.\n\nWho put a vending machine in a frozen tundra?\nPac-Man is a chameleon, and that's not just a figure of speech. Special pellets transform you from a double-jumping eating machine into a variety of creatures that give you different powers. As a chameleon, you can swing from poles using your sticky tongue and turn invisible to make it past searchlights. When Pac-Man becomes a giant boulder (complete with an indecent retractable nose), you can squash the baddies who are terrified of your girth and shoot off ramps like a pinball. Gobble a pink pellet to fill yourself with air and then coast along the currents. Ghostly Adventures injects variety into your escapades through these precious pellets, and thus raises the insulting early levels to a place of respectability. None of these specific elements are particularly well executed on their own, but simply rushing from one objective to another keeps you on your toes so you're always reacting to a new demand rather than being lulled to sleep by predictability.\n\nRushing from one objective to another keeps you on your toes so you're always reacting to a new demand rather than being lulled to sleep by predictability.\nThese powers have a positive impact on the combat. When you become imbued with fire or ice energy, the ghosts keep pace, and you need to use your elemental abilities to stop them. How else could you devour an ice ghost if you don't set it on fire first? Having to put thought into dueling ghosts keeps you engaged in ways that evaporate when you're just slamming on the chomp button. Still, the raw mechanics aren't so hot. Targeting specific ghosts with ice and fire projectiles is tricky, especially when there are teleporting and vomiting ghosts floating across the environments. This imprecision removes much of the skill that could have made conquests satisfying, so instead, you partake in fights of attrition where you hope you nibble every baddie before they chip away all of your health. Because it's so kinetic, combat doesn't become boring, but it merely serves as another dose of variety rather than an enjoyable activity in its own right.\n\nPac-Man seems ambivalent even surrounded by searing-hot lava.\nIt's in the platforming that Pac-Man reaches its potential. There are so many ways to navigate these colorful worlds that you're always doing something different, and that alone keeps you invested. Zipping across vanishing platforms is very different from walking vertically along magnetic columns, and that not only nicely mixes up your actions, but also pushes the levels to new places. The tired designs of the early levels fade away when you have to figure out how to cross a lava lake (freeze the geysers!) or reach that floating island (find an air draft!). All of these elements have been found in previous platformers, but that doesn't diminish their appeal here. Zooming through a tunnel on a crumbling piece of rock is still fun because you have to think fast as obstacles rush toward you. And the repulsive way that Pac-Man just shoves any old thing into his mouth is good for some gross-out chuckles.\n\nAnd the repulsive way that Pac-Man just shoves any old thing into his mouth is good for some gross-out chuckles.\nThrough all of this ridiculousness is the surreal undercurrent that flows through the game. Pac-Man eats ghosts, it's what he does, but there's a joy to his consumption that's unsettling. He eats the entire spook (those eyeballs no longer escape), and then keeps track of how many eyes he's digested. It's a little unnerving. After playing through every level, I have eaten exactly 2,426 ghost eyes. How could Pac-Man pal around with Pinky, eat her kin, and keep a morbid running tally of his conquests? And your victory animation when you nab the fruit at the end of each level cements just how twisted this game can be. When Pac-Man burps as any foodie would, you can actually see the eyeballs in his mouth fumes. It's as if the game repeatedly wants to remind you exactly what Pac-Man (and, by extension, you) are doing, so your actions swirl in your head even when you go to sleep for the night.\n\nThe creepiness continues in the four-player mode. Here, you and up to three friends embody ghosts in 3D representations of the classic Pac-Man mazes. Explore the labyrinthine passageways as you nab fruit and collect power-ups, all while a computer-controlled Pac-Man roams, hungry for ghosts. You may find the pellet ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ near the north corridor, and you rush toward him with unwavering focus. Now is your chance to put that Pac-Monster in his place. And then he nabs a power pellet, turning you and all of your friends blue, and devours you whole. Except your eyes, of course. You're sent back to your hideout as just a pair of eyes, and you realize how scary it is to hunt Pac-Man. Sadly, this mode is much better in concept than in practice. It's a slow-paced affair that lacks the unpredictability that could have made it engaging. Still, it's enlightening to see the world through the eyes of your long-standing enemies.\n\nPac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures travels down the same road as so many. 5/10","May 24, 2015","false","1.1"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","13","24","0","0"

As with many PC ports the game is limited to 30FPS, which was found to be acceptable and cooperative during my gameplay at all times. But is this new Pac-Man who enjoys burping in your face, talks in an annoying voice, and being a meme worth your time?\n\nThe game features 4 different worlds (2 are reused for a total of 6) with around 5 levels per world. Pac-Man has 7 different upgrades that provide new abilities used in both exploring the environment and dealing with enemies. Aside from the main game, the game also features 4 minigames which resemble classic games of the past such as Atari Tanks, Silver Surfer, Defender and the emerald minigame from Sonic 2. The game is short, with my first playthrough done in 4 hours, and replaying the game to get all of the achievements took a total of 9 hours. Although you might consider this to be too short for the average platformer, the levels provide a good balance of length and difficulty to remain enjoyable throughout the entirety of the game. The story, on the other hand, is directed towards fans of the show and will not spark interest amongst the majority gamers. The story involves saving Pac-Mans friends and tracking down the final boss Betrayus, which serves its purpose by being as simple as possible. The graphics in the game are passable as the character models look almost identical to the source material, although within each world there is a distinct lack of variety. Many of the assets are repeated over and over, which is complemented by the short level length to keep the game fresh. The game features professional voice acting from the show, which can be considered good or bad depending on how annoying you find the new Pac-Man.\n\nPAC-MAN™ and the Ghostly Adventures provides a mediocore platforming game that shows a commendable amount of care and polish, which is rare considering that the game is based on a TV show. While I would jump to reccomend higher quality platformers such as 'Tembo the Badass Elephant' or 'Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams', those games provide longer levels with increased difficulty that may not be suitable for everyone. For those who want an enjoyable, short, and forgiving platformer, then I can definitely reccomend this game.\n\nUnless you find Pac-Man terribly annoying, and for that I apologize.\n\nRating:\n7.5/10\n\nPros:\nGood length with approximately 30 levels.\nGame has good graphics although they get boring with repeated exposure.\nMinigames included are a great addition to the game.\nPlayable Pac-Man meme included.\nCons:Pac-Man can be annoying.\nStory is bland and only used to guide the gameplay.\nMay not be challanging enough for some gamers.\n30 FPS Lock ( As many people are against this, I find it worth including here)\nHardware Information\nHardwareTypeMonitorPhilipsTrueColor3000TVHeadphonesGradoSi80KeyboardMicrosoftBasicKeyboard10AControllerSteamControllerMouseRazerNaga2014MicrophonecheapbrandNAMotherboardMotherboardCPUAMDFX4170Quad-CoreProcessor420GHzGPUGeForceGTX560SERAM4GBx2CorsairVengenceOSWindows7SP1Ubuntu14HDDSeagateBarracudaST1000DM0031TB7200RPM","April 29","true","10.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The much-beloved Pac-Man DX was an absurdly fun retro experience - this game, on the other hand, shows the struggles this franchise has endured trying to evolve to more modern tastes.  The Ghostly Adventures is an uninspired, paint-by-numbers 3D platformer devoid of any inspiration or personality.\n\nThe story is the usual fare: some bad guy has an evil device and wants to do something-or-other; I couldn't have possibly cared less.  The plot is presented via scattershot cinematics, featuring afternoon cartoon-level voice-acting and writing.  Pac-Man sounds like a plucky teenager here, which is a bit odd for a guy who, last I checked, had a wife and kid.  Maybe this is a different Pac-canon.  Who the hell knows?  You can skip the cinematics, which I highly recommend.\n\nGameplay is pretty standard 3D platformer fare.  Pac-Man jumps all over the place, collecting shiny objects and battling bad guys.  Pac, of course, attacks his ghostly foes by eating them, which provides a bit of grisly fun for a while.  (At the end of each stage, Pac-Man belches up the eyeballs of his devoured enemies - that's pretty hardcore, man!)  Chaining together chomp attacks in an area filled with ghosts is one of the game's few pleasures.  Power-ups are sprinkled throughout to spice things up, but they're all pretty generic: an ice power-up, a fire one, one that lets you wall jump, and so on.  Nothing you haven't seen 100 times before.  The one exception is the snappy Spin power, which allows you to plot a path for Pac-Man and then have him run it at high speed - it's quite fun and I wish it appeared sooner in the game.\n\nThings are pretty solid, production-wise.  The game looks decent enough and the sounds are fun and appropriately Pac-esque.  The music is fine, if entirely forgettable.  The game let me use my 360 controller without any tinkering, and the controls did the job.  My only real beef here is the in-game arcade.  Namco has one of the most enviable arcade libraries in the world, yet the only four "cabinets" you can play here are new mini-games, each more tedious than the last.  They feel like half-baked smartphone apps.  Why not throw in classic Pac-Man, or his Missus?  Or Dig-Dug?  Galaga?  Anything?  I guess the game's intended audience was deemed to be too young for the classics.\n\nAll in all, a pretty big misfire, from the tepid opening stages to an absurdly anticlimactic final boss battle.  And I know that this is the part where most people would say "it would be okay for the kids," but I don't agree.  I think kids deserve games made with care and inspiration, instead of just plopping them in front of any old safe, colorful crap.  I'd rather see a little one cobbling together a farm in Minecraft, as opposed to enduring the avalanche of lazy, moronic puns that make up this game's script.  And if kids deserve better, adults surely do as well.  Pac-Man is a bona fide legend, but he needs a better agent.","May 25, 2015","false","0.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheStickKid/recommended/239720/","TheStickKid","Xindictive","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheStickKid/","815 products in account","This game is sadly rather boring and very easy. While it is a kids game and i can see why it's easy, this is too easy even for children and it's really not as entertaining. It took me days to complete this game because i kept quitting the game to play something else due to how low my interest with it was as i went through it.\n\nThe first few worlds and the arcade machines offer some challenge, in which children can enjoy. However... the last two worlds are jokes and the bosses offer no challenge. I would really be concerned for my own children if they ever had issues fighting any of the bosses in this game, as they are easier than some of the levels in this game. They all have at least 3-4 health points and they all get defeated by a certain, very obvious way. It's obvious how many hit points they have just by noticing these things. And it mainly consists of them getting hit with their own attacks.\n\nThe final 2 worlds and the bosses in those worlds are jokes though. They are all very short. They are all very easy. The first of the two is basically a waste of time (even the cutscene after the last one calls it pointless) and the final and second of the two worlds is the biggest disappointment, as it is the easiest part of the entire game. The player should be given a challenging final few levels so that when they complete the game, they feel like they succeeded in something. However, because everything in the final world is so easy, it offers no challenge and doesn't give you any rewarding feeling. Just huge disappointment.\n\nIt's also very bad when you have to redo an entire level again just to get a token that is required to 100% the game, because it just adds to the boredom of the game. And once you get all the fruit to play the arcade machines, not only are you disappointed by now because of the fact that the optional, bonus arcade mini games are HARDER than the final world of the actual game, but they are all so short that they don't really last long and still don't feel very rewarding.\n\nIf you are an achievement hunter, buy it because this will be a breeze for you to get every achievement in the game. Outside of getting achievements, this game should be avoided because it will bore you and your children, it's not a fun game and there are far better games to get on Steam for your child that are cheaper than this one.","January 24, 2015","false","19.0"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","0"

If you like platforming games and games with bright, colorful visuals, you will most likely enjoy this one. Plus, it's Pac-Man.\n\nWould I pay $20 for it? Doubtful, but only because I rarely pay more than 10 or 12 dollars a game here on Steam. I got it for $5 and it was well worth it, max price for me would probably be around 10 dollars.\n\nHowever, if platformers are your thing and you want one with a definite Pac-Man twist to it, this game is fun and $20 isn't all that steep. Otherwise, I'm sure you'll find a sale at some point.\n\nPros\n-Pac-man flavor, think Mario 3D style, but as Pac-man VS. Ghosts, collecting his signature power pellets\n-Looks nice and colorful\n-Varied Levels across 6 worlds\n-The levels are fun and all worlds feel fairly unique from one another\n-Really FUN and COOL power-ups, for the most part\n-Pretty fair difficulty, not too hard, not too easy, and very rarely does it feel cheap\n-The arcade games are fun and work as nice bonus games - each one earns an achievement\n-Full controller support, feels very natural on a 360 controller.\n\nCons\n-One power-up, the wooden ball became boring quickly\n-Another power-up, the balloon is frustrating to control, but luckily doesn't appear very long\n-However, this balloon does make one level EXTREMELY frustrating, your mileage may vary.\n\nSCORE: 7/10 Good fun, but not perfect.","May 22, 2015","true","13.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game can be tricky to navigate and figure out what to do at times i am taking about a certain metal maze level .... that level in particular had my head scratching for over 50 tried before i finally got it.  Its not that it was hard for say It was just difficult to navigate. You had no idea wether you where progressing or taking the wrong path ect.\n\nThe finally level of the game was honestly way to easy ... i get this was geared towards kids but you could have made it a little harder ....\n\nAnother level i found hard was the lava surfing one The controlls on the seemed to be un responsive at times There for it made it challanging\n\nlets talk about story now.\nIf you have seen the cartoon then you will notice that the game actualy follows the story very well which is hard to do for some movie/cartoon based games  You are basically protecting pac world from the ghost invasion  while at the same time protecting the three of life from lord betrayes That pretty much sums it up.\n\n\nThe powers you get in the game are ones that you seen in the show. Such as ice pack,fire pac,chamelion pac,tornado pac,rock pac and i think that is it what i like is they make each power usefull depending on the enviroment of the stage or the element of the ghost you are trying to beat ahem eat.\n\nThere are a ton of collectables in the game so if you are going for 100% be prepaired to do some stages at least twice. also you will need at least 4500 energey pelets by the end of the game which should not be an issue if you collect them in every level.\n\n7/10","September 8, 2014","true","7.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The voice acting is cheesy & meant for kids so if you're an adult like me you'll probably cringe & laugh at most of the stuff that's said.  You go around eating ghosts, food & collecting pellets while jumping through areas & you complete levels by collecting fruit or certain coins.  It's a pretty standard set up for the Genre.\n\nThe Main villains name is "Betrayus".  Yes, that's his name.  I'm not sure exactly what the story is since it just kind of throws you into it without much to go on.\n\nThe fruits you collect can be used to unlock several mini-games.  I'm not sure why you need fruit to play an arcade machine in the Pac-Land.  Maybe it has something to do with the guy who fixes the machines having scurvy?  I haven't unlocked any mini-games yet so I can't comment on them.\n\nThere's also several upgrades you can use throughout each level that serve as a power up & an extra hit point.  So far I've run into Fire, Ice & Chameleon.  I'm sure you can guess what they do but I'll explain anyways.  Fire throws Fireballs & melts ice, Ice freezes enemies, water & some objects.  Chameleon gives you a long tongue like Yoshi, let's you turn invisible & use that tongue on poles (get your head out of the gutter) like a lasso.\n\nOverall it's a good 3D platform game where you collect fruit, coins or whatever you can find.  It kind of reminds me of classic collectathon platformers of old so if you like those types of games it'll be worth playing.  I recommend it for those who are starved for platforming games & need something to tie them over until Yooka-Laylee comes out.  It's also great for the kids.","May 22, 2015","true","1.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There’s a distinct lack of challenge here for anyone over the age of 10 but given the target audience, sits about right without being too frustrating. In a nutshell, Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures is a competent game that does what it sets out to do without deviating too much from the source material. It’s inoffensive and perfectly suited for the younger gamer, although compared to some other games aimed at this age group perhaps lacking in overall content. If you’ve got youngsters then this is worth checking out, although be warned, the lack of local co-op for the story means it’s a one player at a time deal which might not sit so well with multiple kids wanting to play at once.\n\nScore – 7.5/10","April 2, 2014","true","14.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

In the same vein as Pac in Time for the SNES and the Pac-Man World series, Pac-Man is back jumping and double jumping through various environments and battling literal ghosts of the past.\n\nThis game came as something of a surprise. On the surface, it's very simplistic and quite derivative of older platforming titles. It even manages to scale back from past Pac-Man adventures, whilst adding something new in the form of various powerups that act as a one hit shield and a way to traverse the environments.\n\nNot an overly difficult game, as lives are plentiful and the tactic of using powerup spawn points to essentially make you invulnerable, though a pleasantly surprising game with a multitude of fun abilities at every turn some very solid platforming goodness.","September 19, 2015","true","8.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Which is why I also picked it up for a friend. This is the Heartland of 3D platformers. It feels shorter than your usual platformer, but that's because it doesn't do the cheap, nasty, artificial elongation that older platformers did.\n\nThis is much more of the Spyro/Ratchet & Clank school of platforming. And honestly, that's a pretty great school of design for anyone making a platformer. It's fun and clever, and it's incredibly varied. It opts for throwing lots of interesting gameplay mechanics at you and polishing those to a tee. It uses some deliciously clever level design to back them up.\n\nDon't read me wrong, I'm not saying that this is the greatest platformer ever. That does go to Insomniac. I am, however, saying that this feels a lot like an Insomniac wannabe (and actual Insomniac, not the increasingly awful Insomniac North). It hits all the right buttons and it feels oh so good. The writing is much like a Saturday morning cartoon of the '80s, and not even a good one, but I don't really care! And the puns... oh gods, the puns are terrible and it's why Pac-Man is so unpopular with his peers. Not to mention that there's some slightly lewd and questionable humour in there...\n\nBut I don't care.\n\nIt's fun to play. I play this thing, and I have fun. The aesthetic is genuinely pleasing to me, it's made by people who wanted to make a nice thing. It doesn't have that soulless, corporate, designed by committee thing that's become increasingly common in, say, Mario games. It's not that slimy, grotesque, GO FOR THE DOPAMINE, BOO approach that anyone who possesses a mind with which to think hates.\n\nIt's fun. It's just fun.\n\nIt may not be worth the full price, but it's worth more than sales ask for it. If this were priced at about eighteen pounds, I'd say that's a sweet spot for it. I'm judging by a metric of quality, here, as it's the only real metric of worth. I'm not a dopamine drone, I won't go with quantity because of addictions.\n\nI don't care how long something is if it doesn't feel fun to play. But something can be amazingly fun and I'll sing its praises even if it only lasts three hours. See: Portal. This is really fun.\n\nIt has power-ups, fun enemies, inventive mechanics, clever level deigns, adorable and appreciable aesthetics, and if you're anything like me it'll make you happier. And the more you go on, the happier it'll make you feel. Because it really is that clever.\n\nBit of a gameplay spoiler, skip past the next paragraph if you're not so inclined.\n\nSo, there are these stages where you become a giant boulder and it reminds me of the better bits of Super Monkey Ball, but somehow integrated perfectly into a platformer. It's lovely. You're rolling around and trying to hit switches and get through obstacle courses and it's great. That's just another thing this game does well that reminds me of the very best of platformers: Obstacle courses. All the best 3D platformers I loved had them. I can't (and won't) speak for you, but... it really does push the right buttons.\n\nThis is just my opinion, but this is some of the most (if not the most) 3D platforming fun you can have on a PC without the use of an emulator.\n\nI picked this up in a sale... I wasn't expecting it.\n\nI just wasn't.\n\nIf this were just a little bit more clever (mostly in that it lacks the excess of secrets it should have), I'd say that it could've been the PC's answer to Ratchet & Clank. Which is what I hoped that Pirates of New Horizons was going to be (still sad that was cancelled).\n\nIt's great. It's fun. You may love it. Your kids may too. I don't know. I had fun. It's fun.\n\nI recommend it.","October 19, 2015","true","6.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MizuGeorge/recommended/239720/","MizuGeorge","George-kohai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MizuGeorge/","482 products in account","Disclaimer: This is my opinion on the game, given what I have played. If you disagree, that's fine, not everyone shares the same thoughts.\n\nOk, this is going to be more of a rant than a review, but oh well. I might as well get the bad out of the way first before I talk about the good.\n\nCalling this game a Pac-Man game is a travesty. Pac-Man goes around a maze, eating pills, fruit and ghosts. In this game, Pac-Man goes around the world in a non-maze like fashion. I can understand that, many games transition between genres and dimensions. However, this is where the game stops being Pac-Man entirely. Pac-Man goes around, collecting spheres, not eating, and defeating ghosts by scaring them, and chomping them, collecting their eyes in the process. Pac-Man also goes around collecting fruit for arcade machines in his high school. Sorry, high school? I thought Pac-Man was married? In fact, more to the point, I thought Pac-Man was a man? Yep, in this game, Pac-Man is in high school, his voice unbroken for some reason and no wife anymore. Mrs. Pac-Man does not exist. The best part about the high school? 1 classroom. Ok, I'm digressing. Pac-Man, with the help of his 2 friends and his professor, Sir C, and Inky, Pinky, Blinky and Clyde (yep, the 4 ghosts who constantly chase Pac-Man in previous games to kill him) go around the world to stop Betrayus and the ghosts. This is explained in the first cutscreen, along with terrible voice acting. Surely it wasn't too difficult to make 3 people act surprised at the same time? Then the game starts. The mouse is over sensitive, so the camera shakes around too much, and since you rely on the camera position to go forwards, Pac-Man stumbles around like he's had 10 too many drinks. The scare mechanic is worthless as every ghost can get chomped with or without it, and for some reason, Pac-Man has to grab handles with his mouth and pull them down using gravity. Oh, are hands too difficult to program? Also, for health regen and to unlock god knows what else, you eat cheese and pies. Way to stick to the canon.\n\nOk, so after looking at this, I need to include a section on the game itself, no comparison to the older Pac-Man titles. Here goes: Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures controls like Banjo-Kazooie or A Hat in Time, but I find the turning with the mouse to be too sensitive, and Pac turns too much, meaning I never move in the direction I want to, but that could be a problem with my laptop not having the RAM needed for this game, or whatever is needed, I'm not good at computer technical things. As for Pac-Man's abilities, he can scare enemies, and chomp them. The scare mechanic seems useless, as the ghosts get chomped in one go anyway, scared or not. As for the chomp mechanic, you'd better be pointing the right direction, otherwise Pac will just chomp in the direction you've pointed, even sometimes chomping right next to the ghost. As a platformer, Pac-Man jumps a little too low, meaning obstacles you'd be able to clear in other games, such as the previously mentioned A Hat In Time, you can't clear. Pac also has access to teleporters, which he uses and poses after coming out of them, stopping the flow of the game, and making me regret buying this even more...\n\nIf this game was a different IP, perhaps Banjo & Kazooie or Crash Bandicoot, I could have accepted this game better, as the gameplay suits the character, and they already have distinct characters in the universe without having to name different coloured Pacs and give them all different hair. And perhaps the controls are good when using the 360 controller, but I don't know about that unfortunately.\n\nAlthough the game is a good concept, it falls flat on every single level except enemy ghost AI. I suggest getting Pac-Man Museum (see edit below) to play an actual Pac-Man game, and I suggest playing Banjo-Kazooie or Donkey Kong 64 for a good 3d collectathon platformer. I hate to say this, but I hope this series of games dies before Pac-Man gets the same tragic fate at Banjo & Kazooie did under Microsoft.\n\n[Edit] I no longer suggest getting Pac-Man Museum, just get Pac-Man Championship Edition, it's one of the two games from the museum I really recommend, the second being Pac-Man itself.","June 29, 2014","false","0.8"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","29","4","14","4","6"
