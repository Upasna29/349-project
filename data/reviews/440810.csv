Shoulda been F2P, but even then there are no resolution options no control options, no options period.\nA shame, I liked the concept but stay away from this.","February 24","false","0.4"," 191 of 215 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","191","215","4","7"

The gameplay actually isn't that bad, but the game has no settings (besides volume controls), and is littered with microtransactions.\n\nThis is clearly a phone game with minimal effort put forth to port this to PC. If it didn't have the microtransactions and was balanced around just playing the game, maybe it would be a better buy at around $5.\n\nDo yourself a favor and skip this.","February 24","false","1.1"," 105 of 123 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","105","123","0","1"

Worst Shoot em Up game I have ever played(PC\ Mobile\ 90's Arcade).\n\nLong version:\nI like some basic Shoot em ups but THIS takes the cake for the worst one. I could not even enjoy the game. Also the actual refund period is less than 2 hours becuase of the game's idea to download updates WHILE the game is already playing(on a 3Mbps connection i DLed the additional files in 20 minutes) Then it needs to connect to the server which hanged and would not connect making me use already 1/4th of the time NOT playing the game .  I would recommened even the cheapest Shoot em up on Steam (Revolution Ace)  worth a few cents at sales than this. That game will actually make you WANT to pay more for the Dev. THATS IT - I have a SEA restricted copy of Revolution Ace. If you bought this (MEGAMI STRIKE) game and are from SEA and do not own Revolution Ace. I will gift you a copy and hope you create a review of this game compared to that.(Create a Steam discussion or comment so I can see you own this game)\n\nThe Graphics is basically the mobile version. It's artsyle of the actual game(not the Cute Girls) is worse than the arcade machines I played as a kid(Strikers 1945) On the game itself it like an arcade game. You have to insert or use "Tickets" to continue. on a game you ALREADY paid for.","February 24","false","0.5"," 82 of 99 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","82","99","7","4"

No features for control customization or any kind of graphics settings.\nSecond, the gameplay was bland for a shoot'em up. Auto-fire with mouse controlled movement is not very exciting.\nBut the biggest problem I have with this title is pricing. Originally a Free 2 Play mobile title, the Steam version keeps the freeium cash store, but dares to ask 20 dollars for the game in additional to that. 1943 Megami Strike's Steam version should have been F2P or they should have reworked the system to remove the cash store or at the very least rebalance it to something less insulting.\nSimply put, disappointing.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/St1VGoSFecs","February 26","false","1.4"," 33 of 49 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","33","49","0","0"

Characters are nicely drawn, with their appearance ranging from cute to sexy to both. As for dating sim elements, however, sadly only a few of the gameâ€™s large cast are date-able, though those that are have over a dozen scenes for each of them, with a large number of scenes offering you dialogue choices.\n\nBullet Hell aspect is top-notch: while early levels are easy enough, the later levels and bosses are quite challenging even with top-tier cards, especially since characterâ€™s level doesnâ€™t prevent her from dying in one hit. But levels are quite short, and you can restart from the level you failed at, which makes Megami Strike overall less challenging than harder Bullet Hell games, that usually force you to complete half-dozen levels in succession.\n\nMegami Strike has microtransactions, which are apparently the reason behind all negative reviews. However, these microtransactions carry far less impact than in most other Online CCG: all characters can be obtained over by completing missions or training, and the game is also quite generous with bonus items like upgrade cards. So it is quite easy to play without needing microtransactions at all, especially since buying Megami Strike on Steam already awards you with a number of cards and items.\n\nThe gameâ€™s weakest point is very brief tutorial, which barely explains the most basic aspects of the game. Fortunately, I tried to solve this problem with a guide I posted, which explains the gameâ€™s basics (and I will be happy to answer further questions people might have to best of my ability, though my own knowledge of the game is far from perfect).\n\nIn conclusion, I fully recommend Megami Strike to all fans of Bullet Hells games, who either like CCGs as well, or are willing to give that genre a try.","May 9","true","205.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/440810/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","1943 Megami Strike is a Korean bullet hell SHMUP that is also available on Google Play as a free to play game with a cash shop. The cash shop remains in the Steam version. The port is decidedly average or even sub par. The game incorporates a card game type system which is where the shop comes into play. Unfortunately, given the quality of the port and the way in which the game almost demands that you use the cash shop itâ€™s not a game that I would recommend on Steam.\n\nIf I were to fix the game on Steam I would begin by making it a free to play game if the decision to keep the microtransactions in the game was made. Itâ€™s a case of either/or as far as Iâ€™m concerned. At the moment the cost of the game combined with the microtransaction system is killing the incentive for anybody to play. There are simply better bullet hell games on the market that donâ€™t have such an outrageous entry barrier. Itâ€™s definitely one of the worst game design choices that I have seen on Steam.\n\nOn the bright side the game comes with one achievement and it unlocks the second you actually start the game so for those seeking to add an easy perfect game to your collection youâ€™ll strike gold here.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways visit http://www.steamified.com/\nPlease feel free to join our wonderful community on Steam","March 9","false","14.5"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","19","31","0","0"

Both were released at a time when the Cold War climate was in full swing and the risk of a new global conflict was not a science fiction. The fertile imagination of Japanese developer Capcom made sure to remind us of it in the best possible way that not much time has passed since the last time a war has led to countless crimes and suffering to the world. Giving us the handling of a powerful fighter of the US Air Force, the two legendary shoot 'em ups finally joined our best teenage memories transforming the horrors of war in exciting pastime full of action.\n\nThis year, Korean developer GameUS Inc restores us to the skies in 1943 Megami Strike, a shoot 'em up that will introduce you to the hell of the aerial dogfights from the very first minute. The similarities with the "spiritual ancestors" of the Megami Strike are obvious from the beginning in the style of vertical scrolling shoot 'em up and the existence of one or two fighter planes (if you play with a friend) moving perpetually toward the top of the screen, transforming numerous enemy planes in debris . Script is nonexistent and there is only a sacred objective, the annihilation of all opponents and of the boss, a huge plane with lots of hit points, sleepless standing guard at the edge of each track. The pace of the game is quick and dogfights last less than a minute so you do not get bored and you can play another battle &and another, and another...) before returning in your daily schedule.\n\nThe MMO aspect is very pleasant and innovative for a classic shoot 'em up and makes the game virtually endless. Each player has an airplane hangar that can be filled with squadrons of five airplanes piloted by beautiful young women in manga aesthetic. The planes differ in type of ammunition and auxiliary skills. Other firing rockets crashing airplanes like aerial torpedo, another fills the screen with shots, a third one manifests a backup plane to assist in the battle. Dozens of varied military planes waiting for you to get them after completing your amazing aerial missions qhice are divided into raids, quests and challenges. The quests are a long series of short missions like all other challenges so the player never gets tired. The raids are a collaborative effort from experienced pilots to crush a boss with huge resistance. The challenges are similar to quests and put you face to face again with your endless enemies and bosses.\n\nAll missions offering new airplanes in card form as bonus after their completion. The development system of your squadrons are innovative. The airplanes cards you can add to your fleet or you can "liquidate" them to upgrade dramatically the level of your star pilots. From level to level pilots tremendously increase their damage and thus the destruction of all the enemies in a track becomes increasingly easier. Apart from cards, ehen you win battles you get white stars that you can spend on upgrading your weapons systems of vessels. Your pilots are graded on the cards with a star system so you can choose for your fleet the planes that can climb to the maximum levels.\n\nWhile free to play the Megami Strike features a cash shop for those who can afford and want to quickly create a perfect air fleet but everyone else can enjoy it without having to pay extra. The highlight of the experience in the game is the game mechanics. Your aircraft maneuvers like an eagle in the skies thanks to handling precision offered by the mouse and the permanent auto fire allows you to focus your attention to avoid enemy shots and use your auxiliary weapons. The last can be activated and spit death by pressing three keys of the keyboard located next to each other so you never gonna be angry because you didn't pressed this or that button at the right time. The Megami Strike costs little for the quality and the duration that offers  so if you are fans of shoot 'em up i recommend it for your collection.\n\nGiannis Moschonas\n\nEditor in www.gameworld.gr","February 29","true","4.8"," 13 of 33 people (39%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","39","13","33","2","0"

Offering detailed simulation of every one of these aircrafts, from the nose mounted repeating turbo lasers of the A7M to the swarm of plasma-gun armed Drones used by the soviet Yak-3. This is the ultimative game for WW2 flight fans.\n\nIf you're unsure, you can try the game for free on pretty much any mobile platform.\n\n\nI revised my review based on the constructive feedback from Circles.
