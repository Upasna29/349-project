"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MasterOfLazyness/recommended/294120/","MasterOfLazyness","MasterOfLazyness","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MasterOfLazyness/","270 products in account","Basically it's a $15 Facebook mobile runner game with a Warhammer Skin.\nJust wait for Warhammer 40,000: Inquisitor – Martyr instead. Or play Kill Team.\n\nI saw there was no gameplay trailer and started having misgivings.\nI saw the steam reviews and thought, Bah, who listens to these anyway. It can't be THAT bad.\nThen I saw that the download was 270MB. And looked like Warcraft 3 if it took all the drugs.\n\nAnnnnd, I was wrong. This "game" costing anything on steam is HERESY. It's basically a runner game where you get to Shoot, Slash or Stand still. Bra-freakin'-Oh.\n\nCarnage Champions is a MOBILE PORT of an iOS & Andriod game.\nIt costs $15 bucks on Steam right now at the time of writing. Meanwhile, on iOS it's $2.99 and $3.99 on Android.\n\nFunnily enough, the Android version has a good trailer WITH actual gameplay and a UI that doesn't look as bad as the PC version. I suspect that they were trying to hide gameplay so more people would simply purchase it. Forgetting all about refunds on steam too, I'm sure.\n\nLet's go down it's picture bullet list.\nEpic Champions? Nah, you gotta unlock each one via STARS... which is your main focus. You know... like Candy Crush or Angry Birds. Collect your damned 3 stars on each level. Then, if you're bored or insane, do it again and again on different difficulties. Even if you unlock them, it's just a new look with maybe... 1 new button to push. Instead of a Block, you get X nonsense move.\n\nNever Ending Warfare? What does this even mean? That the game doesn't end? Oh ♥♥♥♥ off. It's just difficulty scaling for the exact same missions with the exact same crap tier enemies. You'll see the same breakable walls and junk over and over again. Thankfully, it'll end when you refund the game. As you should. (If you want the game despite my review, just wait for it to go on sale for $2.75 or something)\n\nCo-operative combat? Who? What? When? I see no one playing this damned thing. The closest thing to a co-op partner right now is my AI companion who just pew pews every once in a while or dies for 10s.\n\nPowerful Wargear? Yeah, because RPG elements, duh. Of course it will have scaling gear. It means if you don't get what you want... YOU'LL BUY CHESTS UNTIL YOU DO! Oh, did we forget to mention micro transactions? Yeah, there is Micro transactions all over the place.\n\nHack And Slash? Okay, I hate you. This is NOT a god damn Hack and Slash game. Screw that noise. It's Hack and Slash like Pac-man is a VR Action Adventure game.\n\nIf you're even still reading this crap... here are MOAR issues with the game.\nCons:\n-Options menu has 2 options. You can lower or increase Music and Sound FX, that's it.\n-Game Resolution is utterly terrible. I played it on 1920x1080 and the game looks like a tablet port.\n-Game has no starting tutorial and would rather interrupt your gameplay repeatedly later to inform you of things randomly.\n-Game tries it's damnedest to have you waste your Silver early on so you have to farm hard or pay with Gold/Micro transactions.\n-AI is pretty weak sauce. They either come from in front of you (right side of the screen) or they try to attack you from behind (Left side of the screen). That's really it.\n-Platforming is terrible because you can't backtrack... ever.\n-You can PAY to reroll your daily rewards. Because they prefer to give you mostly crap. By the time you get to the better rolled items, you'd already be long bored of the game.\n-Game loves to switch from not needing the mouse, to needing the mouse, repeatedly.\n\nPro:\nIt's more Warhammer... sort of.\nWould be better to play on a tablet.","May 12","false","1.3"," 202 of 205 people (99%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","99","202","205","24","6"

Now as i write this I do not have many hours, but the combat seems to be the same. Most of the time you run right and shoot some bad guys. Sometimes you fight a boss, which is not hard at all.\n\nYou move with a and d, fight with < and > and block with shift and jump with space. The game is built around a run and gun style, so the enemies will come from left of right side.\n\nThe game has a micro tran of gold. Which is used to upgrade gear, buy gear and respawns when you die more then twice. You can also buy supple creates, which drops rare gear, but you have to buy the gear with silver.... which is very dumb since it double charges you. The game works fine, at least on my computer however it gets very stale.\n\nThe in-game currency is silver, and you really don't get too much unless you fight at the hard setting...if you could even call it hard.\n\nIf I had to recommend a price...I would have to say $5 or less.\n\nsmall update, it seems you get 2 deaths, and then have to pay to respawn or start the level over. The other charactors add some new abilitys, but not enough to make the price worth of $15.","May 11","false","2.0"," 98 of 103 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","98","103","3","3"

It's built around exactly the kind of greedy model you'd expect; a mind-numbing core game with the temptation to lessen the monotony always but a few credit card numbers away.\n\nHowever, this latest shameful addition to the Warhammer 40,000 universe is uniquely terrible in that there is absolutely no point in using your own money or even the game's own to upgrade any of the touted "1000+ pieces of destructive wargear". The weapons and armour supposedly run on a ranking system from Common to Mastercraft with ludicrous prices to match. The Mastercraft items are usually unobtainable to a free-playing peasant such as you or I but the hilarious part is that it really doesn't matter.\n\nExample: I squirrel away all my pennies from the smattering of loose change that Carnage Champions sees fit to toss my way after each mission. I use it to buy a Mastercraft Plasma Cannon and upgrade it, thinking that I've made a sound investment. The very next time I visit the gear screen, there is a weapon SEVERAL RARITY RANKS BELOW IT that statistically outmatches my fully upgraded weapon... and it's going for a quarter of what I paid for my last one.\nThis happens after practically every mission. You get dropped a Common ranked item that makes a complete mockery of your SUPER RARE HEALING TROUSERS and it costs but a trickle of the amount you spent edging any sort of numbers advantage out of your existing gear. It is completely and utterly pointless.\n\nThe side-scrolling action itself is an obvious afterthought; lazy, impulse-deadening, sixty second stages in which you charge from left to right, wiping out enemies that couldn't hurt you enough to stop you if you even charitably gave them the chance. Carnage Champions is a cynical, gluttonous black hole of a game without a single remotely innovative or engaging tool in its wretched arsenal. Keep swiping.\n\nFull video review below:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2pSbC_nTj8","May 14","false","3.0"," 89 of 92 people (97%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","97","89","92","18","0"

This is just a quick and dirty mobile port of Warhammer 40,000 Carnage. The only difference seems to be the addition of the 'Champions' tag at the end. They even left in the pretty hefty cash-shop.\n\nSo they basically want you to pay 14,99€ for the right to play a mobile game on steam with no benefit at all. And to add insult to injury, the game refuses to run in english for me and always resets to german (the country i reside in), but the german translation is unfinished and buggy and will give you BAD_ID errors more often than any useful info. I only know what is what as I already have that title on my S4.\n\nFor free, its a fun little time waster on mobile platforms. For the price they ask on steam, while still having the very same, expensive ingame store in place it's basically robbery.","May 15","false","0.3"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","30","32","0","4"

Can't say otherwise.\nI have the game on my Tablet & CellPhone; I emailed GW to ask them if they ever thought of putting the game on STEAM.\nSo, I'm happy.\nBut, for everyone who doesn''t like the game, seeing the number of negative feedback; you can always blame me if it makes you ffeel better.\nAnyway, it's a cool game with a lot of gear to get, ♥♥♥♥ to unlock & loads of stages. It's kind of like a 2.5D side scrolling Diablo? IDK, whatever I will say will probably not be ok, so ...\nJust buy some bubble gum & watermelons,then party with your aunt orr grandma.\n\nCheers!?","May 15","true","1.1"," 10 of 78 people (13%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","13","10","78","12","0"
