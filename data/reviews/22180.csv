These games are surrounded in horror, puzzles and story telling.\n\nLength/Replay Value\nFirst thing that pops in to my mind when I'm purchasing a game is the actual length of the game and how much replay value it has. I purchased this game at the end of 2014 and didn't really touch it up until this day where I managed to finish it in pretty much one sitting. This game on average will take around 5-6 hours to complete... yes I said it... 5-6 HOURS! To me, I think that a horror game such as this deserves much more time to it. Is this game one I can go back and play? Not really. Maybe in a few years since I finished Penumbra : Black Plague a few years ago and now I've got the urge to play it again but other then that there isn't really anything to do in the game. No collectibles or anything like that. Just a game which requires you to avoid dogs, solve puzzles and be trapped in some creepy atmospheric mine. The replay value just isn't there.\n\nGraphical\nThe game was released in 2007 and still looks pretty damn good considering it was released almost TEN years ago! Of course, it won't be as good as modern day games but for it's time I would have said that this game was great and it still is!\n\nGameplay\nThe game itself is actually very immersive, the music is creepy which really adds to the scary atmosphere and you are stuck underground in mines/caves with flesh eating dogs after you, massive worms and caves full of spiders, solving puzzles and trying to survive. Sounds cool right? Weeelllll... the game does start off great, the first time you enter the mine and hear the sound of a dog really does shake you up! But as the game progresses you realise that there is a lot of repetition that is used. You see, throughout this game there are sections where the level layout is very identical... similar looking corridors and mines which branch off different ways to different rooms which require you to go to in order to get specific items to progress and  using them specific items to open a "locked door" in one of the corridors. It gets boring after a while and what makes it even more boring is that the monsters that roam the corridors/mines are just dogs. In the caves there are spiders and there is a part with a worm but we're talking corridor/mine sequences... pure dogs. Unlike Black Plague where that had the Tuurngait [http://penumbra.wikia.com/wiki/Tuurngait_Infected], this one had dogs that you had to constantly avoid and could easily be avoided by throwing beef jerky around and locking them in cages. The Tuurngait actually carried flashlights in some stages and could see you in the dark, the dogs couldn't do that. I went through the game without getting spotted by a dog once because all I did was wait corners and wait for them to pass. That's another thing that annoyed me, Dogs are supposed to have really good noses and be able to smell stuff better than a human can yet they couldn't smell a sweaty guy trapped in a mine who was sneaking behind them or right around a corner, staring them in the face?\n\nSCARE Factor\nNow this is a hard one, I don't know if it's because I'm getting older but games don't seem to scare me as much anymore unless it's a jumpscare but we all know they're no good in a horror game master-piece. Amnesia seemed to get it right. Back on point, this game had no jumpscares but was actually quite creepy when I played it briefly in 2014. If hiding from dogs, running from spiders and worms is your cup of tea then good! The atmosphere was kinda creepy? Personally though, this game didn't really have me scared or on the edge of my seat, If I was to rate it out of 10 on scare factor I would give it a 3.5/10\n\n\nOVERALL\nThe game itself is quite an  interesting game to sit down and play if you're in to puzzle solving and a slight bit of horror at the same time. It isn't that long and isn't on the edge of your seat scary so if you're someone with a weak heart and who hates scary games then this may be for you! Would I say it's worth it's price? Yeah. However, Black Plague was scarier in my opinion. :)","August 30, 2015","true","7.5"," 92 of 106 people (87%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","87","92","106","9","1"

It became the point of no return. This is indie low-budget game that influenced the industry up to AAA blockbusters. Outlast, Daylight, Alien Isolation, all these run-and-hide horror type games grew up from Penumbra and tried to evolve its mechanics in some way or another with no doubt. Nevertheless this game started it all, started so called new golden age of horror games.","May 7, 2015","true","0.5"," 49 of 51 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","49","51","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/22180/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Penumbra: Overture is the first in a series of horror games released in early 2007. While the developers like to class this as a first person adventure game, I would also say there is quite a lot of elements of survival horror and psychological horror.\n\nThe game uses a game engine called Newton Game Dynamics which is known for it's physical and realistic simulations. The adventure portion of the game focused a lot on physics based puzzles as well as a physics based combat system (i'll get more into that later). You can also play a lot of this game as stealthy as possible. The AI in Overture is well coded and respond realistically to noises and light.  There are also no guns or fire arms so your combat mechanics are based around manual weapons such as hammers and pick axes.\n\nThe combat system is the one aspect that I disliked to begin with; it is very hard to control as you actually have to swipe your mouse in the movement you would like to hit the enemy. It can sometimes get very confusing and you may end up turning your camera 180Â° without wanting to, then getting smacked in the back of the head, which at times can be the difference between life and death.  I found I was able to get to grips with the technique eventually, it just took a lot of actual conscious thinking when I needed to use it. It's certainly not a mechanic I would like to see implemented in other games, at least not in this form.\n\nYour main focus when playing is on exploration and classic  adventure game object and item interactions.  Most of the puzzles require searching for keys or other objects which can be placed in another object, such as batteries or motors. All of the puzzles resolution can all be found in the game; there are no wacky puzzles that are really impossible to work out. Clues can be found in books and letters, which again are found all over the game. The game is split into four chapters, each of these chapters has one "big" puzzle which may stump you for a while, they normally involve some sort of maneuvering of some kind, for instance my favorite is a steam pump floor and you have to memorize the pattern in which steam is pumped out of the floor, that puzzle alone takes a ton of thinking and memory skills to progress.\n\nGraphically, Overture looks like a 2007 game, this is not a bad thing - it's just very dated. At the time this would of been a very good looking game. There are however fan made texture mods which make the game look amazing, and if you are confident in installing these type of mods, I would highly recommend giving it a try.\n\nAs with most horror games, the music and audio plays a massive role in Penumbra. Like I said at the start, this game has a lot of physiological horror elements. At times there isn't actually anything physically to be scared of, however the music tempo changes and suddenly you start hearing thumping sounds, then all of a sudden you are on the edge of your seat wanting to throw your headset on the floor. Penumbra does the audio side of things brilliantly; in fact if you we to play the game without sound on at all, it wouldn't even be remotely scary.\n\nThe story mode of Penumbra took me about four hours to complete, which is a solid amount of time for a adventure game like this and I was ultimately happy with the conclusion. Luckily you don't have to pay for each of the games in the series individually, so the price for all three is very well compromised with the length of the game.\n\nI didn't have any technical issues with the game either, the game runs at a silky smooth 60 fps, and can be played at full higher resolutions which is always nice to see from older games.\n\nIf you are a fan of the horror and/or the adventure genre of games, you will certainly find alot of enjoyment in Penumbra. This is certainly a series that I am looking forward to playing the next installments of in the future.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

If yes, Penumbra is for you as you have a chance to see the first survival horror game of Frictional Games.\n\nAlthough not as terrifying, Penumbra Overture is still a relatively scary and interesting game where you pick up the story of Philip who has just arrived to Greenland to find his father based on the mysterious letter he'd received from him. To make it even more interesting: Philip had always thought his father had been dead.\n\nThe game puts emphasis on physics-based puzzle solving and physics based combat. Combat would be a bit harsh as usually the best thing to do is to run and other than a pickaxe or hammer we will not have any weapons at our disposal. Now, similarly to Amnesia, the protagonist has his own notepad where he writes his thoughts so this is how the story will gradually progress.\n\nWhile somewhat short, Penumbra showed something new in this genre and those who liked the Amnesia games should definitely give this one a try.","July 26, 2014","true","5.6"," 41 of 44 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","41","44","0","0"

Compared to Amnesia: The Dark Decent, this game brings more feelings of terror, two-fold the amount Amnesia had on me. In Penumbra, you cannot just run and hide from a situation to make everything okay, in most instances you are faced with a challenge to complete all while being stalked by a demon dog or infected crazies, which can be extrememly overwhelming. The storyline is intruiging, and the visuals are pretty good for a low-budget horror game. The monster AI can be a bit stupid at times, but it doesn't really take away from how terrifying they are. This is a game you will truly find yourself immersed in, and I would recommend it to any horror game fanatic (who doesn't already own it).\n\n9/10","November 7, 2013","true","4.2"," 37 of 40 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","37","40","0","6"

Most of them consist of finding a way into locked rooms  and discovering notes left by former occupants, and using clues left in the notes to make machines work or to put together various paraphernalia to aid in your escape. Remember... You must read the notes, because they are very important to understand the story!\n\nI think Overture it's the best of all three games in the Penumbra series, because are so nostalgic when i play it. If you played Amnesia, there is a chance you'll like this game, because Overture is ancestor of The Dark Descent.\n\nYou play the game from a first person perspective, utilizing the ''WASD'' buttons for movement, and various keyboard keys for additional actions. You can use the mouse for specialized and realistic interaction with objects in the game. Quoting from the manual, âAlmost all interaction in Penumbra behaves in a physically realistic mannerâ¦You grab an object by pressing and holding down (the left mouse button). To let the object go, just release the same button.â (just like Amnesia)\n\nNote: Be careful, your game is automatically saved when you reaches checkpoints, or when you click on artifacts (special items).\n\nTo finish, i really recomend this game if you appreciate a simple game who can give to you a special experience using puzzles and the Survival Horrors mechanisms.","November 14, 2015","true","8.7"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","93","26","28","6","3"

Its atmosphere is dark and menacing, and in general it functions well enough to be both a game and a trip through Hell. It's not too hard, and it's too traumatizing, either. It's a good medium for fun and scares alike.\nHowever, this is Frictional Games' weakest game, too. There is only one thing that truly spoils the horror and gameplay in this beauty, and if you don't know this, then it doesn't matter. Otherwise, if you want to enjoy the game without spoiling the feel, don't read the following. This is only a gameplay issue which makes the game trivial if you know it. Again, if you do not know this game and have the slightest idea of playing it, you should not read the following:\nThe main enemy of the game, the undead dogs, aren't truly a threat at all. In all other of Frictional Games' games, monsters cannot be hurt and you are forced to avoid them. However, in this game, the only two monsters -- dogs and spiders -- can be killed. The spiders you are meant to kill; however, you are obviously meant to be stealthy and undetected by the dogs, but the problem is that you can kill them far too easily by simply stun-locking them with melee strikes of a pickaxe or hammer (which, somehow, do the same damage). In addition, they have bad hit detection, and you can sometimes kill them while standing on something just barely above their reach -- even a wall railing you can jump on. When you know how weak the actual horrors are in this game -- even on hard mode -- then all the stealth and threatening atmosphere that was intended for these dogs just becomes a face-mashing party.\nIn my first run through this game, I didn't know the above and I enjoyed the game well. However, after playing it a second time with the above knowledge, I got bored before even getting a quarter into the game because it felt no longer like a horror game.\n\nIn short:\nIt's a great horror game for beginners if you don't advantage yourself with knowing a few of the game's functional faults. However, if you're already too familiar with such, then you should probably start with another of Frictional Games' better works.","January 7, 2014","true","8.2"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alleycat_the/recommended/22180/","alleycat_the","Alleycat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alleycat_the/","301 products in account","By removing the Shooter element from the FPS, 'Penumbra' created an eerie FIRST PERSON SURVIVAL PUZZLE genre that surprisingly features some unexpected, nicely paced, action sequences without any direct combat from time to time. You can actually melee some foes or trap them but you'll most likely just sneak past them in the dark (unless you're being swarmed by spiders). The interface is mostly a point and click plus, where not only you get to combine elements to make your way through doors and passageways in endless halls and corridors, you also get to interact with the environment in 3D (with the occasional frustration of not turning a wheel quite right to open a hatch or not thrusting a rock hard enough to break something). It's indie games like this that paved the way for something like 'Alien Isolation' and it's still today one of the coolest games out there with a great storyline and level design. In some ways I prefer this to 'Amnesia', specially because here the dark is your friend and doesn't drive you mad like in the later game (A mechanic that was introduced in order to force you to use lights as if it was food, to recharge your sanity).","November 24, 2014","true","10.2"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/recommended/22180/","drmircow","Dr. Mircow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/","677 products in account","Penumbra: Overture is a first-person survivor horror game with problem solving puzzles implemented in the gameplay which focuses more on survival and eerie atmosphere rather than action and gore. It is also the first episode of the trilogy.\n\nThe story centers on Philip, a 30-year old physicist, who gets a strange letter from his supposedly dead father shortly after his mother dies. This gives Philip the inceptive to follow his fatherâs clues, leading him to an abandoned mine in Greenland where he eventually gets trapped in after the mineâs entrance collapses behind him. From then on, Philip ventures through a series of events which turn out creepier with each new discovery he makes. Soon he realises that the mine is not just any ordinary mine. More importantly, it is not actually abandoned. The mine is in fact the habitat of ferocious mutated dogs, ârock wormsâ and spiders. Creepy crawly spiders.\n\nSurprisingly, the game has an intriguing story even if its premise of searching for your lost father as a plot device has been done numerous times before. Perhaps that is due to the fact that the story, or maybe its narrative, is actually pretty well-written. Generally, most of the story is being unravelled as the player discovers more lost documents and journals from various people who worked in the mine but died in the end in various circumstances. This may require quite a bit of reading to understand what and why things are happening that way (although some things are still left unanswered by the end), so it is important not to have a short attention span. Additionally, when a particular survivor by name of âRedâ makes his first appearance, things seem to get even more interesting from a plot stand-point, in a way reminiscent of Andrew Ryanâs debut in Bioshock.\n\nThe gameâs mechanics primarily focus on point and clicking with some "mouse swinging" when solving puzzles and small occasions of combat mixed in. Although some puzzles may require a lot of thinking than others, they are by and large well implemented. Unfortunately, there are times when backtracking is required which may or may not become annoying in time. Furthermore, the game does allow you to hide behind objects and block doors to prevent hostile enemies from seeing or approaching you respectively, thus creating a pretty basic but functional stealth mechanic.\n\nPenumbra: Overture also boasts a great sound design with its spine-chilling ambient music and close attention to details such as foley sounds, as well as having a memorable soundtrack -- the title soundtrack shall always remain a favourite of mine. Sound design is crucial for horror games like Penumbra: Overture, and it is reassuring to see that the developers did a fine job here.\n\nGraphically, while the art direction is commendable, the game did not age too well by todayâs standards. The animations are rough and stiff most of times, particularly for the dogs. But in most parts, the aesthetics do achieve in creating the spooky environment the developers envisioned.\n\nThe major downside of the game is its combat mechanic. Just like the way you have to approach the doors, drawers or switches in the game, the combat here requires âswingingâ the mouse which is extremely clunky and requires a lot of practice before getting the grips with it. Sadly, the experience generally ends up being always infuriating for every single hit stupidly missed by your pickaxe (arguable the main combat weapon). This is why any combat should be avoided as much as possible in this game, at all costs. On top of that, there seems to be a lack of variation in enemies too.\n\nConclusively, Penumbra: Overture is a game which excels in creating an authentic horror experience with genuine eerie atmosphere and plenty of mystique, along with well thought-out puzzles and an unexpected interesting story, only let down by its combat mechanic and roughness from a technical perspective. Being a relatively short game (so long as you do not âwasteâ time standing in one spot due to fear), it has the perfect length and pace. It may not be the most impressive horror game out there on the surface, but it is one which horror enthusiasts must try thanks to its unique approach and emphasis on atmosphere and less on combat which differentiates itself from the masses of generic and/or action-oriented horror games; in addition to paving the way to future superior, if not the best, horror games such as Amnesia: The Dark Descent or even Overture's follow-up episode, Black Plague.","January 25, 2015","true","5.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Both Overture and Black Plague are able to hold their own, with plots that are connected, yet both games give off their own distinct feel.

This series, much like Amnesia, is a true blue example of how horror is done in gaming, only this series gains points of not having an arbitraty sanity meter, but then loses those points for an awful combat system that thankfully, is optional half the time.  The puzzles in the game are a nice relief from fetching â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ly designed slabs of stone to be placed inside indentations in walls and are actually solved through common, real world sense, such as just plain smashing that locked chest open with a rock using the dynamic click and drag world interaction system.  Finally, the story is compelling, and you'd be surprised how much you'll find yourself caring for the only support character you meet, even if he's just a voice over a battered old radio.

After his mother's funeral, he receives a letter from his father, who has been presumed dead ever since Philip's birth. In his letter, he asks Philip to destroy certain cryptic documents, but out of curiosity, Philip decides to do some research and finds out the location of a mine in Greenland. He then goes on to investigate the mine on his own, which is where the game begins.\nPenumbra Overture is a blend of survival horror, psychological horror, and adventure game. You will solve puzzles to progress further, while avoiding and outsmarting enemies. While there is a combat system, the game encourages you to be stealthy and cautions. Combat is pretty clunky and ineffective, mainly because Philip is just a regular guy, not an action hero. Puzzles are interesting and done well, but I did get stuck once or twice (however, I was never good at puzzle games anyway).\n\nWhat makes this game shine is its atmosphere, sense of tension, immersion and isolation. Mysterious story only enhances that, but since this is the first episode in the series, not much is explained. Most of the information comes from notes lying around the place, and you better read them if you want to get the full back-story of the area.\nIn the terms of technical features, the graphics and sounds are solid and do the job, and the physics engine works well. Level design is decent, but since you are in a mine expect to see a lot of similar areas. Voice acting is not the best, but it's not cringe worthy either. Music is pretty good, it really keeps the tension going on and improves the overall atmosphere.\nBecause of the nature of the game the AI is not that complex and that's perfectly fine - enemies patrol the area and if they spot you, they'll chase you.\nMy complaints would be that after some time, enemies started to annoy me and get in my way. Probably because the enemy variety is pretty weak - there are only three different types of them and two of them are encountered only once or twice. Also, I didn't find this game really scary, especially in comparison to some of the later games from Frictional.\n\nOverall it's a solid game, worth your time if you're a fan of adventure games with horror elements. It does a good job of setting up the basis for the series.\n\nClick here to read my Penumbra: Black Plague review.\n\nMore reviews on my Tumblr page[megaskylight.tumblr.com]","April 14, 2014","true","5.4"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","1"

It fascinated me by taking an entirely different approach to the subgenre of survival horror, removing nearly all elements of violence or gore, while concentrating on a terrifying atmosphere and environment. Frictional Games manages to create suspense by solely focusing on the feeling of isolation and helplessness in a most hostile environment. Instead of just throwing one jumpscare after another at you, Penumbra plays with the fear of the unknown, and knows exactly at which time to strike. This combined with the puzzles and sophisticated physics engine ensure a perfect pacing between tense and relaxed parts. The music and sound design is remarkably well done for an indie game and can compare to genre classics like Silent Hill without doubt. Penumbra: Overture is a real insiders' tip for me if it comes to survival horror games, and shouldn't be missed by any fan of the genre.","September 16, 2015","true","7.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

However, Penumbra: Overture is Different.\nI thought I would pick this up, just to see what it was like (Also it was Â£1.25 in the Steam Sale). I had no Idea what I was getting myself into....\n\nPROS/CONS\n\n+A really Tense atmosphere: The atmosphere in the game is spot on. Instead of constant jumpscares the game shoves you into a dark enviroment that will have you jumping at shadows and curling up into a mewling ball in front of your computer.\n\n+Sound Design: The sound is immersive and chilling and when you do encounter enemies (Spoiler-dogs) The Nerve-shattering growling will put your hair on end.\n\n+Gameplay: You can physically interact with objects and you have to manually open doors by using the mouse button and dragging it around. The puzzles follow the traditional format of itemA+entitiyB=solutionC  and will require you to think logically. You have to manage resources (e.g You have a Flashlight that needs two batteries every hour).\n\n+Story: The story is immersive and clever twists and turns will leave you wanting more.\n\n+Graphics: Good for a small indie team.\n\n-Combat: Unfortunately, this game has a rather clunky combat system. You hold down R and Swing in the general direction of the target with a Pickaxe or Hammer equiped. This is rather annoying in dificult situation as you must stand perfectly still facing the target and if the target is a Mobile, Feral dog the you can expect death. Thankfully, combat is usually never the solution to anything.\n\n-Scripted events: The scripted events are annoying as they reqiure you to do certian things in a certian order. For instance, the first spider cave has you crawl through tunnels , blocking off spiders with boulders. You have a limited amount of time to think and what you have to do is unclear without pausing for thought. The worst experience for me was being chased by a Giant Worm through a chemical storage area. You have to close doors with obsucre buttons, bunny hop across a river of Acid, Use the Awful combat system to destroy a fence and finally, knock stupidly placed physics props over to cross yet another Acid River. The cherry on top of this Tarte au â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ was placing a valve next to the exit door only to have it turn very slowly with the solution being unclear (Remeber what I said about time constraints and thinking time). Thankfully these events are Rare in the game.\n\n\nTo Conclude\n\nIf you want a very good game that will Scare you and has a great story with nice gameplay and you dont mind the occasional bit of Scripted BS then this is the game for you.","January 25, 2015","true","17.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Most of the time, you will be spending your time avoiding monsters unless you have a handy pick-axe with you.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is very creepy, especially when those dogs are near. The music intensifies when enemies spot you which gives you a rush of adrenaline.\n\nThe physics are also cool; you can pick things up and move them around.\n\nThe story just immerses you with all the text you write in your notebook, the short passages during the loading of the next chapter, and the descriptions that you observe when looking at things around you.\n\nOverall, it was atmospheric, and scary. It requires you to use your brain and create objects in order to advance. It also gave me chills continuously.

I actually really like it how the player is given the chance to fight the dangers, even though being stealthy is the best option to go with. Or rather, it would be if there were no glitches that the player could take advantage of; the games most commonly met creature can easily be slain by jumping on a crate where it cannot reach you, crouching and hitting it whenever it makes a desperate leap attack towards the player, but to no avail. Also the game seems to crash very often. Then again, thats probably just me skipping puzzles by for example climbing to place x instead of knocking the ladder down with something. Well, lucily those are the only grand minuses of the game that I can think of right now and other than those points, I can't help but recommend this classic to horrorlovers. Why? Because the plot is pretty interesting, the puzzles are semi-challenging and there are parts in the game where you need to think and act quickly in order to survive, this game is basically the daddy of Amnesia: the dark descent.","April 11","true","4.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/22180/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Penumbra Overture is the first part of Penumbra series, being called Episode One as back then it was planned to make Penumbra a trilogy. Ended up being a duology plus expansion pack. It's a First Person adventure game with horror elements and combat and it was made by Frictional Games in 2007. Yep, same people who made Amnesia, you should feel this one being similar somewhat.\n\nActually, one should note about Penumbra tech demo, which Frictional Games people created to show off their engine. It had similar plot intro as in Penumbra, hero wanting to find answer about his dad in a mine set somewhere in snowy lands, and then you wander around in dark industrial corridors. And then meet a somewhat cute monster who is like a mix of slug and bat. And then solve puzzle. And then in the end get lamely knocked out in a small room covered in blood.\nAnd well, it actually excited people enough for developers to consider of making a commerical game based on tech demo. After all, it used physics engine where you was the one dragging things around and being able to manipulate with more detail. Like, you grab a side of valve and then have to circle it around accordingly. And then horror games in First Person weren't widespread back then either.\nOh, and people being spooked by the cut enemy.\n\nAs for how scary this is: Not much. It's not completely realistical and tame, but it doesn't try to screw with your brain with paranormal scares. It just sets of a really dark spooky atmosphere, but once you realize that whatever will be trying to get in your face is just a normal enemy, then well, you will relax. It still can scare you though, in the beggining. I think that game has enough for it going so even those who don't like being scared will feel it's worth playing.\n\nAnd it does feel like a not-high budged episode one of series. It doesn't have much going for it. It's actually repetetive in how it's maze after maze, password after password, note after note. But at least it's still nice to explore and still has lenght of a fine game. Even if it ends on clear cliffhanger. And there are no models for any other human. Even though you will "meet" Red. And may like that chap. Who is about as likeable as companion cube.\nAnd yea graphics are fine for that time. Does good work with shadows and lighting. Can be muddy. It actually has more than one light source. With one being infinite. Not to mentioning that a lot of areas are well-lit anyway that you don't really have to use them.\n\nYes, it still makes use of that physics engine, which was pretty nice at the time. Though puzzle-solving part of a game feels so disconnect from whatever horror premise. And it's not used as much as one would hope. But hey, it still gives feels. You can feel how heavy the box is when you are dragging it and can't lift it off the ground. Other parts of puzzles makes you combine items like in your everyday adventure game.\n\nIt also has combat and monsters. Or more exactly - dogs. They usually patrol the main parts of mazes and you find a few tools and items that are used on dogs. They are here to make you sneak and hide around corners of a maze, to make you afraid, with combat system that is clunky. But in short, it gets tedious really fast to go from one point to another point while hiding from them, so I would just murder them. It's actually extremely easy, you can exploit them. Or you can whack them directly and time it so they are pretty much stunlocked. So another flop.\n\nBut you know, back at 2007 it still was an unique First Person experience. And still is a good fun, even if weaker than the adventure horror games nowdays. Actually, I don't like being scared much, so I enjoyed just having a nice dark atmosphere, exploring and puzzling. Not to mentioning fine music and ambience. And fine pacing at times.","October 16, 2015","true","8.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Heh.  However, this one at least has a direct sequel which I'm about to launch into, so perhaps there'll be a satisfying finish to this one yet.\n\nHaving now played this in the wake of the also brilliant Amnesia, I have to say...not quite sure why this game's "spiritual successor" got so much of the praise, when it's a virtual remake of this in a more "medieval" setting?  Sure, Amnesia is perhaps ever so slightly more refined, but it wouldn't exist without this blueprint/"test run" coming first.  And any game which keeps me in constant suspense with just a handful of feral dogs, some carnivorous fist-sized spiders, and the occasional epic worm is clearly doing SOMETHING right!\n\nIn short, if you adored Amnesia you should at least get a kick out of this one, even if you might suffer a slight case of deja vu...and an absolute MUST-HAVE for anyone fascinated with just where the hell The Dark Descent came from.

There are also small homages to Half-Life in the story and gameplay.\n\nIf you like spooky atmosphere mixed with a bit of action and puzzle solving, you'll really like the first two Penumbra games.\n\nAvoid Requiem, however.  It's little more than a Portal-esque rip-off with some horror tidbits thrown in. The only possible reason to bother with the episode is to see the ending, which ties in to the first two and adds an extra layer to the story.  But it's really not worth the price of admission, unless you can pick up Requiem super-cheap.","January 4, 2013","true","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The stealth was not done as well as Amnesia, either. Getting around the dogs was surprisingly a piece of cake, only being caught at least 3 times, but you can just hit them, and run away while they go for help, and you'll be all good. The one thing I really hate is the way you attack, having to hold down the mouse button and then move the mouse around. This makes it difficult to stay aiming in the direction you want. If all you had to do was click to swing your weapon, it would make aiming a lot easier. I died a few times because of this problem. I can only hope that Black Plague doesn't have the same thing.\n\nAnd I really hated the part with the chemicals. The labeling of each chemical made no sense, there was nothing giving a hint as to which one was which. I though the order they were numbered on the paper was the same order as the letters on the vials. I looked through a couple note regarding explosives and chemicals, but they didn't help at all. I had to look up the combination. I tried to make sense of the labeling of the chemicals, but I just kept seeing people guessing. I still can't find out how it is supposed to make sense, with the numbered order being different than the letter order.\n\nBut besides that, I still think the game was cool.","November 8, 2015","true","8.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FirstUtterance/recommended/22180/","FirstUtterance","FirstUtterance","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FirstUtterance/","571 products in account","It's likely most people played Amnesia first before trying this, and, going in, they will find a lot of very familiar mechanics. The crate-pushing, object-throwing, drawer/lever-pulling, and wheel-turning physics and puzzles were all here from the very start. And, for the most part, they work pretty well. "Most of the time" because, well, there are times when it becomes a hassle, as they still hadn't a completely polished engine and had yet to implement features that would make things less hassling. There are quite a few doors, mainly the heavier ones, that can be fussy to open or shut, turning wheels is more of a pain here than what it'd be later on in Amnesia and, worst yet, no rotation function. You know those stacking puzzles that involved crates, barrels, planks, or similar objects of some variety you needed to use to reach certain areas? Sometimes they'd be in a position that made them not ideal for stacking, until you found you could hold "r" and rotate the object around until they were optimal for climbing. Unfortunately, here, if you have to stack something (which isn't too often thankfully) it's a matter of throwing and bashing them around until they are positioned how you want them. So what is the "r" key used for here, then? It's "interactive mode," which allows your cursor to move freely about the screen, turning off mouselook. A very useless function I'd say.\n\nNow let's talk about your light sources. You have a flashlight which uses up batteries which you'll find occasionally lying around throughout the game, a glowstick which has unlimited use, albeit a slightly shorter range than the flashlight, flares you can throw to light the way, and even a weird sort of blue-tinted "night vision" you get from moving around while crouching. So yes, light sources are near-endless, and considering that the game is actually fairly well-lit a good amount of the time, you likely won't find yourself using these often, even at the recommended gamma level (either 1 or 1.1 works). And when you DO need light, I found myself just using the glowstick. It suited my needs just fine without a flashlight and can be used infinitely, making the flashlight somewhat pointless. And that's another flaw, for a game that takes its namesake from a type of shadow, treading through dark places is hardly ever a concern, especially since you don't play a nyctophobic yet until Amnesia a few years later. Making light a more precious resource would definitely have given the game some edge.\n\nSo with light and darkness not being an issue, the main challenge of the game is navigating its large open spaces and avoiding patrolling attack dogs, with a couple other enemy types you'll encounter occasionally too. The dogs here are aggressive and persistent, and can even climb stairs (how about that!), so you either need to be very good at stealth, hiding behind dark corners and waiting until they walk the other way, or, if you want to take a riskier but perhaps in the end easier-on-you approach (since you'll be backtracking and wandering around a LOT, trust me), you can fight them off. This would be the first and last game of Frictional's to feature combat, and it's probably for the better. The game is notorious for having terrible fighting mechanics, and not without reason. Your main "weapon" will be a pickaxe, which you use by holding down the left mouse button and swinging it in the direction you want it to go. The problem besides it being slow and awkward to pull off, is it's also imprecise, short-ranged, and of little help against your much faster opponents who will often attack in groups of more than one. There is a supposed exploit where you can just stand on a box and kill the dogs that way, since they cannot reach you, but I found they just avoided me altogether when I did this. What IS nice though is there is more than  one way to take out an enemy. For one, you have explosives, such as the occasional dynamite to collect or plenty of pressurized gas canisters you can hit with a hammer or pickaxe, throw them over and cause an explosion (good if you can time them right), or just say "screw it" and pick up a big heavy object like a rock or a barrel and repeatedly throw it at the enemy until they stop moving (I found myself using this tactic more than any of the others). Later in the game there's even an area where, if you're good enough, can trap a dog and blast hot steam in their face until they fall over. It's satisfying, but a pain, to pull off, so throwing heavy crap around may be the way to go.\n\nThe second most common enemy is the spider, and they perhaps are the most annoying by far. They are this game's "tiny enemy that hops everywhere and is hard to hit." Every game that wants to annoy you has to have one of these things, right? Like Castlevania and its stupid fleamen. Anyway, the spiders are a nuisance and you encounter them mostly in tunnels you crawl through, and since you're unable to run when crawling they are all the more aggravating. And they often come at you in packs! Very wonderful. Usually you'll see a batch of eggs where if you get close they'll hatch and hop right in your face. If you think you can just throw some dynamite in a nest to kill them, nope, that'll just hatch them faster. The enemy that will cause many a death and headache for the player. The last enemy you face (won't spoil it) is much, much rarer, cannot be killed, and is Frictional's first stab at a panic-inducing chase sequence, and it's executed well I have to say. You never see it coming, and there are at least a few things you have to do along the way to slow it down if you want to survive.\n\nAs for "plot," there's not much of it per se but you do gather a lot of background information through notes, a tradition Frictional would proudly continue onward after this, some listing procedures, a lot of them clues for puzzles, and some chilling accounts of some terrible events that happened and the last things written by the people documenting them. The actual story, followed with Black Plague of course, starts with you receiving a letter from your father, presumed dead 30 years ago, with instructions to burn items contained in a lockbox, which include a map and other cryptic documents. Instead of doing this you head over to the map's marked location, leading you to the mess you're in, good job! There is also one other character you communicate with (or, rather, he communicates with you since you never answer back) via radio transmissions named Red, who occasionally offers direction but mostly goes off on insane tangents (and as you find documents of his and read more and more about his plight you will understand why), the game's one truly memorable character.\n\nThe one aspect this game excels at I believe is in its puzzles. Not exceptionally difficult but thoughtful and logical, and some maybe more challenging than what's in Amnesia. My favorite is the explosive mix you have to concoct, and gently carry it over a precarious chasm, risking blowing yourself up if not careful. There is definitely a lot of "put x item on y thing" inventory puzzles, some requiring tons of backtracking through confusing, repetitive maps with few landmarks, but on the whole it's all very well-executed.\n\nNot a particularly scary game, a few moments aside (more under-your-skin creepy, which is still fine by me), and can be clumsy and frustrating in the worst of times, with the annoying combat mechanics, stealth and friggin' SPIDERS, with some dull map design and too much backtracking through them for my liking. But despite that is it still worth a go? I'd say yes, with its innovative designs, great background story if you have the attention span for note-reading, & well thought-out puzzles and atmosphere. Recommended for Amnesia fans who've yet to play this and curious as to the company's start, and fans of atmospheric horror games in general.","March 5, 2014","true","14.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Anyway, the spiders are a nuisance and you encounter them mostly in tunnels you crawl through, and since you're unable to run when crawling they are all the more aggravating. And they often come at you in packs! Very wonderful. Usually you'll see a batch of eggs where if you get close they'll hatch and hop right in your face. If you think you can just throw some dynamite in a nest to kill them, nope, that'll just hatch them faster. The enemy that will cause many a death and headache for the player. The last enemy you face (won't spoil it) is much, much rarer, cannot be killed, and is Frictional's first stab at a panic-inducing chase sequence, and it's executed well I have to say. You never see it coming, and there are at least a few things you have to do along the way to slow it down if you want to survive.\n\nAs for "plot," there's not much of it per se but you do gather a lot of background information through notes, a tradition Frictional would proudly continue onward after this, some listing procedures, a lot of them clues for puzzles, and some chilling accounts of some terrible events that happened and the last things written by the people documenting them. The actual story, followed with Black Plague of course, starts with you receiving a letter from your father, presumed dead 30 years ago, with instructions to burn items contained in a lockbox, which include a map and other cryptic documents. Instead of doing this you head over to the map's marked location, leading you to the mess you're in, good job! There is also one other character you communicate with (or, rather, he communicates with you since you never answer back) via radio transmissions named Red, who occasionally offers direction but mostly goes off on insane tangents (and as you find documents of his and read more and more about his plight you will understand why), the game's one truly memorable character.\n\nThe one aspect this game excels at I believe is in its puzzles. Not exceptionally difficult but thoughtful and logical, and some maybe more challenging than what's in Amnesia. My favorite is the explosive mix you have to concoct, and gently carry it over a precarious chasm, risking blowing yourself up if not careful. There is definitely a lot of "put x item on y thing" inventory puzzles, some requiring tons of backtracking through confusing, repetitive maps with few landmarks, but on the whole it's all very well-executed.\n\nNot a particularly scary game, a few moments aside (more under-your-skin creepy, which is still fine by me), and can be clumsy and frustrating in the worst of times, with the annoying combat mechanics, stealth and friggin' SPIDERS, with some dull map design and too much backtracking through them for my liking. But despite that is it still worth a go? I'd say yes, with its innovative designs, great background story if you have the attention span for note-reading, & well thought-out puzzles and atmosphere. Recommended for Amnesia fans who've yet to play this and curious as to the company's start, and fans of atmospheric horror games in general.","March 5, 2014","true","14.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Grotesque creatures stalk your every move while you figure out which way you need to go, as well as solve any puzzles that are between you and your way out.\n\nFrictional games don't disappoint in these games as they will always keep you on your toes, like a midget in a urinal. The only downside that I have seen is the crude combat that exists. Throwing certain objects, using a hammer to strike them, or just simply sitting on top of a crate where they can't hit you but you can hit them kind of takes away the helpless feeling that Amnesia has. However, the sequel to Overture pretty much elminiated this making Black Plague an improvement.\n\nOverture is Part 1 of the Penumbra trilogy, and I also recommend playing the others as well (Black Plague and Requiem).\n\n9/10","January 5, 2014","true","15.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Overture is the first episode in the series and while its not as scary as Amnesia yet its still pretty intense.  Yes you can fight but combat is so awkward and clunky you want to avoid more than fight.  Besides most of the monsters are unkillable so fighting them is just to stun so you can escape.

There is a free demo of this game available from said website, and I recommend playing that if you want a taste of the game before you buy.  It is very much like Amnesia TDD, although in a slightly brighter yet just as grim underground mine.  The atmosphere is eerie, and the story is captivating and can really make you emotional at points (it did for me, anyway).  I definitely recommend this to those who want horror games that play like Amnesia: TDD.

I was afraid that Penumbra: Overture would be similar, but luckily it was not.\n\nThe graphics are not amazing by any means, but this almost just adds to the creepy atmosphere of the game. In fact, most of the horror elements of the game are just by sheer creep-factor, suspense, and tension alone. The story and atmosphere do most of the work, but they do it pretty well.\n\nCombat is a little difficult - weapons are melee-only and swing pretty slowly. Weapons movements are not very fluid, but once you get used to it it's not terrible.\n\nOverall, it's worth playing, but know that you have to continue on to the next games in the series to get any sort of conclusion to the story (based on having just finished Overture, apparently the first in the series).\n\nOne thing though - a lot of the combining inventory items and figuring puzzles out seemed almost impossibly difficult. I don't use walkthroughs very often at all, but I did for the majority of this game, and I have no idea how anyone could get through it without a walkthrough. Maybe I was impatient, but I think I definitely would have simply stopped playing the game if I wasn't 1) brought in by how scary it was and 2) the ability to use a walkthrough - otherwise I definitely would have put the game down and wouldn't have bothered. It's just not the type of game you *want* to spend tons of time on - you just want to play it. Perhaps I should play through Amnesia with a walkthrough...","June 21, 2015","true","8.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While not quite on par with Frictional's later and more famous effort, Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Penumbra fires off a trilogy that's intriguing in its own right, and just as atmospheric.\n\nStarting out in a cabin amidst a frozen waste, you're presented with little motivation beyond trying to uncover the fate of your presumably dead father. After stumbling your way through a howling blizzard, you clamber down a mysterious hatch and find yourself in an extensive cave system and facility that leaves a lot of questions to be answered. It's not long before you realize there may be someone, or something, down there with you that doesn't want you to find those answers.\n\nAs Frictional tends to do with their games, the horror in Penumbra: Overture takes the form more of a looming dread than anything particularly scary. Your powerlessness is repeatedly reinforced, as even something as small as one of the wild dogs somehow roaming the underground can end your day. Using your wits, stealth, and remnants left by those inhabiting the caves before your arrival, most of Penumbra relies on solving puzzles to progress. As you get further in, more and more notes and instructions left behind push you even deeper, eventually toward something no one should have known was below.\n\nVisually, Penumbra definitely shows its age, but things look cave-y enough in the caves and lab-y enough in the occasional lab that you get the idea, and you're unlikely to get lost just because of how things look. Interaction with items feels a bit clumsy, as lifting things just makes them hover in front of you, but the ability to throw or use items and giving things weight appropriate to their apparent mass adds to the immersion of the game. Death, when it comes, is often swift and brutal, but the checkpoints are placed as to not make things too much of a hassle to retread. If you can, remember to manually save now and then, just to be safe.\n\nOther than the awkward interactions and a couple of puzzles being a bit difficult to figure out, there's nothing I really found fault in when playing Penumbra: Overture. I highly recommend picking up the follow-ups, Black Plague and Requiem, if you like the first.","January 10","true","8.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While not nearly as good as that horror masterpiece, there is still a lot to enjoy in Penumbra. In fact, it's very easy to see how Amnesia eventually came to be what it is - its elements are on full display here, albeit in early forms. While the games do have some scary bits, overall the fright-factor is not quite where it could be. This is mainly due to the somewhat dated graphics and easily thwarted enemies (which, unlike in Amnesia, can usually be killed). The puzzles are generally pretty decent, with only a few solutions being particularly obtuse. So, while not perfect, the series is still worth a look for horror/adventure game fans, especially those who enjoyed Amnesia and are interested in seeing the roots of that game and supporting its developers.\n\nPenumbra: Overture is the 1st game in the series.

I bought Overture as a part of the Penumbra bundle, and have started Black Plague with skepticism.  To sum up my experience with Overture, it would have to be, "annoying."  Though the beginning of the game provided an amount of excitement, it quickly became  borderline unbearable to continue due to the ungodly spiders, the redundant puzzles, the giant rock worm debacle and feeble combat/control system.  I honestly had the premonition, "I will never play this game again." roughly ten minutes before completing the game; which was all that I had left to carry good old Phillip past the garbage incinerator and into the, admittedly much improved, world of roving, naked 'grey' alien mutations of the Shelter.  My advice is to find a trustworthy rendition of the storyline of Overture, and then begin playing Black Plague.","October 19, 2015","false","7.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

If you're looking for the adrenaline rush of scary encounters, you'll get maybe two out of this. Also, for the most part, what happens in the story in this game is explained in the second game. What you do get is more insight on a particular character and of course more notes to read. The ending felt quite underwhelming.\n\nWhat I will say that I enjoyed more in this game is that the notes you find are much more helpful (and usually necesssary) to your progression compared to Black Plague which means there's less of a feeling of "I have these useless notes that I could read but I'm not that interested in". However, the puzzles are also sometimes just a matter of wandering around which detracts from them.\n\nTo conclude I wouldn't say you should definitely avoid this game, but that it provides a lot less than Black Plague does in almost every aspect. I feel that skipping this game improves the quality:hour ratio and you don't miss a lot by doing so. If you do decide to skip it and then feel interested in coming back to it, by all means. There are a few sections that are worth playing.","January 16","false","5.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I am very sensitive to horror games....I was never able to go past the first levelm, I tried many times and I always stopped. Once I got used to the 'fear' system of the game, the game stopped being too scary for me and I started enjoying instead of seeing it as a torture (this is a message to the chicken people like me who are scared by such games).\n\nAnyway, the game is cool enough. First of all, keep in mind that this is a Chapter. The game has no end, it is a cliffhanger ending so if you are one of those (like me) that hate unfinished things, keep in mind that even if you don't like the game so much, you will have to play all three chapters (overture, black plague, requiem) to see the end of the story.\n\nThis chapter is quite short (6 hours are enough). Puzzles are nice, physics serve well that purpose. Graphically it is pleasant. Sounds is also still good enough for today's standards and controls are interesting. Can't say about the story because I have to play 2nd and 3rd chapter yet, but what can I say....so far so good !  75/100","August 18, 2014","true","5.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Yes it took me 6 years to finally play this and when I did I was so glad I played it, this is the precursor to Amnesia: The Dark Descent and it's really nice to go back and see the evolution of Frictional's horror games and how they did so well with Amneisa. Anyways this game is really good while it is not amazing in terms of horror it really stands on it's own. There are no incredible grotesque monsters to hide from and the creatures you do encounter can be dispatched with weapons found, the puzzles are incredibly simple and the atmosphere does well to put you on edge.\n\nOverall I think this game is deserving of the attention of all horror fans and I highly recommend you play the others in the series too.","September 5, 2014","true","7.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But it's also psychological horror, like, when you have just pooped and then you realize you might be out of toilet paper and it's the feeling you get before you turn to check if you do or do not have toilet paper. That kind of horror. Or the kind of horror that you get when you realize that you're going to be a parent. Or cancer.\n\nAlso this game has physics in it, which is important because physics is science and science is the future and children are the future. This is a good game for children. To teach them physics.\n\nI give this game an 8 out of 10 Draculas (vampires are also scary).","May 30, 2011","true",""," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game takes a dark turn when Phillip is trapped and forced to survive the horror of the mines while looking for clues.\n\nOverture is only slightly scary in my opinion, but that's just fine. It's more about survival, and is incredibly realistic. What it lacks in scariness, it makes up for in realism.\n\nFor example, the main enemy is packs of demonic dogs that stalk the player. You can fight them, but it's hard. You aren't a superhero, and you can't just click to swing your instrument of destruction over and over. You have to time attacks carefully, and swish the mouse in the direction you want your weapon to swing.\n\nAnother example is the physics engine. Like Amnesia, you can pick up/throw/push almost anything by cicking on it and dragging the mouse in the corresponding directon. You feel like you're really there, like your character has wieght and realness. This makes the game totally immersive, and really heightens the "survival" aspect.\n\nYou'll have to solve puzzles and escape monsters all the way through while feeling helpless and alone--so it perfectly captures what the survival horror genre is about.\n\nThe mad rantings of your only friend, Red, wrap it all up. Red is wonderfully voice acted and his insanity is creepy, eerily setting the mood.\n\nIf you want a dark, macabre, realistic, true survival horror game that doesn't pull punches or hold your hand, Penumbra: Overture is it. 10/10.","May 29, 2014","true","4.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Some great puzzles, but most are frustrating, and don't seem to make much sense. Worth a play if you're buying the whole collection. Not worth a buy on its own.\n\nThis is a hard game to review because it's one of those in between games. I don't want to thumbs it up, but I don't want to thumbs it down. The first couple of hours of the game were pretty good, the build up and atmosphere was done really well. But when it got into it I wasn't scared throughout the entire game which is kinda disappointing. I think it's due to bad AI; once I realised with the dogs you can just stand on top of a box and beat them to death they no longer became any sort of threat. The game very quickly became boring and repetitive as each section of the game is pretty much the same. Big area leading to smaller areas, guarded by dogs with some sort of puzzle to solve to continue. That was pretty much every area in the game.\n\nThe puzzles in the game are hit and miss. There was a puzzle fairly early on that involved Morse code and the way the game got you to solve it was excellent, I felt like a complete genius after solving that. It wasn't a frustrating puzzle, took a little while but solve it. But then most of the other puzzles were absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Later on in the game you grab 6 chemicals which you are supposed to mix in some sort of order to create something (I'm trying not to spoil anything best I can). Right, and literally nowhere is there any clue in what order to mix them. I'd grabbed all the notes and everything, read carefully, and couldn't work out anything. So, I passed the puzzle by trial and error. Mix this with this, nope. This with that, nope. 5 mins later... Yay I solved it!?\n\nAlso, there is this really annoying worm creature that you occasionally run into where you have to run away and escape from right. Well, it's one of those â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ chases where it's literally impossible to solve first try. You have to die, get a little further by working out what to do, die again. Progress more than you did but die again. Until eventually you know exactly what to do to get away from the creature.\n\nThe way I see it, if you're going to buy the whole package of the games, then it is worth a play. I wouldn't recommend buying this to be honest, or at least buy it in the sales.","December 14, 2015","false","6.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/22180/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1777 products in account","The atmosphere in Penumbra: Overture is great. It's dark, creepy, lonely, and cold. The physics engine is okay, with some flaws here and there, but nothing worth seriously complaining about. The moving of objects and melee actions can take getting used to, but once you're comfortable with the physics engine, it works okay, although far from perfectly. The game flows through the story smoothly without any frustration or senseless puzzles/problems to be solved. Everything is logical and upfront, requiring a realistic approach and a reasonable amount of thinking to proceed. The save system is unfriendly. It seems to save your progress when you update your personal notes, or when you interact with a certain object within the game world, which the player has little control over when this occurs. This means that you will often have to do certain portions of the game over and over until you get it right. The voice acting is superb. The accent and tone are outstanding and adds to the storyline greatly. All of the texts you will encounter in the game are well written, interesting, and adds plenty to the plot. The controls can be awkward at times in order to accomplish some actions the game requires. Penumbra: Overture is not a scary horror game. Most of its interesting emotional influences on the player comes from the theme of being almost completely solitary in an unknown place that is far from civilization and darkness. There are some instances in the game that requires the rapid change of items in conjunction to platforming and running, which I had to do many times to get it right. There is also a surprising amount of platforming as a whole for a primarily adventure game. Some parts of Penumbra: Overture are really cool, there is no denying that, but it does have a feel of an unpolished low budget title. With that said, this is probably one of the best adventure games I have ever played. It is logical and tense at all the right moments. I am not entirely sure for how long the main character is inside the mine, but the glow stick lasts for the entire duration of the game. You are not forced nor expected to use the flashlight nor the flares, which have finite longevity. I found melee fighting to be clunky and awkward, but this did not detract from the overall gaming experience. The ending is very creepy and will keep you glued to the plot, even though there is much left without explanations. The only major downside is the game's length. It is somewhat short and leaves you with a feeling of unfinished business with a cliffhanger.\n\nPenumbra: Overture is good.","March 20, 2014","true","8.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Yes, Finally, a game designer had a brain. I hate when there are things in the room and they are just made to look pretty and not be messed with, like part of the building's structure. If you see a book, you can pick it up. If you see a mattress, you can toss it, use it for a puzzle, launch it over a cliff. Glass can be broken. Hell, throw a barrel at your enemy and watch him stumble. How control how you pick it up and where you want it to go, Go play jenga with barrels and bags of garbage. XD\n\nAs for that, the rest of the game is very enjoyable in a very dark and strange way. The lighting, the atmosphere, the game dynamics. Very nice. Never had an issue with the game, including gameplay, puzzles, exploring. The game's sequel Black Plague is also just as enjoying, but not so much as the expansion Requiem.\n\nI highly recommend this game.\n\n\n\nNOTE: This is my opinions and thoughts of the game and not an overall view if the game for general audience.

Plot is decent, but nothing more. It is full of Lovecraftian cliches. The characters (character) you meet  being affected, implausible. The worst part of the game, however, is physics and controls. Interactions with environment tend to be clumsy, using equipment is very unhandy.\nHow big is the problem? Well, I tend to avoid all creatures not because I was afraid of them (as it should be in horror games), but because I struggle to omit any fight possible. To simply hit an opponent with a pickaxe was a challenge requiring very high skills with mouse and keyboard. At the same time the enemies are plain stupid (attacking until dead in a repetitive manner) and happen to die in weird positions - dogs drop dead 2 ft above ground, or partly in the wall or in the ground. Again, it's a glitch, not a horror element.\n\nAll in all, not recommended (says a Lovecraft fan).

The atmosphere is great, the puzzles are ok and the enemies, plot, and stealth elements fall flat.\n\nThis is not a spooky game. The atmosphere builds it up to be, but disappointing enemies and trial and error game play takes all that away. Your enemies are guard dogs & spiders, and very rarely a big worm thing, that's it. Some supernatural or especially fierce enemies could have added a lot of tension, but nope, just doggies. If you were dropped in the middle of the game with no explanation you would probably guess you were playing a poor wolfenstein clone.\n\nCertain parts of the game are only possible to complete by reading a walkthrough ahead of time or by dying over and over until you determine the correct sequence of events (especially the rockworm at the end). This repeated trial and error type game play replaces any feelings of suspense with ones of frustration.\n\nThe plot starts off strong and mysterious, falls a bit flat in the middle and leaves with a confusing ending.

The gameplay is pretty straightforward: You arrive to an "area" of the mine, which consists of a few rooms connected by halls patrolled by monsters. You can see the map of the area in numerous locations in the halls (some are almost next to each other... was it so hard to have the protagonist carry the map around and view it with a simple button?). You visit the rooms, find clues, closed doors, broken machines, etc. and must then proceed to solve these puzzles in order to progress to the next area. You cannot visit previous areas nor move on until you completely clear the current one.\n\nYou get some makeshift weapons, though you're not supposed to use them and instead sneak by the enemies by crouching and moving carefully in the darkness (BOOORING! it was slightly exciting the first time but seriously, there's some parts which you must navigate back and forth, and having to sneak carefully EVERY SINGLE TIME? c'mon), though i ended up developing a strategy to kill all the monsters so i could then move freely about\n\nWhat i disliked the most was the story to game length ratio. The whole plot is summarised in two sentences at the beginning of the next game, and it really feels overstretched at some points (a lot of times i was like "ugh, can something happen please? i'm just here solving all these puzzles and nothing happens story-wise")\n\nAudio, video and ambience are OK, but definitely not scary (and i always played with headphones and at night with all lights off). I really hope they didn't intend the locations to be frightening or disturbing, because if they did they fell very short of it.\n\nFinally the puzzles can be divided in two categories: traditional and physics-based. Traditional puzzles are like "this machine is broken, find the parts, place them in the correct spots and start the machine with a specific sequence of steps ambiguously described in this text" and they always feel too easy. Physics-based puzzles are like "an electric fence is blocking the way" and you must move things around (boxes, planks) to get through. Now i don't have anything against pysics-based puzzles, but most of the time there's no indication whatsoever that you're facing one of these, so you can spend some time wandering around an entire area until you realise that in the room in the complete opposite side of the mine has some stuff that MIGHT be the physics puzzle that you need to move on.\n\ntl;dr more annoying than innovative, and definitely not scary at all.","January 5, 2015","false","9.0"," 6 of 21 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","6","21","0","0"

The game has its moments of horror, but they only slightly stretch passed the initial reactions to it. The beginning does a good job of keeping you in the dark in terms of story and atmosphere. There's a sense of confusion and loss that doesn't leave; however, this eventually turns to a sense of confusion based upon the lackluster combat and wonderment of why you should be scared. The enemies aren't difficult to run from, I found myself just running through areas avoiding enemies because of the horrid combat. Along with the weak combat, you'll get lost fairly easily as there's little to no direction regarding your goals.\n\nThe game is short, so if you're looking for some cheap thrills, then I'd recommend it, but if you're looking for an engaging story and continuous horror, look elsewhere.\n\n5/10","June 24, 2014","false","4.0"," 6 of 21 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","6","21","0","0"

But regardless I found this episode to be kind of lackluster.\n\nThe game controls like a typical first person game, except the bulk of the gameplay is puzzle solving similar to that found in classic point and click adventure games. These puzzles are nothing special but managed not to bore me too much. There is however a fair amount of finding a locked door then finding a key, literal or figurative, in some random place. Fortunately the areas are small enough that they are not usually hard to find.\n\nWhere the episode fell flat for me was the supposed horror elements. In between the rooms with all the puzzles in them there are some kind of mutant dogs or wolves roaming the hallways. These to me were not scary and were just kind of annoying. The strategy for getting past them is generally just walking slowly and hiding slightly out of sight when one is in the way until it moves away. There are some other creatures you come across which you have to run away from and these sections are very trial and error. At least one of the creatures would be scary but when you've played the same part repeatedly because of the trial and error nature of the gameplay, it loses any scariness it once had.\n\nThere isn't a whole lot to the story. You're trying to enter an underground facility to find out what happened to your father who mysteriously dissappeared. There are various obstacles in your way and some crazy guy talks to you over a radio to guide you along. If you were to start with the second episode, you'd find yourself in the middle of the facility without knowing how you got there but there isn't really that much necessary background information needed to enjoy the second episode.","November 30, 2014","false","6.6"," 0 of 9 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","9","0","0"

It is classed survival/horror, but I felt neither of those. It felt more like a trial-by-death rage game. Try to do anything, you die, until you die enough times to feel out what specific actions you need to take to not die so quickly. Granted, I played on the hardest difficulty so it probably would have been quite a bit more manageable on lower difficulties, but the lack of direction killed it for me. Not on a macro story level, but on a micro encounter level.\n\nFor example, hopefully without spoilers, one level immediately drops you into an encounter where the character states, in subtitles, that they need to seal "that door" whilst looking at a door that obviously can't be the target of the statement. You are then in a large room with somewhat of a gauntlet arrayed before you, and if you take more than half a second to look around, even to get your bearings for the first time, you are dead. It took me at least a couple dozen attempts to coincidentally use that half second in the right spot facing the right direction to realize there was a button. Then I died again. And that was just the first leg of the gauntlet. There were at least two of these situations, together probably representing half of the time I put into this short game. Half the time the game decides to ignore its own mechanics, such as an enemy completely ignoring a distraction that should have worked, and had worked on previous occassions, for no discernable reason. There were also several cases where I would be hiding behind cover, such as a box or around a corner, waiting for the chance to sneak by, and the dog I was hiding from would suddenly start growling and teleport right next to me to rip my throat out. This game made me feel as though there were some hidden timer, and I weren't allowed to go more than a half-minute without dying, usually for no fault of my own.\n\nThe controls aren't very intuitive when it comes to the use of tools. I often found myself swinging short or my goal, or in a different manner than I wanted, which in itself got me killed quite often. There wasn't much story, nor was I particularly captivated, but this is only the first chapter in a trilogy. I did like the character Red very much however, in both his voice acting and portrayal. I will also admit that even with all these things, once the credits rolled I was surprised to find how small the crew was, and for the team size I think the game was pretty good.\n\nContext aside though, as the game itself stands I don't find myself compelled to recommend it.","December 5, 2014","false","19.4"," 2 of 14 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","2","14","0","0"

There are a few high points in the game, like the good voice acting of the character named "Red" and also unsurprisingly the atmosphere is great. But on the other end of the scale the "combat system" is completely broken and the game has very loose ties to the personal story of the main character, because the whole game focuses on this "Red" guy who in the end is very unimportant.\n\nThe sequel Penumbra: Black Plague is far superior, and at points is even better than Amnesia in my opinion. I know this is supposed to be a recommendation, but I quess I can also recommend people to stay away from games, so this one right here is definitely one you should skip.","June 11, 2012","false","0.0"," 1 of 12 people (8%) found this review helpful","8","1","12","0","0"

I got myself worked up for the first 30 minutes of the game, not realising there wasn't any thing to chase me yet, and then when they got to their first "scare" it was just a spider the size of my hand just crawling past me. Then, when a REAL threat came around, it growled which startled me (this was when I was still excited about getting the game), but I crawled around a corner and saw it was a bloody ( yet still unintimidating) dog the size of my spaniel, that I could run past without it noticing. Then later I decided to whack it with a hammer that I got very early in the game and it FELL OVER AND SURE AS   HELL TOOK ITS TIME TO GET BACK UP. Later I got on a crate where the dog couldn't get me but wanted to, so I kept hitting it with the hammer, and it DIED. That left me free of the dog until I went to another area, skipping and singing, "ding dong, the witch is dead." I just wish they made a better, scarier, maybe IMMORTAL, at least, monster. Plus, the riddles are SO FREAKING HARD. Had to watch PewDiePie play it to know wtf I was doing. But don't listen to me completely, I haven't beaten it yet, and I heard it gets more intense. CONCLUSION: Not a scary game (to me) but don't be COMPLETELY persuaded. Also, definately play this if you wanna play this game's sequal, Penumbra: Black Plague, which IS quite scary, but you won't understand a single thing in it if you don't play this; Overture. If you absolutely DO NOT GIVE A â¥â¥â¥â¥ about the story, go ahead and play Black Plague, but you'll be left with a crap ending that you won't get or like if you don't play Overture.\n\nOk, I've played the rest now and it got a LITTLE more scary.Just a couple parts with a huge worm. Long story.So, all in all, I'd just get Black Plague and just enjoy the scares.","May 12, 2015","false","13.3"," 0 of 10 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","10","0","0"

Whilst Amnesia dragged quite a bit in its less-scary, more annoying second half it was still a solid little horror title that managed to scare the crap out of me on more than a few occasions. Penumbra, whilst employing pretty much the very same mechanics - albeit without the sanity meter - is, however, one big frustrating colossal bore. I really tried to like this game but as time wore on so did my patience as the game had me running from one drab area to the next solving puzzles that grated more than gratified.\n\nPenumbra: Overture is the first episode in the downloadable Penumbra series where you assume the role of a young physicist who receives a letter from his supposedly long time dead father which leads the young narrator to the icy wastes of Greenland to a compound where it appears that some sort of chemical experimentation has been taking place. As with experiments of this nature,  it doesn't take the player long to figure out that all is not well...not well at all.\n\nThe problem with Penumbra: Overture is that everything takes place at the most languid of paces. This is not the game that dives head first into terror. Instead what we are left with is the promise that something scary is going to happen (queue music) but nothing ever does (that's if you find running away from countless zombiefied dogs, gigantic spiders and overgrown worms scary).\n\nWhilst some of Amnesia's puzzles could seem obtuse, Penumbra: Overture's puzzles can be borderline frustrating - often having the player traipse all the way across large swathes of areas to collect something only to have to meander all the way back to complete it which more than often has the effect of bringing the proceedings down to one big gigantic snail-like crawl. You will need to pay very close attention to the notes found strewn about if you have any hope in completing half the puzzles on display and should you miss a note well then prepare to hunt countless corridors or consult a walk-through. To add insult to injury the game proceeded to save my game in a particularly hazardous section where I was unfortunate enough to perish only to end up re-spawning my game in this particular section where I ended up repeatedly getting killed before I could even move my mouse cursor. For me this was the final nail in the coffin. Insta-delete!\n\nI have no idea how this first episode ends but frankly if you told me I meet up with Satan himself in the bowels of Hell I will just have to believe you since I have no inclination to ever want to find out. As for venturing further down the line with the remaining two episodes - well lets just say the Penumbra series has now been pushed right down to the bottom of my rather massive gaming list and given the lists current trajectory it's most likely I will never ever know the outcome of this tale in this lifetime. Not that I am bothered in the slightest about that!","February 20, 2014","false","4.4"," 27 of 74 people (36%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","36","27","74","2","8"

Albeit the settings in Amnesia are better, I do find the story better in this, and I like how it is episodic.\n\nI felt the combat to be clunky, but it got the job done. More of a thriller than a horror game. I just finished it, and now I am currently installing Black Plague, I most certainly want to see how this finishes. I won't state "if you're a fan of...", but check it out if you're wanting a good story in a pretty atmospheric world.","January 7, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The depth of the story was on a whole new scale. It made feel like you were acually there and not here. It does not make you really scream but it can make your heart shiver (It could, I screamed but yea. lol), and I acually cried due to a choice I was forced to make (No Spoiling). The puzzles do not make you feel like your hopeless, it just makes you feel the need to complete it. The graphics are not what you call games now a masterpiece, but it is indie-like and I love it. Controls are smooth and nice. You do not fight the monsters, but unlike Amnesia, you can kill them. If you choose to push your luck and kill them, then I wish you good luck. This is my favorite horror game just because of how well made it was. If you play it, you might find it boring, or you might find it to be amazing. I of course say go ahead and jump in. Tiny details like bloody paw prints, and the sound of foot steps, bring a darkness upon your mind known as dread, it breeds fear, and grasps whats left of your humane thoughts to whats looking for you.

And as it often happens with "first"s - it's the most impressive horror game for me. When I play it now - I have a huge feeling of nostalgia.\n\nThe plot is great. Mystery of the father's letter, the idea of a small man trapped inside an unknown bunker in the middle of nowhere, the enormous size of that underground construction... this is all very intriguing! In this game a lot of experiences were concentrated together. At first, it was like reading a very interesting fantastic book. At second, it was very immersive experience of being trapped in this bunker where the only way out is to go deeper into the unknown. At third it was innovative system of the interaction with ingame objects, where your mouse (and so your hand) becomes your virtual hand. Forth - it was a real true horror game, where scary things are made not of sudden flashes or jump-out monsters, but horror of the atmosphere, vulnerability and loneliness. Fifth - a lot of physical objects that you need to interact with, made the game even more immersive, because you see less scripting and more like simulation of virtual world. There was also a great musical theme in menu that touched me when I first launched the game.\n\nAs a verdict I can say that this game is at the top of experience of all games I played.\nIf I hadn't play this game I'd missed a lot in my life. Usually a lot of games for me is just a waste of time, and I wouldn't regret if I had never played them, but definitely not this one.","March 10, 2014","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think that imagining what was going on in the game was much better than the actual reveal.\n\nThat said, this is a fantastic game. The atmosphere really draws you in and gives a sense of being alone in the dark. The level progression layouts are well-designed, allowing you to visit the same areas multiple without it feeling repetitive. The enemies are tough without being impossible and some of the puzzles are real dome-scratchers. The weapons system is neat but has one drawback- each attack is super slow and it's easy to get killed by an enemy because you couldn't swing your weapon in time.\n\nFor people who don't want to go head to head with them, there are also multiple ways to incapacititate or evade enemies. Much of the game is stealth-based, making the creepy, ominous atmosphere even more tense. You never know if you're about to walk straight into something that wants to kill you- and will.\n\nThe story was interesting, remaining a complete mystery until almost the very end of the game.

Penumbra Overture, while people may be saying "Has nothing to do with the main character, just this "Red" fellow." it's untrue. Philip has a purpose to coming here in this frozen wasteland and pushing on, and the atmosphere is great if you have an open mind, it's dark, it's lonely, it's scary in the sense that you're trapped with nobody to help you, surrounded by death at every corner.\n\nFor emotions on the other hand, there are so many things in this series that play with your emotions, they get you to love characters, only to do something to twist around your thoughts and emotions. I felt so guilty playing both in the series with how strongly I got to know and like all these characters in the games. I'll leave it at that. Want to know what was so tear-jerking? Play the game. That's all I can tell you.

He worked at some mining complex at Greenland and that is the place the game starts right with the entrance to the pit at the gameâs cover. In the next 4 chapters you delve deeper and deeper to reveal the strange and frightening secrets of this place. Along your journey you find various items to use and even some weapons which you desperately need: this place is haunted by zombie-like dogs, gigantic worms and spiders the size of racoons. Eventually you discover excavations from alien origin and make contact to the sole survivor of this place: âRedâ which apparently has gone mad.\n\nAs the game was created by Frictional Games the mechanics are very, very similar to Amnesia. This game is older and when playing you can see the polish the developers did to Amnesia.\n\nCompared to Amnesia this game letâs you actually kill your enemies, though it is a though job. Which is sorta strange, since the game changes dramatically once you know how to kill all these dogs in the corridors. Then the dominant opponent turns into a âpiece of cakeâ and whatâs left are the riddles to solve. However getting a grip on these Zombie-Dogs is not an easy task and it takes you several (!) attempts to figure out how to get rid of them.\n\nI can imagine why they dropped the possibility to kill enemies in Amnesia: here the game stops been frightening at this point.\n\nThe riddles in the game are of different qualities. Some are stupidly easy and for some you simply get false hints, which is bad. I remember myself in chapter 4 been chased by a big worm. The game tells you to â â¦ to seal that doorâ. Right then you find a crate on the right side. When I jumped up the crate I couldnât reach the door mechanics, but the worm didnât appear. So I thought Iâm on the right place and tried over and over and over and over to get somewhere from that position. Wrong! I needed to simply push a button on the left side of the door! And sealing the door didnât help either â¦\n\nSuch quirks appear occasionally in the game: game mechanics great, story telling nice, riddles range from childish to misleading.\n\nStill, walking the strange mine renders some nice and creepy impressions, 7/10.","April 6, 2014","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Penumbra: Overture is Frictional Game's first game and it definitely shares characteristics with Amnesia.\n\nThe mood and style of the game is similar to Amnesia.  The lighting and eeriness of the locations set the tone of places you'd rather not be at.  Notes are scattered throughout the game, providing background history of the places you travel through.  The game is also physics based, but unlike Amnesia, you are allowed to have weapons, which does suggest that there is some form of defense.  However, the physics nature of the game requires the player to manually swing melee weapons by moving your mouse back and forth.  Nothing quite as fun as swinging in panic!  In addition to these, there are quite a bit more puzzles to solve, but nothing that is frustrating and some have satisfying complexity.\n\nIf you're buying this game thinking you'll get the same experience as you did when playing Amnesia: The Dark Descent then you will be off the mark.  While it does share Amnesia's atmosphere of horror, its level of execution isn't the same.  A play through the game shows that a lot of thought went into finding ways to instill fear into the player, but it's unable to maintain the same pressure throughout the game.  If you want to get the same scares as one would get playing Amnesia, then you'll be disappointed.  But if you're interested in playing a horror game or seeing Frictional Game's earlier works, then it's worth picking up this title.","June 16, 2014","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They're pretty much one and the same, these series. In fact, there's such a high probability that you've played Amesia or at least seen Amnesia that I'm not going to bother going into too much depth as far as the gameplay goes. Instead, I'll just keep things shorter and compare and contrast the two. For starters, both games have an emphasis on hiding from enemies, since combat is kinda spotty at best. However, that's by design, so there's not much point whinging about that. Unlike Amnesia, you don't have to worry about sanity. The screen just goes all wibbly whenever you look at the enemy. All in all, there's three things you've gotta worry about: puppies, carnivorous spiders, and the worm. The puppies will patrol the area, but you can distract them with bits of beef jerky... sometimes. It doesn't work all the time, though; even if you've got a whole pile of jerky in front of the dog. The other two you just run away from.\n\nPuzzles are, again, very akin to Amnesia. There were a few puzzles that were kinda annoying or suffered from 90's Adventure Syndrome, but they're generally pretty alright. You can brute force a few puzzles; a favorite solution to one where you have to knock down a ladder is to build a tower of barrels. Yes, that works. I'm still surprised that it works. There wasn't really anything that blew me away as far as clever puzzle design, though. It's just pretty run of the mill puzzle design.\n\nAs far as the atmosphere goes, Amesia wins by a LONG shot. There really weren't any gripping moments for me in this game. It's not bad, and to someone who's more susceptible to horror than I am, it might be quite a thrill. However, the game didn't grab me in the same way that Amnesia did. Then again, this is the first episode of the Penumbra series; maybe Black Plague can step it up a few notches. 6/10.\n\nStory: It's a pretty typical supernatural-based story. I can tell a lot of the questions the game brought up (that I didn't find myself asking, actually; the game kinda shoved the questions down my throat) are gonna be answered in later installments, but for just the first game, I didn't find myself really caring all that much. Red should have been a lot creepier of a character, but he was more of an annoyance than anything else. At the end, I didn't feel pity; I just felt relief that I wouldn't have to hear his stereotypical rambling. Also, just because your game is episodic, that doesn't mean that you've gotta have a cliffhanger. It only works if you're really invested in the series. Otherwise, it just seems silly. Oh well; at least they got better at writing by Amnesia. 5/10.\n\nGraphics: I'm quite impressed that they were able to do this much in only a ~300MB download. All of the textures look pretty good, the worlds are pretty well made, and everything just looks pretty good. Too bad that the mine environment didn't allow for much on the art style front. Enemies aren't really too interesting art design-wise, either. Certainly nothing as discomforting as Mr. No-Jaw-McGee. It does get kinda boring looking at mine section after mine section after mine section, but I guess that couldn't be helped. The game will run at 1080p easily, and I'd imagine that if you have any graphics card whatsoever, you should be able to run this game without any problems. For a fair bit of technical finesse from an indie team with an unfortunately lacking art direction, I'll give it a 3/5.\n\nSound: Frictional has always been pretty good at sound design. While this isn't their best example of sound design capabilities, it is still a good show. It does get a bit silly and overdone at times, but for the most part, it does a pretty good job at setting the atmosphere. As far as the voice actor (singular; Red is pretty much the only one), it wasn't bad. It's only bad  that his dialogue made me get rather tired of him fast. As far as the music, there really isn't much. It does set the mood, though, so I guess there's that. 4/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 6/5/3/4; cumulative score of 5.7/10. Overall a pretty middling surivival horror game. Hopefully Black Plague picks up the pace.","July 12, 2014","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It ok, but its worth playing it to play the second game, "The black plauge", thats the really good one. In the beginning when you are walkingt through a dark tunnel its scary but after that you are mostly in lighted rooms. But there are some fun atmospheric and scary moments. Like the lake, the worm chase and the room with the UV-Lamp text. There are basicly just 2 enemies. Zombie dog and big spider. Your attack is really bad. When fighting the zombie dogs you get a lot of diffrent things to lure them but to kill the enemies the easiest way is to just stand still att hit them when they attack. Hate the spiders, they are so annoying. >_< The story is hard to follow, but you grasp it and can but the parts together in the second part. Also the flashlight is so muth worse than the green tube whih never runs out of battery. But in "black plauge" they made the green tube worse so you have reason to use the flashlight. ^^","April 10, 2014","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think that imagining what was going on in the game was much better than the actual reveal.\n\nThat said, this is a fantastic game. The atmosphere really draws you in and gives a sense of being alone in the dark. The level progression layouts are well-designed, allowing you to visit the same areas multiple without it feeling repetitive. The enemies are tough without being impossible and some of the puzzles are real dome-scratchers. The weapons system is neat but has one drawback- each attack is super slow and it's easy to get killed by an enemy because you couldn't swing your weapon in time.\n\nFor people who don't want to go head to head with them, there are also multiple ways to incapacititate or evade enemies. Much of the game is stealth-based, making the creepy, ominous atmosphere even more tense. You never know if you're about to walk straight into something that wants to kill you- and will.\n\nThe story was interesting, remaining a complete mystery until almost the very end of the game. The story setup was brief without being rushed, allowing you to get right to playing with a million questions you want answered already.\n\nGreat horror FPS, runs great on older laptops with integrated graphics, great voice-over acting, great game. For an especially sweet deal, buy this game during a steam sale for about $5. You won't be disappointed.","January 14, 2014","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Overture is the first game in the penumbra series, it features Phillip who is investigating a letter written from his dead father and ends up trapped in an abandoned mine.

You can throw rocks or objects to knock out enemies (Dogs, Spiders, Infected) but after a while they will get back up again and attack you.

Your quest to discover the fate of your father in a secret base under the Greenland wastes becomes a struggle to survive a living nightmare, and if this kind of horror is for you, you'll absolutely love it.\n\nBy far and away the biggest problem is the ease with which you can bludgeon most monsters to death, immediately rendering them unthreatening. Luckily, it's entirely possible (though much harder) to play the entire game without killing anything, and this need to remain hidden or face certain death infinitely ups the fear factor. The sequel, Black Plague, fixes this problem without needing to play in a particular way, but Overture can be just as terrifying with only a bit of conscious effort.\n\nHighly recommended and the game that got me into horror.\n\nFrom the developer of Amnesia!","November 26, 2011","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics, atmosphere, sound design, and story are all top notch. This is also pretty much the game that started the exploration heavy and combat-light based gameplay-style for indie-horror that Amnesia later codified.\n\nI DO have some complaints about the gameplay machanics that anyone thinking of buying this should now about, though:\n\n*The combat is clunky and barely responsive. I can see that were going for for a immerisve and substansal feeling system with interaction beyond clicking a button to swing, but it was implemented horribly. It consists of holding the action button to ready yourself, and using the mouse to swing but it takes such broad movements that it's hard to hit anything and good luck lining up enemies when they can simply step out of your hitzone because you obiously can't move the camera while holding the action button.\n\n*I won't post spoilers here, but some of the puzzles violate common sense or rely to much on really diffcult trial and error along with memorization. Some also do downright underhanded things like requiring you know morse-code with nothing but a code-sheet and no indication how to tell dashes from dots.\n\nNormally I'd trash this game, but the story and art design made up for the short-comings in the gameplay and made worth powering through to the end.\n\n","May 9, 2015","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Given how clumsy this was, the developers abandoned combat in the sequel and everything they've made since. This is either their great discovery that revolutionized horror gaming or a gigantic mistake that led to the genre abandoning resource management and becoming a puddle of samey, poorly-designed walking simulators with bad lighting.\n\nRegardless, it still nails the sensation of being trapped in a not-quite abandoned Greenland mine, at least to someone who has never been to Greenland or lived off dead spiders and dog meat in a mine shaft (if you have by any chance experienced either of these and feel that I am mistaken, feel free to let me know). If this sounds appealing to you and you don't mind the possibility of having to load someone else's save after the game refuses to acknowledge that you plugged a power cable in properly, you will probably enjoy Penumbra: Overture whether it spooks you or not.\n\nAlso, pay attention to the store page's screenshots.

When Phillip goes to pick them up, but he reads them rather than destroy them, because of human curiosity, and due to this he investigates more, eventually leading Phillip to leave his home on a "grand" adventure.\nI'm not going to say anything else, The rest can only be learned if YOU buy the game and play it!\n\nGameplay-\nIn Penumbra you have a few "options" to combat the enemies (mostly dogs) that stand in your way.\nThe game tells you that hiding and being sneaky is the only real option, however depending on the difficulty you CAN kill the enemies (which is a BIG flaw IMO) with hammers, dynamite, and more. While trying to avoid the enemies (or jumping around because you killed them all) you have to solve puzzles, and go to different locations. The puzzles are usually easy, I rarely found myself looking up solutions to them, as normally the answers are told to you if you READ THE INFORMATION THE GAME GIVES YOU. Make sure you ALWAYS search a room/area indepth.\n\nI can't really think of anything else to say about the game, It's an amazing game, and a perfect start for Frictional Games, there are 2 more games in the Penumbra Series... Black Plague, and Reqium.\n\nI recommend you get this game if your a fan of horror, adventure, puzzles, or you are a fan of Frictional Games!\nAlways remember\n"If fate frowns, we all perish"","March 24","true","18.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The few "weapons" you encounter are tools that are used more for their intended purposes than they are for slaughter. Most of the time you're better off just running away from combat, as the tools don't do much damage anyway.\n\nThe atmosphere and the creativity of this game make it an experience that differs from the norm, and this is the real reason to play it. The setting is very eerie and a nod to old survival horror games, placing more emphasis on survival than conflict. The sound effects can be very unsettling, and the ever-present snarls of the wild dogs send a chill up your spine. While not "scary" in the traditional sense, there are moments where the game will leave you with a distinct feeling of unease.\n\nThe puzzles can be somewhat difficult at times, but you can't help but admire their creativity and thought-provoking nature. Notes and letters are more than just collectibles here. Many of them are vital to puzzle-solving and advancement, so make sure you read everything you encounter and pay close attention to clues.\n\nConsidering you get both games in a $10.00 package, it's definitely a great value. Though if you don't mind waiting, I picked mine up during a sale for 50% less, which made it even more worthwhile.\n\nAdmittedly, I have yet to finish the game. But I'm several hours in and I would already recommend it to those who enjoy a straight-up adventure game as opposed to the ever popular shoot-em-up. Looking forward to finishing this up and moving on to the follow-up, "Black Plague", which I'm told is even better.","January 5, 2014","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles are fun to get through because you can pick stuff up and toss things around. It makes the Source engine feel primitive. The sound is also done well-- dissonant soundscapes that make your skin crawl just a little bit. And these shining points are why Penumbra Overture gets a solid "MEH" instead of a dissentful "GARBAGE"; read on.\n\nAfter the first hour or so, the game gets quite mundane. The game begins in the typical "abandoned mine" game trope, which is one of the worst settings there is, on par with "the water level that's mostly swimming". Nobody likes abandoned mine levels, we all just begrudgingly power through them hoping to get to the next area. Unfortunately there is no next area-- the whole game is in this mine. As a result the level design feels uninspired and boring.. because it is. And the one lake area that adds some dynamic to the world is a total non-sequitor.\n\nAs is standard for horror, combat is terrible. We are encouraged to sneak around enemies, which does have novelty for the first hour of gameplay. After that, it's just Outlast before there was Outlast.. I grappled with the poor fighting system until I found a reliable way to exploit it and kill the dogs (almost) every time. Running from enemies doesn't increase tension. It never increases tension. It only breaks momentum. The corridors are too long to backtrack through if one has to stop and wait out the dogs, so the dogs need to be taken out back and axed. Crouch down and time your hitstuns.\n\nThe spiders are poorly implemented. They can't be killed in any practical sense, and they can outrun you. It's a matter of trial and error, death and respawn, until you've brute-forced the maze to the point of memorizing the right path. There was an instance where I got check-pointed with spiders right on my tail, thus making the current objective impossible to complete. Player death was unavoidable because I hadn't previously been moving along fast enough for a sufficient head start. I had to reload an older save and use hindsight to briskly run through and make all of the correct turns.\n\nSimilarly, boss battles are all one-shot kills and require fast environment interactions to get past. Once again, they're impossible to beat the first go-around. But after enough trial and error you learn where to go and what to press. It takes all the tension out of the prospect of death. Good game design involves giving the player the opportunity to analyze and deconstruct the situation in the middle of the action, but Penumbra punishes the player for slowing to look around despite it being necessary to advance.\n\nMy guess is that this game was playtested only by the creators, and knowing the lay of each path, were able to breeze through with little difficulty. Uninitiated players, despite Penumbra Overture being a relatively easy game, will inevitably die at certain points in their playthrough, making death expected, accepted, and anticlimactic.\n\nNevertheless, I still recommend buying the Penumbra Collectors Pack this Winter Sale because it comes out to only 83 cents for each game. Although most of my review was negative, it's fortunate that the majority of the game is puzzle solving with that neat physics engine. This game is worth the 83 cents, and it was fun to see where Frictional came from before I play Amnesia for the first time.","January 1","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

He worked at some mining complex at Greenland and that is the place the game starts right with the entrance to the pit at the gameâs cover. In the next 4 chapters you delve deeper and deeper to reveal the strange and frightening secrets of this place. Along your journey you find various items to use and even some weapons which you desperately need: this place is haunted by zombie-like dogs, gigantic worms and spiders the size of racoons. Eventually you discover excavations from alien origin and make contact to the sole survivor of this place: âRedâ which apparently has gone mad.\n\nAs the game was created by Frictional Games the mechanics are very, very similar to Amnesia. This game is older and when playing you can see the polish the developers did to Amnesia.\n\nCompared to Amnesia this game letâs you actually kill your enemies, though it is a though job. Which is sorta strange, since the game changes dramatically once you know how to kill all these dogs in the corridors. Then the dominant opponent turns into a âpiece of cakeâ and whatâs left are the riddles to solve. However getting a grip on these Zombie-Dogs is not an easy task and it takes you several (!) attempts to figure out how to get rid of them.\n\nI can imagine why they dropped the possibility to kill enemies in Amnesia: here the game stops been frightening at this point.\n\nThe riddles in the game are of different qualities. Some are stupidly easy and for some you simply get false hints, which is bad. I remember myself in chapter 4 been chased by a big worm. The game tells you to â â¦ to seal that doorâ. Right then you find a crate on the right side. When I jumped up the crate I couldnât reach the door mechanics, but the worm didnât appear. So I thought Iâm on the right place and tried over and over and over and over to get somewhere from that position. Wrong! I needed to simply push a button on the left side of the door! And sealing the door didnât help either â¦\n\nSuch quirks appear occasionally in the game: game mechanics great, story telling nice, riddles range from childish to misleading.\n\nStill, walking the strange mine renders some nice and creepy impressions, 7/10.","April 6, 2014","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This was one of the first games I ever bought on Steam back in 2011. Being an idiot, I never really got past it. Well, I decided to sit down this weekend and try and actually finish it. Wasn't hard. I did it.\n\nPenumbra: Overture is a good game. As a horror game, eh...\n\nFor someone who hasn't really played horror games all that much, this was a pretty ok start.\n\nPenumbra follows the adventures of a young man as he travels to Greenland upon his dead father's request. When he gets there, a storm hits and he is forced to take shelter in an old mine. Bad idea, as the mine has it's own little messed up histrory.\n\nPros:\n-Interesting story\n-Decent graphics\n-Very atmospheric\n-Pretty ok puzzles (especially for people not good at them)\n\nCons:\n-Not very scary when you can just kill the enemies...\n\nReally thats it.

Itâs always interesting to go back and see where famous and talented developers got their start, and Penumbra is no exception.  Now, I will admit that Iâm not a big fan of horror, or being scared in general, but I played through this game and I can appreciate it for what it is.  Penumbra was originally planned to be a trilogy, but after the release of the second chapter, titled Black Plague, the planned third chapter was instead turned into an expansion.  I havenât played Black Plague, but Overture stands well on its own.\n\nThe game starts with you receiving a letter from the main character, Philip.  He urges you not to follow him and ends with an ominous thought, âIf we are lucky, then by the time you receive this, I will be dead.  If fate frowns, we all perish.â  You play the game through Philipâs eyes, as he himself receives a letter from his supposedly-dead father, and follows its directions to an abandoned WWII mine in northern Greenland.  Follow Philip as he delves deeper and deeper into the mine, where almost as soon as he arrives, he realises something is very wrong.  What he thought was just an abandoned outpost is instead a twisting maze of tunnels, each section full of weirder and more disturbing revelations than the last.\n\nThis is a game that relies not on jump scares and combat, though those do exist.  Penumbra is full of what makes Frictionalâs games so truly terrifying: existential horror, and it makes you really uncomfortable in your own skin.  Youâll get good insight into Philipâs mind through text overlays on screen of his reaction to events. Cheap but effective.  An interesting feature that supports the immersive atmosphere is the physics engine.  To open a drawer, you donât just click on it like in other games. You actually click-and-drag the handle.  To swing a hammer in self-defense, or to break down a barricade, you donât click or hit a keyboard button.  You drag your mouse across the whole screen in the direction you want to swing.  This design gives a very heavy, tactile feel to the world youâre in, making you feel much more engaged and connected to the story.  Which is critical for horror games.  In a brilliant design choice, Philip isnât a soldier, and he doesnât act like it.  Combat is difficult, unwieldy, and largely ineffective.  Catch sight of a mangy dog, for example, will cause Philipâs breathing to become heavy, and heâll start to panic.  You can feel his terror as he prays for the dog to not turn this way, please no, IT SAW ME, RUN!  The past few years have seen many games with this conceit, that youâre just an ordinary guy in extraordinary circumstances, but Penumbra was one of the first.\n\nFrictional Games are very well aware that less is more in the horror genre.  Youâll read a note about giant spiders, and instead of getting chased down a corridor, fighting your way out, your only path is to crawl into a hole in the floor, hearing scratches and scrapes just out of sight.  But you wonât interact with a single spider, not yet anyway.  Run across a dog, and as you desperately hide behind a crate, youâll hear its breathing as it sniffs for you.  The sound effects are top notch, really deepening the sense of danger.  Doors creak as they open, Philipâs breathing and footsteps are loud enough to wake the dead, or at least youâd think so when youâre trying to hide from some unseen flesh-devouring beast.\nThe graphics are a little dated by todayâs standards, but theyâre not too shabby for an indie game from 2007.  The game only consists of a 334MB download, so it is understandable that there are only a few textures in the game: wood, stone, metal, and rock, with some slight variations.  The lighting is where atmosphere is really made, though.  It is almost impossible to see without using either your flashlight (which constantly drains battery) or your glowstick, which covers everything in an unearthly green.  Many games would have flickering lights spread all throughout this abandoned mine, but Frictional is smarter than that.  Why would there be working lights down here, when no oneâs been here in 30 years?\n\nAs you explore deeper and deeper, youâll begin receiving messages from someone calling themselves Red.  Your only companion is this odd voice that guides you through the tunnels, the one piece of normalcy in this cave of monsters.  You can see similarities to Bioshock in this regard.  A minor nitpick I have with the game is something most horror games struggle with.  Failure (i.e. death) resets you to your last checkpoint, at which youâll realize you know whatâs coming.  So whatever set piece they had intended to terrify you instantly loses its impact.  After a while, youâll start playing it like a game, trying to run past the stupid dog and finish your objective, not worrying about dying anymore.  The instant death loses meaning, is the instant the gameâs atmosphere gives out.\n\nWithout spoiling the ending, let me tell you that the choices you have to make at the end of the game are both horrifying and inevitable.  The cliffhanger that the game ends on sets up the sequel, but I do not think it is necessary to play.  Itâs scarier if you donât know what happens next.\n\nSo Penumbra: Overture is an engaging, immersive game.  Even as a wussy non-fan of horror, my curiosity got the better of me and I overcame my fears to explore this mineâs deadly secrets.  It was enjoyable, if unnerving.  Satisfying, but unsettling.  And I suppose thatâs what a horror game should be.  Great work, Frictional Games.","April 5","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/evilTak/recommended/22180/","evilTak","Tak!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/evilTak/","234 products in account","Penumbra: Overture, as the title would suggest, is the opening chapter of the first-person horror epic Penumbra, from the creators of Amnesia and SOMA.\n\nOriginally released in 2007, P:O was one of the early standouts in psychological horror, and laid the foundation for many of the concepts and mechanics that have come to characterize the genre, notably: a relatively weak, "everyperson" protagonist who has no choice but to rely on running, hiding, and sneaking to avoid and bypass effectively invincible hostile creatures; consumable light sources that force the player to balance ability to see against likelihood of being seen, as well as exploration against safety; use of auditory and visual effects to communicate the emotional state of the player character; strong emphasis on immersive audio design; environmental puzzles that require the player to brave dangerous or disturbing situations to collect the necessary components and/or clues to solve them; and the application of the Lovecraftian principle that a nebulous suggestion, filled in by the player's imagination and dangled at the edge of awareness, carries much more potential for terror than something explicitly portrayed in graphic detail.\n\nThe story begins as the protagonist, Philip LaFresque, receives an unexpected letter from his presumed-dead father, urging him to destroy a set of cryptic documents. Upon investigating them instead, Philip applies his Library Use skill, discovers a reference to a mysterious location in Greenland, and, apparently armed with only a flashlight, a bottle of Jack Daniel's, and his wits, sets off to uncover the truth.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, the player interacts very directly with the environment - doors and drawers are manually pulled open and pushed shut, levers manually raised and lowered, wheels manually rotated. In addition to H.P. Lovecraft, the game draws heavy inspiration from Half-Life - in terms of physical interactions, fans of board smashing, crate stacking, and barrel arranging will find plenty to like. There's even a crowbar engraved "Freeman."\n\nP:O is enjoyable and complete by itself, but its ending segues directly into Penumbra: Black Plague, and players who enjoy the overture should definitely continue. The game shows its age graphically, but the Penumbra series's strong writing and eldritch atmosphere make it a classic for fans of Lovecraft and stealth/survival horror.","April 10","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Given how clumsy this was, the developers abandoned combat in the sequel and everything they've made since. This is either their great discovery that revolutionized horror gaming or a gigantic mistake that led to the genre abandoning resource management and becoming a puddle of samey, poorly-designed walking simulators with bad lighting.\n\nRegardless, it still nails the sensation of being trapped in a not-quite abandoned Greenland mine, at least to someone who has never been to Greenland or lived off dead spiders and dog meat in a mine shaft (if you have by any chance experienced either of these and feel that I am mistaken, feel free to let me know). If this sounds appealing to you and you don't mind the possibility of having to load someone else's save after the game refuses to acknowledge that you plugged a power cable in properly, you will probably enjoy Penumbra: Overture whether it spooks you or not.\n\nAlso, pay attention to the store page's screenshots. They reveal some enemy encounters ahead of time while also picturing several that never actually happen in the game just to keep you on edge. Stuff like this is brilliant and I'm surprised there aren't more horror games that do this.","February 22","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Maybe..... Probably not). Anyway, you have this inexplicable feeling to journey to Greenland and find your father.... or something. And what you find is completly expected (Snow). But wait, its not just snow, there is also ICE! After a blizzard that nearly freezes you colder then a cave man you find a door. Its not just any old door though, this door is heated (how else could you open it). Now, you are in a stange hallway with a flickering light! How scary! Then there is some blood, then there is a worm, then there is an incinerator, and then the end. But hey, it was kinda fun.","July 17, 2013","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I immediately started thinking of jump scares and Amnesia, so it was a relief to learn this was made by the same creators of Amnesia so this would be a high-quality Amnesia clone by people who knew what they were doing. Because they did it before. Several times. If you like atmospheric story-heavy horror games where you run and hide like a little baby because light attracts danger, this will be right up your alley. If you're like me and would rather punch the monsters in the face or at the very least NOT have to cower and run and hide while piecing together the story, you should play Skyrim or Le Chuck's Revenge instead.","March 14","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The atmosphere is really well done and while playing I felt more and more isolated, the deeper I went into the mine. If you pay attention to the details and let yourself into the mood, this game will reward you by kicking you in the balls and laughing at you while you whimper on the ground.\n\nSo much for the mood part.\n\nThe puzzle mechanics are a bit rough and unpolished, which is excusable as this is (one of?) the first games of this studio and you see quite some elements that are later refined in titles like Amnesia.\nThe combat system (which they thankfully removed in the second part) is pretty wonky and needs a lot of getting used to, the best option is to hide.\n\nIf you can forgive the mediocre mechanics and really need to feel down, this is the title for you.","February 28","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/some_anon/recommended/22180/","some_anon","Tuxxy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/some_anon/","132 products in account","Penumbra: Overture is a first person adventure/stealth game for cynophobics: you can sneak past the dogs or if you really, really hate the beasts you can sneak behind them with a pickaxe and bash them to death by wildly flailing your mouse around and hoping it hits something. Given how clumsy this was, the developers abandoned combat in the sequel and everything they've made since. This is either their great discovery that revolutionized horror gaming or a gigantic mistake that led to the genre abandoning resource management and becoming a puddle of samey, poorly-designed walking simulators with bad lighting.\n\nRegardless, it still nails the sensation of being trapped in a not-quite abandoned Greenland mine, at least to someone who has never been to Greenland or lived off dead spiders and dog meat in a mine shaft (if you have by any chance experienced either of these and feel that I am mistaken, feel free to let me know). If this sounds appealing to you and you don't mind the possibility of having to load someone else's save after the game refuses to acknowledge that you plugged a power cable in properly, you will probably enjoy Penumbra: Overture whether it spooks you or not.\n\nAlso, pay attention to the store page's screenshots. They reveal some enemy encounters ahead of time while also picturing several that never actually happen in the game just to keep you on edge. Stuff like this is brilliant and I'm surprised there aren't more horror games that do this.","February 22","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You see, in Amnesia, you have no possibility to kill the monsters, you can only hide. But the point is, hiding works, unlike this â¥â¥â¥â¥. You have a hammer in your inventory with which you can, in theory, kill the dog. But swining the hammer is so awful, you can barely smash a crate.

THey are a bit old but the story and adventure part of it is done quite well and is engrossing to a degree.\nThe puzzles and quest are quite well done though a little illogical at times and can be monotonous, but overall they get you thinking.\nThe horror side is mehhhhh!  The game is predominantly in the dark and the creatures are from a B grade horror from the 50's but it does set the mood at times, especially with the audio effects etc.\nThe graphics are very ordinary compared to modern capabilities but for the time they were okay.  The AI of the dogs etc is appalling and quite comical but again its primarily due to the era of the game.\nThe part that kills al these penumbra games is the controls.  Its beyond bad.  They tried to be clever and realistic by making the use grab item and swing in an arc to open boxes and doors, or try to line up items using the mouse but overall kill the game.\nYou cant actually line any thing up so when trying to smash one of these crazy wandering brain dead dogs you end up doing the cha cha and relying on pot luck. Luckily as stated the AI is near non existant so simply get on a box etc and just swing and mash buttons and eventually the job will get done.\nIts a pity really because I was getting into the game itself but it just gets frustrating and unplayable.\nIt would be great if they ever revamped the series as it has the making of a good game, but unfortunately I think this game is long forgotten.\nIf u can pick it up cheap and have the patience of a saint when coming to control etc then I'd say you could do a lot worse.\nIf its a action adventure your looking for then give this a wide birth!\nSteam should put a star system as I'd give this game 2 to 2 and half stars out of 5, but can not recommend for most people.\n","April 25","false","4.8"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

The game just scales enemy's heath and decrease yours to a "glass state" (two hits kill). Play it on normal, and you will have a balanced chalenge.\n\nThis is a slow pace, first person thriller game. There are some readings, but nothing like a RPG.\n\nThe interactivity with objects is nicely done and, despite the limitation of the game's engine, the physics is realistic to the point of believability. For example, you lift, drag, pull objects with movements of your mouse.\n\nThe atmosphere transports you to a depressed world, somewhat like the first Silent Hill.\n\nRuns great in Ultrawide (2560 x 1080), Windows 10 (64bit).\n\nA must play to all hardcore single players fans of terror or suspense.","May 24","true","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
