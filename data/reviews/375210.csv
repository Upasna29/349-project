In fact only the movement feels like RPG maker, everything else feels uniquely done.\n\nFirst the menu/crafting system is very well done and only takes around a minute to fully understand how it operates and what possibilities are afforded from base elements.\nYou're also given contextual information about your surroundings as well as the direct type of material you are currently standing on (which can have it's own compromises)  Sand isn't good for growing plants and requires more energy to walk through.\n\nThe UI is minimalist and has an alert system which can notify you of things that should cause concern.  The temperature will wobble when it's getting too cold.  Your energy will oscillate depending on exertion.\n\nThe first "tutorial" is more an indication of the brutal trial that await you.  Essentially the "tutorial" doesn't tell you what you need to do, instead it robs you of ways to survive making you try new things to try and advance.  Let me give you a brief summary of my quick look.\n\nWhen I first set out, I died of thirst almost immediately.  On my second round, I managed to quickly make it to water and drink up.  I believe I actually could have succeeded on my first trip, but I didn't know that you had to climb the ledge to get to the town.\n\nOn my third round, I managed to survive the night.  On my fourth round I survived the night and the following day but then the water pool dried up completely, so I followed the dried up water basin to see if it would leave to a hidden passage.  It only lead to fruit that would hydrate me a bit.  So, essentially just increased the time between my death sentence.\n\nAt first I didn't like the "tutorial" because I felt it was being purposely obtuse, but then I remembered that one Simpsons episode when the Simpsons go to Japan and the Japanese game show host says, "In America, you reward intelligence.  In Japan, we punish ignorance."\n\nThis game is kind of like a Japanese game show","June 23, 2015","true","6.0"," 56 of 79 people (71%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","71","56","79","13","4"

It's a beautiful little gam: challenging, fun and peaceful, with enough content to do a decent job of holding off the inevitable triviality that survival games all must eventually fall prey to.\nThe audio is polished, and the overall look of the game is really impressive compared to other RPG Maker games I've seen.\n\nThe developer posts dev logs on YouTube very frequently and his enthusiasm for Unveil is contagious. You can tell not just from the weekly bugfixes and content patches, but from the little details just how much love and thought go into this game from its creator.\n\nOn the question of whether I can recommend it, I'd say 'yes', to those who enjoy early access games in general. At the moment, there's probably between 5 and 10 hours of content to Unveil, which to me justifies its asking price. However, supporting such an amazing developer is its own reward. Not to mention that going by the rate of updates since launch, the amount of content in Unveil is looking to increase drastically in the near future.","July 5, 2015","true","3.0"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

But don't let that fool you in thinking this is an easy game. You will die of hunger and thirst as quickly as a T-Rex coming at your face, so you really have to plan in advance and not just cluelessly wander around.\n\nFeel free to check out the first video in my Unveil series.

The game is no different. Find water first, then food, then worry about somewhere to sleep.\n\nThere's not a lot of handholding at all, which I adore, but it feels natural and logical. A superb start in Early Access, and I can't wait to see how this progresses and develops.\n\nWell done, Particle Studios!","June 23, 2015","true","0.9"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","15","25","0","0"

A team of 3 people (a single programmer, two music composers) creates something really great and offers on top of that absolutely great, reliable support. A few days ago I reported a bug which is apparently occurred in only a relatively few people. For days I had several e-mail contact, and together we went through a lot of tests to fix it daily with the developer. There's a lot of commitment behind what nowadays is wished and wanted of many indie developers and therefore you should support this with full force! :)\n\nJust visit the shop page and make sure to check it out. DO u know other games on Steam which were rated 100% (!) positive?\n\nSo come on, support the developers and spread the word. Such games need to be more popular and the developers needs to be rewarded for their very good work :)\n\n\nHallo zusammen,\n\nwenn ihr Lust auf und Interesse an wirklich guten Survivalspielen habt, nebenbei auch noch auf Retrografik steht, dann kann ich euch Unveil nur wärmstens ans Herz legen. Ein Team von 3 Leuten (ein einzelner programmiert, zwei musikkomponisten) schafft hier etwas wirklich Großartiges und bietet obendrein noch einen absolut tollen, zuverlässigen Support. Vor einigen Tagen habe ich einen Bug gemeldet, der scheinbar bei nur relativ wenigen Leuten aufgetreten ist. Tagelang hatte ich dann mehrmals täglich mit dem Entwickler Email-Kontakt und gemeinsam haben wir durch viele Tests den Fehler beheben können. Es steckt sehr viel Engagement dahinter, was man sich heutzutage von vielen Indie-Entwicklern wünscht und daher sollte man dies mit voller Kraft unterstützen! :)\n\nBesucht einfach mal die Shopseite und vergewissert euch. Kenn ihr noch andere Spiele, die zu 100% (!) positiv bewertet wurden?\n\nHelf mit, damit solche Spiele bekannt werden und die Entwickler für ihre sehr gute Arbeit belohnt werden :)","August 3, 2015","true","6.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Plus, it's preety, if you like that kind of graphics, and that, in my opinion increible, music.\nBut more important, it works. No weird physics, no super-fast dehydration rate... You actually can stop for a second, and enjoy... well, whatever you want. And it's funny! For almost everyone who buys it!

It gives you a good tutorial but i do wish it did a step by step process but i still love the game. It does have very small and few bugs like it freezes every now and then but it's mostly my computer.\n\nFood is very scarce and i have yet to find any animals but its a game in progress so i tell you its not a waste of money and its nessary.","April 9","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For the little time I played though I did enjoy it. I hope they will work someday to redo this game in a better engine or make an engine of their on, I would give it another go then.\nI do recommend to test out the game wether it works on your machine, I hear it works fine for some people.","May 1","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
