It's far from being scary, monsters are walking on set paths (sometimes they magically teleport and reappear - I guess it was developer's only idea how to scare a player). Overall, I had this feeling that I've already played this game and that I was doing my second walkthrough. Nothing could surprise me, mazes were simple, puzzles were... wait, what puzzles? Even the voiceacting was irritating for me, but that's of second importance.\nAt least I got this game for free, otherwise it would be a waste of money.

Anyway, as a stand-alone it's clearly much longer and fleshed out than the first two chapters. This one alone takes roughly 2-3 hours to clear. Where the first two chapters had a gothic/medieval feel to them, this one is more like a modern horror tale, with a crazy doctor and twisted abominations included. Nothing that out of the ordinary, just a compendium of classic western horror approaches. Gone are the Lovecraftian touches.\n\nOn the graphics side, things remain as good as the original but performance took a huge nose dive. Unity Engine is clearly not well-documented or its lighting sources are just massive resource hogs compared to, say, Unreal Engine games. Even in the lowest settings you are still bound to get some FPS dips.\n\nA little annoying "feature" or bug is that even if you do pause the game, the game isn't paused at all and you are at the mercy of the monsters that roam within, which doesn't help because the pace is all over the place: you have very few moments of tranquility compared to the original release and you get to suffer an extremely boring sewer section that's extremely repetitive.\n\nThe most interesting mechanic is unfortunately introduced towards the end: a flashback that shows you things from the past but will eventually lead to the climax of the game, one final "battle" that's extremely well done in its tension/frenzy but that, sadly, doesn't lead to anything. The game just ends, not even a final speech. Simply because this is chapter 3 and we are still missing a fourth. There is a spoiler-free FAQ in the community section so at least scaredy cats can now some of what's coming but not all, heh.\n\nIt's a shame, the game is a glimpse of something that could've been so much more but a lot of constraints and situations affected the final result. STILL, it's worth giving a shot.","December 28, 2014","true","3.6"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","0"

As I said in my review for the beginning of the series, these games are not properly optimized and this time I had to play at a maximum 13FPS, which is not feasible, especially in the last part (maze with map) where you have to be fast - which is also the part where I ragequit.\n\nI also found myself stuck a couple of time while trying to activate a lever and run out of the gate.. game was not accepting any input, so I had to shut it down and restart; hopefully the "map section" has a saving feature of its own, different from the one in entire game, so I had to explore the maze once again but my progress was not completely lost.\n\nWhat else to add? I honestly preferred bosses in the previous chapters, rather than running from ghosts chasing you all the time; felt like a downgrade, not an improvement.","November 1, 2015","false","9.5"," 27 of 38 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","27","38","2","0"

I found the first installment of the series disturbing in both atmosphere and story. I'm happy to say that Doorways: The Underworld is a superb follow-up in the series.\n\nThe developers have really progressed the story within The Underworld, although this time around instead of dealing with multiple serial killers, the game deals with just one and her many tortured subjects. Tortured subjects who will chase you throughout the variety of presented levels; such as caverns, sewers and even an abandoned hospital.\n\nThe atmosphere is even creepier and more haunting in this third chapter than it was in the first two chapters combined. The ambient use of lighting along with striking, contrasting color schemes cause the vivid environment to really pop out at the player. The soundtrack, on the other hand, isn't much to write home about; it's mostly just soft sounds that lay under sound effects like foot steps and echoes.\n\nThe puzzles are key to progressing through the game, and up until the final puzzle they are rather easy. Go here, get this key, go back, unlock that door, get the next item you need, rinse and repeat. However, the final two mazes may present themselves as too challenging for some players. For myself, it took me a handful of attempts to finally get it down and it was fun the entire time.\n\nMy only big complaint with this title is the poor optimization. At some points, the game caps itself at 30 FPS, while at other points it will be anywhere from 60-80 FPS. It causes the FPS to drastically jump around throughout the game play. I played on the highest graphics settings, and eventually turned off special effects such as depth of field and it did not help the constantly fluctuating FPS. On my rig (specs in profile), this is completely unacceptable when games like GTAV run at a stable 60 FPS.\n\nThe Underworld lasts roughly 3 hours and has only a minimal replayability factor. So I suggest picking this title up on sale if you can. It's a welcome entry in the Doorways universe, and it will leave you on a cliffhanger, waiting desperately for Chapter 4 to come out of Early Access.\n\nRating:  4.5/5.0 - Excellent, highly worth playing.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","October 31, 2015","true","2.9"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","13","15","2","0"

It just seems very uninspired as you spend a lot of times in caves, sewers and some kind of lab. That in itself wouldn't be a problem if the gameplay was good, but it really overstays its welcome.\nThe first episodes were extremely short, but somewhat entertaining. The Underworld, on the other hand, recycles exactly the same kind of sequence four times in a row before you reach the end, which is just annoying. The same thing happens somewhere at the beginning, where the same kind of riddle appears twice in a row, which is completely uneccessary.\n\nIt's really sad, since the beginning seemed promising. But the atmosphere suffers from too much repetition.\nIn the end, I wouldn't rate it higher or lower than the first episodes. It's better in some regards, but worse in others. Might be nice for horror-fans, but could have been better.\n\nI really hope the final episode delivers a tighter, but scarier experience.","September 17, 2014","true","4.9"," 25 of 40 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","25","40","0","0"

If you were a fan of the first two chapters of Doorways, prepare to be surprised...sorta.\n\nFrom the offset it's got the same atmosphere, the same tension running throughout that made the first chapters stand out. Alongside this it has more traditional horror moments, putting this game somewhere between Chapter Two and Amnesia: Dark Descent in terms of play. Throw in some slightly more natural, less force-scripted, dialogue from Thomas Foster (that's YOU) and you're onto a winner.\n\nBut, the game does take a turn for the worst in the puzzle repetition. While the first real set of puzzles are basically split in two and repeated, it's forgiveable as the experience is new for the game (you'll know what I mean when you play it) and tense throughout. It's a constant threat, or it feels like it. But the second puzzle feels more lax and easier - just repetition without the fearful tension to make it ignorable.\nSadly this isn't just a one-off. I've not completely finished the story yet (couldn't find a certain something...), but what I assume to be the final puzzle/area is another case of repetition. I personally found this one the worst, as it had no tension and became a total grind of finding things and trying to figure out what to do with very little actual indication. I spent 50 minutes solid running around this bit pointlessly...without revealing too much, except puzzle initials, I hated the X-R bit.\n\nBut still, it's a solid game and so far it stands up. The price is arguably a bit steep, I completely agree, but this game is still damn good. It's enjoyable and it has a good share of spooks and jumps. I do not regret my choice of buying this.\n\n\nIf you want to look for yourself, here's a playthrough of the first part of the chapter with more following imminently.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE2W-4q1ot4","September 18, 2014","true","6.0"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

It's kind of similar to a slightly inferior version of Outlast.  You play the "prey" instead of the "predator" as you are chased by monsters through creepy environments.  The concept behind the game is fine, and it has some good music as well as significant visuals.  The main issue is that it's extremely simplistic.  The character you play really doesn't have many choices to make.  There's either "the right way or the wrong way."  The main optional portions of the game are the little "treasure hunts" for relics, which just require you to have a keen eye and wander off the beaten path a bit.\n\nThe storyline is very comparable to many games from the past, and the maps aren't exceptionally large.  Doorways Underworld is decent, but it's kind of short.  I was able to complete it in 3 to 4 hours.  The current price is $10, which I feel is suitable.  I certainly wouldn't be able to recommend it for $40, but I think it would be a steal at $5.\n\nNot a bad first attempt for Argentine game developers.

Its a dark game with scarce lighting and I think I know why your predecessors went missing; neither one brought a gun for a flashlight, because you have neither. That's only because you or your agency have the ability to jump into the mind and body of a killer and switch places. That's just what the game tells you with a heavy tone, but the reality is you're stuck in narrow, cluster phobic corridors with one monster at a time that will chase you.\n\nHorror is more than just startles and a dark atmosphere; Doorways: The Underworld knows this. There are several situations beyond horror game tropes. Sure there are startling moments, but there are also moments of dread where you need to hide. Flavor texts that paint a sickening picture of limbless torsos, feces, flies and someone still managing to live in it. There is even a surgery that you can witness. The bulk of the game is still tight linear passageways with no fear of foes.\n\nIts a dark game, but there is a punctuation of light that will get your attention at the end of hallways. Sometimes it can be tough to navigate, but the darkest parts are the briefest. The ambiance is first set in a series of underground tunnels with lights that flicker, hang and shake. You find sheets of flavor text scattered around, some of which your character will read aloud. These sheets can have codes while others are there just to horrify you. These sheets are usually over the top of a valuable item like a key or a valve that you'll need later. Everything you can interact with glows so its easy to find in the darkness.\n\nThen you'll take the key or valve to where it needs to be, open the menu, select items or instantly open to your items, select the item, and use it on whatever is glowing. Its a bit cumbersome, but its designed to have a monster charging after you and there are only a few seconds left, will you make it? Come on! Hurry! What's that I need to push a different button to use the item than the trigger? Smashed. You'll get used to it.\n\nThese monsters look good and fit the atmosphere, they each have glowing eyes so you can see them better in the dark, but you'll know when they're around. The ground will shake, your view will tussle around and any hanging lights will shift. Its a good effect and it helps when you're hiding, because you'll know when they've left.\n\nYour only recourse when you encounter something is to hide. Again, no guns, no slamming a gate down to save yourself. The first level's monster encounter is more of a linear chase where you need to duck in dark corners you've walked by before there was no monster. You can duck behind desks and this monster will find you even when its facing away. Perhaps it can smell you.\n\nThe second monster patrols a series of tunnels and you'll need to duck and hide in sewer pipes or let it chase you in circles. These sections feel far too long having to scour an area looking for two valves. Dodging the monster turns into a routine rather than horrifying. Each monster encounter will crescendo with a chase scene where the pressure is on to escape harm's way. By chase scene, I mean you turn and run, even if there's no run button in the game. In fact there's a walk slower button.\n\nYou'll find a helmet light at some point to guide the way, so then its odd the second monster will walk right past a shining light emitting from a sewer pipe. Other times your character chooses to turn it off in some of the worst moments such as when you're platforming in the dark over toxic waste. The waste could be so toxic that it burns out lights, but then after the section he turns the light back on.\n\nThis section of walking on dark fences and scaffolds over green glowing waste turns into an issue. There are narrow boards you'll need to walk across and at some point you'll be leaping over gaps in the scaffolding's fence floor. You can take a splash of waste, but stay in for a second or two and you're done.\n\nEach death reloads the last frequent checkpoint. Its an efficient load time for a game that has somewhat long loads between levels. A game that looks this good has to take time. The game looks great with dynamic lighting, but it could perform smoother. The second level seems much smoother compared to the first, but there's no dynamic lighting like the first level.\n\nThe third level puts you in an underground bunker's medical facility where you get the power to see other worldly things. You find a pair of human feet on a gurney and that means its time to switch your vision to see a doctor working on an unconscious man. Its good when horror games take the time to model and animate something more than a single monster. The animation is well done and someone should be proud of their efforts for a horror game. Seeing one foe fight against a crushing wall was devilish fun.\n\nFor a lot of the game, there is no map outside of what you'll find on a wall. Much later into your journey, you'll get a grid to make a map as you move through a maze. Its helpful, but could have been more useful earlier on.\n\nAs a paranormal investigator, its tough to say that you're investigating anything. You're diving through sewers, swimming through pipes and dodging monsters while you collect sheets of paper on a linear path. Its a good facade on a game that excels in a genre full of cheap uninspiring games.\n\nI suppose the biggest issue that I have with the game is the non ending that it gives. I worked my way through a sometimes frustrating lost in the dark game, only to get capped off with "End of chapter 3. Thanks for playing!" No game thank you for showing me that behind your great graphics, you're still just a cheap game. Games are always about the experience and the journey or fun of getting to the end.\n\nEnd of review.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/recommended/311250/","altered_confusion","Altered_Confusion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/","289 products in account","Doorways: The Underworld, is the third chapter of what can only be called a psychological thriller, by Saibot Studios. This is the kind of game that if you like playing games in the dark, you are going to want to turn a light on. You are a man who can journey into the psyches of others, most of them VERY deranged, and twisted. In this chapter you will be trying to chase down a female doctor who has done unmentionable horrors to her victims. Now of course once you go down this rabbit hole, its only going to get more twisted, violent and dangerous.\n\nGraphically this game definitely immerses the player in the different environments. It could be sewers, it could be a hospital, it could be other locations. The thing is that all of these environments builds on the horror, and anticipation of what might happen next. I will admit there were a couple of times where the highlighting feature, this is the piece that will tell you if you can interact with an object or not, was hit or miss. Sometimes I would have to move just right for the highlight to take effect, which in turn had to be on for you to pick up an object, or open a door. When it comes to horror type games a huge factor from the art perspective is lighting, or lack there of. The designer knew how to work this aspect, and allowed for the terror to build. There's nothing like a flashlight blinking on and off, causing you to wonder if you are about to be plunged into complete darkness.\n\nThe sounds of the game are yet another feature to the game that will definitely add to the dread, and fear that this game sets out to cause you. I HIGHLY recommend wearing headphones to catch the light whispers of the wind. You will also get to hear your own foot steps, creaks, and other sounds that make you feel isolated, alone, and of course gives you that sense of foreboding as you know there's something that's going to happen if you relax just a bit.\n\nThe controls in the game are you standard affair when it comes to first person games. You are going to be using WASD to move, and the mouse to look around and of course interact with objects.\n\nSpeaking of interacting, I think the one thing that definitely took a while to get used to was the in game inventory system. There was of course the inventory that held items that you could use in game. There was also a journal of sorts that kept track of all the papers and other bits of reading material you might have found along the way. For some reason it was a ♥♥♥♥♥ to get it open, now of course the vast majority of the game you will never need to use either of those systems, but it was strange for a game that seemed to have so much of it together that this was the one piece that didn't quite fit.\n\nAlright so you are going into uncharted territory, and you are trying to find all the demons and truths that are hidden, through this doorway into the mind. I have to say that the fear factor in this game, though not the hack you constantly up into pieces fear, definitely makes you wonder if jumping into people's minds is that good of an idea. I will say this though, you will earn your way through each area that you will navigate through, and if you survive, perhaps you will find some answers, or maybe there will be more questions.\n\nThere are not a lot of enemies you have to look out for, but if there's an enemy to look out for, you better be beyond careful because once they see you, you might not get to see much more besides your death. This of course adds a bit of a stealth piece to the game, but its definitely not a huge part of the game, its more of a common sense deal. If you see a bad guy in real life, you don't want to draw attention to yourself, so why would you want to do that in game. My all time favorite/worst nightmare has to be The Queen of Sorrow. I'm not going to tell you when or where you will meet this lovely individual, just now that you better have some room to run. Too many times did I find myself facing a dead end and her breathing down my neck right before she took care of me, permanently.\n\nI'm going to be honest, if you are not a horror fan, and if you have trouble with sleeping after watching or playing these types of games, this is DEFINITELY NOT FOR YOU, but if you are willing to take a risk, and maybe a clean pair of pants on a this ride, you are going to find a pretty solid game throughout, and one that you want to keep playing. The thing is I don't know if its because you are drawn into what the game has to offer, or if you just want to see the end to this nightmare. Either way you are looking at a solid game that should be a part of your gaming library. This game gets a 9.2 out of 10.","October 9, 2014","true","2.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Well, if you're gonna buy this game, you'd best get used to it.\n\nIn Doorways: The Underworld you play the single most hysteria-prone supernatural-investigator-of-evil-people's-minds that you will ever meet.  Even after being chased down narrow, bendy, all-but-completely-dark tunnels by ♥♥♥♥ed-up dudes who look like they just stepped out of a Clive Barker novel, he's still prone to jump-scaring HIMSELF with the comparatively mild sight of a clean-picked skeleton or two.  Seriously, the guy is kinda crazy:  He talks to himself persistently, asking more silly questions than a six year-old child being raised in an Eastern European brothel, and they're all completely rhetorical because apart from the odd tortured, animalistic guy with a wheel in place of a pair of legs, HE'S ALL ALONE.\n\nI mean, if the first sign of madness is talking to oneself, then the second must surely be skulking about in unfeasibly dark places when you're as unsuited to scaring yourself as an incontinent schoolgirl with a rare heart condition.  This game's approach to scares brings two words to mind:  "Heavy" and "handed".  In roughly that order.  Having said that, it IS quite genuinely scary at times, almost in spite of itself.\n\nProceedings get off to a particularly poor start, in any case, with a sub-Amnesia style bit which succeeds neither as "stealth" nor "pursuit", and yet BOTH are integral to getting through it.  It's a bit trial-and-error to say the least, and I for one nearly gave up on the game there and then, not even ten minutes in.  Fortunately things DO get better from there - at least until the heavily glitch-ridden finale - and there's actually quite a lot of really good stuff in this game if you stick with it.  I certainly wouldn't recommend it, however, to anyone just "discovering" the horror genre for the first time.  There's every chance you'll just throw in the towel with frustration, and never bother playing another horror game for as long as you live.\n\nThe first Doorways game (Doorways: Prelude) somehow turned minimal mechanics and an almost total lack of regular, mobile "enemies" into a strangely compelling and satisfying experience.  Somehow, by adding more typical gaming mechanics, this second entry has done itself a bit of a disservice.  With a bit of luck I'll find that by the third and final game in the series, the devs have ironed things out a bit, and consolidated the best aspects of the first and second game into some kind of harmonious whole.  I have faith:  Saibot Studios are far from stoopid or untalented, they just need to give themselves a bit of a kick in the ♥♥♥♥ from time to time.\n\nVerdict:  8/10.\n\n(PS Nice little "homages" to Outlast and Penumbra in the sewer section.  You'll know what I mean when you see them, BELIEVE ME!!!)","January 24","true","3.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","6","7","3","0"

Chapter 3 starts off just as strong! The scares were decent, the atmosphere was nice. This chapter features a lot of chase sequences, like the room with the giant statue in chapter 2. The first two with the first "monster" are really cool. The game has a very unique way of showing you help messages instead of using pop-up dialogue boxes, which is really cool. It adds to the stress of running away from the "monster". The story is pretty standard of this series, and the recap at the beginning of the chapter clears up some of the questions from the first 2. What confuses me, though, is in chapter 1 the main character barely remembers anything about what's going on, and now he seems to know exactly what is going on. Just weird, not a huge problem.\n\nThe game changes with the second set of chases, however, and instead of being kind of fun and a little creepy, just becomes tedious. You are basically in a big semi-maze, and you have to collect a key from one part of the maze to get an item that you need in another part of the maze to get through the end of the maze. (I don't want to spoil the whole thing, that's why I'm being so vague.) Essentially, this boils down to running around boring cave hallways, finding a key, running back to open a door, going through that door, getting an item, running back to the place to use the item, just to go find a different key and do it again. It's monotonous, and the "monster" chasing you during this time could have been cool if you didn't spend so much time doing everything. It's so tedious that it stops being scary 5 minutes into this section.\n\nI didn't finish the chapter because of the section after that. The game just released, so I will go back to it eventually, but I'll explain why I didn't finish. The puzzle is either completely unfair and stupid, or I was missing something from the low brightness or my own stupidity. You have to arrange x-rays in a specific order, but where you find that order I have no clue. I ran back and forth through this part of the level about 10 times, not finding anything new. I had a frozen key to a door, but there was nothing to melt it out. There's a door that's locked with a numpad, but I didn't find a single clue to help open the door except for maybe some gibberish note on the wall that I couldn't make heads or tails of. Eventually, I got frustrated and ran around holding the frozen key, I jumped down a staircase, and one of the rooms was pitch black. I thought maybe I did something to trigger a change in the environment, so I stepped into the room. As I stepped in, I noticed some lights above me, and I looked up as I realized I was falling through the game. Somehow, the room had shifted upwards while the rest of the level stayed at the same position. This resulted in my continuous spawning underneath the level. I couldn't even access the menu to quit the game properly, because the menu appears sort of as part of the level I guess. I had to force quit the game.\n\nAll-in-all, the game starts out as good as the rest of the series, then quickly descends into monotony and poorly designed puzzles. Maybe the ending of the chapter would redeem this, but I won't know anytime soon. I wouldn't be too mad if I had paid $3, but for $7 this was really disappointing.","September 17, 2014","false","1.2"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","2"

Loved Doorways 1&2 so obviously got this one. Being someone who is terrified of horror but can't stop playing them it had a few good jump scares in there to get my heart racing. But that was about it.\n\nPro's - Boss type characters that you have to avoid whilst working out puzzles\nOccasional Jump Scares\nAtmospheric music / sounds\nA lot easier to follow than the first two Doorways and more interesting, possibly due to the addition of more boss type characters.\n\nCon's - Puzzles get very repetitive very quickly. Currently given up playing it due to the very last maze where it took me over 30 hours to use flash back (slows time) which materialises the boss infront of you - in order to get to a timed switch only to realise I had to do the same thing AGAIN afterwards on a larger scale. No thanks!\nWasted opportunity for further jump scares. When the head lamp flickers / under water.\n\nOver all enjoyed it greatly until the very end. Looking forward to the next installment in the series. All places played in this time felt very similar, dark dank caves. The hospital could of been expanded on greatly and used for great scare tactics. Also hoping for a larger range of puzzles, not the same ones repeated on bigger scales.","September 29, 2014","true","5.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I understand it's a low budget horror game released back in 2013. My review takes those facts into consideration. I understand a negative review might offend some fans of the game - it has mostly positive feedback. For those offended - deal with it.\n\nDoorways isn't a horrible game by itself. And by horrible I mean Revelations 2012, which is worth buying if only to watch the dancing Mayans on the title screen (seriously, just search it on youtube). Neither it's broken like Day One: Garry's Incident.\n\nSadly, it isn't a good game either. I was sceptical already once I read the title of the 4th chapter (Holy Mountains of Flesh) - cheesy, cheap and pretentious. Then I decided to give the game a chance.\n\nAs I said, recycled assets and bad textures can be justified by the budget of the game. But lack of creativity and talent cannot. The game's writing, as the title of the 4th chapter is bad. It's so bad it could have been a fan-fiction written by that weird kid from middle school with an abusive father and an alcoholic mother. The one who likes torturing stray dogs. Get the picture? The main character acts like a little ♥♥♥♥♥ - it's like the game is trying to convince me I'm in a scary situation every once the character drops the J-bomb.\n\nThing is, the game is trying to convince me it is something it actually isn't. It is not scary. At all. It's just a dark game with repetitive gameplay, with a couple of cheap jump scares now and then.\n\nAnd that is not what makes an enjoyable horror game.","November 8, 2015","false","1.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

However, the time trials area after the hospital interrupted the flow and became tedious very quickly. Time trials themselves are not necessarily bad, but for a game that relies on psychological horror, they need to be used only a few times at most, and making them too difficult and too overcomplicated only leads to frustrating the player and ruining the carefully crafted atmosphere that made Doorways popular.\n\nCase in point: After exiting the operating theater, you end up in mazelike corridors with a map and the flashback ability. You now have to do time trials where you need to hit the lever and run back to a doorway and go through before the timer runs out. Now, while it started out somewhat challenging, it wasn't too difficult or complicated. It worked with the atmosphere alright, and if it had stopped here, I'd be giving a more positive review.\n\nNo, first, the map was purposefully made to be useless. You cannot run with the map in a readable position, so running to beat a seemingly endless stream of time trials meant running through confusing mazes on memory. But the big mistake here was trying to combine the Flashback ability with the time trials. Flashback slows down time, which is absolutely necessary for the later time trials. However, it also summons the monster, which appears very nearby, with the possibility of appearing on any side of the player, including right in front of them.\n\nSo, how do you time it so the monster doesn't instantly kill you? Is it based on where you stand? Maybe, but when you've got a ridiculous time limit to meet, a map you can't use, and a constant need to keep reactivating flashback, beating the time limit and escaping the monster becomes pure luck. As I've already said, they threw way too many mechanics together at once in these trials, which only made the problem of the game having too many time trials already worse. The atmosphere that Doorways relies on was runined.\n\nI understand that challenge is important in a game, and the team tried to do something new and challenging with the time trials, but they don't fit with the atmosphere of the game, and honestly if the developers had given a skip button for the time trials, I would've gotten a greater feeling of satisfaction from clicking that button than I would've gotten from actually beating the time trials for real. That's the point where challenging becomes tedious, which doesn't belong in any game, Doorways especially.\n\nAnyway, the first few levels might make fans of the series happy, but once the time trials start, the game as a whole is likely going to turn into a disappointment for them.","September 27, 2014","false","3.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Although the hospital segment is excellent, it is by far the shortest part, and doesn’t make up for the huge shortcomings presented everywhere else: the whole game is nothing but running constantly from one end of a maze (including an infuriatingly tedious timed rat maze) to the other, while being chased by some invulnerable monster. It’s like Amnesia done wrong, really wrong.\n\nThe tone is different as well. The protagonist constantly yells and whines, which is in stark contrast with the previous chapters. The voice acting is still enjoyable, but even that cannot help much with the new “dialogue”.\n\nIf you liked the first game, wait until Chapter 4 is released, maybe it will redeem the series.","April 15, 2015","false","3.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

If you like horror games, you should check it out.  /plug.  Full disclosure, I was given a review copy of Underworld and my achievements didn't work in the game.\n\nDoorways: The Underworld is the latest chapter in the Doorways saga from Saibot Studios.  It can be played as part of the Doorways saga, or as a stand-alone title.  If you want to pick up this game after this review and are concerned about missing something, you can check out last year’s hands-on playthrough of the first two episodes.   I didn’t play the first two chapters, but since The Underworld is supposed to be able to stand on its own, it should be treated as such.\n\nThe basic gist of the story is that you are a Doorways agent, sent after a psychotic killer that other agents couldn’t handle.  You’ve seen the worst of the worst and you, and only you alone can catch them.  To find them, you will use psychic abilities and see through their eyes.  Underworld tasks you with hunting down a demented doctor, performing gruesome experiments on human patients.  I’ll discuss more on the story a little later.\n\nI will give credit where it is due – Doorways does some things pretty well, however in each of those instances it also shoots itself in the foot and slits its own throat.  It’s as if Saibot was on course to deliver a great game, but they overshot the runway and made a crash landing.  The wreckage could still be considered a horror game, but probably not the best iteration of one.\n\nThe game is decent enough to look at .  It’s dark, and when combined with its sound and voice acting, really sells that feeling of dread and fear that horror fans pine for.  The game is a little too dark unfortunately, and I had to crank up the brightness settings just so I could see where I was going. This caused me to see that there was a lot of stuff in the environment, but it didn’t really do anything.  Some papers to find, but nothing else. I have to mention that you don’t have any hands or arms here – items just sort of float in front of you and instead of a flashlight, you have a headlamp.  I see that neither as a pro or a con, I’d rather have floating items than poorly animated arms flailing in front of me (no one does arms and hands right).  But to have an environment with so much stuff, yet is still so empty, is kind of a downer.\n\nImmediately noticeable when I first fired the game up was that it used sound effectively to – again – sell that feeling of dread.  However my feelings towards it turned from admiration to admonition by the time the first level as over.  That’s about how long it took for me to discover that the ambient audio doesn’t really match with what’s happening onscreen.  And while each level’s audio is different, there’s a defined loop in each level, and it all sounds the same.  There are certain peaks in the audio, where the intention must have been to send chills down your spine and make you think something was about to happen, but it never does.  There’s that slow build-up, but no payoff.  Even the voice-acting, as well done as it is, sounds a little ham fisted at times.\n\nThe game is a horror puzzler, but the puzzles consist of little more than irritating key searches.  A good key search never hurt anyone, but not if that’s all that it is.  The game is devoid of combat, so you’re forced to rely on stealth at certain times. I foolishly believed that this meant the game was devoid of enemies entirely, leading me to charge headfirst into the first enemy I saw and die rather hilariously.  I thought it was a hallucination.  Player idiocy aside, gameplay amounts to little more than these key searches, and hiding from that one enemy in each level.  It’s padded out by making you traipse across the level once or twice before you find a paper or something that details that level’s enemy, then you go back to trek across the level again (because the key you have is for a door/lever/switch on the opposite side of the level) and SURPRISE! That enemy is now lurking in the hallways!\n\nOnce you use that key you’ve got, you may have to go back and find another one, or it’s time for a chase sequence!   The first chase sequence that I experienced, I thought was really well done, but I was significantly less enthused the more I saw it repeated.  If the enemy catches you, a little cutscene plays without much other fanfare.  You’re killed instantly, which is sad, because I wanted to see more of these enemies.\n\nDoorways has some good ideas, but they just don’t seem to be used to their potential.  Those psychic abilities?  Might as well be non-existent, I still don’t even know how they’re supposed to work, actually.  The story?  I mentioned that I would speak more on it, but there’s nothing more to say.  No exposition provided as to who you are and why you’re doing this, who the doctor is and why she’s doing this, nothing outside of a piece of paper.\n\nThe final nail in Doorways’ coffin is that there’s nothing in the game that makes you want to keep playing it.  There’s no pull to make you keep trudging down those dark hallways, it made playing the game a chore.  To rub salt in the wound, the whole thing culminates in a long chase sequence with one of the most unsatisfying endings I’ve ever seen.  Credits roll.  That’s it – not even so much as a heave and a sigh to say that it’s over.  Is it?  I don’t know.\n\nCheck out www.relyonhorror.com for more reviews and news on horror games!","September 22, 2014","false","1.5"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

It\nis split into two parts;  Puzzles, which I found more to be of a scavenger\nquests that send you in endless repetitive loops, and the horror element,\nwhich is completely lacking in its ability to invoke psychological\nscariness.  It is more like a simulation of a coal miner than a horror game.\nIf you are a child, or make it a point to avoid horror games, number one; why\nare you playing this game, and two;  this game might scare you.   Maybe.\nThe bare bones story element will leave you wondering why you are wandering around\nthese caves in the first place.\n\nThis game doesn't respect your time.  The puzzles are simplistic, and\nthe graphics are basic, and it is most definitely NOT horrific.

It fails.  It fails because they took one idea and used it repeatedly throughout the game with hardly any deviation from it, just let me explain.(slight rant before actual review just skip on down to read review if you want)  Now you will see tons of oh yes buy this game omg its 10000000/10 because we spent money on it and want to feel good about ourselves and convince others which will help convince us the people who bought the game that it was better than just mediocre.  In your heart of hearts this game is just ok and you know it.\n\nNow onto the actual reviewing of the game.  THERE WILL BE SPOILERS FOR REVIEW PURPOSES TO MAKE POINTS AND SUCH YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!\n\n\n\nLet me say that I love the design of most of the monsters in this game I think they were very well thought out.  The level design on the other hand is very linear and boring in most parts.\n\nAREA 1  Cave\n\nYou're in some kind of underground man made cave with lots of cells that people were kept in to experiement on they are mostly empty and when you walk into some of them you hear noises or have other effects happen that add to the atomsphere and the main character will say allot of things about the stuff going on around him at first and then as the game progresses he becomes the silent besides some letter reading but he doesn't even read all the letters either which is wierd.\n\nYou walk down narrow hallways until you unlock the door releasing the monster who then will walk up and down the narrow hallways looking for you. The "hide" mechanic is kinda silly as in there are tiny alcoves in the walls that you just walk into and the monster magically won't see you oh and 1 table that you can hide behind.  You run past the monster to the next area and repeat the hiding to get past him once again until you get a chase scene of him behind you and you running in even more narrow hallways until you fall into a hole. End area.\n\nAREA 2  The sewer\n\nYou wake up in the hole and find yourself surrounded by skeletons and find a flashlight helmet to put on to let you see and travel until you reach a sewer area....yes a sewer area.  Here it starts getting tedious very very tedious.  I will explain in a very short manner what this area consists of.  You find keys and valves.  after you open a door or get a valve to add some water to a drainage pit so you can swim to find more keys and valves and do the same thing over and over again and instead of unlocking the monster as you did in the first area this one just magically shows up and walks around while you have drainage pipes to hid in like mario.  This formula happens twice find valves/keys dodge monster.  At the end you get chased by the monster again and run until you reach area 3.  See a pattern yet?\n\n\nAREA 3  The lab\n\nThis area is probably my favorite it has allot of good atmosphere and I like the level design.  The lab has you find keys but then finally adds something to the mix to change up the game a little bit.  You find a stopwatch on a necklace chain that let's you go into the past of the Crazy neurosurgeon lady who is the main villain of this game.  it lasts for like 10-15 seconds I think and will change big to small parts of the level to let you into areas that would otherwise be innacessible.  I really liked this at first.....  A couple of puzzles later and you end up in the last area.\n\nAREA 4 The maze\n\nI hate this area it is so tedious and all scare facter goes away after dying repeatedly and turns into frustration very quickly.  The objective is you find a switch you flick it you run to the open door before the timer runs out and you repeat this 4 times!  The first 2 times is easy and they give you plenty of time.  After awhile you find out you have to use the stopwatch to go into her memories to slow time down enough to make it to the combination of switches in time.  neat mechanic right?  The problem is this area is a maze and the hallways are narrow and when you flick the stopwatch the monster neurosurgeon lady shows up to chase you only while the stopwatch is active scary right?  No annoying as hell!\nIt is creepy at first but she almost always appears right in front of you even though when you die it says she won't and most of the switches are at dead ends so unless you time it right or get lucky she will kill you after you hit the switch.  In the last area of the maze you get a map that fills out as you explore this area but still never deviates from find the switch to the other switch and flick them before time runs out to open a huge sliding wall door only this time you have to use the stopwatch to get to the other switches in time and after awhile the stopwatch gets stuck and you never leave her past.\nThen at the end she takes the watch off of you crushes it and chases you again in narrow hallways where you have to flick switches while running from her and hit buttons to open doors.   At the end of the chase scene you hit 2 buttons the monster gets smashed and you walk through some fire area to a elevator where the screen turns black and says YOU HAVE COMPLETED CHAPTER 3 CONGRATULATIONS!  That's it.\n\nWhile being longer than the first 2 chapters this game is extremely repetitive and hardly deviates from what makes it repetitive  it turns from creepy to frustratingly annoying most of the time saibot did poorly in my opinion and it should not have taken this long to get a 3 hour copy paste level set-up with very minor differences in it out.  I hope they read this and make chapter 4 worth actually getting because they have a good idea here but can't seem to get it right.  I give this expansion to the game 4/10.","September 28, 2014","false","2.8"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","1"

I didn't clock up a whole lot of time for a few reasons:\n1. Awful hard to be immersive when random segments of walls or crates get replaced with placeholder textures or noise.\n2. No real element of why you are doing anything related to what you are doing.\n\nThe first could be a linux thing, lots of devs are still figuring this out but the second was rather bothersome. You are plunked down into... something, and given a few thin plotline possibilities and pretty much have to make something of it. Honestly, the game feels like a demo the whole time as the levels are sparse and lacking in detail. Like there was supposed to be so much more but someone just went 'meh, close enough, box it up'. The voice acting is quite good, and the writing on what little plot there is seems like it could be interesting but the whole thing just felt like running through an empty level that hadn't been populated yet. Also, if you are going to have hanging skeletons and try to make it a big thing in an area, maybe have some sort of collision with them, or a sound and pre-defined animation?","June 9, 2015","false","0.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

After firing it up, the game fails to run..hangs solid when you move the mouse.  Now the company responsible for making this trash tells me "oh we can't make it work on Linux and we added a line to the page to say so."\n\nThis is irresponsible and dishonest.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KrustiClawn/recommended/311250/","KrustiClawn","Krusti Clawn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KrustiClawn/","102 products in account","This review may contain spoilers.\n\nPositives:\n\n- Scary moments\n- Intresting story\n- Creative features\n\nNegatives:\n\n- The story line is too obvious\n- Repetitive gameplay\n- Bad graphics\n- Bad monsters (read further down)\n- Short\n\n\nI thought the first two chapters were decent. I didn't love them, but it was a pretty nice experience. I saw the pictures and trailers and though that this chapter looked even better and was excited to finally see some real monsters in the game. But in the end, it feels like the developers took a step back.\n\n\nStory:\n\nI liked the story. Classic psycopat, torturing victims, doing experiments and so on. I like that kind of story, and in all honestly, it was pretty well written with a great choice of voice actor, but the story was kind of there already.\n\nI read the first 3 notes and I knew pretty much exactly what the story was going to be about. I have played games with such complex stories, so, even after playing them twice, I still don't know everything about the game. It took me around ten minutes to figure out what this game is about. It's way too obvious what the antagonist is up to and what you should expect ahead.\n\nLevel design:\n\nHonestly, the design is bad. The graphics looks like Penumbra. Don't get me wrong, Penumbra is a great game, but I expect something better at the year of 2014.\n\nIt looks like you put very little effort to the levels, because every map look pretty much the same. The sewer map for instance. It looks like you made a tunnel and then copied it over and over again. Not only does it look like you are guys are lazy, but it makes it confusing. I probably ran through the same tunnels three times or so because I didn't know if I had been there already or not.\n\nGameplay:\n\nI like the animations when you use and pick up items. You don't just select an item, use it on something and it disappears out of nowhere, it actually looks like you really use the item, which gives it a more realistic feeling.\n\nAlthough, the game in general is so repetitive. First map - find keys. Second map - find keys and valves. Second part of the second map - find more keys and valves. Third map - find a key and Xray pictures.\n\nIt lacks creativity basically. Except the amulet. That was a nice feature.\n\nMonsters:\n\nI feel like the first monster really have the upper hand. It both look and sound creepy, but it was so hard to hide from him. I was crawling behind him and he suddenly turned around and killed me instantly, even though the character made no sounds at all while crawling and I was at a pretty long distance.\n\nEven when I was hiding at a different hallway, waiting for him to leave, and it should have been impossible for him to notice me because he wasn't looking at my direction and I didn't move at all, guess what, he "saw me" and killed me instantly again.\n\nYou have a very, very low chance to survive if he notice you because he is super fast and kills you in one hit.\n\nI escaped from him after around ten minutes though and never saw him again. You made a monster, only to use him in one encounter you can get away from in a couple of minutes if you are brave enough. Good job guys!\n\nThe second monster was way better gameplay wise because at least I had a chance to get away from him, but he didn't look near as scary as the first one. He looked like a mutated Hulk with a metal leg. It wasn't scary at all actually, just silly.\n\nThird and final monster did at least look pretty creepy, but once again, low chance of survival. Use the amulant at the wrong time, instant death.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nDoorways: The Underworld is a great game if you wish to try out something scary, but I recommend you to stay away from it if you are looking for a deep story and/or unique gameplay.\n\nI liked the atmopshere, story and features, but my experience with it was in overall bad.\n\nAnd seriously, you want us to pay for each chapter? Greedy much?\n\n5/10 - Average, not recommended to buy.","September 22, 2014","false","3.2"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

I'm not sure why i like these games, but the 3rd chapter in the Doorway story has improved upon the first game, while also screwin a cupple things up.\n\nThe Pros:\n\n-  Same good narrative and voice acting: These games have a very episodic feel, like im watching some late night early 90's mystery/horror/scfi show like x-files/tales from the crypt or something of that nature. No matter how low budget these games are they have that charm to them\n- This game is significantly scarier than the first one: Oh Yes, They're are monsters, and depending how much time you spend with them, they can be pretty scary off the bat, while the first game only had enemies that acted as enviromental traps, this game has monsters that roam areas. While not entirel original, its still fun, and the last monster has an interesting way of coming up and terrorizing you\n- Sound: A Solid sound design. Good ambient effects, works well with headphones,\n\nThe Cons:\n- Presentation: I'm not sure if this is just me but this game doesn't feel as polished as the first one. The game is not broken or unplayable by any means, it's just certain parts seem a litle rough around the edges.\n- Repetitive Puzzles - This annoyed me significally, where they spread out 2 seperate types of puzzles by pretty much making an identical carbon copy of both in different areas. It kind of made things less scary, especally since each part had the same monster, became easy to predict.\n- The ending was kind of abrupt. I thought it ended well in the first game with the climax and a little after thought. in this one it felt rushed.\n\n\nPersonally I like the concept of Doorways and I will certainly be playing the next chapter.","February 13, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles are still disappointing and the story is still confusing at best. To its credit, the setting change once you get out of the initial cave-like area is kind of interesting, but not enough to offset the frustrating chase sequences and other lame first-person horror tropes.\n\nI believe there are two more chapters to suffer through before finishing the whole thing, but I can't say I'm in any hurry. If I weren't such a completionist, I'd probably abandon the series altogether.","January 8","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I enjoyed chapters 1 and 2 but this... is a downgrade and here is my opinion of why\n- Devs new idea of horror is to create a 'run from monsters simulator' and not focus as much on puzzles, atmosphere and story.\n- Completely buggy hiding mechanics, I can hide in one little area but not another which are EXACTLY the same?\n-EG/ I can hide in one little corner where the monster passes me and all is okay, but hide in one corner with a locked door and nope - devs have decided that that hiding spot isn't permitted and I am automatically found/\n- I move at all in one of the 'hiding spots' and I am automatically detected.\n- If I get too far infront of the forever-chasing monster, it automatically teleports back to my location.\n- Hiding spots are predetermined and if the player deviates from those, such as using ones own initiative in a completely logical hiding spot - NOPE, Wrong, dead.\n- You cannot pause the game. Got a phone call but a monster is chasing you? Too bad, press escape and go into the menu screen DOES NOT pause the game, it continues, you die, aaand repeat.\n\n\nI tried to give this a proper go as I thoughourly enjoyed the first chapters, but I must say, this game has potential. The notes and backstories seem very similiar to that of the first, which I like. The voice acting isn't bad and the notes are interesting and was one of my only incentives to pursue the end of this game. But running around with teleporting monsters with poorly designed mechanics - eh, no thanks. To me this seems completely unneccesary and ruined my experience of this game.\n\n","December 10, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet 2 people found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
