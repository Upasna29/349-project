Besides this game has a great soundtrack, great artwork and for a 10 dollar price tag is will provide a a lenghy fun experience. Higlhy recomended, if you still have some doubt , just download the demo.","May 31, 2011","true","0.7"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

You start out with an arcade mode which goes from easy to frustrating hard. After playing arcade you'll unlock a new mode, and a new mode after playing this, and so on. There's actually quite a few game modes to unlock, where the last is the most interresting; namely the Challenge mode. Some of the achievements can only be obtained through this mode, and some are very different from the usual bunch, such as "get a better score than a randomly chosen person in a randomly chosen level".\n\nAnother fun feature that sets this game away from other side-scrolling flying shooters is the time-travel abilities. You can fast travel throw time, which gives you bonus score, or you can rewind time such that you can replay a few seconds (while your other timeline self's shots still count).\n\nAn interresting twist on a classic game genre, and I can only recommend it.","March 30, 2011","true","13.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Quite expensive but in my opinion well worth the asking price.  A quality title; slick, polished and demonstrates there is a whole lot more than learning enemy patterns.  The time travelling element has been implemented well and adds to the dymanic bells and whilstles.  Yes Sir/Madame, I wholeheartly loved my time spent with Zeit Squared.","May 13, 2014","true","5.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

If you are a fan of Gradius this is a fun departure. If you always thought gradius was too hard. this isnt  that hard.  its fun .\n\n6.5/10","January 25, 2012","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game looks gorgeous, and like most of the greats of the genre, revolves around a deceptively simple mechanic that'll give you countless hours of fun to reach a true level of mastery at.  It's certainly not on the level with Ikaruga as a retro revival game, but for $10, it's tough to complain and it offers a bottomless pit of replay value.","January 17, 2011","true","19.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gameplay is as easy as pretty much any shooter game there is however, you do get a neat gameplay mechanic added in Zeit2... rewind time for a few seconds! That way, you can land more kills (to heal up) and keep it up with the killing spree!\n\nVisuals, gameplay and soundtrack are all quite decent!\n\nMy only advice though... play this with a gamepad/controller! With keyboard, it ain't as intuitive as a controller!","April 30","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
