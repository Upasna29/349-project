"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shyy/recommended/259530/","shyy","Shyy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shyy/","201 products in account","Savant, Aleksander Vinter, is one of my favorite electronic musicians. I became a huge fan of his music ever since the first tune of his I heard. He dabbles in dubstep, glitch hop, electro, house, complextro, and some other styles. The superb music is great in this game! It really goes well with the intense action. The gameplay, so far, has been fast, fluid, exciting, and challenging. The CDs you complete for new powers are aquired fairly quickly. I've only played for about ten minutes and already have all but two pieces, of four, for the last CD. Being that Savant is a musician I, honestly, didn't expect much from this game but I wanted to support the artist for all the wonderful songs he's made. I'm glad that I was proven wrong. For the measly $2 you need to spend to buy Savant - Ascent I most certainly got my money's worth. When I'm done with this review I'm turning up my speakers and going to jam out while slaying baddies some more. There even appears to be a mini-boss enemy and I'm hoping that there will eventually be a final boss.\n\nPros:\n- Fluid animations\n- Crisp old-school graphics\n- AMAZING SOUNDTRACK!!!!\n- Challenging, but enjoyable\n\nCons:\n- None, I don't know what else I could ask for with the small $2 price tag.\n\nBottom line:\nIf you're a fan of electronic music, or Savant himself, then you should immediately buy this game. Anyone could play it and enjoy themselves for at least an hour. Seriously, guys and gals, it's no more expensive than a candybar but the gameplay, plus the music, is a much sweeter experience!","December 4, 2013","true","0.6"," 186 of 204 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","186","204","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rekkonin/recommended/259530/","Rekkonin","Sarge","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rekkonin/","1129 products in account","Savant - Ascent is a pretty short, absolutely gorgeous, and entirely unique game. It's fast, fun, simple enough to pick up in minutes, and deep enough to warrant long discussions and in-depth guides, and still leave room for new discoveries. The first release from D-Pad Studio (to my knowledge), made in collaboration with the titular musical artist, Savant (Aleksander Vinter), this is definitely a good example of how to make a game the right way.\n\nStory mode is pretty short, consisting of only 5 levels that each take 2-5 minutes (except perhaps the final boss), and the gameplay itself is very simple, consisting of attacking enemies and moving between 2 platforms (and sometimes not even the latter). However, the game really shines through in its ability to stretch everything it offers to the limit. Story mode done? Try to race yourself, your friends, and the rest of the world with time attack, or go for an all-time highscore in endless mode. Maybe [SPOILERS] don the mask of the vanquished Vario and replay story mode with different attacks and movement for a change-up. During play, collect CD pieces from special enemies to unlock bonus soundtracks and new abilities, working your way up to obtaining the ultimate power that is the whole reason you're at the tower. Then try to take on the final boss, a lighting-fast, teleporting robot samurai in space with laser-shark friends who want nothing more than to see you reduced to a pile of ashes with a silly hat. And when all of that's done, maybe think about unlocking all of the achievements in the game. There aren't a lot of them, but when you accomplish them for the first time, they are certainly deserving of the name; the devs intentionally made them difficult to accomplish so it would actually be worth getting them and not just some extra stuff they threw in on a lazy Friday.\n\nThe music and visuals of Savant - Ascent also need to be mentioned; and they are both spectacular. The soundtrack is entirely composed by Savant himself and each song goes perfectly with the crazy, upbeat feel of the game. Some parts of the game even feature specific music not available in the 7 records you unlock, and the final boss seems to fight you to the beat of the music playing in the background. The graphics are simple, 16-bit images with that nice comfortable, retro, pixel-y feel while still being grand and beautiful (seriously, take a second to look at the background in the screenshots or during play).\n\nFor a while, there were two extra unlockable versions the game: GOTY and X-MAS versions, which changed the look of the enemies and added a nice little change. They aren't currently available as of writing this, but maybe X-MAS will come back for the holidays, and perhaps GOTY will come back in a patch or a further update.\n\nNow for the price. I'm sure this is a big issue for a lot of people, and it definitely is a factor for me. Luckily, this game costs only $2! If you can't quite afford that, maybe it'll go on sale for 50% during one of steams big sale events. I would say this game is definitely worth more money than just 2 dollars, but I'm more than happy to pay just that to play the game.\n\nAlright, this is getting lengthy... In summary, I would absolutely recommend this game to everyone, even if it's just to try the unusual gameplay for a few minutes. The music is great, the visuals are stunning, the features play off of each other perfectly and the Devs obviously knew what they were doing when designing the unlockables, achievements, special abilities, enemies, and levels. Play this game. Seriously, though, play it.","December 4, 2013","true","72.5"," 152 of 161 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","152","161","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/259530/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Savant - Ascent is a sort of twin stick shooter bullet hell type game. You are essentially rooted to two spots on each level, you can roll between them to avoid enemies, jump up and down, and that's it - although this sounds like it is restricting, you soon realize that it's all you need, and you probably don't need an extra thing to think about, so having just two positions is quite a good idea.\n\nThe art style is very nice. A lot of games are taking on this graphic style, and rightfully still as it does look good. The sprites of the main character and all the enemies look awesome too. Now, the music, if you are into electro/dubstep music, you may just have stumbled upon a gold mine. The sound track to Savant is amazing, there are about six different tracks to unlock and each of them is probably one of the best soundtracks you'll ever hear. I am surprised they haven't released the sound track as its own download to be honest!\n\nEach of the levels is presented very well; the aim is to just kill everything on screen for a number of minutes, nothing too complex. The game does get increasingly difficult though, it will probably take you a few tries on each level before you get to grips with what you have to do. The last two stages probably had me raging more than any other game I've played. That brings me onto game length, the game is very short, I managed to finish the story in just about an hour, while this is short, there are two other game modes that will keep the replayability going. I can see some people have over 100 hours in this game purely from these modes bringing them back for more.\n\nI would say Savant - Ascent has a place in most people's library, it's short and sweet and for £1, 59, you can't really go wrong can you?\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

I didn't think of this much at first to be honest. When I started it and realised that the character wasn't moving freely, only hopping between two possible spots while shooting enemies, it seemed very limited to me. Everything was happening in this confined area without the possibility of going anywhere. That early impression wasn't fair. As it turned out the strength of this game lies elsewhere.\n\nThe gameplay is generally about shooting swarms of enemies with your character's powers, who can fire magic missiles from his hands at really high speed. Lots of sweeping action as you clear them out while dodging them when they charge. Music plays an important role in this game and while I may not normally listen to this sort of music, it's very appropriate for such a fast paced game.\n\nThe real fun comes from obtaining new abilities and learning how to use them effectively to become even better. In fact... Every ability you unlock is something new, but having a big impact on the gameplay. It forces you to change your habits to get used to the new mechanic, as it gives you decisive advantage that helps you make even greater progress. The abilities are unlocked along with new music tracks that you collect as you play and once you have them all, you can also obtain a secret ability (if you figure out how or look it up) which leads you to possessing unbelieveable power that you'll need to prove your true ability in the Endless mode.\n\nOverall this was fun!","June 9, 2014","true","14.1"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","30","33","0","2"

After going on a five hour binge of playing the game, I can contest that it's not just a competent game, but rather great at what it does. The controls feel extremely responsive (I've used mouse & keyboard), the animations are well-excecuted, and there is no dull moment.\n\nYou start the game with only a rudimentary set of skills – and it's hard in the beginning (or at least was for me), however, you unlock extra abilities by progressing through the levels and game modes. You can probably beat the Story Mode in half an hour or so, but that's where the fun begins. Time Attack Mode is over quickly and good for a short game, while Endless Mode is where the real challenge lies – i.e. in defeating neverending ways of enemies, each wave stronger than the last.\nThe skills you unlock are tied in with six different music tracks you can change at will, all of which are great (and I'm not a huge fan of electronic music, in general).\n\nIt took me five hours to unlock all the different skills and get every achievement in the game – extremely good value, considering the price point of the game, I'd say. One thing to consider is, however, that this will be most enjoyable if you are into score attack games – beating the game once does not take very long, as I said. If you want to challenge yourself (and beat your friends' score, maybe?), though, this might be the ideal game for you.","April 9, 2014","true","8.8"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","28","30","0","0"

On the contrary I actively detested it, but it seems I must have been hearing the wrong stuff, as more and more I find myself eating my own words as I fall in love with some immensely talented artists who make up the genre. The latest of those is Aleksander Vinter A.K.A Savant, a musician whose catalog is a blur of sounds and styles, and who is now the protagonist of his own video game: Savant Ascent.\n\nA mixture of up-scrolling shooting and quick back and forth jumping, Ascent feels and plays unlike anything before it. Simple controls compliment the hefty difficulty as you attempt to stay alive through the onslaught of enemies, only able to move from one platform to the other as you make your way to the top of the tower. Enemies occasionally drop pieces of CDs, which on top of giving you a new slice of the soundtrack, rewards you with a new ability to use in combat. It's arcade nature lends itself very well to hi-score chasing, and the relentlessly quick pacing makes it hard to put down no matter how many times you die.\n\nSavant Ascend is nothing less than an absolute blast, and although it's a short run (I beat it in an hour, though it will likely take less for most players) it is abundantly replayable whether that be going for a new best score, racing through time trials, or seeing how long you can last in endless mode. It looks brilliant, sounds even better, and costs less than a cup of coffee!\n\nWith blistering action, tight gameplay, and loads of wub wub, whether you are already a fan of Savant or not this is something you ought to be playing!\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","December 13, 2013","true","1.4"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slothyexistence/recommended/259530/","slothyexistence","The Slothful Existentialist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slothyexistence/","953 products in account","Overview:Savant - Ascent is a 2D twin stick shooter developed by small indie dev team D-Pad Studios. The game was made using GameMaker and won the GameMaker GOTY award for 2013, it also won Gullstikka Norwegian GOTY 2014. It’s got much replay value with beating previous high-scores and attempting to be ranked in the leaderboards. It is based on real-life EDM artist Savant (Aleksander Vinter), who also provides the soundtrack straight from some of his albums. Savant - Ascent is available on Steam, Google Play, and the App Store.\n\n\nStory:Savant has been expelled from his tower by an evil Orb, as a result he needs to shoot and dodge his way back up the tower, defeating waves of enemies as he ascends.\n\nHigher up the tower are even more powerful enemies, enemies against which your skill will truly be tested. Are you ready for the challenge that lies beyond the tower?\n\n\nGameplay:Shooting and dodging are the game's main gameplay mechanics. The player shoots a burst of bullets before the shots become rapid-fire, dodging and taking down mobs also builds up energy that make your shots stronger. When enough energy is collected the player can shoot a powerful shot that mostly one-hit-kills enemies.\n\nThere is a variety of enemies in the game, ranging from small ones with different amounts of mechanics to big worm-like enemies with destroyable sections. There is also boss battles, which are challenging if the player fails to notice patterns and are careless. The enemies come in hordes, and if they’re not picked off in the order they spawn then you may have some crowd control to deal with, the burst shots help a lot with that. Throughout the whole game there are CD fragments, four of which form one full CD. CDs unlock more songs on the soundtrack and also unlock different abilities and buffs for the player.\n\nThere’s Story Mode, Endless Mode, and a Time Attack mode. You unlock latter two modes by beating the Story Mode. In endless you can try and beat your highscore and also rank high on the leaderboards; same with the timed mode, you can try to beat your time and rank high on the leaderboards. Good old arcade-style gameplay model, which give the game a high replay value.\n\nNow, the Void Update.\nWith the Void Update a whole other section was added to the game, and this section is much, much harder. It adds more enemies with different mechanics, and it also adds a new boss, which is a pain in the ♥♥♥ to beat, to say the least.\n\n\nVisual:The graphics are an overload of visual stimulation. The sprites are fairly detailed and animations are fluous. Explosions and shots are brightly coloured and debris and particle effects are eye candy. Amazing art. Just wait until you fight the space-samurai, just wait.\n\n\nSound:8-bit sound effects and Savant’s music make this game’s audio something unique but at the same time nostalgic. Aleksander Vinter (Savant) has savant syndrome, this makes him able to remember every musical sound he’s ever heard as well as make massive amounts of music in short periods of time. In his lifetime he’s made over 10,000 songs; since adopting the alias “Savant” he has released eleven albums, seven EPs, and twelve singles. He has no definitive genre or sound, and is constantly experimenting with his music.\n\nFor this game he chose most songs from his dubstep-sounding albums: Alchemist, Cult, ISM, Ninur, Orakel, Vario, and Overkill. Not including the musical scores made specifically for the game.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts:Gameplay this simple and this addicting takes ingenuity to develop. D-Pad Studios took a world based on Savant’s music and fleshed it out into a full universe. The Alchemist from the album Alchemist, Vario from the album Vario, and the Samurai from the album Protos.\n\nPersonally, I bought this game simply because I’m a huge fan, had ‘Savant’ in its name, and because the trailer was featuring his music. What I was surprised to encounter was a ridiculously fun game with an amazing soundtrack and crazy good visuals. A must have for Savant fans and twin stick shooters alike.","May 30","true","10.1"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

I did not expect much, considering the low price, but the game really delivers.\nIt plays a bit like an old school 2D arcade game, the graphics and pacing definitely remind me of that era.\n\nGraphics are very sharp, controls are simple and responsive, and the music, which is more or less the focus of the game, is great.\n\nMy only problem with the game is, considering the nature of enemy attacks, I'd much rather have the view zoomed out at all times (or at least have an option). The camera is always zoomed in VERY close to the character and the only way to see enemies is to pan with your cursor, which you're already using for shooting 100% of the time... So even though you're given off-screen markers for charging enemies, that's still far from ideal.\n\nAlso, no Steam overlay on Mac (yet?), meaning no achievements or screenshots for Mac users.","December 30, 2013","true","0.1"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

I have to admit that I have no idea about what I should talk about first. When I bought, for 2$, I never expected it to give me so many hours of fun. I thought it would be a 15 minutes game and that I'd never launch it again after finishing it. Looking at my time in game might inform you of how wrong I was.\n\nShort version : If you're looking for a 2D shmup with an awesome OST, go for it.\n\nLonger version : I was already a fan of Savant and his other works (as Vinter in Hollywood/Vegas, and his other band names) before knowing the game. When I discovered the game, I didn't think I'd appreciate it so much. First of all, the songs of the OST, which are Savant's work from different albums (Alchemist, Overkill, ISM, Vario, Orakel and Cult), fit perfectly in the nervous gameplay. The difficulty which increases along the levels is here, but it isn't too big, and it permits to have fun even after the twentieth try (gotta admit I ragequited a few times, but that's another story). And when you're finished with the five levels and if you love tryharding and competition, you'll love the Endless and Time Trial mode, which require some patience and skills (and ragequits) to master. Also, the characters from Savant's lore like Vario, the Samurai (spoiler : they are the bosses (spoiler: they're ♥♥♥♥ing hard at first)) and the Alchemist (the protagonist, who can be seen on Alchemist's album cover) aren't too much (I don't know how to say it, so I'll just assume you got the idea). The only thing that's bad for the game in my opinion are the bugs, but they're funnier than boring and the developer listens to the player and push updates from time to time.\n\ntl;dr savant memes tryhard godlike ost GOTY (got it ?) game 10/10","April 8, 2015","true","92.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","3"

It's only 2 bucks, and the meat of the game is fantastic! Honestly, you can stop reading now, sacrifice just one vending machine trip, and purchase the game, it's good.\n\nBut if you want to know more, then know this. Though the game play is enjoyable, and the presentation top shelf, it's a small game. There's not a lot in the way of extra features, even the options menu is relatively lacking, and I suspect the difficulty, though satisfying, was cranked up to hide the game's low content. But with that said, know that what is there, is exceptionally well crafted! Think of it as fine cuisine. You get just enough to be full, and while you were tasting it, it was some of the best you've had, except this game doesn't come at the cost of fine cuisine!\n\nIf you've made it this far into the impression, just ignore every thing you read and buy the damn game. Once again... It's good!\n\nPros:\n- Simple but challenging and addictive gameplay\n- Fantastic audio!\n- Twitchy gameplay!\n- Fancy buzzword visuals!\n- It's the cost of a damn candy bar!\n\nCons:\n- Low price, means low content\n- Options menu could use an overhaul","August 30, 2014","true","0.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The soundtrack is one of the game's biggest selling points, with intense, fitting tracks that keep the action flowing. The game is somewhat short, but this is only due to it being early in development (I hope, at least; devs should continue to add more content). I almost wish that I would have waited for the price to go up so I could support this developer with more than 2 dollars. I'd have been happy with $10 in it's current state. I do think that there are some glitches still, which I anticipate the developers will work out. I hope that everyone reading this will buy this great game and give such a skillful development team the support they deserve.","December 4, 2013","true","4.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It is fresh and original while it lasts so I would recommend it. If you are a high score chaser then you'll get a lot more out of the game, but I'm not really.\n\nThe gameplay primarily consists of jumping or rolling between 2 platforms while spamming bullets at monsters, and using a special super attack once you've filled up your bar by shooting things with your regular attack. You have to unlock abilities though, by collecting CD shards. There are 4 of these abilities and you can't beat the final boss without at least 1 of them, so don't worry about dying on the way there, since that is the only way to turn in your CD shards.\n\nThis is really interesting idea, a sort of micro-game to promote Savant's music, while actually being pretty fun to play.","December 4, 2013","true","0.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It revolves around a mysterious figure, who aims to climb a tower in order to find the secret source of magic. Countless and diverse types of enemies try to hinder him and you need to help him getting rid of the evil forces that guard the philosopher's stone.\n\nDesign & Art The game is nicely designed and features an original gothical artstyle. The character and enemies look very detailed and well animated. In my opinion, the visuals were crafted with tender, love and care, they positively enhance the atmosphere of the game.\n\nControls Controls are pretty straightforward; you aim with the mouse and the game offers a tutorial for the moves you are able to do. Also, the Savant - Ascent features complete controller support, for people who want to play that way. Nice!\n\nSound & Music The soundtrack is what keeps this game alive. The game features a set of electronic/dubstep songs, that accompany you during your play. In my opinion, the music is really awesome and makes the game feel more arcady, even without repeating chiptunes!\n\nSounds are nice too. Overall, the sound of the game enhances the gameplay and lets you feel the action from start to finish. It really feels like you are playing an arcade game!\n\nGameplay The gameplay is kept simple: you, enemies, shooting, surviving. You aim in the general direction enemies are in and shoot. That's it. Disc parts you can find or unlock throughout the game will give you a new track you can listen to, but they also grant you a special power (more damage etc.). There are different powers and all of them make you somewhat stronger. Try to find all of them, in order to beat the endgame content this game has to offer!\n\nChain up kills to increase your score multiplier and reach that sweet, sweet highscore in the leaderboards. But be careful not to get hit, since it reduces your multiplier, aswell as your lives. Three hits and it is game over for you!\n\nNext to a small story, this game features and endless mode, in which you have to survive as long as possible (and consecutively gain very many points). Lastly, there is a timed mode for the storymode, in which you will need to beat the game as fast as possible. Small eastereggs are also included.\n\nWeakpoints Unfortunatly, music is (as always) a matter of taste. If you feel a strong dislike for said music, I would advise against buying this product.\n\nBe aware of the fact that this game is short and might not keep you engaged for a very long time. Fortunatly, the shortness is compensated with its price. Consider it a tasty snack you discover, so tasty you want to savor it by not eating it too often.\n\nConcluding Thoughts Savant - Ascent is a game that could really be called a new age arcade game.\n\nFor a game that small in size and content, I really had lots of fun with it. The soundtrack enhanced my complete experience with it and kept my heart pumping and my head banging. The gameplay feels overly satisfying, wrecking some enemies with POWER OVERWHELMING has never felt that good for me.\n\nSo you should definetly give it a try, because Savant - Ascent took the term "Brevity is the soul of wit." and "Sometimes, less is more." very literal. So literal, that I can't even believe I didn't spend more than two dollars on this game.\n\nFriendly advice: Just be careful not to headbang too much or you'll wake up with neck muscle hangover the next day.","March 27","true","7.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The soundtrack alone would be a steal but you get an excellent game too!\n\nThe core gameplay of Savant - Ascent is quite simple but don't let that deter you. Its fluid, pulse raising action is a blast to play. The difficulty curve is just right for most of the game but got a bit steep for my liking right near the end. A steady stream of unlocks keeps things fresh throughout the main story and avoids overwhelming you. This isn't a very long game but it includes a few extras like time trial and endless modes that will please you if you like a challenge.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that the final boss gets away from the frenetic gameplay and instead becomes an exercise in memorizing a static sequence of attacks. While the fight has an epic air to it, it lost the fun factor for me and became a chore to overcome in order to see the ending. Without spoiling anything, the ending suggests that the developers had more planned but it's unlikely that we'll see an expansion telling the rest. That is disappointing but considering that the story is told solely through short, nonverbal cutscenes, you can't claim that story was ever this game's strength or focus.\n\nIf you like electronic music you should enjoy the fantastic soundtrack. All the songs are accessible in .ogg format in the game's main files folder (typically C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\SavantAscent ). It's a testament to their quality that many of the tracks have found their way into my music library.\n\n8/10","October 18, 2015","true","6.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

That is why I picked up this game. For those of you who do not know Savant, he is an EDM artist, with a unique style.\n\nI went into this game expecting some awesome music and exciting gameplay, and was not disappointed.\n\nThe game is essentially a really fast paced shooter, like a lot of “shoot-em-up” games. Although I feel like the game would have worked better as a flash game, the price is reasonably low, so it’s justifiable. The game begins with a very primitive story told in a series of pictures, featuring the man himself, with his own music playing. Although the story is really not necessary, it is a nice little touch.\n\nYou’ll find yourself engaged in combat as soon as you’re in control of the game. A series of robots float around the screen before tumbling towards you if not killed quick enough. There are different types of these machines and you’ll need to keep on shooting at them to be able to progress the level. There are three levels total, with the last containing a surprisingly difficult boss battle.\n\nIt took me quite some time to beat the last level, but the game only took me around 40 minutes to beat. The game has some replayability in the form of high scores, and for me, speed runs. The only real difference in running through the game again is to use the power-ups earned through collecting four disc pieces. These pieces will assemble to form a new power-up.\n\nThe game has its fair share of technical flaws, however. It cannot run at a resolution of 1080p, which I found quite irritating. There are checkpoints in the game, but my game crashed at one point and, upon reloading it, the game failed to place me back at my previous checkpoint, even though I still had the abilities that I had unlocked prior to the crash.\n\nI was also surprised by the lack of documentation on how to even play the game correctly. Sure, it looks self-explanatory, but I found myself confused on how to progress through the game. I figured out after about ten minutes of mindless blasting, but I would have liked to have known what to do from the start.\n\nOverall, the game certainly appeals to fans of Savant and just about all EDM fans at that, but it lacks heavily in content. If you’re up for some fast-paced shooting with great music playing, then this is the game for you.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwTe_M55lOc","December 4, 2013","true","0.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I think this is a really interesting type of shootemup with abilities that you need to learn when to best utilize. There are interesting trade offs after you get various CDS Like using your burst ability that explodes pretty much everything on screen but losing your double damage normal attacks, or stop attacking to jump multiple times so you can full your burst super fast (You get this with the 6th CD) but you need to take care not to get hit and spamming burst all the time can create some problems depending of the situation.\n\nI recommend this game even if you hate the gameplay as long as you like electronic music.

I think this is a really interesting type of shootemup with abilities that you need to learn when to best utilize.

It is more a defense game than anything, as you only move from one spot on the level or another, and become stationary at either point. The wizard must shoot enemies and ...things that drop pieces of records. Getting full records upgrades your firepower (I think) and advances the stage. You're essentially a turret that can jump or move to another point on the level, as you shoot in 360 degrees while dealing with a limited screenview that requires you to be catious and prioritize certain targets as the enemies have different attack patterns. The limited vision is very annoying for me, but I can see that it was an intentional design decision. It's unfortunate that I can't play it full screen or expand it to my 2560x1080 resolution. I don't really get why there is a gothic, Castlevania-like visual theme mixed with Dubstep and 8 bit sound bytes. Savant has a nice style, but it's strange.\n\nThe game is pretty fun and it's mostly a hardcore score attacker's delight. The game is absolutely brutal, and I can't get past the 2nd level for the life of me. I might be able to get further if I really hunker down and practice this game for hours, but I don't feel like doing that at the moment. It's a solid game, especially for $2 or less, but realize that you're getting a very simplistic and hardcore, almost arcade like experience that has an extremely short story mode (From what I read) and an endless mode that is just about score and survival. .","August 12, 2014","true","0.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Addictive.  Even has some slightly hidden references to other popular games.\n\nCons:\nExtremely extremely short story mode.  Beat it twice in an hour or 2 of playing, not counting the time attack and endless modes.  Left me wishing for a much bigger tower!  Also, it's not a true platformer like the videos may accidentally make it look like.  You tell your character when to jump or dodge, and that consists the entirety of your movement.  Only a con if you're under the assumption it's a platformer like I was.\n--\nI got my copy in a Humble Bundle.  But if I hadn't, it'd probably be worth the 2 bucks they're currently asking for IMO.\nAwesome little game.","October 24, 2014","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Expect a challenge.\n\nRest of the review:\n\nThis is a very simple game with a lot of charm.  The dubstep music is very welcoming and is easily the star of the show, but the gameplay is very well planned out as well.  At first, the dodging system feels a little too limited, but the dodging became far more useful as the game progressed.  Shooting things, while initially fun, seemed like it was going to become repetitive.  Boss battles, however, are extremely challenging, and you constantly have to experiment with strategies to figure out how to win each battle.\n\nThe challenge is the biggest hurdle.  The game gives you very little get-to-know-the-game time before throwing challenges at you, but as you unlock CDs, you also unlock abilities which make the game a little more bearable.  I found myself rage-quitting at the third big swarm battle because I not only had to protect myself but I also had to protect my platforms, which were honestly not very easy to protect, even with the dodge-to-regain-power ability.  If you don't want a challenge, don't get this game!","December 29, 2014","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The soundtrack is one of a kind it's like an arcade game but better. The final boss made me tense and insanely awesome. It was only a matter of time until I figured out his pattern.

That's about it, but it works really well, and the game is just about the right size for it not to become stale (helped a lot by the music :P).\n\nI personally love the soundtrack and now own the Alchemist album. A fair warning - it's an electro/dubstepy kind of thing, and I know some people don't like that. If you don't, you might want to consider skipping this title, due to the main draw being the oddly simple cohesion of music and gameplay.\n\nThe graphics are high quality pixel-art, and very well animated too. Most importantly, it's actually easy to tell what's going on on the screen, even when things get hectic.\n\nFor two euros, this one is a bargain.

When the bass drops in certain parts of the soundtrack I can clearly define the audio for enemies spawning and enemies attacking. I think these small details really does bring out the enjoyability of the game.\n\nI enjoy the rogue-like dungeon crawler paired with a shoot em up. I find that it brings a bond to the character to see it grow as it learns new abilities and techniques. Sometimes I was able to develop my own personal strategies to defeat levels after levels.\n\nOne intersting suggestion that I like to see maybe implemented in the future to add difficulty is I noticed that during the second level when you are in between two escalators that when one of the moves higer than the other i was able to dodge to that escalator even though it seems like it is impossible to roll up. I think that adding a constraint to that for the player to jump to the higher escalator instead of simply rolling would add some extra challenge. (Maybe it is already implemented, I have to play more and find out)\n\nOverall I had a blast playing this game and the amount of thinking involved of creating a fun game through its plot, game mechanics and user experience and UI design won you a fan.

The levels are challenging, and the music is enough to keep you going through the whole thing.\n\nProblem is, the golden robots with CD pieces have WAAAAAY too much health. When you're getting mercilessly attacked by 500 other robots then you don't have the time to chip away at the gold enemies for a CD piece. Once I was blasting at one and dodging in an attempt to avoid the other bots and then the gold bot vanished and then I was twatted in the face by an oncoming one and then I died. The way the controls are mapped gives me finger strain and the camera only moves when you're shooting, so when you gotta clean out the CD pieces you missed at the end of the level it's awkward to try and see them.\n\nBut I get a little further in the game with each attempt, and I do believe I can eventually finish it.

When the bass drops in certain parts of the soundtrack I can clearly define the audio for enemies spawning and enemies attacking. I think these small details really does bring out the enjoyability of the game.\n\nI enjoy the rogue-like dungeon crawler paired with a shoot em up. I find that it brings a bond to the character to see it grow as it learns new abilities and techniques. Sometimes I was able to develop my own personal strategies to defeat levels after levels.\n\nOne intersting suggestion that I like to see maybe implemented in the future to add difficulty is I noticed that during the second level when you are in between two escalators that when one of the moves higer than the other i was able to dodge to that escalator even though it seems like it is impossible to roll up. I think that adding a constraint to that for the player to jump to the higher escalator instead of simply rolling would add some extra challenge. (Maybe it is already implemented, I have to play more and find out)\n\nOverall I had a blast playing this game and the amount of thinking involved of creating a fun game through its plot, game mechanics and user experience and UI design won you a fan.

Addictive.  Even has some slightly hidden references to other popular games.\n\nCons:\nExtremely extremely short story mode.  Beat it twice in an hour or 2 of playing, not counting the time attack and endless modes.  Left me wishing for a much bigger tower!  Also, it's not a true platformer like the videos may accidentally make it look like.  You tell your character when to jump or dodge, and that consists the entirety of your movement.  Only a con if you're under the assumption it's a platformer like I was.\n--\nI got my copy in a Humble Bundle.

It took me about 20 minutes to get through it, and then a little over 5 for my first time attack win.  But there's an endless mode as well, and some more unlockables.\nThe game is a frenetic shooter - you have two places to stand which you can move between as you blow away hordes of enemies around you. It starts out pretty basic, but as you unlock CDs, you get new abilities which do change up the gameplay. The endless mode especially has that 'just one more time' feel that is great for a game.  It's not a complicated game, but it does have more depth than you'll see to start.  And once you get the groove, it'll hook you.

Is that even legal?!?!?!\n\nIn all seriousness though this game, oh man.  I had about 3 bucks left over in my steam account from the 2014 Winter Sale.  I was browsing the cheapest games.  Most everything was trash, but this caught me eye.  I saw the reviews were good and the soundtrack was cool.  I'm a sucker for soundtracks so I went ahead and got it.  I installed it and loaded it up.  About 10 minutes in I was having some fun, the beats were sweet and the controls were tight.  Then I got to the second level which upped the difficulty and I was getting into it.  Then I unlocked the next soundtrack.  I was listening with my crappy laptop speakers but then I put my headphones on.  It was like a barrage of beats penetrating my ears.  It was pure euphoria.  The game apparently at launch was only 3 levels but now there are two more, an endless mode, and insane upgrades.  Hands down the best $1.99 I ever spent.  When I played the endless mode I was hooked.  The night I got it I played for 2 hours straight.  That is really rare for me.  What are you waiting for?

Which is a great game. Let's just get that straight. NOW onto the review itself.\n\nSavant: Ascent has a hectic, fast paced and heart pumping gameplay inside a wonderful aesthetic vision. Together with a fantastic soundtrack from the electronic composer Savant, all the elements of this game works and compliments each other extremly neatly. I find myself time and time again tapping my feet to the beat of the music, while at the same time ruining the rhyhtm with my excessive mouse clicking. Many, if not all elements in Savant: Ascent is tied together with a very simplistic, but very effective game design.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are simple, where the difficulty of the game is elegantly increased by more rapid enemy spawning and more powerful foes. I think the controls are tight and right to the point, and works well together with how the game tells you where your enemies are located at all times. It feels very balanced through all stages.\n\nI recommend this game from the bottom of my heart. It is worth every penny (which is not that many). It is truly worth your time. I wish D-Pad Studio all the best in the future, because for you guys it is looking VERY bright based on what I've seen so far.","December 5, 2013","true","6.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It takes Savant's awesome image and music and slaps it into an old 16-bit arcade elevator battle game. The enemies are easily killed but they spawn like crazy, the mobs are difficult and are a good taster at real gaming when it comes to quick thinking and planning your moves. I played for over 2 hours and could have easily kept playing all night. The different modes were really fun; Vario Mode was hilarious. Time Attack was the usual deal, try better your game and finish the game in under 5 minutes. Endless Mode was just what I was looking for; 16-bit non stop battle with amazing music and incredible gameplay.

The animation is smooth and the character design is great. I never get tired of saying of how great they are for a game that's worth a few bucks. And while it depends on your personal music taste, the music is great to listen to as well.\n\nI was really dissapointed to find out how short the game was. I managed to beat story mode in 30 minutes! Not only that, but I find the gameplay very repetitive. It's always the same map, and the same enemies. The setting changes a little as the gameplay goes on, but the only thing that changes is the color and difficulty of the same enemies over and over again.\n\nI also find it frustrating how the game doesn't expand to fullscreen, unless it's just happening to me. My mouse often goes off-screen and I end up moving the window and having to re-adjust the whole game window.\n\nOverall, the game is fun for a few hours then it just gets old unless you enjoy playing repetitive games. I hear that there are more features coming in the future- I'm interested in checking them out.","June 25, 2014","false","1.1"," 17 of 33 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","17","33","0","0"

First of all I purchased this game to support Savant, he's an awesome artist and a cool guy in general. I didn't expect much looking at the pricetag so I entered the game with very low expectations, the first few minutes of the game were confusing but I noticed (and instantly liked) one of savants songs playing as I shot laser beams at the flying metal robot things. I died a few times and got kind of frustrated but then I noticed that I had found 4 parts of a Golden CD. I was pleased to find that I had unlocked a new song and a new ability so I figured, why not play some more! A few minutes later I had found another CD with a new and epic ability and I really started liking the game, however it is not a long game by any means, I was done after half an hour or so... Again I was going to put down the game, generally pleased with how it played out... But then I noticed  the "survival" and "time attack" modes with leaderboards. So far I have had a blast with those for 2 hours and I do not think I will stop enjoying them soon.\nOne of the greatest things about this game is the community (the steam Community Hub that is) I went on the forum only to find that some guy were giving out free games to whoever beats his incredible leaderboard ranks, and generally people seem to be very friendly and polite to eachother.\n\nGreat ♥♥♥♥ing game! 10/10 Considering it's price. Would buy again, over and over.\n-Derpagon\n\nA short video of me playing Time Attack!","December 20, 2014","true","2.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's better than many of the $10+ games and it's super cheap! I'd definitely recommend it, it's hard to stop playing and has awesome music. Just get it, you won't regret it.\nThe only thing I can think of as a negative is that it doesn't synch your saves, so if you want to move to a different computer (desktop -> laptop for me), you have to start again. That really isn't much of a big deal at all, though, because it's still a lot of fun to go back and fight through the story again.","May 14, 2014","true","2.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you try and go up sometimes it jumps up other times it acts like an actual savant and does what ever it wants regardless of your input. The game is solid in every respect except the dodging. it is remarkly slow in that regard you might as well dodge yesterday if you want to avoid something. That only works when the objects don't take a straight line because they can and will make it impossible to dodge regardless of your actions and at that point the game becomes a lesson in futility......\nIf you fix the dodgin mechanics the game will be epic.

Enjoy, Or not, Your life.\n\nPostive [A breif overview]:\nReally dam good pixel graphics.\nGood Controls, shooting works fine.\nDesign is fantastic, especially SAVANT&The backgrounds. Did i mention this game has dam good graphics?\nThe CD mechanic is intresting, its a bit diffucult for me as im not good at this game at all, but whatevs.\n\nNow for some negatives, because no game is perfect:\nThe enemy designs are simplistic [Note:I mean the normal enemies, not any bosses if there are any]\nPretty hard, though thats really more nitpciky on my part. Alot of people might like that challange.\nThe soundtrack,atleast to me as its really not my thing, is awful.\nNow this last one is prooooably just me, but at the beginning screen, it glitches out nonstop, showing 01010101s and a few other werid things. I dunno, might just be me.\nThe CD grabbing can be delayed, or not even registered.\n\nFINAL GRADE:7.5/10.\n\nFor me, a soundtrack is a BIG part of a game, and thats why im not giving it like a 8 or 9. I do reccomend this for you players out there who like your Shoot-Em-Ups, And your difficulty. Just dont expect that theres no bugs with the game, mkay?

In Savant Ascent you play as Savant. A mystical orb cast him out of his tower so now he has to fight his way back to the top. So how is this game ? Honestly its quite fun. The game is played like a twin stick shooter but you play with a mouse. Essiantly you have three levels of killing stuff to get back to the top. In the game you have to kill robots and collect CD parts to get power ups. The game also has an endless mode which is alot of fun. The game has a kick ♥♥♥ soundtrack with great toons which you listen while killing alot of enemies. The game also has a few flaws. The game doesnt explain how to kill the final boss so it takes quite a bit of time to get it right. The game is also quite difficult. Overall theres nothing more to say about this little gem. But overall i suggest you pick up Savant Ascent. Great soundtrack. SImple gameplay. A great challenge and really cheap.

GREAT GAME !\n\nOVERALL This game is pure awesomeness, I've been a fan from the electro house DJ from a couple of years now and when I found out that he had a game I had to play it and boy I wasn't letted down. This action game is a shoot 'em up that needs a lot of coordination if you want to progress, also as you collect Golden CDs you unlock new songs to play in the background and Savant is an exquisite electro house DJ, for $2 you can't go wrong!\n\nREPLAYABILITY You may beat this game in 2 or 3 hours, but once you get to the end boss you can still fight your way to collect 2 more Golden CDs, which mean 2 more songs and 2 more abilities, I haven't been able to get the 6th and last Golden CD and that frustrates me... but things get pretty hectic in Endless Mode and I have just been able to get the 5th GCD, the last one is way too hard!\n\nGAMEPLAY The gameplay has a nice difficulty curve, even if you keep dying you will be accumulating golden CD pieces and once you get 4 you unlock a new song and new abilities that will help you a lot to progress, creeps that were given you a tough time will be vaporized in a breeze after getting the 4th Golden CD, you may also learn to evade hits more efficiently, overall it's easy to just use your Mouse on one hand and a few keys on the other, the only complaint will be the lack of variety in the levels, you only have The 1st Floor, The Elevator Climb and The Boss Stage.\n\nAESTHETIC I love this game look, it's a great realization on Savant's previous cover art for its albums and singles, plus it captures this magic atmosphere that was very well transmitted in his songs, specially on the album titled "Alchemist", we get "Melody Circus" from that album as the 5th track you may unlock.\n\nSTORY The story is simple and yet very cool, specially on the Boss Stage when you'll fight some unexpectedly familiar foe. You play as Savant, a alchemist who tries to control the mysterious great power of the Philosopher’s Stone and fails, getting blasted by an explosion who throws you out of the tower of your castle and you need to climb back and try to master this bizarre energy.\n\nMUSIC Do I need to tell anything more? I'm clearly a big fan of electronic dance music, and electro house is a pretty energetic genre that nourish amazingly well this videogame, it was love at first play.","September 18, 2014","true","16.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Rather like a "game and watch" you are fixed on screen with only 3 options, dodge left or right or jump. Baddies charge at you and you need to get out the way; this gets tricker as the game goes on and is great stuff.\n\nThis all falls apart due to one fatal flaw which is the moving camera, you see the camera moves in the direction you are shooting in so you are blind sided from every direction except the one you are shooting. To make matters worse, moving prevents shooting, so you can't just hop around to avoid getting hit otherwise too many enemies will appear and you will die.\n\nEverything about the game is either good or great. The art direction the various soundtracks (yes you can pick different soundtracks as you play!) the controls (although admittedly they are limited and simple) are good but the whole challenge of the game is dodging enemy attacks or enemies altogether so its a huge, huge promblem that you can hardly see where the enemies are coming from in order to dodge them.\n\nIt's a handicap that ruins what is otherwise an amazing gaming experience and while progress in the game will unlock ways to help deal with this, it is clear it was a design intention but sadly a misguided one because games like Contra are hard; like Metal Slug are challenging but those are great games! No will look down on you for copying the tried and tested method of making a run and gun game!\n\nIf you can deal with the camera moving around all the time then you will enjoy the game but for me I really really tried hard and everytime I got into the game I just couldn't look past how much better the game would be, without giving me motion sickness. :(\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","January 17, 2015","false","2.5"," 15 of 33 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","15","33","0","0"

Its not an old school fighting game like you expect. Its basically a rail-shooter. You can't control your guy at all, only just just straight up or diagonal, or roll to 1 of 2 different spots on the level. You just spent the entire time holding down the analog stick and spraying shots at guys. The lack of character control is made further worse as dozens of guys spawn on the screen faster than you can kill them, and come at you in packs. hopefully one of the 2 spots is open or your rolling will just get you hurt and you take damage no matter what you do, which is a major game flaw. You can only get hit 3 times per level before you die, which is dumb based on how many guys come at once and how many waves there are. So basically you just keep dying and getting upgrades slowly and keep replaying the levels. There is no real story.  And the game is supposed to be super short, no wonder its 2 dollars. 4/10.

I'm just disappointed, and where to start.\n\nWell, it's a one-stick shooter. The store description makes Savant sound agile and mobile. You CANNOT walk, and only jump between 2 platforms on screen. Oh, but it's a game about climbing the tower? That involves one screen of fighting enemies until the elevator starts moving, a second screen as the elevator flies to the top, and a third screen with the boss fight ending. An update did add 2 more sections, but they don't change much. The core game can be easily beaten in 10 minutes, with some time attacks under 2 minutes.\n\nGameplay is simple, jump and shoot. There are some extra mechanics with the first shot, charge shots, and grapples, but they are unlocked by beating the game. So the early parts are only difficult or time-consuming because you have no damage or abilities unlocked. Once you collect everything, the game becomes trivial enough that you hardly need to jump to avoid damage. There are only 5 enemy types, and combat switches between bullet-spongy grinds to easy mode once you unlock the last CD.\n\nOh yea, the music is a thing. It's not what I expected from the store video. I like maybe 2 of the 7 tracks, but they are all short enough that they loop and repeat. Music tracks only switch when you pause the game to select a new one, unless the game decides to switch to the Wyrm spawn song. I know the game is absurdly short, but the soundtrack should at least vary enough to last the length. Some people argue the cost is worth for the songs alone, but there is so much free music available now from generous artists, I can't recommend this game's music unless you already like the specific artists. If you are a chiptune-dubstep fan, you can probably find free songs from other artists.\n\nThere may be more content coming, but at this point I have to consider the game effectively complete. The Void update nearly doubled the game content, which is nice, but I'd think there should've been some big Early Access banners for how short and incomplete the game was. Simple bugs still remain, navigating too far in the music selection will crash the game.\n\nThe graphics are amazing and I love the style, but the game just stumbles too much to end so soon. It feels like a demo, and only gains depth once the game is nearly finished. That leaves score attack content as the only reason to replay, but I expected a complete game. I suppose it was a fair deal at 50% off, completing everything in 4 hours. I still feel misled, as the store neglected to point out that walking around was not a feature. It feels like a Newgrounds game with excellent art, but I can't recommend unless you know what you are getting here.","January 2, 2015","false","4.0"," 9 of 25 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","9","25","0","0"

The majority of their "Demo" video is spent on a level where there are 2 elevators, and the player is jumping from one to the other while firing like crazy.  Everything looked great and natural.  That said, if I had known that those 2 positions were the ONLY positions in the game where you could stand...  Yes, that's right.  Even in full levels where there are visually PLENTY of places to stand, you are limited to jumping back and forth between 2 specific spots.  You then use your mouse to point at enemies and shoot.\n\nGenerating another understatement, I'd have to say that this game gets boring and repetitive after about 5 minutes.  It's a game that you won't have installed long and, unless you got it in a bundle (like me), will certainly regret buying.  The graphics are half decent, but that's about all this game has going for it.\n\nI honestly can't recommend it at this time.","July 21, 2014","false","0.3"," 5 of 19 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","5","19","0","4"

So i tried the game pad and what do you know, the A button acts as SPACE. So than i continue to use my game pad to read the controls that are explained for the keyboard - the device that the game no longer allows me to use.\n\nAfter that i was thrown into the middle of chaos, enemies coming from all directions, a game pad as my only choice for controls which i do not know how to use since the game never told me the controls for the game pad, so i'm blasting in all directions, some how taking hits without so much as a second of time to react and about 15 seconds after the start of the game i died. i barely knew what happened, it was over so fast.\n\nNow i'm not very fond of games where i see the GAME OVER screen within the first 60 seconds of launching it but even still, i decided to give it another try. Pressed START on my game pad to try again and there i was, blasting away in all directions, i managed to dodge a few hits, i think, but with only three i knew i wasn't going to last long. I got hit twice but still going, maybe 30 seconds of living this time and right before i could get hit a 3rd time, the game crashed.\n\nto summarize the game play, you can fire in any direction, you can only move between 3 positions in the room and they are very close together, enemies spawn from all directions, and you can only see 1/6 of the room in the direction you are firing in. you mostly get hit by enemies off screen, out of view. it takes many hits to defeat a single enemy and some take quite a while to destroy. 3 hits and it's game over.\n\nso, my time with this game was breif, confusing and a bit frustrating. bad design and bad programming. all i can say is at least the game was really cheap, so i didn't lose much at all. except for a piece of my soul...","December 26, 2013","false","0.1"," 10 of 37 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","10","37","0","0"

I saw it on sale for 99 cents and bought it. It took me all of 30 minutes to beat it. There was no story beyond some weird character falling off of a tower and coming back to fight his way back up it to destroy whatever shiny round thing knocked him off. I later found that the "hero" character is actually the alias of some musician (Aleksander Vinter), and the character is dressed up as he dresses on stage. And of course this game just happened to be released on the PC just days before his new album...surprise surprise.\n\n+ Really nice art. Too bad there is so little of it.\n+ Apparently there will be additional content added for free. Leaderboards for a 20 minute game that doesn't penalize death? Hurray!\n+ If you are into this artist "Savant" or dubstep, you will love the music, apparently...\n\n- This seems like a showcase for the artist, his music, and his on-stage persona, not about a complete game with compelling gameplay, story, or characters.\n- There is no substance to this game. Your progress in the game continues at the last death, thus removing any impact to death. You simply crunch through the easily defeated waves of enemies until you grab enough pieces of "cds", a ridiculously obvious allusion to the modern real world which makes this game feel even more like part of an album promotional campaign of some kind, giving you extra powers. Then you die, new powers completed/retained and then you start anew with no penalty whatsoever.\n- End boss is ridiculously easy. This fits the general sensibilities to this game though.\n- This is an iOS port of a game developed in just five weeks. I should have known...\n\nI would skip this and buy a good $1 Humble Bundle instead. You are sure to get more value and quality gameplay in a good Humble Bundle than with a 30 minute promotional game for an artist developed in just five weeks...","January 13, 2014","false","0.6"," 10 of 39 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","10","39","0","0"

D-Pad Studio, responsible for the beautiful but not yet released Owlboy, have actually released a game ? I recall them saying they'd paused the development of Owlboy in order to work on this game first. A move that doesn't make sense to me. Not that it's a bad game, but a game that can be finished in roughly in 1 hour. After that you still have Time Attack and Survival Mode, but I couldn't care less really. I usually play games for their story and when I finished the first level of Savant Ascent (or so I thought) it actually booted me back to the main menu, with the new gameplay modes unlocked. That's it ?! How the hell is that a story ? This game didn't raise the bar for action games. It didn't raise the bar for anything. And not that it's bad, it plays just fine, but it's so just frustratingly short and incomplete.\n\nOh man, Owlboy... Tears are streaming down my face if I just think about how they stopped development just for this game. A terrible mistake. Then again, maybe Owlboy wasn't meant to be.

While you get father and father you seem to get more powerful as you collect CD's yes your a super amazing hand blasting wizard who looks fantastic that runs on the power of music.

That is, you depend on the last abilities to do enough damage, and executing them is really finicky and feels somewhat random. For example, to charge your meter fast enough you have to hold down, while jumping from platform to platform. Sometimes he opts to just jump straight up and land on the same platform, other times he choose to jump from one platform to the next. And, you have no invincibility or anything while in air so it just feels completely random whether you can dodge or not.\nWas enjoyable until last two stages, after that just frustrating and boring.","January 10, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's even a rhythm-based final boss, and I've always had a weakness for a good rhythm-based shooter. Also included are time attack and endless modes.

This is one of the hardest indie games I've played since The Binding of Isaac, but this game is harder in my opinion, although they are two quite different games. Savant Ascent is a very fun game for what it is, which is a indie game with the intentions of being made just to promote Savant's music. This is by far one of the best indie games ive played in a long time. It gives a fun challange, but this challenge is not impossible to overcome. And the challenge doesnt become frustrated as you continue to fail, it begins to get more fun and you begin to get better and better, eventually being able to beat the challange. Savant Ascent is a very good game for 2.00$ i wouldn't pay anymore then 5.00$ for it, but it is still a very fun game and worth trying out if you like challenging indie games such as The Binding of Issac. I will admit this game is not the longest indie game, so keep that in mind, but despite the game's length the game is very fun and challenging and worth a try if you have a couple extra bucks lying around, or even if your looking for a new indie game.","December 1, 2014","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For the price of the game, it is a EXTREMELY well made game, which if put on a mobile platform would put other mobile games to shame. But, even with this game's extreme high points, with it's beautiful art, and beautiful music, the game really is only a time waster. The added modes are helpful in keeping one entertained, however the game does lacks in essence and content. My main complaint is that what should be a more satisfying part of the game (I.E. The Story Mode) feels more like a longer, dragged out version of the Time attack and Endless Modes. I was there where more sections added onto the game, which would allow that final boss to be much more intense and satisfying. I also wish that I knew more about the background lore in the world of which the devs had made. Who was Savant? How is he able to shoot light energy from his hands? and what's the background of the villian, Vario? This game has much potential into being something great, but I would think that the game needs a little bit more content before I consider it a full game. None the less, for the price of a whopping $1.99, I think the game is very much worth giving a try. 7.5/10","July 26, 2014","true","19.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That is normally the hand I just push buttons with.\n\nDid I mention that you can not change the controls??\n\nIf only I could swap the two analog buttons this game would be much more fun for me instead of just frustrating.  The game itself is a good one and the music so far has been great but the deaths do to miss button movement due to my brain being screwed to right handed conformity is lame.\n\nThere is also a keyboard mode but it is hard to bring the CD pieces in for powerups as you have to click on them compared to just pointing the controller and pressing X.  The camera is a bit wierd as well but I assume more unlocks help with management of this.  (part of gameplay as there are warning systems build in to unlocks?)\n\nWorth two bucks to me, but would be worth a whole hell of a lot more if I had the abilty to change controls.  The graphics are 16bit looking but are done well.\n\nI would recommend this game but only for right handed gamers.","November 23, 2014","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your character is the living embodiment of the "glass cannon" archetype, meaning you dish out insane amounts of punishment but die in 3 hits.  There's also an ability early on that encourages you to interrupt your attacks briefly to send out a massive volley of magic-missiles that when paired with the dodging mechanics adds a little bit of strategy to the mix and keeps the game from feeling repetitive or stale.\n+ The music. MY GOD DOES THIS GAME HAVE GOOD MUSIC. You unlock 6 out of the 7 tracks through play (2 are in endless mode ;) ) and they all sound so good that I'm suprised there isn't any way to buy just the music.\n+ It's $2. Even if you somehow manage to not enjoy this game you still haven't lost out on much.  As of the writing of this review its only $1.49 over on the humble bundle, but I don't think anyone would be justified comlaining about the price. It's a steal no matter what you get it for.\n\nTher is one downside though. Only one thing took away from my enjoyment of this game, and it's a combination of a few factors.\n- This game has no fullscreen mode, only windowed.  This isn't too much of a problem, and you can change the resolution from a decent number of presets.  The problem is that the game doesn't lock the cursor into the game window, meaning that if you move you mouse out of the window border while aiming and click, you'll switch to whatever you clicked on, even the desktop. The game DOES pause itself instantly, but the sudden interruption can be frustrating if you're in the zone.  I think the only thing this game needs is either a fullscreen mode or a way to keep your cursor inside the game window (think like in windowed mincraft).\n\nBut that's really the only gripe I can have with this game. If you still don't find it appealing that's fine, but if you're the slightest bit curious then you really should slap down the $2 for this game.  You wont regret it, I promise.","August 16, 2014","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The retro artwork and sprites are polished to hell and back and look glorious. The music is spot on as well, delivering bass dropping beats as you destroy your enemies. The learning curve in the beginning is a bit high, but after you learn how the game works advancing through the rest of the game is a lot of fun. While the game only has a handful of levels that can be beaten within a few hours, it will be a very fun few hours. I highly recommend this game!\n\nYou can see my full review of the game here: http://www.skepticalminotaurgames.com/savant---ascent","April 17, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had no idea what I was stepping into (like most games I get from humble bundles), but I actually really liked it.  You need to focus during this game.  Sure, it looks like a small time indie game, but you need to be fast and quick minded when playing Savant.\n\nYou basically are being attacked from all directions.  You have infinite bullets, and can only occupy two positions.  When getting to the opposite position you can either slide to it or jump to it (basically your dodge ability).  As you kill more enemies, they drop quarters of discs that unlock both new music and new powers.  Once you are dead, you restart from the level you started at on that playthrough, but when you die, all the discs you collected are formed together to create your powers and music.\n\nI was hesitant to recommend this game at first, but it eventually stood up to it's name.  It's fun and worth the buy.  If you're looking for some simple, witty action, then this is your game.

There are a couple of things worth noting before making that steep, steep investment of $2.\n\nWub Wub Wub\nIf you like dubstep, you will love the soundtrack. An integral part of the game is collecting pieces of CDs that simultaneously expands your powers while expanding your listening options.\n\nIf dubstep really isn't your thing, this game won't change your mind. You may be inclided to mute the sound and listen to your own music instead.\n\nYou Will Die - A LOT.\nAt the start of each game, you are allowed to be hit three times before you die. The game saves your progress each time you ascend to the next level, and will start there each time you pick the game back up. Your survival along the way will rely on your ability to dodge and shoot at the same time. The game's fast speed and high degree of difficultly are what make it engaging.  Whether you rise to the challenge or rage quit will depend on your tolerance for it. In fact, a good portion of the game's difficulty arises from the next point.\n\nTight Camera Focus\nThis is the only pure negative I have about the game. The focus of the camera is zoomed in on the character, leaving your surroundings unseen. Your first dozen or so deaths will likely result from the fact that when enemies appear, you aren't even aware of their existence until they attack. This is clearly by design as one of the powers you get will grant you more insight as to when and where they appear by way of flashing the screen and red arrow indicators. It is helpful, but I would much rather have a zoomed out view so I can see everything that's going on.\n\nWhen you shoot, the camera shifts in that direction. When you release, the camera shifts back to the character. If you are attacked from behind while shooting, you won't even know what hit you. WIth this camera shift also comes another, external, hazard. If you are prone to motion sickness, this game will turn your stomach upside-down. It did me. Within minutes, the constant camera shifts might have you clicking the X and grab some ginger root.\n\n\nIf none of the above bothers you, the asking price is an enormous value for a game that lends itself to so much replay and fast, engaging action. Though, how much you like it may depend on your preference for dubstep, tolerance for frequent death, and your ability to keep nausea in check.","November 5, 2014","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very short.\nBut don't get me wrong. It might be short, but it is also very hard and addicting.\nYou will want to test your skills by improving your time and highscore after every failure. And you will fail.\nAt least at the beginning... And then, you will fail again... Ok, you will fail a lot. But you won't give up. The music won't let you.\n\nAnd what about the music? Well, the music is fantastic. It is made by Savant himself. If you don't know him, you can check his music at his YouTube channel (http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5ur2L6Zu4oCShmtFw9UTfQ) or his Soundcloud (https://soundcloud.com/aleksander-vinter). It might look like I'm promoting him or something, but it is worth it. Because you might thank me for that.\n\nLet's talk about the art style now. It is great. It reminds me a lot of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. And if you know what I'm talking about, I don't need to talk about it anymore.\nBut if you don't know what I'm talking about, here is a little summary for you. The art style looks like it draws from Renaissance and Gothic styles of architecture. And thanks to that, some of us might feel nostalgic about this game. Others will say that the style looks good and I can't agree more. I will just add that it is very atmospheric.\n\nSo, is it worth paying the amazing amount of 2 €?\nYes, it is. You will have fun and that's the most important thing about games.","February 15, 2014","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Pretty cool dude. This game is a great homage to his awesomeness. This game is frustrating at first but after about five minutes of gameplay, you will fall in love with its style and flow. The mechanics are pretty good. The colors are nice and vibrant. Story is a little short, but hey its an indie game. You cant ask for too much can you? Anyway my point is this is a nice casual music centered game, pick it up if thats what you are looking for.

A difficulty setting would have been nice to newcomers but the difficulty in the game is there for a good reason. The game is very short. When you've completed the story mode, you will find out that it takes about 5+ minutes more or less to beat the game. Even so, it took me one and half hours to beat the game after many failed attempts. Making the game difficult was obviously a good call so persons can have a longer playthrough of the game, and with enough practice beating the game won't feel as difficult as it first did.\nThe gameplay is pretty simple, basically shoot the enemies while keeping a steady evasion rate, but beware, it's harder than it actually sounds. I find the keyboard and mouse mouse works better than a game controller because the camera moves around the screen very irritatingly with a controller.\nI personally would have liked a longer story mode for the game, at least two levels. The two other modes are great for score attacking but nothing else. Also there are only 2 resolutions, since the artwork of the game is pixel art, if you don't have the supported resolution, there will be a noticeable difference of how well the games looks.\n\nFor $2 you'll be getting a pretty good but very short game. If you're a fan of shoot em up or bullet hell games, you'll definitely love this game. If you're not fan of the genre but like intense games, this is well worth the experience.\n\nRating: 8/10","February 28, 2014","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sure enough, they have and my opinion of the game has changed slightly. I would still only recommend this game to the hardcore gamers, but after figuring out that you can unlock new attacks and skills through collecting golden disks, gameplay got a little easier. But the game never really explains this unless you actually read the description of the disks after you unlock them, which I hadn't done before. Getting one disk in particular (disk 6) is a nightmare for me though because it requires you to play the game's "endless" mode and survive past wave 4 which might sound simple but is truely a test of skill to behold. This is where the game turns into controller breaking frustration as your progess is pretty much halted if you can't get this one disk to acheive the true ending to the game. At $2.99 current price, I'd say pick it up just for the experience at least.\n\n-----\nOld Review:\nPersonally It's not my cup of tea. It's got vibrant animation, great sound track and crisp, clear graphics. It's a fast paced shooter with plenty of thrills and kills to go around. For many people who love bullet hells, you might just like this one. Me on the otherhand feel that the difficulty of this game can rival that of Darksouls, and unfortunately that's a turn off for me. The game is meant to be difficult of course and I'm not faulting it for that, but there are times where there is absolutely nothing you can do to prevent an innevitable death as the enemies clutter up the screen faster than you can shoot them down, and your only means of dodging are jumping between 2 platforms in an effort to get out of the enemy's line of attack. That lack of free-movment unfortunately it was turns me off. It's a nice music based game, but unfortunately I would only recommend it to hardcore gamers.","December 27, 2014","true","19.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Really nice indie game made in GameMaker Studio. Graphics makes this game more retro-styled and it's awesome. Plus, you can collect in-game disc parts and once you have full disc, you will unlock Savant track. Perfectly suited for every battle, every level and you will feel so strong and powerful. Wait. No.. You ARE strong and powerful ! Crushing every enemy with super-powers obtained from discs. Sadly this game is short, BUT, with the new Void update it's slightly longer ! Because, Vario boss was hard for the first time, but if you know what to do, you can easily beat him. And with powers from discs even faster. However, 2 new stages including Void boss has been added with an amazing soundtrack called Overkill. Void is really, really hard to beat and it will take it some time, to learn what to do, and how to NOT get killed. Then, there's a way to obtain ultimate power, endless mode, time attack, and Vario mode. There was also GOATY mode, but they removed it (Maybe it's hidden somewhere, who knows). Well, as I said, it's really fun and cheap ! So if you have 2€, you love epic (dubsteppish) soundtracks, you are bored or perhaps you have nothing to play and you don't know what to buy, this game is for you !\n10/10","June 21, 2015","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really like this game.  No, you don't understand...I REALLY like this game.  It was like a breath of fresh air after trying to play a bunch of boring, generic titles...Savant is anything but boring.  Guy faux victorian hero Savant throwing DBZ style energy blasts while riding an elevator up a tower fighting metal monsters and collecting music while rocking out to the amazing sound track...yeah, not boring.\n\nA lot of people mighty scoff at this game because the basic story mode can be beaten in under ten minutes...however, the game's true fun lies in replays, high scores, time attack, and the endless battle mode.  Savant is a game that is short, but is almost more replayable than a 60 hour rpg because it is just plain fun.  It is arcade fun with an AMAZING sound track.  Even with the apparently short length, I have got to give this game the thumbs up.\n\nBesides, it's 1.99.  That's pocket change for a truly unique, fun game.  I may not put in a huge number of hours in Savant, but I will go back to it, because it is just fun and I don't regret my purchase.  Not one bit.\n\nAlso, my time in this game is about 30 minutes so far, dunno why it's saying zero hours.  Anyway, gonna go play some more.

A difficulty setting would have been nice to newcomers but the difficulty in the game is there for a good reason. The game is very short. When you've completed the story mode, you will find out that it takes about 5+ minutes more or less to beat the game. Even so, it took me one and half hours to beat the game after many failed attempts. Making the game difficult was obviously a good call so persons can have a longer playthrough of the game, and with enough practice beating the game won't feel as difficult as it first did.\nThe gameplay is pretty simple, basically shoot the enemies while keeping a steady evasion rate, but beware, it's harder than it actually sounds. I find the keyboard and mouse mouse works better than a game controller because the camera moves around the screen very irritatingly with a controller.\nI personally would have liked a longer story mode for the game, at least two levels. The two other modes are great for score attacking but nothing else. Also there are only 2 resolutions, since the artwork of the game is pixel art, if you don't have the supported resolution, there will be a noticeable difference of how well the games looks.\n\nFor $2 you'll be getting a pretty good but very short game. If you're a fan of shoot em up or bullet hell games, you'll definitely love this game. If you're not fan of the genre but like intense games, this is well worth the experience.\n\nRating: 8/10","February 28, 2014","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love Savant, so I picked this up, didn't expect it to be a really interesting shooter. So there are gold records in every level on enemies that won't attack you. You gather these records and you unlock special abilities to make the next playthrough easier and easier. The enemies always come in the exact same way, and you can't collect multiple gold records from the same enemy making it a good way to make replaying easier since you won't have to concentrate killing the tough gold record character and instead focus on staying alive until you see a new gold record holder. Plus those records unlock more songs and you can choose which one you want to listen to while playing.

Savant Ascent is the kind of cruel mistress that brings out the most deliriously self-serving masochist from within you, and rewards it with the delicious satisfaction you crave: but only after you have endured every sweet punishment it has thrown at you. If that analogy sounds overtly sexual, then I implore you to view that as a re-enforcement of how devilishly brilliant this game is, and only in some small part as a reflection of my own character.\n\nThe game is not perfect; the difficultly curve is steep, the 'story mode' is a tad short to be called a story, and the final boss is more than a little odd (Although Savant fans will get a kick out of the in-joke reference). However to re-use the previous analogy: she's cheap and you get exactly what you deserve. She's also got some surprises you would never expect, and not in the venereal-infection kind of way!\n\nBuy it, growl at it, then submit.

The limited scope Asteroids style game-play is certainly designed for touch-pad gaming, and translates well enough for PC. However there are moments where I found myself in situations where I couldn't make use of the game's dodge mechanics. Then I found the game ended up being balanced around powers acquired later in the story mode. The bosses is an poorly implemented and often times unfair challenge for the player, and can boil down to rote memorization at times.\n\nIf you get this game just get it for a five-minute time-waster of some kind.

In order to avoid some enemy attacks, you have to jump and dodge, and cannot simply move anywhere you want to on the screen. In any given stage, you have 2 areas side-by-side (hyphens are useful as hell, aren't they?) in which you can stand and shoot.\n\nThe game starts out hard due to the fact that your powers are garbage to begin with. In order to unlock new powers, you must kill special enemies who drop CD pieces that you scoop up with a chain whip grappling hook gimmick. You will die....a lot....but your powers stay with you into the next life, and the game lets you start your next life from the same stage you got to last. Takes the sting out of it nicely and keeps you from ragequitting!\n\nIf you like twin-stick shooters, touhou shmups (that really is a silly "word"), or just plain difficult games, you might find this to be a solid shoot-em-up type of experience for 2 bucks.

On top of that the game is well made to the description it is given. somhow the  developers manage to nearly seemlessly meld the game and the epic soundtrack. that by itself is awesome, not to mention the entertainment factor of the gameplay which, once you get used to it, can be an exceptionally enjoyable experience. Even if the campain playstyle becomes too easy the time attack and endless mods provide an interesting twist. Personally I'm a fan of the endless mode due to the exponential increase in dificulty as you go through an endless version of the second stage. Although the time attack is interesting in the sense that it challenges you to complete the story as fast as you can. The only real drawback to the game is how short the story mode is. but all things considered, if you like arcade games that include shooting and dodging then you won't find many games that surpass this one.","May 5, 2014","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Savant Ascent is the kind of cruel mistress that brings out the most deliriously self-serving masochist from within you, and rewards it with the delicious satisfaction you crave: but only after you have endured every sweet punishment it has thrown at you. If that analogy sounds overtly sexual, then I implore you to view that as a re-enforcement of how devilishly brilliant this game is, and only in some small part as a reflection of my own character.\n\nThe game is not perfect; the difficultly curve is steep, the 'story mode' is a tad short to be called a story, and the final boss is more than a little odd (Although Savant fans will get a kick out of the in-joke reference). However to re-use the previous analogy: she's cheap and you get exactly what you deserve. She's also got some surprises you would never expect, and not in the venereal-infection kind of way!\n\nBuy it, growl at it, then submit.

He has released 7 LPs and 3 Eps since 2012. If you're a fan of his music you probably already know this, if not you should look him up on youtube. I am a fan of the songs "Butterfly", "Melody Circus", and "ISM", all of which are featured in Ascent.\n\nSavant - Ascent is essentially a a bullethell game,, except that you don't have freedom of movement--you can only move between two locations. It's really short--the story mode is like 10 minutes if you don't die. That said, it's also really challenging, and between the time trial and the endless modes, there is a really good amount of replayability for such a cheap game.\n\nThe music is great, obviously, although it's a shame that there isn't more interaction between the game and the music. In summation, this is a challenging, addictive and fun game, and I would recommend it to any fans of Savant.","April 12, 2014","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art work was interesting and in the most recent update the "intro" scene gives the player an idea of the storyline behind the game all the while leaving a sense of mystery. Gameplay is indeed fast as it took me about 15 minutes to actually beat the game. However, replayability is present in the scoreboards for highscores, timed runs, and other various features of the game.\n\nThat being said I would have liked to see more from the developers in the aspect of the music. Considering the fact that it is crucial to the gameplay, I would have liked to see more tracks available to play. It would add a lot more replayability in my opinion. However that is not enough to knock it down in my recommendation.
