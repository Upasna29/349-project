Oddly, despite looking quite nice, the maze’s layout isn’t very distinct, which resulted in me walking in a circle five times before getting anywhere.  But the satisfaction I felt when stumbling across a rotten fishing dock, or the aging ruins of a forsaken hut, made up for it.\n\nThe puzzles are nothing to write home about. They don’t break from the norm, but they get the job done. Sometimes quantity surpasses quality. They’re simple, fun and they don’t hold your hand.\n\nThe monster, again, is nothing special. He will occasionally present himself in random areas of the maze, sometimes through a guttural cry of agony, or a sudden leap from the tall grass. He isn’t too scary, per say, but knowing that he may appear at any moment forced me into an uneasy haste.\n\nI managed to beat The Last Nightmary in a little under an hour, BUT there is still a large majority of content I haven’t discovered yet. In fact, the game itself encourages players to run through it multiple times. I ended up with the ‘GOOD’ ending, but I’m definitely gonna give the game a few more tries.\n\nLastly, the English translation isn’t the best. Anyone who’s grasped the language will spot a fair amount of mistranslations in the game’s text. But, seeing as this was developed by a group of college kids from Brazil, I’m still satisfied with the outcome.\n\nTo sum it all up, The Last Nightmary is a fun, simple horror experience that should keep you interested from beginning to end. I assume you can soak up 3 to 4 hours of this game if you attempt to unlock all the endings and secrets. For its asking price, I’d say it’s worth a buy.","November 4, 2015","true","3.6"," 46 of 51 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","46","51","3","0"

Why last, you ask? Well, she is lost in the haunted forest where a cursed creature is that is killing all virgin Mary. As the last one surviving, she doesn't gave up on hope and it's up to you what it's gonna happen, the game has various endings.\n\nGameplay-wise it's a point and click adventure game that went many years back in terms of the technical quality. Most of the screens are just copypasted with few changed details, as they are composited into a small maze. There isn't any proper animation, you just blink through the screens from first-person view. The story is there but it's just a slightly more thought in compare to a porn screenplay.\n\nWhat is the main thing about The Last NightMary, is the horror atmosphere, that has been built well and gives you a reason to be scared, since you can really die. Well, at least for the first few moments, since you can always escape the creature really easily.\n\nIt's a short adventure game (~30 minutes to get the basic "good" ending) that doesn't offer much interesting story, is missing a features that are axiomatic for the P&C adventure genre (your cursor isn't even highlighted if you point an item to any object in the scene) and is based purely on the atmosphere. But that's not enough entertainment, considering that you'll be mostly  walking through the copypasted maze scenes.\n\nFun fact: If you check the game's screenshots, you have already seen majority of the game scenes.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","February 27","false","4.9"," 38 of 61 people (62%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","62","38","61","4","0"

I personally found it very creepy and disturbing. The puzzles aren't all that complicated, it's more of a run around and collect things kind of game.\n\nThe biggest knock against the game is how long it is. It took me just under an hour to complete it and get the  "Good" ending. There is some replay value in multiple endings as well as a new secret to uncover (No spoilers! :D) during the second playthrough.\n\nAltogether I'd say it was worth it and it gets my recommend, but beware that it is somewhat of a short adventure!","November 4, 2015","true","1.2"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

It presents an unsettling atmosphere which compliments the way the story was told. The "monster" presented no threats to me during my entire play session and its movement patterns made no sense in regards to the protagonist's navigation of the maze. Unfortunately the main downside to this game is its length. It feels more like a demo than an entire game. It felt like a tease for something bigger that never got fleshed out.\n\nIt's weird. To some extent I enjoyed what I played but felt unfulfilled and disappointed in the end. I'd still recommend the game because despite its downfalls, it's definitely not a terrible game. I'd go as far as to say that the developer should definitely take their skills and make a game with a more expansive scope. If the gameplay in regards to the "monster" was fleshed out some more or required some sort of actual skill to avoid him, I'd have a greater feeling of satisfaction. They also need to get a better English translator.\n\nThere are multiple endings apparently but I can assure you the second ending I achieved felt even less fulfilling than the first. I'll pass on playing this multiple times again since the gameplay itself was lacking for me to begin.","December 19, 2015","true","6.5"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","13","20","2","0"

A short horror puzzel game. A bit to short I think. I finished it 2 times and the second time there where a few new things and it seems you can get different endings depending on what information you get and what you do. But I really did not get that invested to try and find it all. But I liked the atmosphere of the game.","March 9","true","1.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

There's a bit of anxiety present, namely from what amounts to a "timer" on the screens - linger too long, and ~the scarrrry monnnnster~ approaches, requiring you to quickly leave the screen and come back - but not much in the way of actual horror, just a bit of spooky atmosphere here and there.\n\nThere's worse games out there, but there are far better ones too. $0.64 on sale is an okay price, especially if you're into trading cards, but there's also better MystLike gaming experiences to be had for free. Give it a bit of a bump if you're a speaker of Portuguese and are hungry for more native-Portuguese games on Steam, but otherwise, don't expect much here. I'd give the guy a passing grade on his Visual Arts final, with no reservations, but I can't give this a thumbs up.","May 30","false","2.0"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

I played the game in windowed mode, and I did also find some issues with some text, especially during the endings, being cut off. I didn't try it in full screen, so that may be a better option for gameplay. Finally, the last problem that really shows up is that the game was originally in Portuguese, and while the translation is mostly good, there's still some problems, and the endings and journal entries, in particular, really could have improved writing to flow better in English.\n\nAll that said, the game is ultimately meant to be scary, and the game goes about it in a way that is fairly straightforward, but really effective. The sound of the demon (of sorts) in the game approaching is fairly unpredictable (if not random), but it gives the game a frantic pace, and since I started playing this in the middle of the night, it did a good enough job for me to stop playing until it would be daylight.\n\nOverall, for a few bucks it's a decent (although not great) storyline and a pretty effective scare the first few run throughs.","May 25","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/apochweiss/recommended/407300/","apochweiss","ApochsDotNet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/apochweiss/","1846 products in account","QUICK THOUGHTS: While it isn't necessarily a BAD game, it's just pretty boring. The main game moves along through two maps. The first is an outdoors map where the only real landmarks are a random plant or one of six dead Mary's strewn about as your being chased by a "demon", and the other a log cabin where you have to perorm a ritual in order to survive. It's easy to get lost in the first map, not to mention overlook the key you need, and that's the biggest flaw. No map exists, so you have to rely on memory in a land that all looks the same.\n\nOther than the fairly bland surroundings, the game's mechanics work well enough. You click the direction you want to go at key spots on the screen, you pick up items like a hidden object style title, and solve random puzzles in typical adventure game fashion, once in a while relying on you to combine things you picked up. The soundtrack isn't bad either, and the monster that chases you isn't all that bad.\n\nI received both the bad ending and the good ending, and have litlle interest in playing it again to get the "alien" object. But, if you pick this up, know that there are walkthroughs that will help you find the items and paths you need (mostly in Russian though) so use them like I had to in order to figure out what I need and overlooked.","March 8","false","1.7"," 2 of 13 people (15%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","15","2","13","0","0"

I love this kind of game....  Point and click adventures are exactly what got me back into gaming as an adult.   And, I love interesting artsy style graphics and creepy stories.  However, I have to be honest... no save feature really, and I mean REALLY ticks me off.  I don't care if the game takes five minutes or twenty million hours to complete, EVERY game needs a save feature.  Reason?  Real life.  I just hate that.  I played for a little while last night and had to go unexpectedly.  I was AFK for a while while it sat here waiting for my return and it was too late to continue when I got back, so of course, all progress lost.  I really really HATE that.

The puzzles were bland and didn't feel rewarding. The monster was boring and didn't really prevent me from getting through the game at all. I don't want to sound too harsh, but it just didn't leave a good taste in my mouth, in a way that a horror game should. The point and click style was alright, didn't really get fleshed out as much as I'd like. Scenary was drawn well, albeit repeatative. Translation was the worse part. I understand it's by developers that don't speak English as their first language, and it's not an English focused game, I am fine reading subtitles but the translation from Portuguese to English was God awful. The context and tense in the language was messed up to the point that it took away from any horror/creepiness the game even possessed.\n\nTL;DR - Game is not that great. Unoriginal. Story is forgettable. Not really worth $7 IMO. Try The Park for a better short horror game.","November 7, 2015","false","2.5"," 13 of 39 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","13","39","0","0"
