The demo covers tthe first act of three in the game. I was interested by the Ghibli-styled horror, and the first act delivered some chilling moments. However, after the first act I felt the game tone the horror down. Nothing really comes after you and the sense of dread is replaced by wonder, which is alright by I really wanted a horror experience, especially after the first act. The third act is item fetching and LOTS of repetition, and the horror elements are completely sapped.\n\nThe story is interesting, but not without poor writing. Lots of unneccessary characters and too many unexplained details. It's not hard to figure out what exactly happened by the end, but there are questions that will nag at you.\n\nThis game has incredible visuals for a 2D game. The characters are well designed and the locations are incredible. This and the amazing soundtrack are the best parts about this game.\n\nGameplay is alright. You have a run button to go places faster and there is one instance where you have the option to jump. Puzzles are way too easy. There's only one or two instances where you might die, so the rest plays like an interactive novel.","August 28, 2015","true","2.0"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","33","36","0","0"

There's a reason for the way it is presented, and it may or may not become apparent to the player as the story goes on. The concept of the story is pretty good. Although I already knew most of what was going to happen, the ending still shocked me and made me pretty emotional.\n\nStrong points\n- Story, graphics and music. The last two appears to be well thought out and designed to fit each other and the story itself. Among the three, the music garners my interest the most.\n\nWeak point\n- The Theater. From what I experienced, it has to be done in a rather specific sequence. Otherwise, if you messed one part up and saved over your only save file, you have to restart the game all over again since you can't gain that one item back.\n\nRecommendation to potential players\n- Keep one save file at the start of the Theater before interacting with anyone so that you don't have to restart the entire game if you mess up by accident.","April 7","true","2.3"," 27 of 27 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","27","27","0","0"

Ultimately, I can absolutely recommend it.\n\nThe music and art alone is worth more than 3$. The music is full of expression, and the art is incredibly surprising, considering it's an RPG maker title.\n\nThe gameplay itself is what made this so hard for me. The game played well enough, but when it came to your objective, it was needlessly difficult(Lack of detail.) The ending, though, is what bothered me. You play through the same scene(Same for the most part) five or so times, unless you mess up and need to do it more. It was VERY annoying.\n\nBut the story and it's expression made up for that, hands down. The characters are absolutely wonderful, and although it didn't scare me in the least, the creepy atmosphere never died down. If you are a fan of short stories(Especially creepy-pasta type stories), this game is perfect for you, as well as admirers of art and music. This game has a quality far surpassed 3$.\n\nTLDR, 8/10. Great music, great art, okay gameplay, incredible characters and great story.

But you realize only after her entering the house that she still has your scarf, which is really dear to your heart, so you enter Cat's house to find her and ask her for your scarf.\nWhile the short introduction also plays an important part in understanding the whole story, the real content of the game starts after entering the house.  On your left you see a blind girl, eyes covered with bandages, holding a camera, meekly asking you if she could take a photo of you...  and then you can pick your save slot :)  The game developers really cleverly implemented, and inserted the savepoint system in the game that it's actually a person, who appears at numerous spots during the game, always reflecting to your current actions - it's wonderfully immersive\n\nAfter speaking to her, you see footprints on the ground, which lead deeper into the house.\nThe game consists of three different parts of the house, three chapters - each really different from the other ones, they build on the previous ones but there's a common thing in them - they are all has their own creepy characters, themes and actions that can send shivers down one's spine.  Each chapter gives you a clear goal, and you can reach it by completing smaller goals, sometimes puzzles.  The characters of the house had a similar feeling to me like in Silent Hill - they do have a strong resemblance to asian, or rather japanese horror-creatures, but what sets the macabre tone the best is that they are all clever, thinking - and has no real intention of hurting you. But, if it's possible, they won't let you go.\nThe game only has one point when you can die while you're just walking around, but it's more like an event, like a QTE is for a game - and it has a save point just before it, so it's safe to say that while saving is advised, it's not easy to get yourself killed. Which is nice, because you'll be able to spend more time exploring the house, and to see VCR-like short video-cuts appear, that unravels a little more about the story, while conveniently raising the creepy-factor a LOT.\nI don't want to spoi the story, especially as the game is short, can be completed in three hours and it's really worth to be experienced rather than just told about. But as it can be guessed from the lack of combat, the game's story revolves around pretty serious matters, and it's elements presented through the game's symbols, with the whole story explained at the end. While the third, last chapter got pretty tedious compared to the first two, the game really did a great job by not making the story overly simplistic, and at the same the explanation was presented in a way that does not make the player feel stupid for not getting it during the game.\n\nWhile the art style seemed a little at first (the characters are pretty big compared to the environment) the game did a perfect job at introducing, then gradually unfold and solve a story while making me feel intrested, weirded out, or at some points just staring onto the screen.  I've got the game from a bundle that cost maybe 1.5$ ; but I think if someone's looking for a more creepy-weird, than a scary horror and finds the art direction attractive, I can absolutely recommend the game even at full price.  It's done with RPGMaker but uses own art, has a great soundtrack and has a really nice story with a proper ending that's quite memorable.  It was a great experience for me.","March 29","true","5.1"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","23","24","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/385330/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","There's a surprising number of RPG Maker horror games, if you've never looked. Most ditch the RPG trappings entirely in favor of a minimalist retro-2D walking simulator style, and most of those tend to be boring or poorly designed. But every once in awhile you'll find a gem in the pile, and Stray Cat Crossing is one of those gems.\n\nYour lovingly-rendered character happens across a small girl wandering the road at night. The girl, Cat, runs off with your treasured scarf and you follow her all the way home like the worst sort of creeper just to get it back. Don't feel bad, though, because her house is full of all kinds of nightmare beings. SCC is a surreal adventure game through symbolic realms of guilt and loss, expressed in a magnificently detailed and colorful art style. Characters are memorable, environments are vivid, and the atmosphere is excellent.\n\nThe sound design is on point as well, but the real stand-outs are the bizarre video clips the game hits you with periodically. Every once in awhile, you'll be interrupted by a short scene that looks cut from the VHS tape in The Ring. These sequences are incredibly jarring and effective. I am not a fan of jumpscares in the least, but these felt well thought-out and earned. They add immeasurably to the atmosphere and help hint at future story beats, as well.\n\nThe story itself is quite good, managing to dabble heavily in symbolism and moralizing without falling into the traps other games often do. There's nothing forced or heavy-handed about the plot developments, and you tend to catch up with things as your tight-lipped protagonist does. The one place the game stumbles is in the puzzles, which start off strong and clever but end on some sour notes. The final sequence is honestly quite clever as well, but in a way that's not actually very fun to get through. It comes at the very end, though, so at that point there's no reason not to power through for the satisfying finale.\n\nYou'll finish the game in two hours or so, which is perfectly fine considering the price. They're a tense and emotional two hours that would be worth experiencing just for the cast and atmosphere. Luckily, the whole game pulls together to form something I can whole-heartedly recommend.","October 11, 2015","true","2.3"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","23","24","0","0"

What a wild ride! Stray Cat Crossing not only has amazing art and music, but also a story telling style that will get your heart racing and it will be on your mind even after you have finished the game.\n\nOverview\nAt the first glance at this game, the store page screenshots show that the art style is very unique and eccentric. Having played the game I absolutely agree that the art style played a huge part in creating the atmosphere and immersion of the game. It's made with RPGMaker, however the loving care put into the art, as well as its detail and quality, make it hard to notice the engine at all.\n\nStory thoughts\nThe story is about a girl Cat, that got lost. I really don't want to spoil anything by giving out details, as the story is a crucial part of this story, and emotionally impactful. I'll say that it's a story about memories and the past, kind of like To the Moon's themes. The way the story is implemented is quite outstanding, with different layers to getting to  "what actually happened". In the end the story is revealed bit by bit, with symbolism and twists of reality. It indeed is very thought provoking and I'm still thinking about the events that happened and what the story is trying to say. I absolutely love games/ shows/ anime that do this! What came to mind after playing was Spirited Away by Studio Ghibli, and after this thought occurred to me I looked up the developer's site and it's listed as one of the influences. So kudos to them for conveying the atmosphere right!\n\nGame play thoughts\nThe game play is generally very smooth, involving puzzles and some chase scenes. I had a lot of fun with the puzzles, and the difficulty is about just right for a game heavily focusing on story - made me use my brain but didn't make me overly frustrated. The first 2 acts are great, the 3rd drags out but felt worth it. However a gripe I had was the speed of talking which is on the slow side and unskippable. The game froze sometimes after saving (thankfully after saving not before!) But looking at an FAQ unfortunately this is due to some problem with the RPGMaker engine, and will not be game breaking on most machines.\n\nRandom tips\n1. The chase scene seems hard at first but don't give up! It's actually quite short. You can only jump over the small holes.\n2. The OST is free, included in the game files!\n\nConclusion\nStray Cat Crossing is a game with great storytelling, with a dark and creepy atmosphere. If you're looking for a thought provoking and emotionally impactful game, look no further! In addition the unique art style and soundtrack will draw you right in. I highly recommend this game - it's a steal at its asking price on Steam.","April 24","true","2.6"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

The characters you meet are interesting and very different from those you typically would expect to find.

I read really fast and felt like I was waiting for the game often when I was done reading.\nAct III is more of a chore than it is fun and drags out the last part of the game easily to at least 1.5 times what you've already done in the first 2 acts.\nOverall the game is a great little adventure for a Sunday morning/afternoon and the price isn't bad for what the game is.\n\nThis game deserves a 8/10 for what it is, based on story, price, and entertainment factor.","April 10","true","2.3"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

Of course, I was surprised who the actual "cat" was and how the real cat had such a trivial role. By saying that, I don't mean it in a bad way.\nThe soundtrack is definitely the best part of the game, it's very atmospheric and I would really be able to listen to it when I'm in need of some good instrumentals. I also very much loved the mini-animated clips when the screen would randomly turn to static; the first time it creeped the hell out of me lol; but they're very artistic.\nThis is a rpg mostly focused on gathering "pieces" that make off the overall story and so, most part of the game is going to be focused on puzzles. I personally am a very big fan of these types of rpgs and this one was not a disappointment in that particular area. I had fun trying to solve the puzzles and I didn't find them particularly brain wrecking, so don't worry. Just take a bit of time and you'll manage to solve them on your own.\nI have to also praise the writing when it comes to the dialogues/monologues between the twins. They were, to say the least, fantastic! It really reminded me of TweedleDee and TweedleDum of Alice in Wonderland. Maybe there was a refference there, though I don't know. XD I would be able to relate this game with Alice in Wonderland for some elements, mostly because on some parts it's quite "unique" and "twisted". But don't expect a girl in a blue dress and a white rabbit. That you won't get. It's more of a "feeling".\nThe thing that I'm disappointed in though, is the ending and the revelation of what truly happened. I can't exactly say why; maybe on one side I found it a bit "trivial" and "too simple". There wasn't any big revelation in the ending, just didn't have enough impact to care about it properly. And it was kind of annoying to repeat the same scene at the end for like 5 times without able to at least skip on the already read text.\nBut overall I still recommend it. 3$ is not much, and it deserves them.\n\nOther games like this one that I would like to recommend if anybody's interested are: Ib, Mad Father, Witch's House and the Crooked Man.","September 13, 2015","true","2.9"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

Music was especially effective, very nice job.\n\nMy one critique is that some of the puzzles seemed to take an unnecessary amount of time. I got the thematic point of all the repetition required, but from an actual gameplay perspective it got a little tiresome, especially when I could see easy ways the issues could have been resolved. It's fine not to give clear instructions and let us figure it out, but then figuring it out became tedious. For example, the movement speed reduction during the bird bath puzzle, making us go through the play repeatedly, making us pick up the rose to get the ticket every time, making us go through that conversation with the crying Cat oooover and ooover and ooover. Some of those options should have just stayed in effect so we could move forward once completing something correctly.

Why you need this scarf so much and just why this house seems to hold so many nightmares within is soon explained in three parts.\n\nAdmittedly, I was waiting for Stray Cat Crossing since greenlight and now that it's out (and cheap) I was happy to play it. You'll be able to play this in one sitting. At the most, you'll do three hours if you're getting stuck. You probably won't.\n\nThere's no real combat in this game other than fleeing from a few monsters. Most of the time you'll be scratching your head over some moderate brain benders, but nothing is really too tricky in this game. The hardest puzzle is the red larvae passwords and that shouldn't be too hard if you listen to the other hints from the larva and try to draw connections to the storyline in that area. You'll figure it out eventually, I promise.\n\nThis game is unusually storyline-rich. There's less gore and less emphasis on the jumpscares (they are there, however, but tend to pop up only in relevance to what you're doing) and more on figuring out Cat's story. I find that some RPG horror games can overdo it on the scaring you out of your skin aspect. This game seeks to disturb you and keeps you involved by introducing these figures in Cat's life. You're immediately shown that Cat feels guilty over something, but why? What is wrong with this tiny little girl and why are you chasing her through this nightmare house that Tim Burton might rent for a summer vacation?\n\nThe music is rather beautiful in the game. I was disappointed to not hear the trailer music anywhere (I'll live!), but every level was delightful. Leaving the game on pause for a quick break wasn't a nightmare. I can see (and hear) the effort. The jumpscare cutscenes are animated very well and while not something that certainly scared me, but made me feel uncomfortable and with an impending sense of doom. I preferred that over screaming in horror. I loved the design of the characters and how other-worldly they felt. While the main character was the only "normal" person there, supposedly, they also had a special look to them as well, which made me feel like there was something more.\n\nNow that I've lavished praise, let me talk about my dislikes of the game. I was reduced to only using the arrow keys. A mild annoyance and once I was able to sprint, I didn't complain as much. It gave me a reason to rest my hands across the keyboard. However, after only using the jump function for one part of the game, it was relatively useless. I would have loved to see it again after I had mastered it. (Because that is one angry fetus monster and he did eat me a few times!)\n\nSince I'm a handicapped gamer and I often make reference to it, there is quite a bit of flashing graphics in this game. Do not, by any means, play this game if you are prone to seizures. This game may cause severe migraines. Please take a break and do not play straight through. Otherwise, it wasn't too awful. It's not so much a negative as I was neutral on it. Not my favorite, but if I could have turn it off, I would have loved to.\n\nWhat I loved the most from Stray Cat Crossing is that I didn't expect needing to grab a box of tissues by the end. I was sobbing. I was hugging my laptop and sobbing. I've already mentioned it, but allow me to do so again. The storyline really has a lovely build up. You're already piecing together the truth, but once everything is revealed and you have your confirmation of Cat's life, you will feel like your heart is being ripped out. With emotional lines and capturing the feelings of love between family members and friends, Stray Cat Crossing has a theme of love and never forgetting your past, even if it gives you some of the greatest pain you can ever endure.\n\nPlay it. It's a good way to blow off two hours and it really is cheap. You won't get your typical horror rocks off from it, but it's a much more artsy style of horror.\n\nFrom what I saw of the ending? I hope that means the story really isn't over. Not just yet.","September 6, 2015","true","3.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The music makes it even more creepy and the art is bloody beautiful. Unfortunately, it took me months to finish playing this lovely game since I'm a lazy nuthead and I would be lying if I said that it wasn't a confusing experience for me. The puzzles were nice; not too easy or too tough. The characters were interesting except of the MC. I did like little Cat, though. I could relate to her because (running away from home, feeling unneeded and worthless). Yes, I still feel like a kid in my twenties. The boy with a camera (to be honest, I thought it was a girl) reminds me of Flaky from Happy Tree Friends. I wish I'd get to know his name at least. He was there for Cat when no one else was.\nThis whole game is about letting your past go. Humans make mistakes and it's natural. Someone always ends up getting hurt one way or another. Sometimes there's nothing you can do or say to make things better. Even when it makes you feel useless and you start hating on yourself - just stop right there. You can't beat yourself up over everything you do. That's life, unfortunately. It takes long to learn how to live. Too long. How many of you people are truly happy? I'm not talking about material happiness. Appreciating and cherishing what you have is a good start. 2deep4you? I beg your pardon. You could listen to blaberings of an idiot or you could do whatever you feel is best for you (don't do drugs, kids). I never take my own advices and that's why I'm an idiot. I'm a sad human being. All in all - gg, bee gee. Staying alive and all.\nI guess, curiosity didn't kill the Cat.","January 6","true","4.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

The Alice in Wonderland vibe I got from the game hooked me for good and I was definitely interested in the final product upon release. This purchase did not leave me disappointed.\n\nYou start off as an unamed girl merely being a decent human being to a lost child named Cat by escorting her home, and when you reach your destination you're pulled into a house of mysterious creatures and settings as you discover just who Cat is. Now, I'm not familiar with games made from RPG maker - though I have heard some negative things - but in my opinion this is one of the better ones. The pixel art is indeed gorgeous and well done (the cutscenes served their purpose well too), and the puzzles were a perfect balance of "Oh, I know this," and "Hmm, gotta actually think." It's not really horror in the traditional sense of inducing fear, but I suppose one could see some of the creatures and actions as disturbing. The soundtrack was hauntingly perfect and set the mood for everywhere the protagonist traveled, and as the plot unfolded before my eyes I was surprised in a bittersweet way.\n\nThe only gripes I had with this game is the keyboard layout and steam overlay. Although the controls are few and simple (up, down, left, right to move, enter/space to interact, shift to run, and A to jump), there was only the one scene where jump was introduced that I had trouble with. It felt awkward using shift and A at the same time and I wish I could've changed the jump command from A to space, but I managed through the scene. As for the steam overlay it's nonexistent, and while it's not necessarily a bad thing, it would've been nice to know that attempting to screenshot via F12 would actually bring me back to the menu screen and I hadn't saved for a while.\n\nAll in all, I could totally see this game extended a bit since I was left with a few questions, but for $2.99 and roughly 2 hours of gameplay I definitely recommend Stray Cat Crossing. It's a short but good one.","August 28, 2015","true","3.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

They're kind of jarring and don't really fit with the game and aren't particularly scary.\n-The plot doesn't progress organically. It makes an abrupt jump from creepy 2spooky4u to generic "solve the mystery" style adventure game. When the game's plot goes from vague to specific it becomes overly specific and kind of removes the mystery while still trying to present the story in a vague way. It gets tedious fast.\n-The end of the game becomes very tedious and boring as on your first try you will end up replaying the same segment over and over as it's trial and error based.\n\nOverall it's not bad for an RPG Maker game. The creators did a really good job of creating an atmosphere using a medium that doesn't really allow for much variety in gameplay or presentation. It's worth trying out the demo at the very least but keep in mind that it's a <2hr RPG Maker game before you buy it.","December 6, 2015","true","2.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What got me so interested are those 2 doll character. Their dialogue is some of the best i've ever heard. Sadly, they are just a small portion of the game, and though the game was fun with some interesting puzzles, i'm not sure if i'd recommend it since the ending (not sure if there are more than mine) was sort of odd, and some puzzles can be irritating more than anything. The last stage also repeats itself over and over till you do the right things and you'll have to repeat atleast 3 times which is just annoying.\n\nThe game is short, really short, if you look at my gameplay hours, so if the price is right for you is hard to say.\n\nAll in all, it was worth playing for the story, but you might want a guide because it can be really hard solving some stuff.\nAgain, this is pure story. Know what you're paying for. Hell, the dialogue for those two dolls was worth the money itself, but that is entirely my personal opinion.","September 27, 2015","true","4.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The visuals are so much better than Ib or Witch's House or really any of those games; SCC has a beautiful art style that perfectly fits the dreamlike quality of the game, and the soundtrack is absolutely stunning. It is at times reminiscient of movie scores by Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor (Gone Girl, The Social Network, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo), eerie and discordant, and at times creepy carnival music—an appreciated cliché.\n\nIt's not a particularly scary game after you complete the first "stage," but it does maintain a very unsettling atmosphere the entire time. You even feel, in the best way possible, faintly unsettled after the ending.\n\nWhat I really enjoy about SSC is that it doesn't hold your hand through the puzzles. Often when I play RPG maker games it feels like I'm just constantly being spoon-fed instructions, and it takes away from the actual fun of the gameplay. Of course, there is the opposite problem of not being given any direction and subsequently becoming really lost, but SCC's puzzles were never so difficult as to frustrate me and detract from the immersion. Instead, you feel satisfied for solving something on your own in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nThe story itself wasn't anything incredible; by around halfway through the game, I felt like I already (mostly) knew what was going on. However, the game's symbolism of that story is awesome. I plan on going back and playing it a second time just so I can fully appreciate the rich imagery, as well as little details hidden in book titles and whatnot.\n\nAlthough the characters weren't particularly compelling, esp. the main character, I didn't mind at all. SCC felt like playing a work of art; it didn't need a 3D main character to make the game interesting. The visuals, gameplay and symbolism were more than enough to make SCC an enjoyable experience.\n\nTL;DR - Great game. Amazing atmosphere and music. Rich symbolism and imagery. Good, smart gameplay.

The game follows up a really strict pattern, each place in the house has it story, characters and puzzles and you go trough them as the story guides you.\n\nThe gameplay isn't really the focus here, and when the developers try make it the focus they fail. As you can see in the game description, Stray Cat Crossing was made using the RPGMaker and the game have a little list of flaws because of it as little freezes, crashes and others who are more bad design choices like the infamous escape from the basement or the loop sequence at the attic.\n\nThe game REALLY shines through the story and the things related such as the visuals and music. Going against the preconception of games made through the RPGMaker, this one uses really good looking assets and the art style is really unique, it is creepy but in a way that fires up your curiosity and the same can be said of the music. The plot that starts quite simple at its premise evolves quickly on the 2 hour long game into a sweet story about what is a family and how much love can change bad feelings such as guilt and regret.\n\nAlthough not perfect, this game is great and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes this kind of short experiences.

The game itself was a semi-memorable experience. Is it horror? Not really. Were there jump scares? A few. Most reviewers have commented on the Alice in Wonderland vibe as well as the more Ghibli-esque elements so I won't mention those here.\n\nOne mechanic I found interesting, albeit frustrating, occurs during the first level with Baby face. Once you complete "favors for favors" you are presented with verbose seemingly redundant dialogue. If the player scrolls through too quickly they will auto-select "yes" to a question that ulitmately ends the game. While annoying for some, this mechanic caused me to slow down and take note of the game design's self awareness.\n\n--Aesthetic, SCC knows who it is and what it's going for. Overall, I felt it was similar to "The Witch's House" with much nicer graphics.\n--Story itself was fairly predictable, no "twists" or "turns" to really speak of.\n--Dialogue was average\n--Level design was enjoyable until the third arc which was repititive with little to no payoff.\n--Replayability: little to none\n\nTL;DR: I sound hyper critical but the game was an enjoyable experience. For only 2.99 it does, relatively, what it sets out to do which is provide the player with a creepy visual novel of sorts. There aren't many decisions in the game per se, routes and end goals are ultimately highlighted for the player.

But she forgets to return your scarf and THATS where all the creepy things happen. The first act (or the basement segment) is creepy and horrifying, the second act (or the garden) is mesmerizing but heartbreaking (okay, that’s not the word... guilt tripping?), and as for the next ones, I hope they'll be as amazing as the first two were.\n\nThis game is simply awesome.","August 29, 2015","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There isn't much in the way of challange to it but that's alright. The core of the gameplay can be summed up as bumping from point A to point B, interacting with something or someone in order to advance the story. There are several puzzles thrown in to spice things up a bit, which is certainly a welcome decision. Everything is pretty straightforward, though, so there is little chance to get stuck for more than a couple of minutes at the same point. The single exception to this could be a small but very unforgiving action sequence (which I sincerely hope is tonned down at some point).\n\nThe story is intriguing, though the game never really takes the time to explain some details and lets the player imagination fill the gaps. The music is great and adds a lot to the ambience. The art is nice too and has a lot of personality. The backgrounds can get a bit repetitive, but they are populated with big, detailed props which really help to ease that feeling. All these elements feel well integrated with nice shadowing arround them and simple lighting effects livening things up a bit. The sound effects are maybe a bit lacking, with very simple PSG-like samples played to give feedback about things like locked doors.\n\nAs for the tone of the game, it certainly fits the horror label in the beginning. But this aspect is progressively downplayed and the final act pretty much drops it completly. If you come expecting a traditional horror experience you may feel disapointed.\n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed this title and found it's release price very fitting. My compliments to the developers.","August 30, 2015","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Eh go ahead and call it a sightseeing tour.  I still liked it a little.\n\nPart 3\nI'm not sure what to say about this one.  It has problem solving through time paradox which I'm normally a strong supporter of but there's just something about this part I find off.  Maybe it's just the pile of crystal swans I had piling up in my pockets.\n\nEpilogue\nPretty good.  If there's more than one I would appreciate knowing.  There is that suspicious line of events that I think I completed but I've seen some games that cut things and forgot to cut what led to them causing confusion and possibly major bugs.\nAt least it wasn't a bug.","September 2, 2015","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The last one starts out alright, but becomes an absolute cacophony halfway through and never recovers.\n- Unintentionally hilarious rather than scary. Horror generally gets to me pretty easily. SCC is one of the first times I've never come close to being scared - after an initial surprise, the game's attempts at nightmarish visions and monstrous transformations were just funny.\n- Where there's quests, there's fetch quests.\n\nFor the price, it's probably worthwhile just to experience the madness for an hour or two. I can't call it good, but it's undeniably entertaining in the right mood.","October 24, 2015","false","2.6"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","10","19","2","1"

The art isn't quite my style, but it's obviously high quality. The music fits the atmosphere. That atmosphere is well-developed, too. The settings and characters add to the air of mystery throughout most of the game. One point of criticism here: the trailer is pretty misleading. Few of the animations in the trailer are actually used in-game in any way. While the game does have good art, the trailer makes it seem far more well-produced than it actually is.\n\nUnfortunately, the gameplay and story are greatly lacking. If one of the two were lacking, it might be forgiven, but that's not the case. The gameplay is entirely puzzles, which would be fine if the puzzles were at all engaging. At best, the puzzles are insultingly linear and obvious. At worst, the puzzles are not only linear, but also employ moon logic to make you question if it's actually the solution to the puzzles. The areas are small and confined, and you can solve every puzzle in the game by running around and interacting with everything you see until the solution is effectively told to you. There is a chase sequence at one point, and it was well-executed, but it's the only segment of it's kind in the game. I see people complain about the last segment of the game in the attic. I can see how it might be frustrating if it were a difficult puzzle, but I figured out what I needed to do after the first reset. It was pretty quick after that. Also, the description on Steam is a bit misleading. "Challenging riddles and puzzles"? Not quite. "Test your wit to survive"? Failing to answer any of the "riddles" in the game doesn't affect you at all. You just get to try again. There are no consequences.\n\nAs for the story, there were definitely some good ideas here, they were just poorly executed and explained. I can appreciate leaving things up to the viewer/player, but this level of vagueness makes it seem less like it was intentional and more like the writer just wasn't sure what he was writing about. I figured out the "plot twist" less than halfway through the game, but admittedly, I was still strung along by the "mystery". That's in quotes because, apparently my idea of what the game's mystery was didn't match up with what the writer was thinking. About halfway through the game, I had pieced together most of the main character's backstory, and who many of the other characters actually were. But, I still had questions: what was going on in this place? Why were things so strange? For the few characters I didn't understand, where did they fit into this? Unfortunately, very few of those questions were answered were answered at all, and none of those answers left me with any sense of satisfaction. Right when I thought the game was just beginning, it ended and left me hanging.\n\nSpoilers ahead:\n\nCat's backstory is fine and all, but where do characters like the grub/bug woman fit in? Why are there four wolves when we know the blind child has only one dog? Why are they being cursed by the "sphinx" from the story Cat's mother told her? Who is the toy maker? Why is there a ghost thing in the maze that teleports me to the start for some reason? This is just the tip of the iceberg. I suppose I may have just not have been paying attention, but if the house in the game is a memory, what are these things Cat is remembering? Is it all a hallucenation? Magic? Beyond that, how did Cat forget all this stuff in the first place? Does she have amnesia? And what's with that ending? Is it supposed to be another plot twist? A cliff-hanger? Like I said before, vague is one thing, and I love to interpret stories like this, but there's just nothing to go on here. There's nothing to analyze. It's just a bunch of stuff lumped together in a story for seemingly little reason. Even a little more flavor text on items in the world might have helped. More  things to explore on my own, instead of Cat telling me exactly what I'm looking at ("It's a light.", "It's a mirror.", "It's a plant.").\n\nSo, ultimately, I can't recommend this for most people. The art is good, the music is good, and if you're really interested in that, the game might be worth $3 just for the short and mildly interesting ride. Most people won't enjoy it, though, I don't think. If the game had cost me much more, I might be mad.","February 27","false","2.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

for a while until i played this. stray cat crossing is a horror puzzle walking simulator made in rpgmaker about some ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ little girl stealing your scarf and running into a haunted house so you have to chase after her. like many games designed to be art first game second it sucks at being fun and no one cares about the art. and im not talking the game art as in the graphics we already know how those are im talking about the story or point or whatever the point of art is that the game tries to do. i dont know i guess its point is to convey emotions other than boredom but whoops. i think the worst part about it is that it costs money when other walking simulators are both free and better although not much.\n\nfor gameplay it is a walking simulator with the most basic of puzzle elements. as an rpgmaker game it has the obligatory large amount of walk up to a thing and press x next to it puzzles except the game automates it slightly so it auto uses any item that can be used to solve a puzzle instead of making you manually going through your inventory so it actually requires even less thought than other games although it is more convenient. other puzzles usually combine the press x thing with some environmental change and theyre all ♥♥♥♥ easy too and i think theres only like 2 of these. the real kicker is one puzzle at the end but ill get to that once im done with the fundamentals. in standard rpgmaker fashion you walk around a world divided into squares and you occupy one square at a time and have a sprint button and thats well and good but i dont know why you have a sprint button when there is 0 incentive to not have sprint continuously and the game doesnt really do anything with it barring one poorly done chase sequence. like why not just make sprint speed default speed and make the sprint key slow you down if you need to go slow i dont get it. why not make it toggleable. to go back a little, that puzzle i described as being a kicker the game requires you to replay the exact same part of the game multiple times and do things slightly differently each time which was huge fun when combined with this thrilling gameplay. this takes a large chunk of the games playtime which was like 2 hours so this is like 20 minutes of doing the same ♥♥♥♥ repeatedly. that was clearly the worst puzzle in the game and is bad enough to be an outstanding mention because the game expects you to care about the developing story changes or some ♥♥♥♥ that occur during the whatever but you dont. there was also one part where you had to select the right text options in order and do it for like 10 choices or it resets and the text scrolls slow as ♥♥♥♥ during this time which makes it annoying as balls. all the puzzles are either boring and irrelevant or suck.\n\nmost of the game is just talking to people and walking around looking at ♥♥♥♥ since there isnt a battle thing or anything else except bad puzzles. all of the characters barring you get at most 5 minutes of screen time and have one or no defining personality traits not barring you. obviously i remember none of the characters vividly so any sort of character review for outstanding individuals is out. the story is entirely uninteresting and just sort of manifests itself later in the game with no obvious connection to what was happening earlier. maybe the game is doing a diy story thing but i dont care enough to figure it out. i would call it pretentious but it feels like it lacks the magic pretentious spark other, more pretentious indie games have so i dont know. i guess its pretentious. the story itself is also pretty stupid in concept like the main character goes into this haunted ♥♥♥ house that tried to kill her repeatedly because she didnt get her scarf back those other times and the ending has some plot holes like why was the car on fire. you would understand that if you played the game but dont. it was pretentious enough for me to read on the forum a what if it was all in a coma story though. at least the story wasnt like godawful or anything and actually had a reasonably easy to interpret ending. unlike off which was horse ♥♥♥♥. today someone actually typed off was good on the same server i was in and it was horrible.\n\nas for the horror i had to do a double check of things i had to write about when thinking of what to write about for this game because its just not there. i think the game forgot that it was horror after the second time go in the house like a dumbass because that was where the only part that if people said they were afraid of i wouldnt laugh at them. almost. the game is clearly going for some disney/alice in wonderland but scary ♥♥♥♥ that would probably work if the game wasnt bad because it doesnt push the scary stuff enough. i mean it could work the theme itself wasnt bad but it just doesnt. it doesnt matter if it would though in case anyone thinks i add that to review score i ♥♥♥♥ on planetside for not being what it could. at least this is less disappointing because it lacks potential entirely. as for the part 1 horror its mostly jump scares. woo. i dont actually have a problem with jump scares if they are used with taste but they arent they just like happen randomly in an very badly done attempt at tension building. speaking of tension building im assuming thats what the rest of what the game is trying to do too but it just results in a bunch of ok that looks out of place moments instead of anything like oh ♥♥♥♥ something might happen. probably because the player has meta knowledge nothing will happen to them and dying is almost impossible the game doesnt mix this up at all. if anyone reading this is doing a horror game you have to make the player feel like some ♥♥♥♥ will happen to them by making it so ♥♥♥♥ can happen to them. i don thtink its even possible to die here except in that one badly done chase scene\n\nyou know the graphics werent actually that bad most of the time. it really wasnt i swear. no stop laughing guys im serious. there were some very obvious flaws but most of it was passable. maybe i just wasnt paying attention or something but it was alright with me. the walk cycle and talking portrait thing were constant reminders that all was not right in the world of graphcis in a game consisting mostly of walking and talking and jesus man were they something. i already talked about the games artstyle thing in the horror thing so whatever. they are graphics if the rest of the review didnt stop you from buying this the graphics part sure wont. pretty sure the graphics were actually the best part of the game which is saying something\n\nthe music and ♥♥♥♥ was mostly ambient and i dont feel like writing filler so it and the sound effects were all normal.\n\npretty boring game overall i dont really have any advice for how it could be better except make the story better and realize that repeating the same actions 5 times for tidbits of a story that i dont care about isnt good gameplay. if anyone says they like this game just call it pretentious hipster ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and them pretentious hipster ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.","April 8","false","2.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this

On the other hand the gameplay itself, due to being limited by the RPG Maker rules, and also due to being strictly reduced to puzzle solving, did not keep me interested as much as I thought I would be after watching the trailer.\nThe puzzles can be very tedious. These are the kind of puzzles I always hated in similar games, since they purposely prolong the gameplay by giving away only tiny hints, while the player must often traverse the scenes multiple times to find the solution. Be prepared to be annoyed after a while, especially during the event in the attic.\n\nThe horror element in this game is also pretty much nonexistent unless you are very easily frightened. Maybe my expectations were beyond what one should expect from a RPG Maker game, I don't know.\n\nEven without taking its overall shortness into account, what I do know howewer is, that despite its semi-interesting story, good artwork and soundtrack I was not entertained, shocked or mystified by this game at all, and I wouldn't recommend it to other people despite it's low price tag.\n\nIf you are into puzzle solving, mysterious and/or macabre stories, that Pan's Labyrinth/ twisted Alice in Wonderland feeling, I would strongly recommend getting "Fran Bow", another adventure game recently released on Steam.\nI played that game before this one, maybe that is why it left me utterly unimpressed, depite the interesting premise.","August 31, 2015","false","2.2"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","10","23","0","0"

Despite the game having an average play time of two hours the actual amount of interesting content is around 10 minutes, at best, and the entire time is filled with puzzle solving.\n\nSo many questions left unanswered too, so many characters that show up, give a tiny bit of story, then leave and we never hear from them again. Also all horror stops after the first act, the first section of the game and even then the horror is in the form of jump scares with one extremely brief 15 second chase sequence.\n\nTo make matters worse the game itself is so broken that the following features do not work: Steam overly, streaming via the steam client, taking screenshots (because overly is broken).\n\nThis game is exactly like a bad movie, it sells you with a trailer that shows every good part with some nice music, then when you actually go to watch it it turns out everything good was in the trailer. Replace watch with "play".\n\nI have played a lot of RPG maker games in my time, lots of wacky crazy stuff, and I have to say that the best ones are free; nearly all of them are free but the fact they are asking three dollars for a middle of the road at very best RPG maker experience is insulting.","September 1, 2015","false","3.9"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","5","17","0","0"

This one is pretty OK, but indeed very easy and stringent. What in fact annoys me a lot: Never have I experienced a game with so many bugs to be released. Depending on if Iplay in Fullscreen or small screen (but sometimes it's the other way round) Iget thrown out of the game. The first time after 2 minutes, if Itry to open up the inventory. I have the feeling, there was no exact testing of the game, because every behaviour that is not perfect according to the solution seems to end in me being thrown out. So I saved a lot (which also resulted in being thrown out, but at least the save stand stayed...) and played for a while.\nBecause the game really is nothing special at all, at least in my opinion, and because I think a game should at least be properly tested before being released, no matter how many updates follow that correct the bugs, I wouldn't recommend it.\nSo my review has two sides, a very subjective one, according to the frustrating experience of repeatedly having to start again, to play. And one, trying to be more objective: the game atmosphere, the graphics, the storyline: not very innovative. There are lots of games, for examples the ones translated by vgperson (just search this via google) that are a lot more interesting, very outstanding and indeed creepy, in a deeper kind of way. So play them, if you haven't already, they're freeware. In this game here you have some animated sequences between the normal gameplay: I found them to be just ridiculous and boring.\n\nAfter all, I've wrote the review mainly because all the other ones I saw praised this game as a jewel, in my opinion it is being very far away from being.","August 29, 2015","false","0.6"," 5 of 20 people (25%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","25","5","20","4","2"

It is, for the most part, a low difficulty game and won't task your brain too hard and willl only task your reflexes once. The music and visual style of this Alice in Wonderland type adventure are competent and mostly enjoyable.\n\nIf I were to have gripes about this game it would be these:  The dialogue is basic and amateur.  While it may normal for these types of games I still found a lot of it irritating.  Seeing as the game is short on things to do it would be nice if the dialogue wa smore fleshed and deeper.  Also, the one action part of this game is horrible to do if you're using a controller.  Well, it was horrible on a 360 controller.  I had to switch to the keyboard controls to complete it.\n\nAll in all, Stray Cat Crossing is a decent enough entry for the price.  It won't wow you with masterful game or story design, but it's interesting and good looking enough to give it a go.","September 10, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game looks lovely - the visuals are surreal and unique. It's clear the game is drawing heavily from Alice In Wonderland, but it doesn't simply directly reference its source material by having rabbits and whatnot. Instead, it feels more like an original setting, with its Japanese influenced art and cartoonish character designs. The dialogue is also great, giving you just enough information about the setting and story. The gameplay has more variety than what I was expecting - one puzzle in the middle of the game was particularly interesting. I liked that the game tried to make sure that the puzzles were intuitive through gameplay, without much specific info-dump-like dialogue. This breaks down at the end - the final puzzles are tedious and require a lot of fetch quests and rewatching cutscenes over and over and over without the ability to skip through them or speed up dialogue. It really took away from the rest of the game and I almost didn't recommend this game over it. However, the story and the rest of the puzzles are strong enough that the game is worthwhile. I'd recommend picking it up if you want to enjoy a short story through gameplay.","September 1, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is not thoroughly scary, more likely morose and melancholic with elements of surreality. The music was enjoyable as well. It wasn't obnoxious, and it set the mood.\n\nThe only con I could possibly think of was that it was short, but it was really worth it considering the price and the quality of the game overall. It is possible to finish the game in one or two sittings (the general consensus seems to agree that it takes about 2-3 hours to finish). I'm not sure what I think about the replay value yet.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bryanonion/recommended/385330/","bryanonion","bryanonion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bryanonion/","293 products in account","(Review originally published on Gamemoir[gamemoir.com].)\n\nRecently, I have been mulling over horror games made in RPG Maker. So when it was brought to me attention that there was an intriguing new title known as Stray Cat Crossing, I had to give it a look over. And while it is far from a complete horror experience, it is an exceptional case of RPG Maker horror done right. A signpost of sorts to guide the way.\n\nIndie devs Jurlo and JetPackGone have created a wonderful, beautiful, creepy little game in Stray Cat Crossing. It goes in the right direction, but never quite reaches its destination.\n\nAfter the first few minutes of Stray Cat Crossing, I was hooked. It grabs the player with some astoundingly pretty presentation. The graphics are reminiscent of GameBoy Advance-era 2D pixel art—charming if sparing animated brightly colored sprites set upon creative backdrops. The world of Stray Cat Crossing is bizarre and fascinating, a fantastical mixture of Silent Hill and Alice in Wonderland. It features creepy anthropomorphic creatures, Japanese Noh masks, freaky babies and theatrical interludes. The horror isn’t outright—the emphasis is placed more upon weirdness and subtle uncanniness. Jurlo’s music manages to bring calm and fright to the atmosphere, laying as it does somewhere between Akira Yamaoka and Yasunori Mitsuda.\n\nStray Cat Crossing places nearly all of its strength into its presentation and atmosphere, and boy does it ever perform this well. Beautiful graphics and sound-work, effective art direction and a flurry of inspirations that come together as something wholly unique. These facets make it worth the price of admission.\n\nUnfortunately, this does not make the whole game. Not everyone places so much value on the presentation. The regrettable flipside of Stray Cat Crossing comes from its two greatest weaknesses: Un-engaging gameplay and a lazily vague plot.\n\nThe gameplay, by itself, is serviceable. Definitely a flaw, but not altogether bad. It simply suffers from never feeling cohesive. One doesn’t get the sense that there was much design philosophy behind the gameplay. There are occasional inventory puzzles. There is one chase sequence involving light platforming. There are some dialogue puzzles. Yet none of this ever seems to come together—they feel like challenge added for the sake of having a sense of gameplay, rather than the game organically developing its play.\n\nI’m reminded of the Charnel House Trilogy, which the developer Ashton Raze has admitted did not lend itself well to gameplay. But the devs at Owl Cave Games managed to accept that and work around the game’s inherent shortcomings, doing what they could to make it engaging as a game despite not having much by way of challenge. Stray Cat Crossing‘s gameplay feels like a sequence of arbitrary puzzles—some challenging, others not so much—that in the grand scheme just don’t match the rest of the game. They may be filtered over with the game’s atmosphere (filling a fountain in a dark garden with the right amount of water in order to save a giant bug, only to inadvertently lead that bug to be eaten), but they don’t feel like they fit. Puzzles in Stray Cat Crossing are always obstacles. They simply never feel like progress.\n\nIn addition to this, some of the puzzles are just plain bad. The horrendously repetitive final act involves exchanging various items with people in order to gain the script to a play, allowing the play to finish and the game the move forward. Only one must perform the previous scenes of the play multiple times in order to speak to the correct people and obtain the right items. It is essentially one large, monotonous fetch quest, quite unwelcome at any point in a game but especially right at the end.\n\nThen we come to the story. Now, Stray Cat Crossing‘s story is by no means bad. In fact there is a lot to like about it. It touches on themes of childhood, jealousy, loss and regret. But its way of being told really distances the player from these themes, leaving them with neither a solid narrative nor a sympathetic character to connect to. Rather we get a quirky cast of one-dimensional creatures and a few curious but ultimately nondescript humans.\n\nThe vague story in indie games has been bugging me for a while now. Perhaps popularized by Limbo, one of the few to actually perform it right, a great deal of indie games have been turning to player interpretation narratives. In only a few isolated cases is the vagueness ever a complement to the overall game. Limbo, for instance, works because it never makes any attempt to really tell a complex story—it only asks that the player experience this weird German expressionist-inspired journey. Another example, Lone Survivor, meanwhile gets a pass because it is a conscious experimentation in dream logic. Stray Cat Crossing doesn’t have these excuses. The execution of the story, as a result, comes off as lazily constructed—a nonlinear sequence of events assembled as a means to set the aforementioned great atmosphere together. They could have combined much more smoothly, but this lack of synchronicity between them causes the story to simply drag the atmosphere down.\n\nThus we have the three pillars of Stray Cat Crossing—atmosphere, gameplay, narrative—and only one is stable. These pillars rely on each other to hold the game up, but Stray Cat Crossing put all its weight on one. And while it doesn’t quite cause the whole game to collapse, the strain definitely pushes the overall experience down a bit.\n\nI like a lot about Stray Cat Crossing, don’t get me wrong. It just doesn’t hold up as a game on its own. If Jurlo and JetPackGone were to team up again for something more cohesively designed, that would be absolutely worth checking out.","October 24, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'll keep this review short and sweet, as not to give too much away, for I believe its the  mystery that truly immerses you into this world. If you're a fan of the darker works of Tim Burton, Hideo Kojima, Neil Gaiman or Studio Ghibli, then I hope you'll take my word in faith and purchase this game without reading too much about it.\n\nIt was a game I played from start to finish- that rare feeling of wanting to play it all at once, though you know you shouldn't or it will all be over too soon (and I'll admit I got no sleep last night because of it). The graphics are beautiful, the art pulls inspiration from all corners of the world, the music is perfect and it has a glistening array of eccentric characters.\n\nThat's not to say it's not without fault. Admittedly I struggled for great lengths of time on some of the puzzles, and even had to look to walkthroughts. At one point it got very repetitive, but honestly I can only say that added to my immersion, a true sense of desperation as you get trapped in this house of horrors.\n\nOn the surface it's polished, well written and exciting, though it truly is a three dimensional game (metaphorically, pardon the pun) its exploration of the darker side of the human psyche left me wanting to play it again from a new perspective.\n\nI can only say- for £1.99 this game is a complete steal.

But not due to mentally disturbing images or gore, but just to the sheer "odd" atmosphere this game gives.\n\nIts only made in RPG maker, so if you go in expecting nothing more than a 2 hour long game with a good story that will leave you thinking about it for the next few days as I am - Then give this a shot.\n\nJust let the absolutely beautiful music take you away and get lost in it - Its very easy to do so, and that is what makes it shine best. Its "odd" atmosphere portrays the deepness of the story through unqiue means and relies on leaving you confused and wonder what is even going on rather than splasing blood in your face.\n\nI just like it. I do. Give it a shot, its $3 and easily worth $10","September 15, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am not so great at puzzles, but this game was doable even with my lack in skills regarding all things puzzle-related. It is very tasteful, and, simply put, very pleasing. There is enough mystery to keep you going throughout and enough hints to help you piece everything together slowly but surely. It is not thoroughly scary, more likely morose and melancholic with elements of surreality. The music was enjoyable as well. It wasn't obnoxious, and it set the mood.\n\nThe only con I could possibly think of was that it was short, but it was really worth it considering the price and the quality of the game overall. It is possible to finish the game in one or two sittings (the general consensus seems to agree that it takes about 2-3 hours to finish). I'm not sure what I think about the replay value yet. Maybe after some time has passed I will go through another playthrough to see if I missed any little things, but the game is satisfying enough after one playthrough.","September 25, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a pretty game, and you will get what you pay for. The only real problem is that while the creator(s) did make a game that looks great, it seems they were almost afraid of making something too short. Without spoiling it, there's a part of the game that feels like it could be accomplished in less time than what it takes, which only makes the game drag on needlessly.

It is, for the most part, a low difficulty game and won't task your brain too hard and willl only task your reflexes once. The music and visual style of this Alice in Wonderland type adventure are competent and mostly enjoyable.\n\nIf I were to have gripes about this game it would be these:  The dialogue is basic and amateur.  While it may normal for these types of games I still found a lot of it irritating.  Seeing as the game is short on things to do it would be nice if the dialogue wa smore fleshed and deeper.  Also, the one action part of this game is horrible to do if you're using a controller.  Well, it was horrible on a 360 controller.  I had to switch to the keyboard controls to complete it.\n\nAll in all, Stray Cat Crossing is a decent enough entry for the price.

Sure, the atmosphere is quite gloomy but I honestly could not have felt any true horror. Yet this doesn't mitigate my estimation in the slightest - actually, I would have found it weird if there would have been jump scares or QTEs, as there usually are if something is declared as "horror game".

It isn't very scary at all.\n\nThe game looks as amazing as it does in the screenshots, though the walking animation is a little stiff and awkward. This is however remedied by a better looking running animation. Sadly choosing whether you want to walk slowly or swiftly already covers the amount of choice in how you will play the game, as it is extremely linear. If you are looking for something with mechanical depth these are not the droids you are looking for. If the atmosphere of the screenshots is what you are interested in and you like curious fantasy creatures woven into a decent story you should pick this up.\n\nOverall the price is fair if you aren't expecting to be wowed by the gameplay and are impressed by the artstyle.","December 12, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Stray Cat Crossing has a lot more polish than most of those. the pixel art graphics themselves are almost worth the admission price, and the music is also great. The story is definatley above average for a RPG maker romp, telling a sad tale of jealousy and domestic neglect.\n\nUnfortunatley, not as much love and care was put into the gameplay. Stray Cat Crossing relies on several "tricks" to add artificial length to what otherwise would have been a single sitting game. The most infamous is the theatre section, which I talked about at the start, but it runs through the whole game. Actions (such as rotating a bridge) take ten times as long as they should. An early chase sequence requires you to sit through the same 30 second cutscene every time you retry (And you will die A LOT at that part). A part involving carrying objects slows you down to an absolute slow as hell crawl. All of this builds up, and what started as minor annoyance eventually blossoms into resentment. It feels like the game is wasting your time, and thats never a good feeling.\n\nOverall, Stay Cat Crossing left me feeling kind of mad, but I can't say I disliked it's macabre world.\n\nWait for a sale, if possible.","January 20","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had just gotten steam a few months prior and I was scrolling through the greenlight section to see if there was anything that was interesting. This game jumped out at me with its unique art style and atmospheric appearance. The moment that I discovered that It had gone up for sale I purchased it.\n\n-I'll try my best not to spoil anything as it would be a tragedy to do so in a 2 hour game\n\nI regret nothing about my purchase of this game. Though it is short it was definitely short it used that short runtime very effectively. The graphical style and sound design design really lend themselves well to the world that the developers built. It has a fantastic dark atmosphere and some very interesting characters (both in regards to their design and behavior). While the interactions aren't the deepest, they do serve to keep the story going at just the right pace for what it is, and they do very clearly have some thought behind them.\n\nI feel that this is one of the greater uses of any of the RPG Maker Engines that I've encountered. Stray Cat Crossing is a wonderful value at $3 considering the fact that you get such a compelling experience, as well as the unique atmospheric soundtrack in .mp3 format. If it seems interesting to you I would say that it is definitely worth a buy.","February 10","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The horror comes from being locked in small areas (typically a single floor of a house) with surrealist characters as your only companions, as well as FMV scenes that interrupt your actions with jumpscares. The characters you encounter are creepy and may antagonize you, but there are very few of them that impede your progress or can send you to the game over screen.\n\nThe narrative of Stray Cat Crossing starts out shallow at first. During the first two acts, it seems like the characters are strange for the sake of being strange and no explanations are given for their behaviour. Near the end of the second act is when things start to become deeper, but still very obscured. During the third act, essentially the last half of the game, the loose threads begin to join and form a unified whole. There is a sense of discovery when you find out the significance of a seemingly throwaway task in the earlier part of the game. I was pleased with the way the story came together at the end. It could have been easy to leave everything vague or unanswered in a game as surreal as Stray Cat Crossing, but the developers thankfully brought everything to a conclusion.\n\nPros:\n-the pixel art is wildly original\n-the soundtrack swaps between creepy ambience, pastoral guitar plucking, and dissonance as needed\n-the full soundtrack is included in the base game!\n-story comes to a satisfying conclusion with everything tied up nicely in a big bundle of feels\n-different characters have distinct personalities and speech patterns\n-about half the puzzles have nothing explaining how to complete them, yet are still intuitive\n-the repetition and changing of rooms. Revisiting the same rooms multiple times and seeing how they change as I advanced made an entire level of just three rooms interesting\n-I really liked the saving system. Very stylishly done.\n-The brevity of the game makes it very easy to finish, and after discovering the secrets at the end, it is worthwhile to play through again to see the foreshadowing.\n-Very unique experience. It is not easy to compare with other games\n\nCons:\n-the song "Skin Tight" from the trailer is only as long as it is in the trailer. 0:51 is just not long enough.\n-the controls are not quite ideal. Being an RPG Maker game, I had to search non-Stray Cat Crossing forums to find a way to rebind keys to my comfort and play the game fullscreen without stretching.\n-the other half of the puzzles are simply trial and error with little logic beind them\n-the hedgemaze: this was a really cool, creepy locale with a completely indecipherable puzzle. After wandering aimlessly for 30 minutes, I simply looked online for the answer to progress. I haven't seen any Let's Play videos figure it out themselves either yet, so am sure it was not just my own problem.\n-The repetition of scripted events. This was an annoyance in the third chapter. Rather than merely revisiting rooms, you are forced to sit through scripted events as you replay the same scenes over again, learning a little bit more each time. This would have been awesome if some of the connecting events were cut on subsequent visits. Having an usher always come, say the exact same lines as the three times before, and then walk away, come back, and talk some more is irritating when you simply want to walk into the room you are trying to go to.\n-Some of the dialogue can fall a little flat. One of the things that grated on me was a certain character that begins every sentance with "..." waits for awhile, then finally says something.\n-The FMV jumpscares that interrupt you early in the game do not tie into the plot anymore than to remind you that things are oh-so-spooky here, but largely die off in the second and third chapters","April 14","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
