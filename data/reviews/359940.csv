I enjoyed the gameplay, the atmosphere, and I'm interested in seeing this game progress through Early Access.  If you enjoy first person horror games, I recommend playing this one. There is only about a 1 hour gameplay at the moment though, so some of you may want to hold off buying it until more content is added.\n\n\n\n***I know some don't like people posting videos on steam, but this is solely for people to see my experience playing the game for the first time.  It also will help you see more of what the game currently has to offer.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO2BNA3NGDc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***Added***\nSteam Reviews have become a waste of time and I should probably stop posting them.  I play/own a ton of games and I'm an experienced gamer who's been playing games since 1990, so I would think my thoughts on a game would be respected.....but apparently Steam is full of trolls.\n\nThe amount of down votes across steam lately for many people's reviews is ridiculous.  I guess one line sarcastic reviews are the way to go now, even though they offer no info to what the game actually is.","March 18","true","3.1"," 68 of 89 people (76%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","76","68","89","6","13"

The game is heavily inspired from the original version of Alan Wake, which was supposed to be an open world mystery game.\n\nSTORYA writer goes with his wife to Shadows Peak, an isolated place where he can finally start writing again. But when they get there, his wife mysteriously disappears and it's up to you to find her. In its current state, only the first part of the story is available, and while it isn't all that amazing, it manages to catch your attention from the get-go. I'm really curious to know what happens next.\n\nGRAPHICSMade with the Unity engine, the game surprisingly looks pretty solid: I haven't found a bad texture, an out of place model or anything like that. It is however pretty easy to exploit some things like jumping to get to otherwise unreachable places, making you feel like one of Skyrim's horses.\n\nGAMEPLAYThe game is open ended: when you boot the game you can freely explore the map without many walls (both visible and invisible). You only have a cellphone that keeps receiving cryptic messages. As some who dislike having his hand held for the entirety of the game, this was a nice change of pace. I really enjoyed exploring Shadows Peak, finding hidden clues to the story and new items to proceed. The combat is very light and simplistic, but there is a stealth mechanic to avoid the Black Shadows, who will chase you no matter what. I hope that more variety and a little bit of puzzles will be added in later builds.\n\nCHALLENGEThe main threat, the Black Shadows, can be avoided by crouching and not using a flashlight. But if they start following you, they will not let go: you can run for four minutes straight, if you turn around they will be right behind your ♥♥♥ ready to scare you and to cut your health in half. Other than that, some of the "puzzles" might be frustrating to some players, mainly if you didn't pick up an object that is on the other end of the map.\n\nSOUNDThe sound design is solid, and the voice acting isn't half bad either. I especially loved the sound of the Shadow people: that's the stuff of nightmares.\n\nREPLAYABILITYNot much at this point: until more is added, you can replay the first part to try and change the order of how you do everything.\n\nOverall, this is a promising start to what might be one of the better horror games on Steam: no hand-holding, good scares, open ended levels are something that we need more of in gaming nowadays. Worth buying at full price.\n\nStory: 7\nGraphics: 8\nGameplay: 8\nChallenge: 7.5\nSound: 8\nReplayability: 5\n\nENJOYMENT: 7.5\nFRUSTRATION: 4.5\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\nJoin my Steam group","March 28","true","3.8"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","21","29","3","2"

For what the game is the price is fine, though the game wasn't what I was expecting or looking for which isn't necessarily the game's fault, though it wasn’t very satisfying or enjoyable. I imagine the reviews will be coming in over the next few weeks so interested potential buyers may want to see how favorable they are before diving in; I may be in the minority.\n\nI had good expectations for this based on what screenshots and the summary I had seen from the store page. Unfortunately, I can't give it a recommendation.  The sad reality is that, though this game is in early access, I'm not quite sure if even in its finished state I'm going to be able to recommend it. Obviously I've no idea what will change over the course of time with continued development.  The game ends with a ‘cliffhanger’ of sorts and promises that future chapters will be released as free updates. I’m somewhat skeptical of the future content as the first chapter, while beautifully designed, was lacking in controls, story, and enjoyment.\n\nYou play as a writer who, in the search for inspiration, comes to an island that is shrouded in mystery with his fiancé. Thirty seconds after arriving some sort of incident occurs that blankets the sky in red, kills dozens of birds, kidnaps your fiancé, and creates a dark and stormy night for the game to start in.\n\nYou start on the dock on which you watched the ‘red enigma’ occur, and are given free rein to begin the game and explore the island. There isn’t really any prompt to suggest how or where to go. The island, itself, is worth commenting on. It’s very well done, graphically, but almost as if you suddenly find yourself on Horror Trope Island. It’s like someone kidnapped the island of Myst, then replaced the charming puzzles and interesting buildings with abandoned houses, shipwrecks, a spooky lighthouse, an abandoned church, a graveyard, dark caves, remote campsites, billboards filled with missing person posters, abandoned cars, etc. It’s like a Universal Studio backlot. It’s impressive just how many tropes they’ve crammed on this island. Much to my chagrin there was no Castle Dracula.\n\nYou are not told how to proceed or what your objective is and will initially wander without purpose. This isn’t a terrible mechanic for games, as the discovery and exploration of environment can work to draw the player in and engage them in their surroundings. Two of my recent favorite games include an open exploration aspect to them (Monstrum, and Miasmata). Each of them allows the player to openly explore and move on their own, pursuing the game's goals as they see fit. This aspect of game design is a favorite of mine as it shows that the developer has faith and trust in their players, and that the player doesn't need their hand held in order to proceed. Funny enough, Shadows Peak uses that phrase in its advertising. That's all well and good, in theory. In Monstrum it works because the player is given the game's rules immediately: if you're caught you die. In Miasmata it works because the guidelines and goals of the game are laid out for you at the start and are added to as the player explores. In both there is the suggestion of a goal to begin with. Shadows Peak almost gets it right in that aspect, but falls short in that it doesn’t provide anything for the player at the beginning, nor does it offer the player anything even with exploration. You’ll occasionally get a vague and ambiguous text message on your cell phone prompting you to certain actions, though there’s no reason why.\n\nEventually, while exploring, you will come across the denizens of the island which look like black floating shadows with eyes. The shadows are probably the most annoying part of the game.  I think they’re just floating in various areas of the island and, upon seeing you, will cry forth a tremendous shriek and then give chase. If they come into contact with you they will injure you for a majority of your health. You find a knife early on though it is of no use against these shadow people which you will learn very quickly. The only way to truly defend yourself against them is to flee. The frustrating aspect is that while exploring you will be navigating areas and looking closely for objects to pick up, or use, or things to interact with. When a shadow appears and starts to chase you, your only real option is to run a great distance away from the area you were exploring. If you are lucky enough to escape the creature, on your way back to where you were exploring, you will often trigger the same shadow creature again, and then need to run, again. The real straw that breaks the camel’s back is that while running from one shadow, you will often trigger another, or a third, and sometimes a fourth and then you’re just running around the island, Blues Brothers style, without any particular aim, only to escape dying.\n\nI like the idea of creatures you can't necessarily defend against, but when there are several of them chasing you, and you can't avoid them without traversing long distances, and they're constantly interrupting your search to find anything or even your overall objective, it becomes a grind that isn't fun, nor is it scary. In Monstrum, when the creature finds you and you flee for your life it's frightening. Here, it's just annoying.\n\nMonstrum gets it right by having a single monster that you can hide from and then navigate around while it explores other parts of the ship. You can get an idea when it is near and respond accordingly. In Shadows Peak you never know where the creatures are, walking through one area can spawn two or even three of them, and then you're just running and dodging them by running through fields of grass and forests where they can always see you. That's unfortunately just not exciting. In addition to the silly shadow enemies the designers decided to throw in the occasional rattle snake. I’m not sure why they’re included other than to give the player something to hit with his knife (objectives aside) and to give us some sense of accomplishment. Since this is Horror Trope Island and we’re running from ghosts and killing snakes the developers really missed the chance to throw some bats in as well, or maybe a wolf, or some strange fish men to really round out the enemy force.\n\nThe game can be summed up as follows:\n\nThe player runs around the island looking for an objective of any kind while avoiding snakes and ghosts.\n\nIt just feels uninspired and flat.\n\nWith that said, I'll talk about some of the stronger aspects of the game.\n\nThe atmosphere is excellent. The creepy ambience, setting, and even the idea of the shadow creatures is enough to elicit a feeling of uncertainty and nervousness even though it fails to deliver on those ideas. In the first ten minutes I was actually pretty excited for what this game could be, and I spent the remaining play time being frustrated with the content. I'd explore areas, trigger a shadow creature, while running trigger at least another shadow creature, maybe lose them, explore a bit of the island, run, kill a snake, trigger another shadow be killed, load up where I was, explore a different part of the island, be killed, repeat, repeat, repeat. I finally decided that it just wasn't worth my time.\n\nI applaud the developer for all the hard work that they've put into this game, and for not making it another ‘collect x objects to win’ style horror game that flooded the market after Slender or another siege style defense game like Five Night’s at Freddy’s. Shadows Peak is just not something that works for me. It may work for others.","March 21","false","1.1"," 25 of 41 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","25","41","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/359940/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAs some of you may know as much as I love playing games on my PC I also have quite a lot of time for the console exclusive titles. One of my favorite games of 2015 was Supermassive Games’ Until Dawn. Ainslie and I played the ♥♥♥♥ out of that game. It hooked both of us together and we sat on her couch playing it for many many hours and made a lot of shared decisions to see how our playthrough would advance. It was one of the best gaming experiences the two of us have shared together. I was not expecting to find another horror game that would be comparable to that experience wise for a long time. That’s why when I found myself fortunate enough to play Andrii Vintsevych’s Shadows Peak I was more than a little bit surprised and deeply absorbed in its early access game play.\n\nJim Sterling, who I am very much a fan of, recently published a 34-minute video on the game and in his summation he believed that the game was “worth keeping an eye on” and that it was an “early access game with promise.”   That’s putting it a little mildly. Everything that I have played thus far has shown that the game has high production values across the board. It’s one of the first open world games that I’ve played that genuinely doesn’t guide you as though it really does want to be an on rails experience. I’m sure some players will disagree and claim that you have to go to certain places to unlock certain things before you can progress further – and that may ultimately be true – but you can easily spend a significant amount of time taking everything in and not feel as though you were somewhere you weren’t yet meant to be or when you stumble across something that you feel like a dumby for not having found it much sooner. In that respect it is a near flawless open world experience.\n\nThen there are the constant spirit invasions that are a cross between a jump scare and a genuine paranormal experience. I’m not such a big fan of jump scares because more often than not they are poorly done and demonstrate an inability on the part of the developer to be unable to frighten the player genuinely. However, when they are done right which they are here they leave me considering their context and the deeper meaning of what I have just witnessed. I suppose in some ways good jump scares can be a part of a psychological horror. In that regard Shadows Peak has me spooked but to the point that I am deeply intrigued into what will happen next and not an “ARGH! You got me! You stupid game!” type of way.\n\nI adore the graphics that were utilized in this game. They are heavily atmospheric and are well thought out which is a continuing theme throughout the game. Here’s a non-spoiler screen shot from very early in the game that makes a good representation of what I found stunning graphically and atmospherically. Do note that the blurriness in the picture is as intended by the developer for the particular part of the game that this comes from. Other screenshots of the game provide more clarity.\n\nShadows Peak could become a must own and play title when it is ready for its launch out of Early Access. As it is it is still a game that I highly recommend for the horror-adventure lover in all of us.\n\nVisit Steamified[www.steamified.com] for more reviews and our epic giveaways","April 7","true","8.0"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

I will look forward to see what happens in the next chapter. Graphically, the game is lovely. The environments are spooky and creepy, but the enemies need work, they are just not scary enough. Survival Horror are the games I like the most and there was at no point in the game that I was scared or had a jump out of my seat moment, so a little work may be needed to make it scarier.\n\nAll in all, if you like walking/running adventures, then you will like this game. My only gripe with games like this is that every character talks other than you. There is no player dialog and I always find that it makes the game seem dull. Also the English translation of some of the text in the game needs some work.\n\n7/10 for me, but this may change when the new chapter is released or there are patches to improve what could be an excellent game.","March 19","true","1.3"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","11","19","0","5"

You press F to call to her- "Michelle! MICHELLLEE!"- but there's nothing around except dirty bird corpses and a save point. You save over your previous life with Michelle because, I don't know, what is love when you get down to it, and head towards a lighthouse in the distance, the radiation burns slowing your attempts to sprint anywhere.\n\nBelieve me, that particular hindrance won't go away by itself. Shadows Peak plops you down on a very generously sized play area with several landmarks and locations to visit and unless you've got your explorer's hat on, you wouldn't know that you have to cure your crippled jog with medication. There's no waypoints, no map, few hints, precious little health and some incredibly quick and vicious enemies chasing you down. These brutal elements are balanced with a generous number of save points that allow you to properly investigate the many hidden pockets of the island without undergoing a frustrating degree of backtracking.\n\nIt's a good solid show for an Early Access title. The atmosphere is consistently bleak and bizarre and the island design and layout is excellent but maybe the best thing about Shadows Peak is that it's a huge leap in quality from the developer's previous game, Gynophobia. That won't mean anything to some of you, I'm sure, but one of my personal simple pleasures in life is seeing independent talent grow on Steam and come back stronger from their losses. This is a rare victory in that regard and I'll be following whatever else grows out of this early build's bizarre ending twist with great interest.\n\nYou can check out my fun with the game below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN1JHoAOTrk","March 18","true","1.2"," 18 of 36 people (50%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","50","18","36","6","3"

I've played quite a few horror games in my day, but I did not expect going into this to get so scared. So much of this has to do with the amazing visuals mixed with the ridiculously spooky audio (the sound effects mixed with that constant drone really help make the game spooky). It's a bit of an adventure/puzzle/mystery sort of game and it's a psychological horror, the dev totally screws with you a lot. The story thus far is interesting though, I'm interested to see more of what lies in Shadows Peak, it's a great atmosphere for making some spooky myths come to life.\n\nWould I recommend you buy this game? Yes. But only if you're sure you want to deal with waiting for another chapter to release for more content. $8 is a decent price for how much content this game currently has, but when future chapters are added it will be a steal.

The game's walls and obstructions are oddly placed. There are points where you can scale the side of a mountain by pushing up, and others where you'll get sent flying over the island like Superman.\n\nAs for the game itself... it has more in spirit to do with Slender than Outlast or Alien. You're caught on an island following a horrific vision, and the game doesn't do a good job of telling you why or what's happening. The tagline says the game won't hold your hand, but there's a difference between holding your hand and giving some basic guidance.\n\nThe island is scattered with landmarks in Slender esque fashion without the beating drum of an ever present monster hunting you. However, some of the sites are freaky and will make it difficult for scaredy cats (me) to enter. I had one moment where I had to summon up the courage to run into  a church. The surprise appearance of enemies will make for some scream inducing moments. Sound design is pretty good. Although there's not much in the way of music, the howls and distant screams are disturbing.\n\nOverall, I enjoy the game, but it needs some more polish. The world needs to be better walled so that you don't get sent flying around. Second, a bit more guidance would probably be useful, not only to get the game complete, but to put together a cohesive story. I have only the most vague idea of why I'm on the island or what I'm doing.\n\nAs the gods of the internet demand, I have played this game while recording. I streamed it last night at four in the morning... a bad decision.\n\nSpecifically, watch betwewen 21 mins and 24 mins for the big scream... and an interesting glitch.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb0Lr2XG0BU\n","March 19","true","13.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

You have an open map so the story isn't strictly linear which enables you to explore the game freely. The story of the game starts off very vague and throughout the game you still don't have much of an idea of what's really going on. The sounds in the game are good when to comes to music which I liked but for some of the sound effects they were pretty basic and didn't fit the part just right. Like the walking sound effect for example. The graphics are pretty good. One issue I discovered while playing was a bit of lag as I walked. The rain and lightening were pretty sick. The shades are creepy. Since there is going to be more context released later on for this game I'm looking forward as to how they are going to develop the story, the characters and most importantly the plot. I feel like this first release is lacking luster  compared to what I was expecting but I had fun playing the game nonetheless. I don't want to give away to much but I was confused and disappointed in ending of this part but I am hopeful for more DC to come. Play it for yourself!

Playing only the first 20 minutes there should be lots more to explore and check out, and im looking forward to doing it. The Graphics is probably what is giving the game its most points, the gloomy yet good looking environment really ads to the atmosphere and scary vibe of the game.\n\nI definitely recomend this game in its current state!","March 19","true","0.8"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

Sure the plot's not a triple A seller, and its not as scary as you might expect, but I have high hopes for it! Hey, let me set that teddy bear on fire and I'll give it a ten out of ten! But for now I'm going to give it a 7 out of 10. I'm not judging harshly because I enjoyed the game and its still being worked on. The plot could use some fleshing out, the music could be a bit scarier, the enemies could be a little less forgiving, and there could be a few more places to go into on this wide scale map. I still think, anyone who likes this genre should give the game a try!\n\nIf your interested check out the full review at: http://www.keengamer.com/article/12698_shadows-peak-review\n","March 18","true","1.1"," 2 of 17 people (12%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","12","2","17","0","0"

Lots of improvement to be made! )\n\nRecommended? Yes. This game is already robust for an indie early access, it plays well, the surroundings feel good, there's a lot to explore already.\n\nGraphics & Ambience: The graphics are definitely up to par. I like the way that everything that's already there has details.\n\nGameplay: There's still some work to be done on this aspect. I thought the F key wasn't a logical key to put a "grab" mechanic on and it confused me a couple of times. The 1-4 keys or mouse to scroll through them also didn't feel quite right because there was no feedback; there was either a tool or no tool and nothing else to tell you what you had in your inventory (not that I could find). I would love if there was a tiny blinking thing for it or a small HUD part.\n\nSpoopfactor: This game might not scare the horror/thriller pros, but beware those extremely faint of heart.\n\nLet's Playability: ★★★★☆ Medium to low difficulty. This game has its own voice acting, which is nice. It'll be very funny for your viewers if you are actually scared like I was. I don't take suspense too well, haha. People love watching other people play scary games so they don't have to, you just have to know what to say since it can take a while before anything happens and this game does do horror clichés. If you play indie horror a lot or you're looking into getting one of those games, this might be something for you.\n\nCons: The health mechanic is a little out of wack maybe, you get hurt too quickly and too much. The jumpscares are simple frames, I feel that this can be much better.\n\nTrivia: This is the same dev that made Gynophobia, cool right? :)\n\n**Key was provided by an independent party to play the game. I was not instructed to endorse this product apart from my honest opinion.","March 18","true","0.3"," 3 of 20 people (15%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","15","3","20","2","0"
