Kain awakens hundreds of years after the events of the first Blood Omen, in a world occupied by both magic and technology. He reluctantly joins with a vampire resistance to restore rule over the world to the vampires.\nUnlike in Soul Reaver, which emphasized puzzle solving over action elements, Blood Omen 2 is primarily an action game. As Kain, you will have to slaughter countless human and inhuman foes with either your claws or a number of different melee weapons. Combat is pretty simple at the touch of a button, you turn to face the nearest foe, at which point you can either attack or block.\nOverall, Blood Omen 2 sounds great because of Simon Templeman, but the rest of the audio is not remarkable. There is not enough music in Blood Omen 2, and what little can be heard is mostly quiet and ambient. Later in the game, an effective, percussion-heavy battle theme starts up when you raise your claws for the attack. There should have been more like it.\nThe battle system is fairly easy to learn and the puzzles are not mind-blowing. Blood Omen 2 is completely linear and will take you only a few hours to finish. Once you have reached the end, there is no real reason to revisit the game, since none of the sequences in it are particularly memorable and since all of the gameplay mechanics are used repeatedly throughout.\n\nSounds 7/10\nGraphics 6/10\nGameplay 6/10\nAtmosphere 9/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","December 18, 2013","true","5.9"," 64 of 73 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","64","73","0","0"

Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain featured unprecedented voice acting and unthinkable amounts of content. This formula was expanded upon in its 3D sequel Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver. Soul Reaver reinvented platforming, combat, and puzzles. This would spawn 3 more sequels.\n\nOver 12 years ago, I discovered this gem known as Blood Omen 2. I wasn't familiar with the series at the time but instantly became hooked by the role of being a killer vampire who fed on the blood of the living. Even at that young age, I knew Kain's voice was unlike any other.\n\nThis game strays away from the formula created by the Soul Reaver games. Less puzzles and platforming, more violence and gore. This is often seen as a hinderance to the Legacy we call Kain, but I disagree. I commend Eidos for changing things up a beat, sometimes you just want to kill stuff and not worry about breaking your mind on a puzzle.\n\nThe best part of this game is something that is constant throughout the series, and that is the voice acting. Simon Templemen fully embraces and succumbs to the role of Kain. He IS Kain.\n\nI recommend this game for fans of The Legacy of Kain games, vampire fans, or just fans of good story telling and great voice acting.\n\n","September 14, 2014","true","3.9"," 55 of 62 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","55","62","2","0"

Its a cool game, from ps2 era. Characters have good voice actors and well made models. Main character is not good guy, he is not bad guy going good, he is not here for love, he is not here for friends or family, he is here for blood, revenge and power, he is a vampire btw. Story starts of interesting but losses some of its charm near the end. You gain hp and exp by sucking blood of enemy's or civilians you kill, awesome system in my opinion. You can take weapons, each one looking differently and having different (bloody) finishing move when you use fog to kill. Fighting can get clunky when fighting 2 or more enemy's. It has some puzzles but they are easy, game is mostly straight forward but levels are large and it gave me 15 hours of gameplay, for example I finished Arkham City in 12 hours. You may have crashes but that's easy to fix, just go to Google and type "Steam Blood Omen 2 crash" its really easy, takes 2 minutes to fix and I never had crash after that. There are three more games after this, all connecting into one big story.","March 27, 2015","true","15.7"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrNotDeadYet/recommended/242960/","MrNotDeadYet","squirrel_killer-","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrNotDeadYet/","493 products in account","Love this game. Very good. Default controls are less than ideal, and saddly the game does not have offical controller support. However I found after taking a minute to map the keys to a controller myself it played fine.\n\nSome people complain about not supporting the xbox 360 controller, I mostly feel that while it would be nice I don't have much right to expect it because really, this game is old. It doesn't need more than 7 buttons and a pair of joysticks to bind EVERYTHING.\n\nYou can quickly bind your own controls for a controller if you need to, however a slight shift of a few keys on the keyboard also worked fine. Personally I set the ABXY buttons to jump, feed/grapple, action, and dark use darkgift respectively. Set up your control sticks as L for movement and R for my mouse functionality, you could even set it up with a southpaw style if you prefer. Then I set LT and LB both to lock on and RT and RB to block with RS button to the dark gift menu.\n\nBut if you judge this game only by it's controls or it high end (for it's time) not so great graphics than it is not for you. The mechanics are older, and the puzzles are simple. I have found no way to caption the game, which makes this a game I can't expect my deaf GF to play and still enjoy fully without having a headset on. However these are all results from it being over 12 years old. It does not have the luxuries gamers are spoiled with now.\n\nHowever it is still fun. It has well written story. Kain's personality feels dark, but real. He feels flawed in his personality, but at the same time he simple is too powerful for those flaws to slow him down. The combat is simple, but the vampires feel like vampires, not like something from a bad teen romance novel. Dark, powerful, but not purely evil. Fans of the series know that Kain veiws his vampirism as a curse as much as a dark gift. He hates what he is, and lashes against the world which wronged him viciously in revenge for it. He hates what and who he is. This is not shown enough in this installment of the series, but if you know the story, you see the results of it.\n\nThe combat of the game is simple, you lock onto enemies and block their attacks, hit them back, use your abilities as needed. You find or salvage weapons as you go to use in battle to turn the odds even more in your favor. However eventually they weapons break so you always need a new one. THe only other feature in combat is grasping your enemy and attacking them as you hold them by their throat about a foot off the ground effortlessly.\n\nThe world and progression is liniar. Exploration can help you find chests that enchant your weapon for a time or give you more "lore" which is basically experience. Get enough lore and you get some more health. A simple leveling system really. The other way to get lore is to feed on the blood of your victims. Which also heals you. The one danger of this game is you are ever growing hungry. Don't feed, and eventually you will die. Ultimately however, everything is basically liniar with short tangents to take. Nothing ground breaking. Focus is on the story of the game.\n\nGraphics are actually really good for it's age, however any computer newer than about 8 years should be able to play it fine. Their is little happening in the graphics or mechanics department. A clear sign of the games age. However this isn't so bad since graphics should not be the priority of any game.\n\nThe game does have simple puzzles, which can be solved quickly without over thinking it. Often you will see the solution after moving somethings around. The game often basically hands you a situation where you flip a switch and you get a result. Then has a puzzle shortly after to make you need to find a way to mimic said result in the next area. It is very much an action adventure game in that respect. The puzzles often feel like something from a Legend of Zelda game.\n\nDespite it's flaws this game is still absolutely amazing. Unless you feel that a game needs state of the art graphics or new features like xbox 360 controller support (which is actually really new to PC gaming if you think about it) which will not happen due to the fact the developers of the company seem to have abandoned the frachise saddly, than you are bound to enjoy this game if you give it the time to play it. A games age does not determine it's worth, only the quality of the gameplay and story. And this game shows that by still having a story that few games seem to have been able to maintain as the years gone by and graphics became priority. So do yourself a favour and play this game. It isn't long and the gameplay is still relavent. The story is perfect, and the characters feel real.","April 2, 2014","true","9.6"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

I've beaten it countless times on PS2, and only picked it up on Steam when I saw a 70% off Legacy of Kain bundle. Unlike most people, I prefer the Blood Omen games to that of Soul Reaver. Kain's games are more action-oriented, as opposed to Raziel's puzzles. And frankly, I just like Kain better.\n\nOne of the big pros to Blood Omen 2 is that there is no need to have played the first one. The world of Nosgoth is vast, heavy in background and lore, but it's given to you in bits and pieces. Kain himself awakens two hundred years after the end of Blood Omen 1, giving a plot-related reason to your learning curve. His loss of power (both of status and vampiric ability) fuel the narrative as he seeks revenge. The characters you meet will be familiar if you've played the first game; they'll become familiar quickly if you haven't. The sequel could easily have been a stand-alone game, with the sheer amount of cinematics included.\n\nThe other big thing that I like is that 2 doesn't suffer from middle child syndrome. So many games that end up in a trilogy (or more) barely have a coherent beginning, and usually an unresolved end. I believe that the game was created before Defiance was concieved, but it's still a welcome change to have a story with a real beginning, middle and end, and still be able to continue the flow of the overarching plot.\n\nThe gameplay itself is very simple and straightforward. The puzzles are barely puzzles, and the game is extremely linear. And yet, the world itself comes alive through the tale of a man who, despite being the most powerful vampiric general Nosgoth has ever seen, was nearly slain by his enemies and must recover his power while navigating a world flooded with new technology, and magic even the jaded stand in awe of.\n\nIf you don't mind adjusting to the controls and graphics of an older game and enjoy sinking into a new world chock full of exposition and character-building, this might be for you.","May 2","true","1.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

What could I even say? This game has so many positive points, but I'm sure I will only remeber the bad ones. First of all, it crashes a lot. I mean, really a lot. You have to use compatibility mode, and change the CPU affinity to make it work, and it will still crash sometimes, so you have to save pretty much after every savepoint. Oh, and the savepoints don't actually save the game, if you didn't save manually after those, when you quit the game those savepoints simply lost, have to replay everything again. So yeah guys, save a lot! But unfortunately, if you change the affinity, the cinematics will be bugged, they will be spiky, the sound will be delayed, etc. But none of these matter, they are nothing compared to the most annoying gameplay bug I have ever encountered in my gaming life: the charm bug. When you use your charm, the target will just scream, and the game is still. And you can't do anything about it, you have to quit, reload the game, and hope it will work next time. Most of the time, it won't. And the more you progress, the more you need to use charm. The last quarter of this game is basically playing around the crashes and glitches instead of playing around the puzzles and bosses. Very disappointing.\n\nBecause the game itself is good! The atmosphere, the ambience is great, I really liked playing when everything worked fine. I could lost myself in the game and spend 5-6 hours straight without realizing the time. The characters are fine, the conversations are a little forced sometimes, but nothing really unusual to be honest. I played with keyboard+mouse, and the controlling was a bit unusual at first but after a couple hours of playing it felt completely fine. The story is great I think, pretty much the only thing that kept me playing until the end.\n\nI will play the other games for sure, and I didn't regret buying this in the 5-game pack on a sale, but I can hardly recommend this to anyone. Even if you fix everything, it will probably still be a pain in the back.","December 5, 2014","false","20.8"," 25 of 45 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","25","45","2","0"

This game follows the story line of Kain who was a ruler of his vampire kingdom in the storyline of Soul Reaver; this game takes you back to his origins. Where you came across the Sarafan Lord who defeated you in combat, and now you want your revenge and the one thing he stole from you; your Soul Reaver sword. In this game, you can drink the blood of your enemies, chop off heads, split open stomachs, the more you fight, the more you kill, the more blood you drink, the stronger you will become. The more powerful you get, the more powers are opened for you; turning into the mist from leaping from building to building at ease to even taking control of the lesser minded humans.\n\nThe combat is repetitive though, no inovation, just block, attack, dodge. However this is a lengthly game with it's fair share of puzzles and whatnot, this game is a interactive story at best. For the whole Legacy of Kain games, I'd say play them the order of their release dates to get a whole picture of the story. The story is a rollercoaster.","July 16, 2014","true","8.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This, this alone should've been warning enough to stay away from this abomination.\n\nBlood Omen and Soul Reaver are known for their amazing plot, somehow entertaining puzzles and BEAUTIFUL voice-acting. The three of which Blood Omen 2 lacks.\n\nThe puzzles are gone. I dare not call pushing levers a puzzle. People complained about the block puzzles of Soul Reaver 1, well, here the puzzles are nothing BUT levers. Ten thousand levers. There is a little variation now and then, but most of the game consist of moving one lever, going another place, moving another, then going back and so forth and so on.\n\nThe amazing plot? Forget it. Here, all the characters acts completely different from the other games in the series. COMPLETELY. Kain has become more close to Vegeta than from Kain himself, shouting arrogant drivel throgh the entire game. Vorador has become the leader of a vampire resistence, the same tiresome plot of "rebels versus empire" that have been done to death ever since Star Wars, and shows little of the arrogant, self-centered and calm Vorador that aided Kain through Blood Omen 1. Janos appears later in the games and, although his personality wasn't exactly explored in the other games, here he has the same problem all the other characters got: A massive idiot characterization.\n\nAnd I mean MASSIVE. Each and every character take such stupidity and idiotic behavior that sometimes you just want to forget about all this affair.\n\nIt's important to draw attention that the problem with voice-acting by no means the responsability of the voice-actors. Kain, Vorador and Janos retain their original voices from the other games, however, I believe the voice directing and the script are the ones to blame.\n\nThis is the absolute proof that the quality in all the other Soul Reaver games, especially in their story, is thanks to the amazing work of Amy Hennig. It's unfortunate that she's now working for EA and probably won't come back for the series. One can only hope Square and Eidos do all they can do to get her back, I have little faith this series will be back to their former glory without her.","February 15, 2015","false","17.6"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","1"

There's no graphical polishing or changes beyond an AA and resolution option. It does suffer from random crashes, though far between each other. I must have had atleast 4 crashes in a 16 hour gameplay length that happen randomly after an animation of your character ends (ei: picking up a weapon, climbing a ladder)\n\nThe mechanics are pretty reliable except for the Movement. There's no strafing possible as long as you're not in combat move, and since there's a bit of platforming involved, it can be tricky with certain spots. Combat is fairly decent for an early PS2 game. Guard, Attack, Dodge, Grabs and throws are implimented, and later in the game, you get Ragebar skills, though the last skill I beleive is a bit of a game breaker since it 1-shots any enemy. The game also relies on simple puzzles to progress through a map with decent checkpoint placing(It does not Auto-save with these checkpoints, so save before you quit the game).\n\nSo as long as you know what many early PS2 games are like and you don't mind the older graphics, it's a great game, bits of lore, dialog and narration from the protagonist, Kain.","March 22, 2014","true","16.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You can attack, block, dodge and use "dark gifts". The problem I had quite often was enemies attacking through my attacks, even if I started attacking first, which can be extremely annoying, but all in all it's pretty easy. Block normal attacks, dodge special attacks, then counter. Rinse and repeat.\nThere are also a variety of weapons in the game, which are more powerful than your claw attacks, but break rather easily.\nThe boss fights usually featured completely dumb bosses, which had to be damaged a certain way. Over and over again. One of them, for example, was sitting on some sort of oven, throwing fire bombs at Kain, when he saw him and you had to use a lever to fire up the oven to damage the boss. And you had to do it over and over again, meaning that the boss will be burned the same way again and again.\nThe boss fights were all multi-staged. Damage the boss enough and the next phase would start.\nThe fights themselves were managable, albeit a bit bothersome at times. The end fight was a bit too easy, though.\n\nThe game also has a very minor stealth aspect, which only comes to use when there is mist around. Standing in that mist, you can use one of your "dark gifts", the mist form, to become basically invisible and stealth kill enemies, when you sneak up behind them.\nThe mist is mostly placed really oddly, sometimes even indoors, which looks rather dumb. Also some of the enemies can sense and spot you in mist form, which nullifies the use of the mist form completely.\nApparently there was a bigger stealth aspect planned, but ultimately dropped, which is sad, because it would have made more sense to cautiously approach enemies, instead of just running up on them most of the times.\n\nYou can save whenever you want, by the way, BUT it will save only until the last checkpoint you've visited. And no matter what you had with you (weapon-wise), will be gone when loading a save or a checkpoint.\n\nThe game is quite old and it certainly shows. So if you're into super high quality uber graphics, this (or any old game) isn't for you.\nThe sound design was ok, nothing too special, but the voice work was, mostly, pretty good, especially Kain's voice actor did a really good job delivering a condescending tone, clearly showing what Kain thinks of his conversational partners.\n\nThe game also worked rather well on Windows 7. I had some crashes, mostly at the beginning and then again two closer to the end, but besides that it worked without a problem. The last crash I had occured while watching the trailer for Soul Reaver 2, which can be accessed in the Extras menu...\n\nIt certainly isn't the best entry in the franchise, but all in all it's an ok game.\nIf you like playing the bad guy and enjoy rather simple action adventures games or are a fan of the Legacy of Kain franchise, this game might be for you.","March 2, 2014","true","15.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The difference is noticeable and many people consider this game to be the worst one in the series.\n\nI am not a big fan of the character Umah, clearly designed to be a romantic counterpart to Kain even though that kind of thing is nearly completely absent in all other Legacy of Kain games. The overall dialogue was also not quite on par with the other games.\n\nHowever, I do like the overall atmosphere of Blood Omen 2 and I had a lot of fun playing it. It has a nice gothic feel to it and there's something to be said for playing the “evil vampire”. I tend to treat it as a separate game and not judge it as part of the Legacy of Kain series. In that way, while it certainly has its shortcomings, it's not a bad game at all.","April 26, 2014","true","0.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ge0stigma/recommended/242960/","ge0stigma","geøstigma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ge0stigma/","227 products in account","Let me start by saying that im a huge fan of LoK series for a very long time and that i have played every one of this amazing series titles countless times... except for this one. I finished this game right before writing this and i must say that i now fully understand why BO2 was the only title in the series that i was evading during all of my series replays.\nThis is, in my oppinion, the only title from LoK series that is bad and here is why:\n\nTL;DR Version\nCons:\n-Scarce and crude story, unworthy of LoK titles.\n-Boring, repetative combat with bad mechanics, little to no enemy/weapon variation and useless abilities.\n-Easy level progress with boring, repetative encounters and puzzles.\n-Progression system is barely useful, not fun and it feels forced.\n\nPros:\n-Kain(and his voice actor)\n-Simple yet fun boss encounters for the most of the time\n-Story, though deficient, is a part of one of the greatest stories ever told\n\n-Story and Acting:\nWhile in previuos LoK games naration is plentyful throughout all of the game, BO2 seems to be missing that, and story is barely worth following untill chapter 7 where it kinda starts to develop. Story telling is scarce and crude, every character except for Kain sounds like it has absolutely no written dialogue and is improvising on the spot, while in every other LoK game, every single dialogue sounds absolutely eargasmic. Plot is plain and simple, story develops as expected with no twists or surprises that LoK series are known for. Also, levels have close to no narated cut scenes or dialogues except for the occasional level introduction and conclusion.\n\n-Character Progress:\nIn BO1 we were exploring caves, collecting armors and weapons with different properties, learning new spells and sacrificing our blood for more powerfull items, in SR titles, exploring was the key for progress, rewarding those who take alternate routs, climb high places, shift between realms and dive deep, etc... In BO2, the only aspect of character improvement is HP increasing and you do this by draining dry the enemies that you kill and syphon ancient containers of vampiric lore which are neither hidden nor hard to reach and you will probably get them all on your first run without even trying. Also, the thing with enemy draining is really boring, tottaly unnecessary and time consuming, considering that u need to completely drain your victim which can take up to, roughly, 5 seconds and if you want to get as much as possible you will need to kill every single civilian you encounter.\n\n-Gear:\nKain has no weapon of his own except for his claws and every other weapon that you can pickup is exactly the same and differs from other weapons only by the light and heavy attack on grabbed enemy and, ofc, attack animations while damage, speed and integrity are the same for all weapons(not sure about this but it definitely feels like that, no distinguishable difference). Kains armors(tho purely cosmetic) look absolutely amazing tho, and many enemies are well designed and fit into the world perfectly.\n\nCombat:\nCombat is realy bad in my oppinion, its the same for every enemy and rly slow and easy. Even tho Kain can dodge, parry, grab and "combo", all of this is poorly executed and tottaly no LoK-ish. BO1 combat felt more engaging and dynamic.\nWhile enemies do hit pretty hard, even the worst average players will have a hard time with dying in this game cause attack patterns that enemies use are all alike and consist of 3-5 light attacks with either a power attack(yellow/blockable) or unblockable finisher move(red/unblockable). Good thing is that almost every fight can be avoided or escaped from if player chooses to do so.\nIf however, player would rather fight and rely on his vampiric prowess and supernatural powers, he would shortly realize that he is limited to a 3-hit combo with "no-matter-what" he wields and a set of a nearly useless, so called, Dark Gifts, that can only be used if Kain parrys enough blows and are basicaly the same thing with a 3 levels of strength(the ones that matter for combat at least).\n\nBoss battles:\nThesse are pretty good and true to the LoK series and old school boss battles but there are few bosses with some very monotone stages that require you to do certain things many, many, many times before they let you proceed to the next battle stage, but overall, this aspect is probably this titles strongest aspect.\nBosses are pretty much battle puzzles that you need to solve using your abilities while simultaneously staying alive and fighting back.\n\nLevel Progression and Puzzles:\nLevels are long, filled with monotone enemy encouters and full of repetative, super easy puzzles that can barely be called puzzles. Now, some may think that these are easy for me cause i already played the game once but i assure you, these puzzles barely classify as puzzles and, my memmory of this game was very vague when i started my last(2nd) playthrough and i last played it roughly 8 years ago. Basically, if you are not pulling a box, you are mind controlling a human through a glass window to pull a lever for you and shooting a sigil every now and then with a TK power.\n\nIm pretty sure i named it all so far.\n\nI would also like to say that, while i do think that this is a terrible LoK game, it could still pass as an playable adventure game with a cool main character and would probably be a successful title for younger ages if it was not so violent.\n\n2/10 as LoK title\n5/10 as an action/adventure game","May 27, 2014","false","19.2"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","2"

You also might not be able to play it at all, due to crashing. If you're only in to it for the story, I recommend just reading up on it, rather than playing.

Here's why:\nCutscenes cannot be skipped. You can alt+tab to switch to doing other stuff, but the game will just pause the cutscene for you. This the made worse by the fact that you can't just save right after a cutscene, since it uses a checkpoint system, which works like this - all progress after a checkpoint will only be saved if you save at the next checkpoint, i.e. returning to the previous checkpoint to save does nothing.\n\nThe controls are very awkward. There are no strafe keys - the left/right movement keys turns the character rather than strafe. Character can only attack if you hold down the target-lock enemy key. Release the key->lock is lost->can't attack. Once target-locked, your character's movement slows down by a lot and you can't turn, though the left/right movement keys now allow you to strafe, albeit slowly and you can jump sideways to dodge. The first part sucks in many cases, as the game will often fail to orientate you correctly to the enemy during lock, and since you can't turn while locked, you'll have to release the lock, turn to the enemy, apply lock, attack - all provided you didn't get hit and knocked down by the enemies during the process. Of course you'll get used to this control scheme after a while, but it feels tedious rather than enjoyable.\n\nThe character's attacks are limited. Discounting the special skills (called dark gifts), you can do a 3-hit combo and a execution attack, that's it. Regardless of which weapon you pick up, it's just click-click-click -> 3-hits. Execution attack can only be performed when there's fog-covered ground + hide yourself with the mist dark gift + you're behind the enemy + click. Only the attack animations are different. The dark gifts are like spells, you just target and press a key to activate. You can't attack enemies that are knocked down, and attacking them when they are trying to get up will just immediately trigger their attack blocking animation.\n\nThe platform puzzle aspect is literally non-existent, since involves just pulling levers and repositioning objects that all sparkles. If an object doesn't sparkle, then it's not interactable. At the very most you need to pull the levers and move objects in a certain order, and it's trivial to figure them out given the amount of visual cues available.\n\nI got this because I thought Soul Reaver 2's gameplay was pretty good and wanted to try the whole series. I am very disappointed.","December 28, 2013","false","22.1"," 13 of 31 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","13","31","0","0"

So even with the now working resolution, it is absolutely impossible to continue the story.\n\nI hope that there will be a bugfix for this issue soon, even though the game is already pretty old...\nUntil then, I cannot say that I recommend the game, no matter how much I love the story.\n\nEdit: Please read my comments below, I added information that helped me enjoying the game again!","November 15, 2014","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

You think a game I played more than 10 years ago on an ancient console (sorry PS2) would get old quick but it hasn't, maybe it's just the nastlgia of playing through an old game I enjoyed.\n\nI've put about 3 hours into the game and havn't experienced any major issues yet. The only bug I've encountered were a few buggy cutscenes where the scenery would phase in and out of scene, but the game quickly adjusted once the cutscene ended.\n\nFor anyone experience issues with their game, I found that lowering the Resolution to the lowest setting (mine being 1024 x 768) makes the game able to run, and now I don't even have to manually adjust the resolution it does it automatically when I start the game.\n\nAll in all, this isn't a very groundbreaking game but It was one of my first titles I got on the PS2, so for anyone looking for a bit of nastaliga I suggest picking this game up.","December 27, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Though I can see where they are coming from- I don't think this makes the game a "Bad" one, per se. I'll be trying my best to compare it to it's predecessor Soul Reaver as it is the only other one I've played on PC.\nFirst things first is the gameplay- which is a little wonky compared to Soul Reaver. You still use Autoface to aim at enemies, but you have to hold it down to attack anything, so you can't run in claws-a-snarin' to get past your obstacles. Another thing different from Soul Reaver is that Blood Omen 2 takes advantage of the mouse. My advice; don't. Camera troubles aren't quite as bad from Soul Reaver, so using the WASD set-up alone gets you around just fine normally. All the mouse really seems to do is muck up where you are walking. In fact- If you have a Playstation controler port; I think this would be a most opperotune time to use it... If not, then you CAN go in and change the controls at your whimsy, but something tells me that the original controler would work much better.\nAnother thing that bothered me, maybe more than it should have, was the fact that if you die whilst holding a weapon, you spawn without it. Weapons, as with Soul Reaver aren't entirely necessary; but they're still pretty useful- and it's a little dissapointing if you loose it; especially if you power it up.\n\nNow onto the story- the thing the entire series is Famous for. Blood Omen 2 was made after Soul Reaver but before Soul Reaver 2. Chronologically it happens after the original Blood Omen before Raziel and the Lieutenants were raised. This entire game is made to expand on Kain's character, and how he rose to power in the Vampire race, and eventually his own empire. The game starts in an interesting location. Kain's army had hit a snag in their conquest, and Kain himself is defeated by the Sarafan leader. Kain goes into a slumber for 200 years, and wakes up barely remembering what happened- just knowing that he was defeated and.... Well. Being Kain... Is more than a little miffed by that fact. So Kain teams up with the remaining Vampires unnoppressed by the Sarafan Order, known as the Kabal, and sets out to recover his strength and come back into power.\n\nIn all seriousness, though, Blood Omen 2 isn't very pertinent in the rest of the lore. You can scrap this game and the rest of the story from the other games will still make sense without it- and I'm afraid the ONLY thing this game does story-wise is give a little bit more insight into our anti-hero Kain. Granted; this was no secret, and was why I wanted to play the game in the first place. To a regular player, however, it might not be worth the trouble.\n\nI certainly get kicks from not being able to run through timed doors, calling Kain a wrinkly old angry prune, and having to  look up walkthroughs. I get even more laughs when my family becomes emotionally involved in my progress. This game was everything I expected and I am looking forward to playing it the rest of the way though, even with it's faults it's still a gem. I would suggest it to anyone who's played anything else in the Legacy, and HIGHLY recommend it to any legacy of Kain affictionado.","February 26, 2015","true","20.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You lock on to your chosen target (the interaction and attack button are the same, so you can't punch otherwise) and can attack with your claws or with various other weapons found in the game, but regardless of what you use to whack your enemies with, you have one (effin' 1) measly 3 punch "combo" to deal damage which cannot be altered or combined to change things up, and believe you me when I tell you, it gets old, fast. You can also block your opponent's attacks but beware, as your blows can just as easily be blocked, and they will. Often. Making your weapons break with use... fun.\nCombat is therefore reduced to block a bunch of enemy attacks so you can dodge their stronger, sometimes unblockable move which leaves them open for you to whack 'em to the floor -that 3-punch combo always knocks them down- and then wait for them to get up and repeat the process again. Sometimes there are 2 baddies at the same time, but they rarely if ever backstab (real honorable folks for vampire-hating fanatics) so you're left tag-teaming them until they stop moving enough for you to drink their blood, a process with feels less satisfying than in Blood Omen 1 due to the sucking sound effect, which sounds disconcertingly like a brat blowing bubbles into their milkshake. Oh and you gotta drink them tasty bloodshakes, always, since your health meter increases when enough of the red stuff is sucked, so every kill slows you down even more and thus feels like a chore.\nBlocking enemy attacks fills an energy bar used to perform some special moves of your own, unlocked during story progression, and some of them can be fun if clunky to use, like a strong, unblockable punch or a combo, a long distance leap or a one-hit-kill incineration spell, but you will rarely use them since most of them will drain your energy bar in 1 or 2 uses at most and filling that thing up for every enemy would double the time you spend on combat.\n\nPUZZLES - Or "Herp what the developer was derp-ing".\nThere are 2 types of puzzles in the game: the insultingly simple, or the infuriatingly abstract, either way, the majority feel monotonous and pointless. As per LOK tradition, most revolve around you using a recently acquired skill, like the long distance leap or the mind control spell, and often require little more than dragging a thing into a floor switch thing, or possess the mind of conveniently placed non-combatant to flip a switch for you, or (my favorite): laboriously using a crane to pick up a rock and depositing it on a conveyor belt, then disabling a crusher before activating said conveyor so the rock can pass through safely, and then just as laboriously as before use another crane to pick up the damned rock to drop it into a magic battery thing so it can explode and thus a wall that was a good 7 meters from the explosion can collapse and you can continue on your merry way. No, you can't just pick up the battery thing with the crane and then just drop it, because game design. (BTW, you may think this was unnecessary but thrust me, you'll thank me for giving you the solution to this crap).\n\nBUGS AND CRASHES\nThere are, thankfully, not that many in most of the game, however, as with many old games, if you're running Win. Vista, 7, 8 or 10 and depending on your rig is quite possible that you'll need to limit the number of cores used for the game (alt+tab while running the game, ctrl+alt+del to open task manager, right click on BO2.exe and go to details, locate again BO2.exe, right click again and go to set affinity and make sure ONLY CPU 0 is ticked. You might want to set the game to compatibility mode just to be safe).\nStill, I was experiencing game crashes by the last 2 chapters, forcing me to keep the paranoid habit of saving after every checkpoint.\n\nSo, as I said at the beginning, I would only recommend to fans of the series who, like me, feel compelled to experience the whole story to completion, since there are some good things about it: The voice acting ranges from pretty good (courtesy of Kain and some of your allies) to tolerable. The combat, despite the crap I gave it, there is some definite weight to the punches thrown, and it's overall serviceable,\nHell, the whole game can be summed up by that word, so I'll leave it at that; Blood Omen 2 is serviceable, but it's definitely the worst entry in the Legacy of Kain series.","February 25","true","17.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first, it is interesting. The feeling of controlling a vampire, having suppreme powers and tactics. But of course there are cons. This game uses gore to represent many situations and although it should, it tires the eye after spending enough time killing and drinking your foes' blood.\n\nPuzzles, it gives you the idea that this game will have some awesome mechanics and having you spending time trying to solve riddles or even open a door. It actually does, but using some premade patterns which makes your experience a bit dull in the process.\n\nAreas, filled with nice effects, for it's age of course, it tries to create an atmosphere according to the story bound to the place you visit.

At first, it is interesting. The feeling of controlling a vampire, having suppreme powers and tactics. But of course there are cons. This game uses gore to represent many situations and although it should, it tires the eye after spending enough time killing and drinking your foes' blood.\n\nPuzzles, it gives you the idea that this game will have some awesome mechanics and having you spending time trying to solve riddles or even open a door. It actually does, but using some premade patterns which makes your experience a bit dull in the process.\n\nAreas, filled with nice effects, for it's age of course, it tries to create an atmosphere according to the story bound to the place you visit.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Joshua_the_Bard/recommended/242960/","Joshua_the_Bard","Joshua_the_Bard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Joshua_the_Bard/","46 products in account","The long and short of itTHE GOOD: Simon Templeton reprising his voice acting role as Kain; the story (kinda)\n\nTHE BAD: Humdrum combat, repetitive gameplay and monotonous "puzzles"; bugs and crashes present.\n\nVERDICT:  Recommended *ONLY* for Legacy of Kain fans  who want to experience what little it adds to the story and lore of the series, and even then, it's a lukewarm recommendation at best.\n\nLonger Review - I will concentrate mostly on gameplay aspects, since touching on the story would only spoil what is, in my opinion, the only real point to play the game, so if you can endure the razor-sharp rough edges, then you might want to try the game out.\n\nCOMBAT - give 'em the ol' 1-2-3 and not much else.\nIf this the meat of the game, then it's a slab of undercocked beef at best. You lock on to your chosen target (the interaction and attack button are the same, so you can't punch otherwise) and can attack with your claws or with various other weapons found in the game, but regardless of what you use to whack your enemies with, you have one (effin' 1) measly 3 punch "combo" to deal damage which cannot be altered or combined to change things up, and believe you me when I tell you, it gets old, fast. You can also block your opponent's attacks but beware, as your blows can just as easily be blocked, and they will. Often. Making your weapons break with use... fun.\nCombat is therefore reduced to block a bunch of enemy attacks so you can dodge their stronger, sometimes unblockable move which leaves them open for you to whack 'em to the floor -that 3-punch combo always knocks them down- and then wait for them to get up and repeat the process again. Sometimes there are 2 baddies at the same time, but they rarely if ever backstab (real honorable folks for vampire-hating fanatics) so you're left tag-teaming them until they stop moving enough for you to drink their blood, a process with feels less satisfying than in Blood Omen 1 due to the sucking sound effect, which sounds disconcertingly like a brat blowing bubbles into their milkshake. Oh and you gotta drink them tasty bloodshakes, always, since your health meter increases when enough of the red stuff is sucked, so every kill slows you down even more and thus feels like a chore.\nBlocking enemy attacks fills an energy bar used to perform some special moves of your own, unlocked during story progression, and some of them can be fun if clunky to use, like a strong, unblockable punch or a combo, a long distance leap or a one-hit-kill incineration spell, but you will rarely use them since most of them will drain your energy bar in 1 or 2 uses at most and filling that thing up for every enemy would double the time you spend on combat.\n\nPUZZLES - Or "Herp what the developer was derp-ing".\nThere are 2 types of puzzles in the game: the insultingly simple, or the infuriatingly abstract, either way, the majority feel monotonous and pointless. As per LOK tradition, most revolve around you using a recently acquired skill, like the long distance leap or the mind control spell, and often require little more than dragging a thing into a floor switch thing, or possess the mind of conveniently placed non-combatant to flip a switch for you, or (my favorite): laboriously using a crane to pick up a rock and depositing it on a conveyor belt, then disabling a crusher before activating said conveyor so the rock can pass through safely, and then just as laboriously as before use another crane to pick up the damned rock to drop it into a magic battery thing so it can explode and thus a wall that was a good 7 meters from the explosion can collapse and you can continue on your merry way. No, you can't just pick up the battery thing with the crane and then just drop it, because game design. (BTW, you may think this was unnecessary but thrust me, you'll thank me for giving you the solution to this crap).\n\nBUGS AND CRASHES\nThere are, thankfully, not that many in most of the game, however, as with many old games, if you're running Win. Vista, 7, 8 or 10 and depending on your rig is quite possible that you'll need to limit the number of cores used for the game (alt+tab while running the game, ctrl+alt+del to open task manager, right click on BO2.exe and go to details, locate again BO2.exe, right click again and go to set affinity and make sure ONLY CPU 0 is ticked. You might want to set the game to compatibility mode just to be safe).\nStill, I was experiencing game crashes by the last 2 chapters, forcing me to keep the paranoid habit of saving after every checkpoint.\n\nSo, as I said at the beginning, I would only recommend to fans of the series who, like me, feel compelled to experience the whole story to completion, since there are some good things about it: The voice acting ranges from pretty good (courtesy of Kain and some of your allies) to tolerable. The combat, despite the crap I gave it, there is some definite weight to the punches thrown, and it's overall serviceable,\nHell, the whole game can be summed up by that word, so I'll leave it at that; Blood Omen 2 is serviceable, but it's definitely the worst entry in the Legacy of Kain series.","February 25","true","17.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some of them are buggy though and its not because its a port, it was already like that in the ps2.\n\nThe biggest problem is to actually get this game to work whatever you do DON'T enable fillter cutscenes(might be wrong name but has something to do with filtering cutscenes) option in the little window that shows up the first time you start the game. Although there are many other problems for what i saw from other people, so buy at your risk.\n\nStill i liked this game it does have its charm.
