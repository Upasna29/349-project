"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ank501/recommended/6400/","Ank501","Ank","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ank501/","1595 products in account","Joint Task Force is a real-time strategy game from HD Publishing.\n\nIn Joint Task Force, you don't get to build a base unlike any other RTS out there, but instead you have to secure a landing zone to deploy your heavy forces. Light forces such as infantry can be deployed directly near your officers via helicopters. Vehicles will need soldiers/crews to operate, and their effectiveness will increase if the right crew mount them. Soldiers that operate a vehicles can also be killed even if their vehicles still intact, which makes capturing enemy vehicles possible. Officers can also call in an airstrike or cruise missile strike.\n\nThe graphics are great and awesome for an old game and the effects are very good. This is the first strategy game where I see ragdoll effect is featured. Unit collision is also a big matter here, as unlike most RTS game out there, vehicles and tanks almost cannot collide with one another. Even on very low graphics setting, somehow the game still looks good.\n\nThe downside of the game is, the skirmish game is somewhat boring, as the AI is quite stupid. The skirmish setting are also bugged, as there are some setting that makes you win or lose instantly when the game not even started. Multiplayer are also dead I think. I haven't been able to play multiplayer.\n\nJoint Task Force has great potential to be a great game, overall the campaign can still give you some hours of playtime. I recommend this.\n\nRating 6/10","December 17, 2013","true","10.4"," 37 of 40 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","37","40","2","0"

If your looking for online multiplayer do not bother as the servers are gone. Clicking "Internet" multiplayer will just freeze the game. Happily LAN still works.\n\nYou need to download a physx driver from Nvidia in order to get this game working. Steam should have added this file as download with the game. Too bad the Developers are gone.\n\nhttp://www.nvidia.com/object/physx-9.13.0604-legacy-driver.html\n\nSome people buying this game have no clue how to make the game working without reading the forums.\nIt works for both AMD and Nvidia Graphic card users.\n\nBeware, you might need to turn off "Hardware Cursor" in option menu if you are getting crashes.\n\nIt has a good singleplayer campaign, but you might not like the ending. I can't really recommend this game due to it being an abandonware game.  The game is very balance between the factions.\n\nThere is a bug in "Vigilant Arms" mission where if you destroy the artilleries before the map expands, you cannot complete the secondary mission. Spotting the artillery for F117 to automatically to bomb them. The secondary mission I do believe should have been activated during the start of the mission(bug). When the map expands the secondary mission activates. So destroying them early stops you from completing the mission.\n\nThere is no secrets or unlocks in the game. If you are a big real time strategy fan you should get this game, unless you don't want to be bothered to get this game working. If you are not a fan of real time strategy, I cannot recommend it unless you can get it to work. If there was a neutral option in steam review I would have selected that option. The game currently works on Windows 8.","May 26, 2015","true","13.2"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","29","32","4","1"

It's still kind of topical, but I don't play it for the politics. The graphics are nice, the missions are fun, and there's a lot of replayability because if something doesn't work, back up a little and try a different approach. Sometimes the AI is a bit wonky, especially when in vehicles, but overall the controls are smooth and intuitive. I like that you have to pay attention to how much money you have and that you can't rely on just endlessly churning out or requisitioining equipment, supplies, and soldiers.. It makes you play smart with what you have.","June 22, 2014","true","2.4"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","0"

The performance could be better, and there are animation glitches.  (however it is more than stable, and FPS don't fluctuate that much)\n\nNow the good, the story is rather generic, but done rather well.\nThe graphics are pretty good, and to this day some of the best models of the (AH-64 Apache, and AV-8b Harrier) I have seen in an RTS/RTT.\n\nCampaign is a decent length despite having only 1 faction, there is like 21 or so missions.\n\nThe gameplay is arguably some of my favorite in a Real Time Tactical game (which this is more that, than it is an RTS, there is no base-building) The options are many and nice. Can actually do some awesome guerrilla style warfare in this game.  (Also it is slower-paced)\n\nSound is good, Music is better than most RTS/RTT games set in this time period.\n\nFor $10, I recommend it.  If it goes on sale, there is no excuse not to try it.","April 26, 2012","true","67.4"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

Just another war game, I think. But, I try it anyways, and has so much fun playing it in my surprised. It has so many things that ulike any RTS game, you don't have base, for start, just field of operation, you will plan your move around your officer. That means you need to move a lot.\n\nPhysic is pretty good in this game, the explosion seems somewhat sastified. The music is so-so thought. The bad thing is no one still playing this game in multiplayer.\n\nThis game offer so much for you for a change, you should try it out, I'm sure you will enjoy it.\n","October 13, 2015","true","19.7"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","12","15","2","0"

A twist on the usual strategy game elements. base building is no longer recquired, and you have a selection of "hero" units at your disposal that can call in reinforcements. Basic units such as rangers or medics, even tanks and humvees, can level up and become "promoted" to a hero unit. Each hero unit has specific abilities based around their original class. For instance, the marksman(sniper) unit can upgrade into a veteran Sniper, giving him abilities like stealth, and the ability to recquisition units like scout helicopters and humvees. As said, it's intriguing and worth a look. There is a demo in the steam store, and if not, you can download the demo from fileplanet.com. Trust me, even though the voice acting is a little iffy at times, you can't judge based on cutscenes and chatter. it's the gameplay that counts and thats what this game has.","October 15, 2011","true","35.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"
