"http://steamcommunity.com/id/infindima/recommended/40330/","infindima","A. Yeager","http://steamcommunity.com/id/infindima/","680 products in account","The story is weaved together nicely. It starts off very gently, just giving you a few clues and then you get the bigger picture. Even though there's a lot of supernatural elements in the game, it was done in such a way it didn't make the characters feel out of place. Nina is as a young woman who has no superpowers, but is pulled into a mystery where she must confront these strange things. It makes you relate to her and her own worries.\n\nI found the story very good. It kept me interested and wanted me to really finish the game. The game makes you travel to many different areas in the world. I liked the change of environment and due to the complicated story, it also makes sense as to why Nina would travel all these areas without it feeling out of place. The new places allows for lots of exploring on it's own and are not confined to a few areas.\n\nFinding out the clues are mostly not that difficult. There are some very clever clues, like needing to look at paintings and see what it represents in numbers to open up a safe. There are some objects in the game which are annoyingly tiny on the screen, as you see each area and room from quite a distance. It can be quite annoying when you have to click on an itty bitty edge of a carpet, as the pointer doesn't register unless you are close enough to the specific area. Thankfully there aren't a lot of these.\n\nThe game is good at providing ideas of what to do next. Nina will make comments about her environment and gives good clues about how to solve things. It doesn't spoil anything or leave it too easy, just enough to make you think things through. At one point, Nina reads a poem which indicates what items she needs, masked though the words. At some points in the game, you have two characters to control. This is a great idea which works out very well, you swap between them in the same area, so that they can complete things in different parts of the building. Clever use of mechanics and storytelling.\n\nI admit, sometimes I got very frustrated as I knew what I wanted to do, yet the characters kept complaning they couldn't, despite needing the item. Sometimes you have to prepare a lot of other things before you can use the idea first at hand. At one part, Nina needs to climb an area which she does awfully slow, then if you forget an item or need to go back and try something else, she will slowly get back the same way. Going back and forth between these two could be very tedious, but thankfully they shorten the time you have to watch it, to not waste time.\n\nThe mini-games weren't annoyingly complicated, they were difficult enough to manage on my own without having to look at some guide. One of them is pushing lighted buttons until all lights are out, and certain buttons only turn off or light certain lights. There aren't a lot of these, thankfully,\n\nThere is some funny dialogue at times, which lightens the mood when you're stuck for a while figuring things out. Nina will usually make quirky or sarcastic comments about the items she tries using or the situations she has been in.\n\nThe english voicework isn't really that enjoyable, so I wish they could have had an option for the original german voice acting. Nina's voice is in particular very straining for the ears. I can tolerate her voice due to the dialogue being fun at times. I don't know what it is about her voice that bothers me, but I think it is the fact that I couldn't honestly tell how old Nina is supposed to be. She sounds like she is 10, but she looks like she's about 17. Her voice just sounds really childish.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this game and piecing the story together. Even though the ending is a bit over the top. There are some nice cutscenes in the game and the ending credits features what happened to all the characters after the game ends. Some are very funny to read.","December 3, 2013","true","12.3"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","1"

Sadly, it seems there's no official way to play with German voice overs and English subtitles, and I didn't manage to find any fan patch.\n\nHowever, you can do this. Download the game in German, make a backup of loca.spr file, then download the game in English and replace it's loca.spr with the one from German version. This way almost all the voice overs are in German and almost all the subtitles are in English.

The story is interesting, and focuses on the Tunguska incident.  I won't give anything away about the story.\n\nThe production values are high, professional voice acting, good graphics and an excellent adventure game interface.\n\nThe script is good with plenty of characters to interact with.  There are also many varied locations, which helps maintain interest.  There is also a handy 'diary' feature, to refresh your memory as to what has happened if you take breaks between playing the game.\n\nThe puzzles are decent enough.  There are a few nonsensical ones, particularly near the end, but you usually get some of these with adventure games.  There are only one or two like this, but they do stop it from being a 'great' adventure game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/imaginationsfire/recommended/40330/","imaginationsfire","imaginationsfire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/imaginationsfire/","109 products in account","This is a pretty good game! It has a single plot line so it plays kinda like an interactive graphic novel, but it's pretty cool anyway. It has some humor and the plot was enough to keep me on the edge of my seat. I actually stayed up all night (accidentally, I swear!) because I wanted to know what was going to happen next. The speech is a little odd here and there but not bad considering the era the game was made and the graphics are really good.\n\nThe game has no tutorial, so it took me a little while to figure out that you click to move and right click to examine things and left click to interact. That sounds simple but it isn't so much so, as you'll see, because of the inventory items and needing to combine them. You have to select the item, then move the cursor over the other item or spot until it lights up for interaction. One beef I had was that the game has her (or Max) speak something whenever you examine something, but you don't always know what spot will go to what, so they may repeat something several times. Luckily you can fast-forward what they say or it could get REALLY irritating. I think most of the length of the game comes from listening to the characters talk; it's a pretty long game (much longer than I was expecting). It felt like around 26 hours? but it might vary depending on how fast you play and what you do.\n\nAlso, there's a magnifying glass you can click on in every scene to see everything you can look at or interact with and the location of movement arrows to go to new locations (so you don't have to guess where to click.) Periodically you'll hear the sound of an old-fashioned typewriter, signifying that you have another journal entry. A lot of them merely chronicle your adventures but some contain useful information that you need to solve puzzles, so it's helpful to look at them.\n\nThe puzzles aren't always intuitive, but they are varied and interesting. Avid puzzle gamers will enjoy this game! There's also some beautiful scenery to enjoy as you solve your way through the story. I was pretty amazed by some of the graphics. Overall, great game, and I'd recommend it for puzzle lovers.\n\n*****Possible Tangental Spoilers!!! Read at your own Risk!!!*****\n\nI liked that the game has a happy ending and epilogue -- it even has a blooper reel even though the whole thing is animated! I appreciate that the designers put in the extra work to add that touch. I do wish that they had portrayed Nina as a little smarter and found other ways to progress the storyline, because she seems very resourceful and innovative so it seems odd that she would repeatedly fall for being used by the bad guys. I also think it's strange that she seems so young and naive but also wears a leather jacket and rides a motorcycle. I think some things like that were done simply for game design convenience though, rather than for logic (who puts a torture chamber next to their bedroom? on second thought, don't answer that!!) but I still liked it and liked that Nina is so independent and resourceful. I thought it was funny that she was flirting with that guard and neat that she aided in her own rescue. Ok, I'm gonna shut up before I give too many things away. I hope I didn't already. :P","March 12, 2014","true","10.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Voice acting is welcome however it is all too often obvious that some lines were recorded in a different room to others with lines sounding inconsistent at times.\n\nThis point and click game plays well and can be difficult quite often when the right answers seem just beyond your reach, but it’s worth your hardship if you can solve something and progress! The game will require you to check your surroundings often and includes a handy button that shows you what objects are intractable with, which means you won’t accidentally miss anything or get too lost if you use it.\n\nAll in all I’d say it was a fun ride with a decent-ish ending…\nI’d give it a “Why doubt Max” out of 10.\n","November 16, 2015","true","12.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I personally liked the plot and the flow of the story\n- Well-designed background graphics.  Each location was very well done in my opinion.\n- Quick-travel to adjacent "scene".  Many of the other adventure games I've played have to wait for the character to completely transition to the edge of the map to get to the next scene.  The double-click fast travel was a welcome addition\n\nNeutral:\n- Voice acting.  Many of the voice actors' lines felt bland and uninspiring with only a few lines that really stood out.  And those that did stand out could have done with a little more "emotion" applicable to the scene.  Thankfully they don't detract from the gameplay but would have been a nice to have.\n- No "map" travel.  A lot of the puzzles require you to travel back and forth between locations, some separated by several screens.  Being able to easily jump from location to location would have been welcome.\n- FMV character models / animations could have been done better.  Several have a lack of facial expressions that made the scene feel out of place but the FMVs are short enough that they don't really impact the storyline or gameplay.\n\nOverall a good game and worth adding to your collection.  It's no Telltale as far as acting goes but it's good enough given how short it took me to finish it. Even more highly recommended if you can get it on sale.","December 29, 2015","true","11.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamehoard/recommended/40330/","gamehoard","Jeremy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamehoard/","173 products in account","To hear the full review, check out the episode on Game Hoard Podcast[soundcloud.com]\n\nStory/Setting\nThe story is based on the real life Tunguska event in which a massive explosion, thought to have resulted from a meteor crash, rocked Siberia in 1908. It's a great idea to base an adventure game around investigating a real life mystery, but unfortunately it is executed horribly here. Everything is cliched, the story moves at a snails pace, and all the characters are totally unlikable. This extends to the protagonist, Nina, who is extremely unkind to everyone she interacts with and even goes as far as regularly insulting the player's actions. There's a large variety of backdrops, characters, and even a love story thrown in, but it's all incredibly uninteresting.\n\nGameplay\nSecret Files is a pretty typical point and click adventure game. Click on things to observe or interact with them. Collect, combine, and use items to solve puzzles and advance. The game allows you to press a button to show everything on screen that can be interacted with, which prevents "pixel hunting" and circumvents a lot of frustration. Unfortunately, the puzzles are generally either extremely simple or incredibly convoluted and illogical. I ended up using guides for large parts of this game because I simply didn't want to take the time trying to interact every item with every object in the game in order to advance.\n\nGraphics\nLike it's other bargain bin adventure game brethren, Secret Files is an ugly game, even without taking its age into account. The game features simple 2D backgrounds and stiffly animated 3D characters. Despite the variety of locals, its all very boring.\n\nSound Design\nPossibly the worst part of the game. The music is fine but the voice acting is truly atrocious, especially from the actress playing Nina. If you want to get a sample of it, jump to 27:55 in the episode. I think part of this is that the game was originally in German and a lot got lost in translation so the actors have no idea how to deliver the bizarre lines that they have to. Also, despite traveling the globe in this game, everyone speaks in an American accent.\n\nOverall, I do not recommend that anyone plays this game under any circumstances. It's just plain bad.","March 31","false","14.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Considering I started it last April, froze it until June, and then only came back to it today as I was bored really says a lot about it.\n\nI really don't understand what people find in this game. I am a long time point'n'click lover, I've been playing adventure games forever, and played a lot of them. Tunguska is a bit like the Runaway series: an incredibly lame game that for some unknown reason a lot of people seem to enjoy, and sometimes even consider (god forbid!) peaks in the genre.\n\nThis game is boring. It's just as plain as that. You're simply not motivated enough to go on and find out what's happening and why. The characters are dull, the story uninteresting, and there really isn't anything that stands up. Well, except maybe for the UI. I really loved Lost Horizon, which was made by the same guys and with which Secret Files Tunguska shares engine and UI: I liked the way the user interface was conceived, and it doesn't fail to deliver here as well. Unfortunately the developers apparently completely forgot the valuable lessons Lost Horizon provided and so in Tunguska, excellent UI aside, pretty much everything else is missing, that is the game itself. Thinking I bought the whole series in a bundle really makes me cringe: if that's the standard I'm supposed to expect, I really don't think I'll ever install the sequels.\n\nSave the money for some better game, and there are a lot out there.","December 13, 2015","false","10.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Its not so bad I hated it, but I certainly didnt love it. I enjoy games where I have to use my brain to think of how to combine items in my inventory to progress but often in this game I just didnt understand how I was supposed to know to combine certain things.  IT got to the point that when I was stuck I would often just try combining everything to see if something would work and when it did I'd scratch my head.  That element made it very frustratting to want to finish this game. At one point I had forgotten to use a certain item in my inventory with another item at a location and everytime I tried to leave the museum, Nina wouldnt let me leave saying she wasnt finished there... but I couldnt finish because I didnt have a vital piece of the puzzle! I had to restart from an earlier save...GRR.  It wook me about 9 hours to finish this game and its not difficult, I just spent so much time retracing my steps when I couldnt find the right combinations to move on.  The story is "meh"... the voice acting is awful at times.  I bought all four games as a bundle so Im really hoping they improved upon some parts of the game as the series progressed.","November 20, 2014","false","9.5"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

Bad voice acting kills any adventure game for me, and this one has a HORRIBLE voiceover (at least the English version, can't say anything about the others).

It wasn't horrible but, it could have been so much more.  The voice acting was only alright - cheesy in many parts.  The graphics were pretty nice and the cut scenes weren't bad but the story did not keep me guessing at all or for that matter interested.  I was praying for it to be over so many times.  It took me 10 hours to beat this game because that was because I kept wandering off, in all reality I would say this game can be beaten in about six or seven easily.  The puzzles are not that amazing either sadly.  Some make sense and others are a complete joke.  I bought all four of them in a package deal - haven't decided if I'm going to try any of the others yet.  If you aren't a big point and click person normally - I would skip this one and head for the FAR superior adventure point-and-click game Broken Sword.","November 5, 2014","false","11.0"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"
