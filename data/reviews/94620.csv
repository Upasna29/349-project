It’s a slightly darkish humour but funny none the less. Especially if you get the quirky little remarks and references only a fellow brit would.\n\nHector: Badge of Carnage is a point and click adventure game set in a small ♥♥♥♥♥♥ British town that has been overrun with corruption and lack of giving a toss. Full of chavs, junkies, prozzies and rather crappy coppers you play as Hector, a questionable detective who is going to help the town, catch the bad guy and save the day!\n…so he can indirectly help himself to probably go back to the pub or for a kip.\n\nDialog in this game is very amusing, at least it was to me. I would recommend the game for that alone.\n\nCharacters are enjoyable most of the time, the main ones are loveable, the… chav and junkie extras and whatnot not so much. But they’re WRITTEN to be annoying! So good job, old bean!\n\nWhat I remember of the music wasn’t bad. Didn’t make me want to pull my hair out so that’s a good start.\n\nGraphics are nice, I enjoy classic point and clicks more so then the newer ones and this game series is definitely one that should be on the list for anyone that likes the same.\n\nLiterally the only problem I had with this series is that I had a crash during the second episode. I lost no progress but it was still mildly annoying. Apart from that and me having a slow start with it (probably the old point and click brain trying to boot up again) I haven’t a bad word to say about it.\n\n\nTL;DR : Great/slightly dark British humour,  amusing characters, nice graphics and an all-around great little series, I recommend any point and click fan buys it.","August 17, 2014","true","4.2"," 26 of 26 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","26","26","0","3"

Lots of British slang. The mechanics of the game is simple: click once to See an item, double-click to Use it. All 3 episodes are connected, but Episode 2 is probably my favourite because it has the largest number of locations. The story isn't the greatest, but there is a big plot-twist at the end of Episode 2.\n\n- The graphics are cute but the game's maximum resolution is quite-small, and doesn't support wide-screen.\n","March 8, 2015","true","2.1"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

Puzzles are decently complicated, the story makes sense in its own way, and what will keep you interested is the fantastic (and really cynical) humour.

He's the right man for his place and time. Hector is a cop in the degenerate town of Clappers Wreake, a place which has so abandoned the notion of anything wholesome that the street out front of the police station itself features ♥♥♥♥♥s, drunks, and looting.\n\nAnd so the story is set in motion: a sniper appears in a window in town, gunning down police and boasting a roomful of hostages. Hector is called to the scene to deliver his unique brand of justice, only to be set on a series of errands for the mysterious gunman who claims only to have the betterment of Clappers Wreake at heart.\n\nHector is fat, blunt, rude, an alcoholic, and not a connoisseur of self-respect. He's every ounce as much of a degenerate as the rest of the population, but he's smarter than a good deal of them, and he's willing to do what it takes to save the day. For... well, some reason or other, anyways.\n\nHector: Badge of Carnage contains a lot of crude humor. The first screen of the first game involves fishing in a disgusting toilet with a used condom. But there's an interesting wit about it - particularly in Hector's observations on the situation. Yeah, this series is for the immature, through and through. But it's a sarcastic immaturity that's aware of its actions, and doesn't just settle for, "Look, poop, ha ha!" as an entire joke.\n\nThe voicework is not a highlight. The first game sounds as though it's voiced entirely by one guy speaking into his laptop's built-in microphone. The second game adds a genuine female voice to the cast, but that's still only two voices, seemingly digitally altered to sound more diverse. At the very least, the delivery's good, so it's nothing that'll ruin your experience.\n\nOn the whole, the puzzles are decent enough. The third game has a habit of making new elements appear in locations you've already visited, and then not alerting you to them, so that you have to stumble across them in a fit of random, confused wandering. But overall, I like Hector: Badge of Carnage. And if, like me, you're both an adventure game fan and a scumbag, then you probably will, too.","October 26, 2013","true","4.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You play as Hector, a crude and vulgar British Detective over 3 episodes which are all linked together very well. The storyline and characters you meet are interesting and are always surprising. The writing, voice acting and comedy are superb and the hand drawn characters and environments are all well done. If you're looking for a comedic point and click adventure game, this is a must have!

The series tells a single story arching over the three episodes and therefore act as one in that sense as well.\n\nA terrorist is on loose at Clappers Wreake and it’s your job as titular Hector to save the town. Very little is actually worth saving since the place is run down and infested with trash – both literal and as in its citizens. In your aid is an annoying and useless (the game’s own words) sidekick called Lambert. Hector himself is no ordinary policeman and neither are his methods: There is not a single decent thing you do in this game! You have to insult people, drug people, cheat people. You’ll participate in organ trading, church burning and evidence forging among other things. I especially liked the part where you beat up a dairy farmer.\n\nThis might seem as crude and you can be sure it is. It’s all presented with loads of dark and tasteless humour that you either love or you hate. Every human orifice and fluids found within gets some time in the spotlight. I kind of liked the totally absurd conversation options and just listening to the madness. Puzzles are relatively easy and you can breeze through most of the game. There is a really generous hint system if you ever get stuck and even a full walkthough can be  found in the menus.\n\nGraphics have nothing to give praise for. Animation is there just to get the job done but it's not very polished. The game does support wide range of resolutions, at least up to 1920x1080, but the assets are not 16:9. Instead the game leaves black bars on both sides of the screen and it’s really hard to tell any meaningful difference between the resolution settings. The graphical quality cannot be customised any other way. I didn’t notice any crashing, bugs etc. during my playthrough, which took about 4 hours per episode.\n\nHector’s voice acting really hits the spot and his delivery combined with the horrible things he’s saying is what kept me motivated. Every character has a thick British accent with a lot of slang that is at times hard to understand. No matter, since every unfamiliar word is an insult anyway. Whatever other sounds or music there was didn't make any impact.\n\nI’m a little bit ashamed to admit it but I laughed far more than anyone should at this game. I have given warnings about the content and if it still sounds like something you might enjoy, you’ll get your moneys worth.

I was never disappointed with the responses I received from Hector when interacting with his environment and with others as the dialog is varied and entertaining.  I thought the puzzles were fairly easy, but Hector's partner, Lambert, was able to provide clues in a roundabout way had it been necessary.  There was even a hint option beyond that, unbelievably.\n\nHowever, the game isn't without it's flaws.  In fact, it suffers from a few glaring issues that make me just about want to not recommend this game and they both involve the voice dialog.\n\nFirstly, there only seems to be three or four voice actors for the entire game.  One voice sounds like an Asian making a pathetic attempt at a Brittish/Scottish accent and every time I heard this voice it grated on my nerves.  Secondly, some of the dialog has horrendous production value and sounds as if it were recorded with an extremely cheap desktop microphone with its gain set to max.  A third notable but much less irritating issue is that some of the text and voice didn't match and on a few occassions there was no voice at all.\n\nI would still recommend this game, but if I had to rate it I would probably give a 6/10.\n\nBTW, even though I chose to write a review for "The Complete Series", it's listed as a review of Episode 3 in my profile which lists as 4 hours played.  It took me ~12 hours to complete the series.","September 15, 2014","true","5.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You're really buying this game for the story (more then gamemplay).\nIts an interesting mix of Brit and American Humor.  The text -tree  dialogues are pretty good  (  you  may get bored w/ them and just want to move the story along ..  ((  at least I did ))   at which point  you're  kind of missing part of the game)  so  idk.        where does the fun stop and tediousness set in?\n\nmost of the 'puzzles' are pretty straight forward...  though there are some that arent obvious ( which can be  frustrating since you know what u need to do, but its wanting you to do it a certain way)     example :  I needed 'something'  and I found 'something'   only that wasnt the 'soemthing'  they wanted me to use... the "something"  they wanted me to use  I needed to ask for from someone i didnt realize i could even talk to.\n\nthe game does come with an in game  help/cheat    but  even it doesnt give u a complete walkthrough\n(and if you watch the help on line.. . you might as just watch the game online  instead of buying)\n\nSo if you're a fan of Telltale games/  P&C adventures/  and can get it for $5 or under i'd say  give it a go...\n\n\n","January 4, 2015","false","11.0"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","11","24","0","0"

Coupled with the crass bitterness of the alchoholic main character, and goofy puzzles, there was entertainment without too steep or shallow of a difficulty curve.\n\nI bought the entire series for 5 bucks, a downright steal for 3 games, and though my experience with this genre may have shortened the playtime to a few hours per episode.","March 10, 2012","true","3.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RPINerd/recommended/94620/","RPINerd","RPINerd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RPINerd/","470 products in account","Point and Click adventures are a finicky bunch; regardless of whether the genre as a whole appeals to you or not, there are always a few titles that you will love simply because of the thematic material. I personally find myself on a fine edge with the genre. I tend to get frustrated easily with the Sierra logic puzzles but at the same time I will often stick it out simply to see the next moment of storytelling. This can hold true even if the characters are not ones I have previously been invested in.\n\nSadly I just was not impressed by Hector. I made it maybe halfway through the first chapter/episode/adventure/whatever and just had no desire to suffer through the point and click gameplay to see the story pan out. I only briefly started the second iteration/sequel/whatever and it was just more of the same. The gameplay was by no means flawed and the art was actually rather marvelous, but Hector as a character just did not appeal to me.\n\nObviously I have no way to concisely convey all of my tastes in entertainment so I think my best advice would be to check out the trailers for the game, and maybe watch the first 10-15 minutes of gameplay on youtube. If you like the humor and the narrative then definitely pick up the trilogy when it goes on sale next. Otherwise, there are tons of other franchises out there to enjoy. I personally love the Wallace and Grommit titles, as well as the Back to the Future series.","September 20, 2015","false","0.5"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

I give this a slight no recommendation on based my personal gaming taste, I only finished one episode of the three and didn't have motivation to carry on so in some ways i didn't like it enough. On the other hand if you'd like a point&click adventure that doesn't take it too seriously and some funny jokes along the line - Hector: Badge of Carnage is a pretty decent choice.","December 9, 2013","false","0.2"," 9 of 27 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","9","27","0","0"

Even so, it was a fun game full of classic british dark humor, silly puzzles and just so much fun. The fact that you get to play from different perspectives after episode one was great and why some puzzles took a long time to figure out, nothing was so impossible that you have to go down the entire hint system.\n\nOn that note, for those who are less then awesome at figuring puzzles out, the hint system will go from hint to full hand-holding all the while insulting you in humorous ways. It kinda makes you wanna prove the cheeky system wrong. hehehe.\n\nEither way, great game, great story, great characters and just a classic point and click game. 9/10 Would play it again.","September 27, 2014","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

He and his little sidekick have to save the town meeting both amusing, irritating and gross characters on the way.\n\nMyself, I liked the humor, at least when it was absurd, and even though there were a couple of literate turds around it was okay. That reminds me, the playing experience is enhanced if you're a bit tired. The puzzles were mostly quite logical but also rather easy with maybe one curious exception, and if you can't figure something out then this is one of those games where you can just click everything and try everything on everything and, eventually, you're bound to get onward. If you tried other Telltale titles with point & click -interface, the gameplay is rather similar.\n\nI think the 20 € price is a bit much for 7 hours that I used to finish this game, but in a sale this is definitely worth picking up, so long as you like light adventure games.","July 23, 2013","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gameplay seemed to flow really well from beginning to end since your only pointing and clicking but there was a minor bug in the 1st game, with a little time out being stumped in how to progress but the game helps you out without resorting to the net for any help (if your smart enough "heh").\nFor any "British" person out there I would highly recommend this just highly for the humor value in what hector and the the inhabitants of Clappers Wreake has to offer. It could do with improvement but in a slight way but would be me berating the game, but it gets a high mark from me. I highly recommend playing this game if you love your point and click games, Its not long it should take about 3 - 4 hours tops (well for me) but was worth it.\nEnjoy!","November 19, 2012","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Quite a bit of the humor is low brow, I didn't find it too offensive myself, so you might want to watch who's around if your playing with your speakers on or the youngin's might find some interesting names to experiment with. The game basically reminded of a british "The Naked Gun".\n\nThe game is made up of three parts.  In each part you have to solve the various puzzles to move on.  I didn't find the puzzles to be to much of a brain twister, but there are couple that had me scratching my head for awhile.  Luckily there is a built in hint system if the games wacky humor has you wanting to guide Hector off the nearest roof or something.\n\nAll in all give this one a shot if you like parodies, british humor, and point and click adventures. You might just get a laugh or two.","October 5, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LonMcGregor/recommended/94620/","LonMcGregor","LonM","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LonMcGregor/","303 products in account","Hector is a point-and-click adventure game with a lot of vulgar humour. I'm not entirely sure why it got made as 3 separate games instead of being packaged into one, so this review is for all 3 together. Total playtime ended up between 6-8 hours.\n\nThe art in this game is very comical and fits nicely with the sort of jokes in the game. It's high-quality with just a few spotty patches in the entire series. The voice acting in this is very good, with a wide range of 'british' accents, which help to add to the wide variety of amusing characters.\n\nThe humour, as mentioned, is very vulgar, so it won't be to everyones liking. It ranges from chav humour, to off-colour jokes about the local deadbeat population. Surprisingly, it manages to do so without resorting to a waterfall of swear words, with Hector showing off a wider vocabulary than you might initally expect, which really adds to the humour. There are also a few meta-jokes in there for good measure, which aren't too in-your-face.\n\nThe puzzles in this game are generally pretty good, with solutions that need you to think a bit, but aren't ridiculously complicated or out of the box. Its your standard p&c puzzles of helping out characters to get items to progress with others. There were one or two spots that left me stumped, but the in-game help is very good at giving both subtle and obvious hints at how to solve things. The way you can interact when you get to play as both lambert and hector at once is a nice way to spice things up.\n\nMy real complaint with this game is the interface. I never really got the hang of click once to view and click twice to interact, and often trying to double click just gets interpreted as a single click. Plus, on a 1080x1920 screen, the scenes sort of got squashed into a 1080x1400 letterboxed screen. A bit annoying.\n\nBut other than interface issues, this is a good p&c adventure game, and if you like a vulgar/british stereotype style of humour, then its definitely worth playing.","April 16","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
