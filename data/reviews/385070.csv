You get a choice between two paths, one of Nail and one of Elleria each have a different team which aides them and they seem to be enemies. I guess you could say it's a choice of Good or Evil, but I haven't played far enough in to know if that is the case. I would recommend this game to anyone who loves a cheap and entertaining game, as long as you don't mind the graphics, the actual fighting is fun. Gashrun is love, Gashrun is life.\n\n8.5/10 I Really Enjoy This Game.\n\nEDIT: I completed the game and it is indeed enjoyable, I have now started a new save as Nail. ^-^","July 17, 2015","true","13.2"," 40 of 48 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","40","48","3","0"

I have many games in my library and very few have i tried to play more deeply. I suppose the biggest sin with these games are that they require massive amounts of time before it gets interesting and i rarely have the time for that.\n\nTo my delight there are newcomers that attempt to squeeze out everything from the engine and add something new to the gameplay. This game does not seem to try to add any really weird tricks like a more popular Lisa game did but it tries it's best to make a dark looking rpg and apperars to succeed pretty well.\n\nIt's still the base RPG engine underneath there but the soundtrack is awesome and the intro to the game is some of the best i have seen in awhile in these types of games and pacing is good.","August 15, 2015","true","7.3"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","27","30","2","0"

The first couple act are decent if forgettable affairs as you move from place to place, tackle some very simple quests and generally kill everything in your way. It works but leaves no lasting impression and that's something that always makes me frown in an RPG.\n\nThis flimsy base sadly starts to tumble down when fights ramp up in difficulty, random encounters happen more often and escape attempts become harder. I'm fine with a challenge but facing foes that, with unlucky targeting, can leave your party at half health after one turn isn't my idea of fun: once you start going low on HPs or lose a member the fight can quickly turn into an heal/rez/die again circle that quickly becomes annoying. The escape mechanic is also random and sometimes you'll need 3 or 4 attempts before it works (my record is 6 btw) meaning you're probably better off just wiping and reloading a save.\n\nBut even if fights worked the main problem is the lacking plot, in my 8 hours with the game (going through with both characters) I simply lacked the will to go on as the flimsy story wasn't enough to make me want to see the rest of it or to give me a reason to go through the annoying fights. Atonement: Scourge of Time isn't a terrible game but it simply failed to do enough to be a remarkable or even fun RPG for me. You can easily find better games even from the same dev, as City of Chains proves.\n","April 14","false","8.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","2"

The story started very cliché, but surprisingly developed into something more than decent, well thought out.\n\nSide quests are rare but make sense within the story. I died only a handful of times on the "challenging" difficulty mode, playing as Nail and completed the game in roughly 10 hours (you can probably do it in less than 7 hours if you play fast, I'm slow). There are a few puzzles here and there, all of them very easy. Combat can sometimes be challenging, but it's easy enough so that no grinding or backtracking is required. As long as you take your time to explore, do side quests and upgrade your equipment in shops between missions you will be fine.\n\nSince this game has two completely different story lines (as two different caracters / teams), I liked it enough to know I will play the other one sooner or later. I think it says a lot.\n\n+ Interesting enough story to keep me interested\n+ Combat carefully balanced\n+ Good soundtrack\n+ Competent use and tweaks of the RPG Maker engine\n+ Not too long, not too short\n+ 2 campaigns to play\n+ Cards and achievements\n- Very linear\n- I barely had to use any potion and ended up with too much money to spend\n- Not everyone will like RPG maker interface\n\nOverall score considering it's a low budget title: 7/10\nBuy on sale, in a bundle or trade for this game without hesitation.","December 20, 2015","true","10.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

No little Anime sprites and cookie cutter RPG Maker type of game.  Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy those type of games.  However, Atonement was such a welcome break from the typical RPG Maker market of games.  Good boss battles that actually makes the gamer think of using some of those skills you gained while leveling up.\n\nAtonement has a good story line that is told through the eyes of two different characters (each has their own campagin with different quests and unique bosses).  A gamer can tell that Atonement was made with true heart and care.  The developer should be very proud of this game.","March 10","true","19.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
