That's what's on the sign. In its own way, it's really trying to warn you. Not about ghosts; there aren't any here, just enormous skinless women, but that this entire game is about as original and well thought out as calling your setting 'Ghost Town'.\nThere's nothing to do here. The biggest challenge you'll face is collecting the notes that are nailed to the walls, in spite of the Skinless Sisters' ability to murder you through them. Deciphering the notes is also a fun distraction. "It seems more and then look in the hopper" reads one. Such poetry.\nIt's not worth money in any currency I can think of.

Said enemies have a sort of death aura and you'll die whenever one gets too close to you, even through walls thus leading to some frustrating deaths: their AI is super simple and, the rare times they'll try to slowly walk towards you, just ducking out of view will quickly make them lose interest.\n\nYou'll have to gather a certain amount of notes, said notes are supposed to be research left behind by the man you're looking for but between the broken English and simple, nonsense phrases ( what the heck is "it seems to me that what I saw" supposed to mean?) they just resemble something written by a 4yo. The notes also seem to always spawn in the same place so getting them will be easy once you know where they are: I had at least two notes bugging out though and I had to get near them and pick them up a second time before they finally disappeared.\n\nIf you can survive this dull exercise in frustration you'll have to do the same in an hospital: this part was even easier since there was only two floors with a monster each and both of them followed a very simple patrol route: once that's done you'll enter the final area and get the ending.\n\nIt took me 30 minutes to finish the game (including retries in the town area) and, after getting to the end, I can safely say there's really nothing going for it. The overall production values are very low, heck there's not even a death animation, the actual gameplay is awkward and lacks challenge once you learn how to avoid the cheap deaths and there's no sense of menace whatsoever as you travel through the bare environments. If you're looking for a Slender clone there's many better games out there, if you want SCP games there's some good ones for free: either way avoid this one.","September 22, 2015","false","0.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

He shows up at a town named Ghost Town.  It's abandoned except for ugly looking beastly things patroling the town, and you don't even make a peep or any sound of surprise.  No, you go around collecting notes stuck on walls that make zero sense, and for some odd reason you have to collect the notes before deciding to go to the hospital, where you know your friend is at, and eventually you go there to end up collecting more notes before you decide to use the elevator.  If that was me, I'd be at the start of the game fixing my car so I can leave asap.  F-ck that noise.\n\nThis is a good example of a developer who has no bright ideas or developed skill for making games.  This was obviously a beginner's project.  Don't expect much.  Not even the notes have much.  I still don't understand what the notes were saying.\n\nI'm only recommending it because it does produce a creepy vibe, and I got a couple of jump scares and lingering creepiness from it.  And the running is excellent.  I managed to run up a mountain right up to its apex, in seconds.  Too bad there's no jumping and I had to run around the sidewalk to the sidewalk-ramp in order to get onto the sidewalk.  =(","February 20","true","0.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

At the start, you can walk through the truck. Exploring the town, sometimes the camera "peaks" out through the walls. Most of the building assets are all the same, and the furnitue is non-existant. Even though it looks and feels half finished, what is there is decent.\n\nAudio is something Im also on the fence about. It fades at random while outside. But when it is working as it should, its pretty good.\n\nThe objective of the game, collecting notes is a bit bland. Why not have more text in the notes? As it is, there are only a few words per note, barely enough to peak your interest. Some notes trigger a jump scare which seemed slightly out of place (because the monsters never attack or chase you), but did make me jump.\n\nAs a side note, as my friend was quick to point out, the bad guys are giant brown boob monsters in heels. And speaking of the boob monsters, becareful exploring the town. When the game goes fuzzy, a boob monster is near. If youre in a building, back away from the walls. I died at the start because I stood too close to a monster on the other side of the wall. And speaking of the boob monsters, they are on fixed pathes. They never chase, they never attack, they just follow their set path and ignore you.\n\nGame play aside, the game lacks a UI. Hitting "escape" mid game doesnt seem to do anything. There also arent really any "options" other than graphics settings. No volume slider, no resolution sliders, nada. If you want to play in windowed, you need to hit alt+enter, but the window doesnt resize (or didnt for me at least). When I wanted to quit, I had to task manager kill it. Maybe it was just a freak bug I found, or so Im hoping.\n\nOverall, the game appears and feels half-finished. What is there is decent, but you definitely notice that it is lacking in many ways, gameplay and graphically, which break immersion.\n\nIn the end I cant honestly give it a recommendation. The clipping bugs, lack of graphical assets (it bugged me beyond end that the buildings were all clean and empty), and buggy audio are what Id expect from an early access title, not something sold as a finished product. If you really want to play it, grab it on sale, but I wouldnt pay full price for it.","October 5, 2015","false","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
