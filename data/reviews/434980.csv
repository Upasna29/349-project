"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/recommended/434980/","TeeJaxOff","TeeJax <3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/","3933 products in account","Onion Force is an addictive tower defense hybrid with a unique spin and a lot of fun to be had.\n\nGeneral Gameplay\nOnion Force combines the elements of tower with some light action features which sets it apart from most other games in the genre. The gameplay is true to most TD games, you can place towers that’ll do different things such as attack and heal but the unique thing about Onion Force is the use of a hero to help repel enemies.\nYou have three heroes to choose from: Warrior, Bowman and Wizard and each has it’s own abilities and attack style that you can use. Warriors focus on Melee and are very strong whereas the Wizard and Archer are ranged and you’ll find yourself a little more susceptible to damage. Your heroes are fully controlled by you and you must defend your king alongside any towers you build. Though your hero can die in battle if you don’t use the heal tent properly you don’t have to worry as you can select one of the other two heroes to continue on with the level allowing you to have a second chance if you just made a mistake. Your hero has stamina and health, both of which will decrease as you play and can only be refilled at a healing tent so you’ll want to strategically place yours so you can both fight and survive!\n\nThe game is done in stages and each stage has a boss and as you’d expect the levels and bosses get harder as you continue through the game. Each stage can also be replayed in harder modes so if you want to complete the earlier levels again with a little more difficulty you’re able too adding a small amount of replayability after you’ve completed the game once.\nIn between stages you have the ability to level up your towers using the stars you get from completing each level. You can also use the onions that enemies occasionally drop as currency between stages to purchase spells but these only last one stage and since the onions are rare you’ll not want to waste them until you really do need them.\n\nSound & Graphics\nThe graphics are fine but they don’t scale well onto a larger screen. Everything looks a little blurry and the only options you can change are the resolutions options which don’t make anything any better. You need to play the game on a small windowed screen for the best graphics, I think this may be because it’s a mobile port? The sound is also nothing too impressive, just your run-of-the-mill soundtrack you’d expect in a tower defence game.\n\nCons\nMany people have mentioned the heal tent and i’d have to agree, it’s an annoying feature and should be rethought. It's boring/annoying to constantly have to return to a certain point just to regain stamina to attack. I think it could be much more forgivable if it was just for health but the stamina element makes it impossible to not use. I also feel at times the game really does feel like a mobile port. You see things here and there which seem like they were meant to be paywalls yet they haven’t translated well to PC. Lastly, there are some stages that seem severely unbalanced and require you to have beaten many prior stages on the harder levels to beat which can be a pain in the butt if you like you play through each difficulty individually.\n\nSummary\nOverall Onion Force is very fun and worth picking up on sale if you’re looking for a tower defense where you feel like you’re doing something more than just building and waiting. Although it does have it’s flaws it’s a great time waster and has sturdy enough gameplay to hold its own.","May 30","true","1.6"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/orgelambart/recommended/434980/","orgelambart","Orge Lambart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/orgelambart/","5483 products in account","Product received for free\n\nI personally love Tower Defense games, something about protecting my tower (or king in this game's case) really appeals to me.  It has all your typical Tower defense offerings, towers to help with defense (sniper, tar, cal-traps, soldiers etc,) you can also purchase spells between stages which will give your hero the advantage in the upcoming stage.  I was quite impressed by the game, and found myself drawn to it and it's very simplistic gameplay.  Onion Force makes for a nice casual game play experience, it's a game that can be enjoyed by people of almost any age and gameplaying ability.\n\nGameplay\nThe game play is simple, you select a stage,  (the first time you play it'll be on easy, after that you have the choice of med or hard), then you select which hero you want to use..  The levels i'll call them are broken down into various stages..   Each level has 5 stages, with the fifth one being the most difficult and containing a unique "boss" battle, although most of the bosses aren't too much more difficult than the normal enemies.  The game features three different heroes, the Warrior, archer and mage, each one has a slightly different approach on how to defeat enemies.   The warrior is as you may have suspected, the upfront meat head type, continually smash into enemies until they are dead, rinse and repeat, I personally found myself using the warrior twice as much as the other two heroes.  Personally felt the other two were slightly under-powered in terms of beast slaying, although they are viable choices albeit much more options.  The goal of the game is to protect your king from being overwhelmed and killed by the enemies.\n\nThroughout the game you'll get various drops from the enemies, the first of which are coins, which you can collect and use to build your various towers, the second collectible will be onions, which are used to purchase spell buffs prior to the stage.  The buffs can really give a major advantage to the gamer, but require onions which are semi rare, so be sure to not go too crazy buying buffs or you'll run out of Onions on the stages when you really need them.  The game also has weapons which can drop for the various heroes, you can equip them prior to the stage, the weapons increase attack power and sometimes have a unique bonus added to them.  You also get coins by beating stages, which are used for upgrading your towers.  Although this proves to be a double edged sword as each new upgrade, increases the cost of building that particular tower.  The gameplay is relatively fun although can get repetitive after a while\n\nCombat\nEach of the three heroes has their own unique brand of attacking.  The Warrior bumps into enemies and takes down the enemies health.  He has the most health and deals the most melee damage.  The archer as you may have guessed is given a bow which shoots at enemies from am distance.  You can also bump into enemies while playing as the Archer but don't expect to last very long, the archer can only take 4 or 5 bumps before he's killed.  The mage attacks with an AOE cone of damage, it damages and pushes back enemies, a great tactic involves standing just near a tower as the wizard and continually pushing enemies back so the tower can hit them.\n\nThe two bars on your heroes are health and stamina, the warrior loses health and stamina with each attack, the archer and mage lose stamina with each attack and only lose health if they melee an enemy. If you run out of stamina you'll have to rest in a medical tent to continue fighting.  Upon death you are given the option to select one of the other two heroes to continue the battle.\n\npros\nCasual and fun\nPick up and play\nsomewhat humorous\ngraphically adequate\n\nCons\nThe reliance on a medical tent (a better mechanic would have been making the enemies drop health and stamina when killed)\ntends to be a bit repetitive\nThe upgrade system can make replaying  earlier stages difficult as you won't have the money needed to build towers.\nprice tag is slightly high\n\nRecommendation\nFans of tower defense games will love the simplistic nature of Onion force, it won't scratch that itch if you're looking for a hardcore intensely difficult tower defense marathon game, but it will certainly provide a few hours of casual, enemy smashing fun.  I'd recommend this game if you like to kick back, play a fun and simplistic game.  Will you enjoy Onion Force..  most likely yes, will it be the GOAT, certainly not, but not all games can be the GOAT, but they should atleast strive to be fun, and Onion Force does just that..","May 20","true","1.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","2"

The levelling system and game design is awesome and refreshing for fans of tower defense games. I've found myself doing levels over and over again trying new strategies to get perfect victories or more stars. I highly recommend this game to anyone interested in tower defense games. It's extremely addicting and enjoyable to play. I'm a huge fan of the three character system. I'm mainly been using the Bowman and when I died to one of the wave bosses, I ended up having to use my underleveled Wizard and Warrior characters. My only choice was to kamikaze them into the boss doing damage to both of us before the boss killed my King. After my Wizard died, my Warrior managed to kill it with the last of his health and I beat the level with all 3 of my characters dead! One of the cooler moments I've had in this game. The new WASD movements also offers versatility for players who want to play with a different control scheme which is a nice addition that shows the creator cares about what his consumers want.

It offers 30 levels across 6 environments, which is about the standard amount of content for a game of this type to keep you playing without losing interest before you're through. The 8 different tower types in the game follow the usual arrow / cannon / slowgoo chain, but there are also a couple fairly originals ones such as the caltrops & barracks towers.   The heroes you control are likewise incredibly typical - archer shoots single foes quickly, mage shoots slowly with area blasts, warrior hits things up close and can take a lot of punishment.  The story is little more than an excuse to fight through the boss map to reach another change of scenery, but there is always a bit of quirky dialogue about the different enemies you encounter and locations you explore to keep you interested, which is definitely a plus.\n\nUnfortunately, along with the averagely well-done game mechanics, Onion Force also suffers from the most common flaws in a mobile port.  The audio sounds nearly as tinny as it would from a mobile device, and the graphics look about the same.  Additionally some of the controls don't work as well as they should (pressing ESC instantly quits the game instead of bringing up a menu, inventory management is a pain, running through a tower-build spot brings up a huge window covering the screen, gold/onions are hard to collect, etc) - but on the plus side, the devs recently patched 'WASD' keys to work as movement, so improvements are being made.\n\nWith all that said, Onion Force does everything well-enough to make it an enjoyable - but not exceptional - experience.  However, I would have to suggest waiting for a sale (or price drop) before purchasing, as $10 seems too high for the content in what is essentially a mobile game... and I probably wouldn't recommend this game to those who don't already enjoy Tower Defense as a genre.  Still, if you're a Tower Defense fan, you might want to give Onion Force a shot!\n\nReceived a free copy for testing/reviewing purposes.

The humor is actually very well placed and comes from the side character, Lady D, who pops up in the top of the screen and also gives hints or tips about levels when needed.\n\nAs for the game itself I honestly loved every minute of it. The game is very challenging and really requires you to grind and strategize especially if you want to replay each level on a harder difficulty for more loot. The tower defense function of the game literally works just like any other tower defense game. You build various weapons to protect your king and enemies follow a preset path taking damage along the way. What really makes this game fun however is the enemies are almost always too powerful for just the basic defenses meaning that you have to use one of three characters, each with their own strenghts and weaknesses, to fight against the horde of enemies. If one character dies then you can choose one of the other two characters to play as until you are either victorious or fail. The game offers a lot of challenge and can even force you to have to go back a level or two sometimes just to make sure that you can jump back in with enough experience and money to build your defenses up.\n\nI love tower defense games but tend to get impatient having to wait on the games to progress so having one that throws you right into the action is a fun and new breath of fresh air for tower defense games and action games as well.\n\nI did a lets play of the first stage for people who might want to see the crazy action for themselves:\nhttps://youtu.be/JIGBalslxYs","March 2","true","0.9"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","16","27","3","0"

I was excited at first because of the goofy premise and the fun (albeit sometimes disturbing) art style, but what I got was a disorganized mess of a game with frustrating controls in spite of the good ideas it has.\n\nThe game is a Tower Defense at its core, where you are able to build towers in predetermined locations.  You control a hero (there are three total with slightly different playstyles) to fight them off.  However, the mode of movement is weird.  You click and your character goes there.  This isn't like Diablo or similar games, but more like aiming a gun and firing a bullet, with the origin point being where your hero CURRENTLY is.  This, while an interesting and unique idea, becomes un-fun very fast.  You can to continue to click for max speed and you have to use this method of control to move around the pseudo-maze maps that tower defense titles are known for.  You end up bouncing off walls very often or accidentally purchasing towers you didn't even want because you're clicking so frenetically.\n\nThere are three main factors that make the movement style so unbearable in this game: parts your screen and map are often occluded by the inconsequential textboxes of the fairy companion character, the fact that you get almost no time to breathe in between waves to collect yourself, reposition or place buildings, and finally, the necessity of running over coins to collect the money for kills.  No vacuum effect for the coins, and they have a very precise hitbox for a very imprecise method of movement.  Collecting coins is infuriating but required, and with so much to do you'll find yourself falling behind in one way or another, ultimately getting screwed out of a star or two (your upgrade currency) because you maybe hit a wall one too many times.\n\nFurther, most damage will be done by your hero rather than the towers.  You damage enemies by colliding with them with your bullet-hero, which also deals damage to the hero.  So you have to bounce between helping and going to a medical tent (which costs money to build in the first place, taking away from the money for your towers) to be effective.  It feels more tedious and frustrating than fun.\n\nOverall this feels like a game that would be more at home on Newgrounds.  I can't see anyone paying 10 dollars for this and being pleased, especially when games like Kingdom Rush, which is in the same genre, came out 2 years ago and is much bigger in scope and much more competently put together, is the same price.  Maybe for a buck or two this would be a good buy, but even then I think these frustrations are hardly worth dealing with.\n\nKey was provided by Queen Bee Games and Dietrich Online Services.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/LGYTTT3TheY","March 4","false","0.9"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","1"

I actually already reviewed this game a month ago but that was based off of the demo version and this review is based off of the full release. For the record, I played this game for around 9+ hours according to Steam before beating all the “easy” levels in the game. Still working on beating the “medium” and “hard” levels.\n\nIf you haven't read my first review of the demo version then please go here first before reading: http://www.jtrev23reviews.com/2016/02/onion-force.html\n\n\n-INITIAL THOUGHTS-\n\nWhen I first reviewed this game I really disliked the default moving mechanic in which the player moved continuously in the direction of the mouse. Since then though, the full release has switched to WASD controls as the main movement mechanic with the mouse direction as a secondary moving option. I feel that just this small change alone drastically changed the overall quality of Onion Force for the better. Not only is it easier to control your character now, but it greatly helps the player maneuver out of unfavorable situations.\n\nOne more thing I wanted to mention was that although this game is a Tower Defense game, it also has many features of an RPG game and should be played as much. I found that certain levels that are too hard at first become way easier after leveling up your characters a bit and I would recommend treating the game as an RPG in addition to being a Tower Defense game.\n\n-PRESENTATION-\n\nI still highly appreciate the quality of the graphics and the variety of music in Onion Force, but after beating the game I’ve found the story to be rather lacking. Yes, this game does a nice job of telling bits and pieces of the story in between levels and spreading out relevant information throughout the game but in the end I feel that there are still many questions that are left unanswered. Without spoiling much, I found myself wondering: How did your team get chosen to protect the king? Who is Lawst related to, or better yet why did he start killing off kings in the land? These questions and a few more are left without answers by the end of the game and there doesn’t seem to try to answer them anytime in the game. Despite my feelings towards the ending and plot holes, I still found the overall presentation to be wonderful and I still believe Onion Force is a great game that I has a nice universal story with interesting plot twists that keep the player engaged.\n\nThe visual representation of the enemies are very well thought out and I felt that there was a nice variety of enemies with many different characteristics. I also liked the varying locations that the player has to traverse through in order to progress through the game. The music also flows really well with the game and helps to amplify the tone of each area in the game. Other than the holes in the story, I really had no other problems with the presentation of Onion Force.\n\n-ENGAGEMENT/GAMEPLAY-\n\n\nThere are many reasons that a player may be engaged in Onion Force. The obvious reason would be to complete all the levels and beat each of them on all levels of difficulty. Easy mode alone can be challenging before leveling up your character and Medium and Hard modes seriously tests the player’s skills. However, I can see players becoming engaged because of a particular challenging level, because the player is trying to beat their high score on a level, or because they are trying to level up their characters to a certain level before moving on. Aspects such as the leveling up and having health and mana is what makes this game somewhat an Action RPG in my mind even though the game mainly functions as a Tower Defense game. As for gameplay, I really especially liked the difficulty of the game and the overall tower mechanics. Much like other Tower Defense games, you have to spend a limited amount of money on towers that help to defeat enemies in some way and you earn more money by defeating enemies. For the most part I liked the variety of towers but I feel that the “chance” tower is a little overpowered in comparison to the rest. Sure you aren’t sure what perk you are going to get but it seems that the only negative result is rolling a 1. Not to mention that by increasing the level of the chance tower, increases the number of die rolled at a time which allows for stacking multiple effects on the enemy. Other than that I would say the game is fairly balanced in difficulty but power-ups, special equipment, or perks are needed in some situations. I really like the random special equipment feature. It helps to keep players from experiencing the exact same style of gameplay. In the demo version I mostly used equipment that sped up my wizard but the one of the first items I got this time around was arrows that poisoned the enemy. Needless to say I played as the bowman more this time around and I feel that having the items be randomized like that helps to keep the game interesting and fun.\n\n\n-OVERALL-\n\nI actually would be happy after spending money on this game. Not only is it fun and challenging but it also the game is good from both a visual and mechanical point of view. I would highly recommend playing with a separate mouse and keyboard though for anyone who plays game with a mousepad. Though rare, those people do exist and I warn you that the game will become very frustrating if you attempt to play this game without a mouse. Other than that, I would say that the game is well worth the $10 bucks and I recommend you buy it if you’re a huge fan of Innovative Tower Defense games, or Tower Defense games in general. At least consider buying it if you really like RTS games or Action RPG’s. If you like those types of games then I believe you would enjoy playing Onion Force.\n\nThanks for reading, and Happy Game Making!!\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/434980/","March 24","true","10.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

There is a variety of different levels and enemies that you may come across as you play throughout the game.\n\nGameplayFor me, Onion Force started off to be a really good game for the first half an hour. The gameplay itself was fun to begin with and really got me intrigued to play more of the game, but once I realised what the game actually was I really wasn't very impressed with it. The gameplay is sort of like a tower defence game meets RPG styled game, you are able to 'choose' your character and roam around the battlefield to kill enemies. I use the word choose loosely for a couple of reasons.\n\nSo when you first start a level you are given three characters you can pick as. Just normal standard classes nothing fancy or nothing, these classes consist of Warrior, Archer and Wizard. My first thought about this was that I would be able to play as one character throughout the game and then play it with another character to maybe add some replayability. I soon discovered this wasn't how this game was going to work out at all. With the three characters that you choose to be you will probably be all of them. because the way that the game works is that if your character dies you will either have to wait for it to be revived or pick another hero. Obviously you will pick another hero because you don't have time to wait around. So getting them to the same level as one another is a grind for the most part, having to replay levels constantly to try to level up your character.\n\nSomething that the game is highly dependant on is this heal tent. This will obviously heal your character to make sure they don't die in battle. This wouldn't be a problem if the game didn't have this one mechanic that forces you to always go back to the tent. This mechanic in the game is a yellow bar above your health bar. This yellow bar indicates how much of the power you have left. Every attack move that you use will cause you to lose some power. For some reason this power bar doesn't stay active for very long if you are trying to kill enemies. You are then either forced to go to a heal tent or use a heart to get it back. Trust me, you will visit the heal tent several times in one game.\n\nApart from this constant grind for exp the game does do a few things quite well. The first is the enemies that you encounter through the game. As you progress you will find more enemies that will have certain weaknesses from the towers that you can build. This is a nice way of making the game easier for the player, and makes them think about what tower to buy an place down next. Some of the enemies are also themed based, getting through 5 levels you will get to a new area and will find new enemies to encounter.\n\nSomething else that is rather unique about Onion Forces is the way that you upgrade your towers. Normally you would upgrade your towers when you place them once you have gained enough of the game's currency. Onion Forces however. puts the stars that you gained into upgrading your towers and making them more powerful. This is really good because in most games the number of stars you collect is just something that you collect, you don't find them precious or helpful it's just nice to have. While this game lets you use your stars to help you out later on in the game.\n\nThe next point I am going to make is this boost run that you have. Now I'm not really sure how this was suppose to be implemented, I thought that this boost has a cooldown or something so that you didn't constantly run around, but the game doesn't have that. So you can constantly run spamming right click. I wasn't sure if the game meant for this to happen but it seems a bit stupid to have something like that and not have it to be toggled on or off.\n\nThe graphics of this game aren't all that. In the new areas that you will find it will seem like a nice change of scenery until you realise that you will have to put up with it for X amount of hours. For me the first 5 levels took me about a hour to complete, the levels aren't really any different from one another and just look the same. Apart from that the colours of the game are nice, sometimes they are a bit dull here and there but overall they are alright.\n\nOnion Forces has a few soundtracks. Unfortunately, these are limited for each new area that you find as you go through the game. For the first 5 levels you will be listening to the same music as you fight through the enemies. Trust me when I say the music in this game isn't very good. I wouldn't even call it music, it just this same repetitive sound that is slightly mixed in with other sounds to try to make it sound different. Really dislike the music in this game.\n\nPros+ First half an hour is good\n+ Nice variety of enemies\n+ Use stars to upgrade your towers\n+ Standard graphics\n\nCons- After half an hour the game got boring\n- Game forces you to level up 2 or all 3 characters instead of just sticking to one\n- Playing as 2-3 characters makes you have to redo levels to gain exp, constantly grinding\n- Power bar makes you constantly have to go to the heal tent to attack with your character\n- Can constantly run, but have to spam right click to do so. There is no toggle for it\n- Music is bad\n\nResult / Final ThoughtsFor me Onion Forces really isn't worth buying. The replay ability is dragged on from you having to replay levels to level up your other characters that need to be the same level throughout the game. The game has alright graphics, but the music I would advise listening to your own if you're going to buy this game. Overall, I wouldn't recommend buying this game.\n\nRating: 4.7/10\n\nThis review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games.","May 12","false","2.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"
