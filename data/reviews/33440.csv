"Never heard of it", they tell me, "What's it about?". Well, it's a story-based driving game. "Intriguing", they say, "and you're playing as a criminal, I take it?". No, in fact you're a detective.\n\nA detective in a coma. I know, I know, it's serious.\n\nThe most ignorant people usually walk away at this point, and never listen to my opinions again. Or are those the ones who stay to hear more? I can never tell. Anyway, there's a filtration.\n\nHere's the great thing about Detective In A Coma: he can fly out of his own body into that of another driver, and take control of their car. What you do with it is up to you, and at the touch of a button you can fly back into your own car. You aren't restricted to the cars you can see, either; you can fly right up into the clouds and zoom out until the world is a virtual map, and choose cars to enter from the entire game world, zooming seamlessly down into the gameplay again. Yes, you've seen that in GTA V recently, but don't forget this game came out in 2011. And there are other abilities you'll gain later that I won't spoil now, but trust me - something FANTASTIC happens before the game's end, and you will never see anything like it in any driving game ever again.\n\nYes, this game is trashy and silly, but it's intentionally so. It's a spirited, madcap take on decades of buddy action movies. You should buy it. Maybe it'll become your favourite driving game too.","November 29, 2013","true","44.8"," 169 of 178 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","169","178","0","5"

The Uplay downloading from steam is outdated, do not open the game after you finish downloading it. Do not think for once it is like Origin/EA Game giving away your CD Key to another friend because it will not work like that.\n\n1. After downloading on steam, do not launch game!!\n\na. If you did install Uplay from Steam, uninstall it.\n\n2. Download the latest Uplay from the original website.\n\nhttps://uplay.ubi.com/#!/en-US/\n\n3. Launch the game from steam. Use the CD key on steam and activate it on your Uplay account.\n\nNow you can launch the game from steam all you want.\n\nThis game works on Windows 8 completely fine.\n\nUplay has two singleplayer challenge content you can grab after gaining Uplay points.\n\n"Tanners Day Off" and "San Franscico Challenge"\n\nThese challenges help your story mission by winning points to buy vehicles. They are worth grabbing. The other two is on your own. Not many people play multiplayer, so I suggest not to grab "SRT8 Police Car" as it is for multiplayer only.\n\nInitiate Uplay Achievement -> Reach Multiplayer Rank 5\n\nTips: Doing first Tutorial mission for multiplayer will get you from Rank 0 to Rank 1.\n\nThis achievement you either have to play with a friend or play online with 1 other person. Getting to level 5 is very easy and within an hour or two. Multiplayer content doesn't cross over to singleplayer. So those who bought this game for single player don't have to worry other than this achievement for 20 Uplay point to unlock contents.\n\nThe actual review. This is a must grab for racing fans. It is a free roam driving game rather than a GTA like game. You cannot get out of your car. There are many racing in this game with a lot of Hot Pursuit chases. If you are a fan of "Need For Speed Hot Pursuit", you'll love this game. This game is what "Hot Pursuit" should have been like with a story mode.","June 17, 2015","true","25.0"," 125 of 129 people (97%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","97","125","129","8","0"

One of the few 'tutorials' ever that aren`t annoying\n- I rolled my eyes at the first 2-3 'shifts' but it is actually totally forgivable and extremely well executed. It also adds to the very streamlined experience that seems to focus on the fun parts of a 'Driver' game. It also allows nice variety of perspectives and quests.\n- I got a similar feeling from it like I had with the first driver game. Something that never happened again since then. Now, very little time into the game I already failed at a few challenges a couple of times like it did so often with the original one. However, it is not frustrating since you know what your mistakes were and you improve.\n\nI decided to write the review already because I feel that I have gotten enough for my money in such short amount of time. I will play further of course but probably not update, since noby will give a ♥♥♥♥ about a review of an old game :D\nGet it if you like nice driving games. I´m hard to impress in this genre.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcnallyo/recommended/33440/","mcnallyo","SteerClear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcnallyo/","41 products in account","A reboot of the series rather than a true sequel, Driver SF brings something pretty much brand new to a driving/ racing game. It may not suit the series if you think of this game like its predecessors, but this installment of the Driver franchise has a much more lighter tone to it, therefore this new 'shift' feature fits in pretty well. 'Shift' allows you to jump from one vehicle to another that are cruising around on the streets of San Fran (this replaces 'on- foot'). If you get fed up of a car you're driving in, tap one button to shift out of the vehicle, float around the game world, choose a car that's driving about, then tap one button again to enter the vehicle. Simple. The game brings back the Hollywood film driving handling, allowing you to 'drift' or slide around corners in your favourite film car. Whether it be a classic Dodge Charger, Fiat 500, Nissan Skyline, or a Lamborghini I would say there's a car for everyone in this game, which there should be, since there's about 140 to choose from.\n\nThe story is about Detective 'John Tanner' once again, and takes place 6 months AFTER Driver 3. Jericho, also from Driver 3, is about to be sent to prison, yet he escapes in a prison van which he then uses as a weapon against Tanner causing a massive crash that sends Tanner in to a coma. The game, 99% of the time, is in Tanner's coma hence why you have this ability to shift and take over a persons body/ vehicle. The story is odd, but makes sense. In the real world Tanner is in a hospital bed, where a TV in is room is switched on and he can hear everything that is being said on the news about Jericho. So, in Tanner's coma dream he is trying to track down Jericho in a made up San Fran world.\n\nThere are main story missions that can range from finding info about Jericho, to chases and to learning about shift. Then there's side missions/ activities/ challenges, which there are a lot of. This could range from races, chases, smashing cars, or doing awesome stunts and jumps. There are also movie challenges which are based on classic car films, like Bullit for example. There is also free- drive which you can do pretty much at any point in the game, missions are found driving around in free drive.\n\nThings I like:\nThe range of missions/ activites- chases, races, etc\nThe cars- A nice range of vehciles. Whether it be muscle, sports, super. (Even buses and trucks etc)\nIn- car cam- Nice details and steering movements, one of the best I've seen in a driving game.\nFree roam or free drive- Means you can just mess about in your favourite car, causing cop chases and chaos!\nGraphics- The graphics aren't too bad for it's time, they're much better on the cars rather than the San Fran itself.\nMultiplayer- Both split screen & online are good, but good luck finding people who play on it.\nFilm director- It's a bit basic, but it just about does the job to take a look back at a cool crash or chase you just did.\n\nThings I don't like:\nAI- Suffers some bad rubber banding, sometimes they'll destroy you, then the next they will be nice as pie.\nCustomisation on cars- Can't choose what colour you want from the garage, it chooses for you! Also, boost is something the game makes you have and they put it on the steering control, so I advise changing control options.\nStory- It's a bit weak, it works in the game, but it's just too short.\nHUD- Things flashing up on screen quite often and they don't let you have the option to turn any of it off.\n\n8.5/10","December 12, 2014","true","337.8"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","26","28","0","1"

He goes into a coma after a huge car crash, and while he is dreaming, he gains a special power called "Shift" that gives him the ability to get into any driver's body at any time. In other words, he can switch to any car he sees around the city.\n\nYou may think that this is way too ridicolous. I thought so too, until I started playing this game. I'm an avid fan of the old Driver series, but even this one delivers, even though everything is different! The Shift surprisingly works well, it makes the action non-stop and less boring. The core of the storyline may be weird too, but it's well interpreted and well executed! Because of these, and because of how the entire atmosphere of the game is not the same as the old Driver games, I personally like to think this is a reboot of the series rather than the sequel of Driv3r.\n\nPROS+ Shift ability makes the game less boring and more strategical, bringing the racing genre to a whole new level.\n+ Surprisingly not repetitive, especially the story missions.\n+ Awesome driving physics with very smooth steering, even when using keyboard.\n+ Licensed cars, trucks, vans, from 70's muscles to modern supercars.\n+ Contains both licensed songs and original OST.\n+ Lots of challenges, activities, story missions, chases based on famous car chase movies and high-speed pursuits. Single-player alone lasts for many hours!\n+ Intriguing storyline with interesting characters and well-detailed cutscenes.\n+ Low price tag!\n+ Very original multiplayer...\n\nCONS- ...But not very active.\n- AI cop cars suffer from terrible rubberdanding: no matter which car you're using, they are always slightly faster than you, and awkwardly give up after a few minutes in a chase.\n- Lifeless city: all traffic cars going at the same speed, only-walking civilians, no particular/interesting scenery.\n- Yellow-ish graphics.\n- No different weathers and day/night cycle.\n- Stiff car physics with no interesting car crashes, except in rare cases.\n- Very limited and overhyped film director mode, could have been much better.\n- Inability to repeat a story mission of choice.\n- No manual transmission, and steering wheel compatibility could have been better.\n- Bad PC port: missing HDR and some lighting sources, missing minor features such as varied traffic after storyline, crashes and other general bugs... and guess what, the console versions have been patched a lot more with added features and many fixes... the PC version is left in the dark (that's Ubisoft for you).\n\nPersonal rating: 8/10\nWorth every penny if you can go past the issues - especially with this current low price tag.","September 4, 2014","true","46.6"," 39 of 53 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","39","53","0","0"

Crashes are kind of boring, but other than that, it's one of the few games personally that I can enjoy just driving around without doing anything else. Physics are more arcade than simulation, with an emphasis on stunts and drifts.\n\nVisually great, very pleasing aesthetic and a good representation of San Francisco.\n\nUplay is a minor annoyance, once you start the game you can forget it exists.\n\nStory works, it's charming but not great.

When I saw Driver SF on sale a few years ago, I picked it up on a whim to assuage my homesickness.\n\nDriver SF doesn't do a perfect job of recreating the Bay, you'll quickly pick up on the differences if you've ever spent a decent amount of time there, but it does nail the essential elements and creates a beautiful and exciting city to tool around in.\n\nIt's not intended for hardcore racing fans, the controls are fairly simple and arcadey, cars drift pretty frequently but they're also easy to control. It doesn't take a long time to master, but it also doesn't get in the way of the fun.\n\nIf you've heard anything about the game you've probably heard about the Shift mechanic. It allows you to temporarily possess almost any other driver on the road, and this mechanic alone would make a poor game worth purchasing. Fortunately, Driver SF was already a solid game before adding this to the mix, so it really rises above the pack. Shifting allows for some creative mission design, and very rarely will you feel bored with repetitive race/follow/chase missions that are so common in racing games. Even when you do have those missions, the shift mechanic allows you to approach them in a completely different manner. Shifting is fluid and fun, while I've heard some complaints about your car's AI while shifting, I never noticed too many problems. In fact, one time I shifted during a race and watched as my car somehow found a shortcut I hadn't noticed, passing the first place car and putting a sizeable lead between me and the rest of the pack. The satisfaction of shifting into a civilian car and plowing head-on into rival racers is also hard to match.\n\nThe story and the soundtrack were both impeccably managed. While the story takes place in modern SF, the entire game has the feel of a 1970s buddy cop movie. The soundtrack accentuates this, and I find myself listening to the sountrack on Spotify while playing other games because it was so well done. While most racing games don't put a whole lot of effort into story (I can't remember anything of the original Driver's plot), the Driver SF devs clearly put a lot of work into it, with great dialogue between the two protagonists and amazing cutscenes in the style of the aforementioned cop shows. I won't go into detail about the plot, but it was an absolute blast to experience.\n\nEven if you don't like racing games you can fall in love with Driver SF. There's so much character in it you can't help but like it.","December 30, 2014","true","64.3"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","20","22","0","0"

Driver: San Francisco is an extremely well made and outrageously enjoyable title well worth it's full price or lower. Every car model is licensed, from old family sedans to powerful muscle cars to zippy super cars, and everything in between. Driving a heavy vehichle like a bus or a transport truck feels fun and weighty, like your really pushing the car to its limits as you perform burnouts, jumps, and weave between oncoming traffic.\n\nThe story so far has been relatively camp, the usual villian breaks out of jail and you are the only one who can stop him, but takes interesting new directions in how it tells that story. One of my favorite parts is how all cutscenes use a fusion of CGI for charachters talking mixed with actual in engine gameplay (Which means you aren't looking at a cutscene that's been prettied up and doesn't look like what you'll see in game.)\n\nFor those worried about the Uplay integration, don't be. I was originally of the camp that hated the service, but so long as your system is able to run the game you shouldn't have too much issue with it. Would I rather it be removed entirely? Yes, but I'll give Ubisoft a pass with this, so long as the service isn't discontinued and the game breaks because of it.\n\nFor those who need a score, I'll give the game a 9/10.","June 28, 2014","true","18.9"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zerathos/recommended/33440/","zerathos","Locke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zerathos/","1102 products in account","Having grown up by San Francisco, the setting of this game is just right for me. The music goes a long way to setting the tone, as do the cutscenes, all of which embody 70's era cop movie. Being in San Francisco gives the game lots of opportunities to to exploit elevation with large hills and jumps, something you're incentivized to explore through the Dare system as well.\n\nDriving is fun, though not without some frustration. I'm a big fan of games that let you hold on the accelerator the whole way and control your course with careful steering and application of drift, but this game is anything but. It'll take a lot more planning than that to succeed, and quite often holding the gas at max will make you fishtail or wildly spin in circles. Not that these are bad things, mind you, but like I said, not how I prefer my racing games. Some cars are better at holding a straight line than others too. There's also the matter of traffic. There's a lot of it, and running into it will slow you down significantly. It does help make the world feel full, and sometimes you'll see active police chases going on around you as well, but other times it just feels in the way. While this game certainly isn't as realistic as a proper simulator (and more on that in a second), it is much less forgiving than your average arcadey racing game, so keep that in mind if realistic racers aren't your style.\n\nThe thing that sets this game apart is the ability system, most notably the Shift ability. Shift allows you to jump into (almost) any other car in the world and do with it as you will. Chasing down a criminal trying to get away from cops? Shift into a bus in the opposite lane and have them meet an unfortunate accident. You're also often not alone in the car; passengers will talk to you about their troubles or comment on your driving. I've only had a couple repeats so far and most of the lines are pretty funny. You can also boost or ram cars on a shared cooldown or shift instantly between any other car on your team. The game gives you a lot of options in tackling different missions, but cracks start to show up when it takes away these options. For Dares it doesn't matter so much, but full-fledged Challenges where they do things like take away all your abilities and ask you to take out a car quickly become frustrating.\n\nI'm normally not a fan of open world games and end up feeling lost and aimless, but some games, such as this one, do manage to get a hold of me. The building blocks of story missions and Challenges are the same, though story missions tend to be more involved and obviously will have cutscenes strung through them as well. Dares are simpler than either system and take place in free roam, having you accomplish a single task, often with some restriction such as having to do it in first person, do it without hitting other cars, do it in a certain amount of time, and so on. There are a pretty wide variety of missions to take on, but there are a few that are just really bad and show up time and time again. The one where you need to defend an armored van comes to mind, as does the one where you need to smash objects to add time to the countdown. The former Is just repetitive, the latter runs into problems with how cars handle. Too often you don't have the precise control you want and end up missing what should be an easy hit. Traffic is a big problem here too.\n\nThe one open world part of this that still feels too open to me is navigation. The game provides very limited options for navigation, requiring you to pause the game to memorize a full size map, multitask trying to read the expanded map that covers your screen while you drive, or trying to read the tiny minimap while you drive. What I'd really like is a Saint's Row: The Third-style GPS, but instead of picking a single endpoint and having the computer plot the route, draw the route you want to take. The road system is quite complex, so putting human intelligence to the task seems like the best option (and perhaps difficulty programming automatic routes may be a reason they weren't included).\n\nThe PC port is decent. It runs well enough, though it doesn't have much in the way of options. I do get hiccups sometimes and outright drops to single-digit FPS in the presence of fire. Some textures, such as the ground, will randomly flicker on and off sometimes. I do have to say though, I've never seen such nice looking tire smoke, and it doesn't even trash my wimpy little card like I'd expect.","June 30, 2014","true","21.7"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

Lots of garages, cars and upgrades to earn through side events.\n+ The 'shift' ability which lets you possess drivers of other cars is cool and makes the game feel unique\n\n- Atrocious AI rubberbanding in Race events.\n- Car handling and physics barely passable for the time it was released, today's gamers will expect more.\n- Feels dated visually, with fairly low quality textures and complete lack of post processing effects.\n- Non existent player base.  While online servers are still alive, don't expect to find people to race online against.\n\nDespite some potential dealbreakers listed above I am still admittedly rather enjoying the occational romp around San Fransisco on this game.  The story is written like an oldschool tv show and is generally enjoyable to play through, and its a great game to chill out with and do whatever events you feel like and increasing your car collection.\n\nThe main problem I have with Driver San Fransisco is the rubberband AI.  During events and even campaigns, the other drivers stay glued to you.  If you crash, the other cars will slow down to a crawl right around the next corner.  If you drive like a god, so will they.  I get that it is designed to make players of all skill levels feel challenged, but in practice when it is done as blatantly as here it removes all feeling of challenge entirely.  You can quite literally go take a leak at the start line of a race, then catch up with the others and win.\n\nOutside of that issue, which understandably will turn some away from the game, Driver San Fransisco is a pleasant game to relax with.","January 25","true","14.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpxmsk/recommended/33440/","dpxmsk","DeadPoolX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpxmsk/","1183 products in account","In Driver San Francisco, you play a cop who was injured in the line of duty, so the entire game (more or less) takes place in his head while he's in a coma.\n\nHis coma is what allows him to do seemingly impossible feats, such as transferring himself to any vehicle he sees and temporarily taking over the driver of that car. It's an interesting gimmick and for the most part it works.\n\nBeing able to drive around San Francisco, where all the streets and landmarks are recreated, is really nice. I've only been to SF once in my life (I believe it was sometime in the early-to-mid 90s) so it's not like I know the city well or grew up there. Even so, it's neat to see the TransAmerica Pyramid building in the background or drive down Lombard Street.\n\nSomething I really like is that real-world cars are used. I can understand why most developers don't do this, but I prefer seeing a Ford or a Nissan to whatever the developer creates as a thinly-veiled in-game analogue. Surprisingly enough, all of the cars can be seriously damaged (with visual markers as well, such as broken windshields and smashed fenders), which is something you don't often see automakers allowing in games.\n\nThere are a ton of mission types, so you don't need to stick with the main story, and plenty of vehicles and upgrades to purchase. All of this will likely keep you busy for some time unless you're attempting a speedrun (which really doesn't make much sense to me, but some people apparently enjoy it).\n\nThat said, there are some problems with the game.\n\nI use an Xbox360 wired controller and the controls are pretty damn bad. Steering is loose, but somehow overly sensitive at the same time. You'll find yourself skidding out a lot, often right into oncoming traffic.\n\nAdmittedly, different cars have different stats, so some handle better than others, but even so, the steering is woefully inadequate compared to games like Grand Theft Auto 5, Saints Row: The Third/Saints Row 4, or even Watch_Dogs.\n\nMy biggest gripe is the limitations placed on the city of San Francisco itself. Although you can slowly unlock new areas of the city by playing through the main storyline, you'll be limited by red barriers for most of the game. For most driving situations, this wouldn't be a big deal for me if it weren't also for the high-speed chases or escapes. It's jarring to run into a red glowing barrier (which, fortunately, doesn't damage your car but resets you in a nearby position).\n\nAlso, the "Dare" missions often require you to reach a certain speed for a predetermined amount of time and doing so is extremely frustrating when you're close but suddenly run out of street to drive on. At the very least, they could open up the entire city for missions and then require you to unlock the city later for free roaming purposes.\n\nIn case you're wondering, the game does come with music you can listen to while driving, but I didn't really care for it. Otherwise, the audio is fine, but not particularly noteworthy.\n\nWhile the graphics look good for a game made in 2011, don't let the screenshots on the store page fool you. This game was made to be compatible with DirectX 9 on WinXP, so you won't see many of the visual effects we've grown accustomed to with DirectX 11.\n\nAnd finally... be aware that UPlay is required to run D:SF. For me, that's slightly annoying, but some people can't get UPlay working (or at least working properly on a consistent basis), so take that into account when deciding to purchase this game.\n\nDo I recommend Driver: San Francisco? If it's on sale and you don't have problems with UPlay, then yes, I would. It's not the best game out there and some of the in-game mechanics are a little wonky (for lack of a better term), but overall it's decently fun and worth the money if purchased when discounted.","March 28","true","1.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

(At least for a filthy casual/arcade racing fan like myself)\nCar-Shifting is part of what makes this balance work. The easy to understand and master shift system adds a lot to the general flow and experience of the game and also allows for interesting twists on the classic racing game formula, Particularly with chases.\nThe 70's-buddy-cop-car-chase-movie/show vibe also helps keep the tone the right shade of whacky, while still being able to take itself seriously. Right down to the "Last time on Driver San Francisco" episode recaps everytime you load a save or begin a chapter. It's like something out of Burn Notice (If you're into that sort of thing). They even have special races based off of classic movie chases. Then you add in this nightmare-ish coma subplot and it all just makes the tone so great.\nCars handle well enough, but the variety can be jarring. It ranges from an impossible to control Zonda to a practically NFS arcade-y Murcielago. Partially as a result of this, Drifting in particular stays fun and rewarding, without being to difficult or easy since you still need to remember how each car handles.\nAlso the soundtrack. OOOOooohhh baby the soundtrack. You got Beck, Southside Movement, The Chi-lites. The Chi-Lites?! We Chi-Lites up in this 70's-style racing game! YES. 100% YES.\nWould be a solid 8/10.

Driver: San Francisco is game that lives or dies on a gimmick. But it squeezes all the excitement and entertainment out of that said gimmick. It's a game that prides itself on being fun over being gritty and realistic. Some of the later game missions and challenges do get frustrating. However it's playful enthusiasm and over the top action is so resolute in it's silliness that it's also nearly impossible to truly dislike. It's not the perfect driving game, but amid the cynicism and attempts to be serious video games seem to go through, It's refreshing to see a game let loose once in a while. Also teleporting into random people's cars and hearing their reactions as you cause some chaos never get's old.","May 5","true","40.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This really is an amazing game. There are so many cars to choose from, and not all of them are super cars, there is a WIDE variety and i mean WIDE. Seriously, you could be driving around and at an intersection you see an AMC Pacer sitting there next to a Pagini Zonda, and behind that Zonda is a Doge Charger Police Car next to a Ford Shelby GT500! Then there is the 1st person view with the beautifully detailed interiors (not many racing games have those these days!). Now we have the graphics, which for a 3 year old game (as of Jan,2014) is a whole lot better than "OK". The game developers really went all in detailing the city and all of the cars, which look beautiful by the way. Then, we have the game mechanics, there may be no guns or on foot action, but that's okay. That's because they replaced it with shift, a brilliant game mechanic allowing you to have an out of body expirence while also picking any car you wish, and it goes along with the storyline (which I'm not going to spoil) perfectly. Finally, we have the soundtrack. It is the best soundtrack put in any racing game Feturing a wide selection of funk, and soul, songs that you may have never heard of, untill you hear them in the game. Unfortanetly, the game is compleatly undersold, becuase of Driver: Parellel Lines and Dirv3r being such sucky games/ GTA clones. But since this game is nothing like Parellel Lines or Driv3r, I strongly recommend that you buy this game, even if you aren't a Driver fan, because I can assure you, once you play this game, you will.","January 31, 2014","true","255.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I had seen the "shift" mode and thought it was ridiculous. The last Driver game I had played was Driver 2, and you were able to get out of the car which I felt undermined the classic 70s car chase feel the original Driver had. This is where Driver: San Francisco surprised me. It brought that feel back in a modern setting, still allowing the player to switch vehicles without any "on foot" portions. It doesn't take itself too seriously either, and the shift mechanic is routinely used as a vehicle for some comedy. This becomes the most apparent near the beginning of the game where Tanner has to prove to his ability to his partner by taking control of a jerk driver and doing stunts in his vehicle. The story is average and I didn't pay much attention to it, to be honest. But the driving is solid, not too arcadey. All the vehicles have cockpit views as well, which was a plus for me. The game really plays to lovers of car chase movies, as there is are missions to unlock based on car chases in movies. Movies such as 'The Cannonball Run', 'Bullitt', 'Gone in 60 Seconds', and the movie that inspired the original Driver, 'The Driver'. Many of these missions will also try to recreate the traffic and police of the movie's era, which is a nice touch. Also, try taking the DeLorean to 88.\n\nWould highly recommend to anyone who is a fan of cars and car chases.\n\n9/10","September 29, 2014","true","9.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Not only are you able to change vehicles but you can do it in a great way, you exit the vehicle from the air, and in the air you can move around before choosing your next car. This makes things like crashes much more fun. For example, say you're driving down a hill at 60MPH, there's a wall right ahead, you teleport out and pick a car which is going across in the other direction and you can watch your car hit the wall, all before you play it back numerous times with the in-game video editor.\n\n- The map is well made and there’s plenty to explore, once you're driving about there's no more load times and you're free to just cruise around the map, running from the police or being to be the police.\n\n- There's an extensive range of cars to choose from, these range from vans to sports cars, all licensed and well detailed. This makes gameplay even more fun as you can see many of these cars driving around, making the game even more realistic.\n\nNegatives\n- Lack of steering wheel / joystick support. Although this isn't a necessarily bad thing for most, it is annoying that a steering wheel can't be used; however the 'WASD' keys still drive fine.\n\n- Multiplayer doesn't seem to work, my best guess is the servers are probably outdated. This is annoying as it does say that there's multiplayer support on the store page, but in honest the single player suffices.\n\n- You're forced to use Uplay. Yep, even though you've bought this game on Steam you have to go through the pointless phase of creating an account for Uplay and then adding friends before you can play the game, this is just an unnecessary step that has been added.\n\n{Overall: 7/10}\nTL;DR Good game and story, with a unique concept, but a poor PC port and Ubisoft's Uplay bring this game down to a 7.\n\nYes, I mark harshly, this is because you can't have a game which is rated a 10/10, another game is always going to be better and there is always going to be small errors with a game, I am sure no company will ever get a perfect game, that's what makes games fun.","July 3, 2015","true","8.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cold__/recommended/33440/","cold__","Rocket P.D.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cold__/","128 products in account","Driver San Francisco: The 70's "Buddy Cop" TV show that could've been.\n\nI saw this game on sale and thought "Oh, Driver! I remember what that game first came out on Playstation. My buddy and I used to play that game for hours!", so I bought and installed that night. After figuring out how to fix the issue with UPlay crashing on startup from Steam (you have to launch UPlay as an admin with "compatibility mode" once, then it will work with Steam), the game was pretty easy to hit the road driving.\n\nI played the game with a mouse & keyboard. Not as easy as an XBox controller as you have to mimic analog controls by tapping the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to gently maintain a drift (AKA "power slide"). The game wouldn't recognize me hitting the BOOST function unless I pressed the key ("control") twice. That sometimes lead to me barely losing a race.\n\nThe story is pretty interesting. You are a cop in San Francisco who cruises around with his partner in a 1970/71 Dodge Challenger (with a Shaker 400 6-pack!). You've just nabbed a notorious criminal who, you guessed it, escapes with car chases in tow. In an attempt to take him down you get into an accident with a truck and are sent to the hospital.\n\nThis is where things get kind of strange. You're no longer playing in the "real world". You're playing in the main character's MIND.\n\nIn the Mind World you have gained the ability to "shift" out of your body and into almost anyone else's body (who is driving a vehicle). One part of the game's heavily-relied upon mechanics is for you to "shift" into oncoming traffic and use those people's cars as missiles to take down your opponents. Basically, the protagonist has no regard for public safety and is willing to use ACTUAL PEOPLE as weapons to take down criminals.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, a crazy person is behind the wheel going beyond justice and civil procedure.\n\nThe side missions are great. DSF is a great game to fire up and get right into a fun race, etc. The Extras are good, too. I earned a challenge to perform the actual stunt chase sequence in BULLET! Super cool.\n\nI haven't finished the story because I lost interest. The game keeps teasing you with "will your character finally wake up?" while not really fleshing out many of the characters in the game. For instance, there are two brothers who are racing to pay for college tuition. They keep getting deeper and deeper in the criminal life as the protagonist keeps winning races for them. Each time I had to race for them, I got to learn a little more about their lives. There weren't as many side story lines as I wanted.\n\nAll-in-all this was a very good game. I feel like it hit just barely off the mark to becoming great. Besides being an XBox port, I felt like there were some QA issues that were over-looked. Such as, the time it takes to "zoom" from "shift" levels, or the collision detection. Some of the models looked like you could barely squeek by - NOPE.avi.\n\nFun times.\n\nStory: 7/10\nControls: 7/10\nGraphics: 9/10 (for its time and because they got a LOT of car nuances right)\nFun-factor: 9/10\nMusic: 9/10\nCars: Cars/Cars\n\n\n","August 2, 2015","true","12.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","2"

As a kid all I'd ever want to play on PS1 was DRIVER and DRIVER 2. We got PS2 few years after that and got DRIV3R. Love everyone of them to this day. DSF, here was a little different. But I don't blame Reflections; this is the first canon DRIVER in years. Sure there's the portabe ones, and Parrallel Lines. But those are uncanon. Prior to DSF, you'd play DRIV3R. I hope we see more from DRIVER, though there's not really anymore perps to catch. I'm not certain of this; it's what you'd call a well educated guess... but I believe The Crew was some kind of replacer for a sequel to DRIVER San Francisco. I just think because it's similar in gameplay, same kind of charactor position (Undercover), and both are Ubisoft games. Again, just a theory. Anyways, a lot of DRIVER fans will love this.

This allows for some very amazing play mechanics, and some frustration. For example, there's a disabled vehicle at location X. Bad guys are trying to destroy it by sending cars to kamikaze into it. Police won't get there in time. Your job is to "zoom up and out" to spot those cars, then back in and take over cars in the path of the bad guys and disable the bad guy's car(s) through ramming. You see this "red" car charging down the road. You take over this truck going the other way two blocks ahead of it, going head-on. Then before that other car can react, you swerve into its lane... kablam! Repeat on other streets at different distances (and they do react! You can miss!) A regular chase suddenly becomes a VERY different animal when you can "shift". Add other minigames, tribute missions, challenges, and so on and you have a very interesting driving experience, in an older San Francisco that is interesting though not very detailed (yet recognizable).

What can I say, it's a fun, drifty sort of driving game. It's driving controls are rather smooth, even on keyboard. The game gets rather difficult at a certain point, but once past that small spike, you're good to go. The progress is nice, and if you're like me, the starter cutscene at the start of the game that tells you what happened previously is quite helpful. This game is a fun game to play for fun, when you're bored. I rate this game a 7/10.

It seems the developpers got stuck viewing Fast & Furious too many times and that changed their view of the physical world: most of the cars (the ones you're stuck with at the beginning, unfortunately) will spin, shift and stray at the slightest touch on average speed. It could be great if you were not expected to race or take risks. And this is partly a racing game.\n\nIt is however a design choice (seeing how much smoke your tires produce, it's a wonder a rubber protection fund has not been created) and maybe this is your thing. But keep in mind that if you like tight controls in a racing game and a good straight learning curve, this game may offer you more frustration than fun.\n\nIn a few words: A slightly less enjoyable Burnout Paradise with a good story and a few twists.","July 8, 2014","true","46.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A lot of cool cars, a funny and engaging 80's style buddy cop story (complete with "Last Time On Driver: San Francisco..." every time you load a save), and lots of fun and interesting challenges that organically ramp up in difficulty!\n\nWell, I guess the fact that the cars sometimes feel like they're driving on ice, and there are some vehicles you can't even accelerate during a turn without immediately spinning out - eh but you can work around that.\n\nThe only other Racing game I own is Burnout: Paradise City, which encompasses everything I hate about racing games: no plot, no narrative, hell, not even a person inside the car just an empty driver seat, and there's just challenges dumped on the map with no rhyme or reason to them.\n\nDriver: SanFran is the opposite of that, it feels well put together and organic - and that's before you add in how you can astrally project out of your body and possess other cars in an instant.

The game is all about driving, just like the first game and that's exactly how it should be. You can no longer get out of your vehicle and run around on foot and considering that I did like that part of the game as well, this is a good thing though. Instead you can just zoom the camera out to a bird’s eye view of the city and select a new vehicle to shift into. The whole story behind this is ridiculous but at the same time entertaining.

Despite  previous releases of Driver games that seemed to confuse itself as a GTA clone, Driver San Fransisco plants itself firmly into where it was good. Without an ability to get out of the car and roam on foot (bringing back memories of the terrible Driver 2), you find yourself focusing on trying to find the best line around a crowded street with cops blaring behind you while you're doing your "modified" version of detective work.\n\nThe story in itself is a bit of a surprise, but I don't want to spoil it since it has absolutely worked. Suffice to say that the cliches you'd have expected aren't there or are at least obscured enough so you don't notice them right away.\n\nThe driving model is most definately arcade, but that comes at the benefit of tickling my nostalgia bone.

I got a decent numer of hours and finished it and I felt quite satisfied.  I personally am a big sucker for 60s 70s and 80s tv/movie culture and eing able to carry out thse famous chases was great.  The car selection is all rounded and solid, altough the game does lack BMW.  The story is a matter of personal choice. Again me not minding cheesyness and liking the setting I quite enjoyed the story and the subplots in the non Tanner missions. Graphics on the pc are decent, they dont have the highes textures (it is 2011) but the fx people added some nice touched (eg. tirespin smoke will actully change depending if your vehicle has 2 wheel front or back and 4 wheel drive).  The game world itself is varied and theres even some stuff if you like off road racing (props for including the group B audi quattro, Ford RS 200 and the Lancia Stratos). Finally, let´s be honest here, there arent that many proper driving games on pc and this one´s pretty good so passing it up especially for this low price really would be a shame.\n\nTL:DR:  its a good open world driver with some great throwback to old car tv shows and movies and general car culture","August 7, 2015","true","41.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I personally found it amazing. The story fits in amazingly well with the gameplay. This however means you pretty much have to watch the cutscenes to know what's going on, but that's no bad thing with this game. This is one of the few games that I've willingly watched the cutscenes, as they are interesting and of good quality.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is nice. Alongside the story are many events that you can do anytime, usually including something along the lines of a race, police pursuit or stunt. The story events include similar things, but also have events where you need to protect a vehicle or something along those lines.\n\nFreedrive is very diverse. There are many things to do, such as start a pursuit (as cop or getaway), try to make insane jumps or drive around trying to view the beautiful scenery.\n\nPursuits are fun. Being a Need For Speed fan, pursuit games are my favourite genre. Although a little easy to not get busted, the cop AI is quite clever and it is sometimes quite hard to get away, especially when driving a bus or flatbed-trailer truck :P\n\nThe main focus of the gameplay is "shift". John Tanner (whom you play as) is in a coma, and the game is pretty much set in his mind. This allows him to "shift", or teleport, into any body he may choose. This allows you to drive trucks, buses, tow trucks, cars, police vehicles and car transporters.\n\nAt the end though he starts trippin' balls and starts throwing cars around and stuff :P Iit gets a bit mental at that point :P\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics are quite nice, especially on the highest settings. Surprisingly, even poor graphics cards can run it with decent settings at 60 fps, which I think is great considering the standard of the graphics.\n\nWheel Support\nI have a G27 and I can honestly say it works great with this game. If you are considering buying a G27, I recommend it, it's perfect. Only problem is I have to remap the controls everytime I start the game...\n\nTL: DR\nThis is a fantastic game for such a price. I've so far gotten 14 hours out of this game, and that's going to increase by quite a bit :P Amazing graphics, gameplay and storyline. A good buy :)","July 24, 2015","true","31.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

(It's kinda like steam for UbiSoft games) Unfortunately, when Steam tries to download uPlay, it doesn't work, and the game can't even start up. With a little bit of research, I figured out that you must create a uPlay account and download the application yourself for the game to work. Once I had solved this problem, the game began to run normally... for atleast a little while. During the first cutscene, the game froze, so I had to restart the entire game over... twice. The third time I was able to skip the cutscene, only to find myself having the force stop the game again because it was stuck on the loading screen! On my fourth try, I was finally able to play the game. Once I was able to play, I thoroughly enjoyed the graphics and gameplay, and the freedom of the game. I did, however, have some problems trying to switch the controls. You start out using the arrow keys to accelerate, decelerate, etc, and I looked through the settings. It gives you the option to change the keys, but when you try to choose your desired key, it won't register! (I did plug in my driving wheel {that I purchased from a yard sale a couple months back, lol}, and it worked perfectly!) It was pretty fun for about 30 minutes until the game froze... again!\n\nThis game so far has some major issues, and unless  you have a steering wheel and a huge amount of patience, I would not reccomend this game for you.","June 16, 2015","false","1.7"," 16 of 33 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","16","33","0","1"

Certainly not with Steams black and white system that I will continue to ♥♥♥♥ and moan about to no end.\n\nI suppose I'll just reel off some pro's then. It has the usual Driver pros like licensed cars, car chases that hark back to those classic car movies I've never seen and it transitions between two distinct decades!... wait, that was the only really good Driver. I liked some of the missions and the way they present the game generally enough. The shift thing is a cool gimmick and such. The brilliant cutscenes from previous games kind of make a return. Except they don't really look any better and they're layered in with in game footage. Jumping between the two is really quite jarring. Also the voices don't seem to mesh well with the animation.\n\nWhen driving around all Quantum Leap style Tanner will talk to people in the cars and respond to what they say. Normally it's quite standard for passengers to just shout how terrible you are and the comments go ignored by the player. It's quite a nice touch and can be genuinely funny at times. Oh and there are collectibles, normally I hate them as they detract from the game but these ones are quite easy to find and unlock some pretty awesome challenges based on classic movies. Also if you do get it try driving up to 88mph in a DeLorean and see what happens.\n\nBy far the most enjoyable game mode is where you shift into other cars to take out your rivals in a race. It's so satisfying to get overtaken, jump into a semi and U-turn that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ right into your opponent and then smugly drive by windmilling your ♥♥♥♥ out the window to show that tosspot AI who's the mo'♥♥♥♥ing king of the road. Not that it always works out that way. A lot of the time you'll jump back into your car only to find your traffic jam has screwed your pooch too or worse yet, the AI that takes over from you has just mistaken the days events for a Sunday drive and has let the other racers, two funerals, a biker gang and a band of girl scouts on tricycles overtake you because he's just too ♥♥♥♥ing polite.\n\nI'ma go ahead and reel off the cons now. In fact lemme tell you about the mission that killed this game for me. An off-road race that I could've smashed through in the Dodge Viper but they saw fit to give me the supposed best off-road car in the game. The one that handles like ♥♥♥♥, has as much grip as a wet ♥♥♥♥♥ and accelerates like my mum going up a steep incline. After the first 6 times I failed I tried to quit but the unresponsive menus thwarted my efforts.\n\nUnresponsive menus are the absolute worst thing to have in a game that might frustrate you. When you're already ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to high hell the last thing you want is to fail exiting the game three times because the game can't keep up with your rage. That's how controllers get broken and how I ended up forking out for a new tv.\n\nOn top of that there is no way of looking at what songs are in the game nor does it have a menu to select which songs can play like any good open world game with a licensed soundtrack should have. The exception being GTA, that does radio stations more than efficiently and allows for your own muzak. It got to the point where I didn't know what seems to be the only song I was already familiar with before hand was even in the game until literally just after I finished it.\n\nSo basically it's okay if you're good at driving games and a fan of the series. I don't think this'll be the game to turn any newcomers onto the franchise. Especially when the other games have aged like they have.","April 28","false","6.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

Oh right: It must have been a kick of nostalgia. Playing the first "Driver" I liked the illusion of driving through San Francisco while doing some jobs along the way.\n\nThis game here is simply boring. The graphics are outdated, the gameplay is 'meh' and the story is uninspired and completey unrealistic. It's premise of a comatose patient's soul taking control of people is nothing but a justification for the gameplay decsions made:\n\nBeing without a body, you hop from car to car via a skycam to find new missions.\n\nTalking of gameplay: Being chased by the police I had to realize that they can't be shaken off. No matter what you do, cops are going to catch up with you in no time just to start ramming you like they wish to commit suicide. This is particularily annoying because there is no real damage model implemented: They can smash into you on full speed, repeatedly, until your heatlth bar is down. So driving a car in "Driver" feels exactly like moving a bumper car on a fair.\n\nThe best of this game is the soundtrack, which is very nice, but can't be played back outside of the game.

While it isn't too bad it is an issue to play the game at a lower framerate as it just isn't as fluid.\n\nThe next thing; while driving around I noticed that almost every car I used was fairly annoying to control. Adjusting the steering sensitivity did help a tiny bit but the issue is that coming out of corners, the cars would fishtail so heavily that it took a few moments to gain control and by that time you either lose your place or fall behind.\n\nFor fans of the series, I would say go for it, it is a lot of fun and a fairly original and well developed story line.\n\n","December 28, 2014","false","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The Graphics are okay, but there are loads of better games that offer pretty much the same thing and are way more enjoyable/rewarding. Maybe I didn't spend enough time getting to know it?

Every car seems to spin out of control with some doing more than others and the controls were very obviously designed for a controller. But I got used to it and it's quite enjoyable. It's the first racing game I've actually liked probably because of the story. It's weird but fun.\n\nMy one complaint is that it's hard to get around. Most of the time you'll want to do that thing where you can see large areas at once but you can't move very fast or see very far. You'd think there would be an option to press another button and zoom out to the whole map. Maybe there is I just didn't find it yet. And there's a world map burried in he menus. I just unlocked a new region but it seems meaningless as I have no idea how much of the map I've actually explored.\n\nThere are two types of missions. The blue optional missions and the yellow missions. Don't do the blue ones, they're too hard.\n\nAll in all it's a fun game but it doesn't have that 'I need to find out what happens' feeling many other games have.","August 28, 2015","true","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While it isn't too bad it is an issue to play the game at a lower framerate as it just isn't as fluid.\n\nThe next thing; while driving around I noticed that almost every car I used was fairly annoying to control. Adjusting the steering sensitivity did help a tiny bit but the issue is that coming out of corners, the cars would fishtail so heavily that it took a few moments to gain control and by that time you either lose your place or fall behind.\n\nFor fans of the series, I would say go for it, it is a lot of fun and a fairly original and well developed story line.\n\n","December 28, 2014","false","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's finally all about driving again, just like the first one.\nThe game features over 100 cars (licensed cars) which get damaged. The handling is really excellent (with an Xbox Controller anyway) and the driving is fun.\nAlso featured is a  function called "Shift" (minor spoiler which happens at the beginning of the game: Tanner is in a coma). With Shift, Tanner imagines he can take control of any car in the city. Shift allows for fast car changing and gives you the ability to block the way for the person you're chasing. Throughout the game, as you progress, Shift gets stronger so that you can zoom out even fruther to get across town even faster.\nThe multiplayer is great fun as well, it also has Shift, but it needs to be charge/needs to recharge after picking a different vehicle. The gamemodes vary from a race, to felony and others. In multiplayer you also level up and unlock new "weapons" like Car spawn, Impulse and Swap. When you start playing you have only 1 gamemode unlocked, called "Free for All", which is 2 different eventtypes; Trailblazer (follow the A.I. car as closely as possible to score) and "Tag" (basically hold the flag).\n\nAll in all, Driver is great fun, features overall good car handling, a great multiplayer and great humor during the singleplayer.","June 9, 2013","true","93.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

I had really high hopes for this game, because the idea in general sounded quite fun and refreshing. But now that I've played it I can't shake the feeling this could've been better.\nFirst of all, the story is ok, let's get that out of the way. It's a bit far fetched maybe, but ok nonetheless.\nThe graphics get the job done as well, but this is one of the things that disappointed me. The models for the cars are solid, but there's just so little detail in them. I like my cars very detailed, like in GT5 or Forza. Of course I can't expect the same quality for an arcade racer, but it would've been nice to give the most important cars some extra detail. Same goes for the city.\nThe VOs are pretty good, and the music is alright if you're into that kind of stuff. It wasn't really my taste.\nAnd the gameplay itself is solid; the shifting technique is actually pretty cool and adds a bit of strategy to the game.\nStill, it's not full-price-worthy.\n\n[Rating: 82/100]","October 7, 2011","true","10.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/acetherandom1/recommended/33440/","acetherandom1","Lt. Ace Briggs™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/acetherandom1/","59 products in account","Although the storyline is solid, and the car models are beautiful, inside and out, the game's physics are atrocious. With only WASD controls, just about every car handles as though it is on ice. Using a race wheel may help, but for those who don't own one, your 2 options of tire-spinning full throttle or locked-up brakes make gameplay quite difficult at the best of times.\n\nAlong with the horrid keyboard driving controls, the NPC drivers tend make gameplay even less enjoyable. If civilian cars aren't gluing their rear bumpers to your front when you rear end someone at high speed, swerving with you until you stop, back up, and then swerve around them, the unreliable, inconsistent police AI will drive you mad. In some cases they can be easily outrun on a long, flat stretch, other times they keep up with you at speeds approaching 170 mph (I've clocked them) in vehicles seemingly as strong as tanks that handle like they are glued to the tarmac, while in standard, NPC-started car chases they barely crack 80 and drive like they're going on a Sunday cruise. Adding to the police chases is the cops' tendancy to spawn just ahead of you 2 seconds before you escape, making for incredibly aggrivating runs through San Francisco.\n\nLast but not least is Ubisoft's game launcher. During the quite frequent spells when the launcher will not sync up with the Ubisoft network, the multiplayer game mode is deactivated. Out of my close to 100 hours* in the game, about 70 of those hours were done in 'offline-mode', a shame, as the few times I was able to play multiplayer with friends, even with the terrible controls, much fun was still had.\n\nAll in all, the graphics are incredible, the story line well thought out, and the variety of vehicles available is quite impressive, but the poor driving physics and terrible AI really drag the game down, along with Ubisoft's unreliable game launcher. I honestly wonder how the game was rated so high by professional critics.\n\n*Contrary to what my Steam game hours may show, I have actually devoted closer to 100 hours to the game, beating the Campaign mode, and nearly completing all extra challenges. The Ubisoft game launcher system doesn't function too well with Steam when it comes to Steam acknowledging Driver: San Francisco has actually started, and in order to get Steam to recognize I am playing the game, I need to tab back over to Steam once the game has started and press the play button once again, which then 'officially' shows me as playing the game. After a while I got sick of bothering, and just played in 'non-Steam' mode, hence the low Steam hours.","July 21, 2014","false","16.3"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spincube/recommended/33440/","spincube","spincube","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spincube/","310 products in account","You know what's fun in driving games? Putting you, the player, in a gigantic, slow, heavy machine that handles like a skip full of potatoes with a lawnmower engine. And you have to escape suicidal police cars by weaving through traffic. And it's apparently manufactured using damp toilet paper.\n\nYou know what's also fun? Mandatory race missions, where you're given a supercar that feels more like an ice cream van. And your opponents are also suicidal, and have those magical rubber-band engines installed.\n\nThe overarching story's enjoyable, in a borrowed Life on Mars? kind of way, and bonus points for having a protagonist character pulled straight from a buddy-cop film; no standard angry, eye-rolling cynicism here. The way the game presents recaps of the plot at every chapter's nice, too - the 'events so far' cutscenes and the traditional blackboard replete with names, photographs and arrows again borrow heavily from TV police procedural shows.\n\nI just didn't like how little things seemed to spoil the experience: there's no GPS guidance besides 'get to X point on the map within Y time', and expanding the mini-map covers up the road in front of you. So you can either risk running into traffic, or jump into the Pause menu to look at the city map at every checkpoint. Not sure if it's a deliberate stylistic choice or not, but an option would have been nice. One other thing - played with a controller, your 'boost' is activated when you push the stick forwards, so it's really, really easy to accidentally trigger when weaving through traffic.\n\nThere's also lots and lots of side-content in the form of stunt missions, and 'dare missions' - but they're all along the lines of 'drive for X seconds at Y MPH in oncoming traffic', or 'perform a drift for Z metres'; so there's always something to do, but  not an awful lot of variety. Same goes for the soundtrack: I couldn't name (or even hum) one of the songs that plays in free-roam or in a mission.\n\n...the game also uses uPlay, which is an abomination. Not the game's fault, really, but there you go. Boo, Ubisoft.\n\nIf you enjoy goofy buddy-cop films and enjoy arcadey Burnout-like gameplay, but can also look past minor, awkward gameplay complaints, go ahead. The little things annoyed me enough to not recommend, though - and if you're looking for a GTA-like experience, don't bother.","May 31, 2014","false","7.9"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","1"

UBisoft thought it would be funny to say in every message I sent them, just re-install my Windows OS and turn of any A/V software I'm using []o_O]\n\nI've partly figured out over time, that running my system above 1920x1080/60Hz and 48Khz/16bit will stop the game from working. I guess it doesn't help having 2x 2560x1600/60Hz, 1x 1920x1080 and 192Khz/24bit []¬_¬]\n\nHowever, lowing the settings to old school audio and video gets me to the intro logos, where it crashes before I get to anythign at all.\n\nThis is about the only game I've come across out of over 200+ games that don't work for me on Windows 8 which to be fare, isn't a big loss, just a waste of money now, as I didn't even get to play it for more than an hour when I was using Windows 7 at the time {}¬_¬}\n\nI hope UBi's statement a few weeks ago will actually be true this time, with them taking Windows OS gaming a lot more serious.

First of all, only Xbox 360 controller will work (and keyboard controls are simply horrible in this game). Second, if you have an AMD graphics card you will get a lock of 24Hz in full screen so you have to use Fake Fullscreen software to combat this. Third, the in-game graphics are the most pathetic I've seen even on max. Fourth, the driving mechanics are amongst the most ancient and lifeless I've ever come across. Fifth, various problems with starting the game. Sixth, it doesn't do what a driving game should. Eight, too many cutscenes for a racing game. Need I go on? The only thing I can possibly give credit to is the facial detail in cutscenes and that it's actually trying to do a 'Starsky and Hutch' style story, something you don't see in newer racing games. But seriously, if you want a decent game like this either play Starsky and Hutch or Midtown Madness 2 SE. At least with Midtown Madness 2, you know the game has been made by professionals (Rockstar San Diego, published by Microsoft). Driver San Fransisco not only has horrible controls, laughable graphics and driving physics, but also poorly optimised for PC. Unless you have zero experience with racing games you can't possibly think these driving mechanics are acceptable. Sure, you get interior view but what's the use if you can't have manual transmission and the animations and graphics are shockingly bad?","November 26, 2013","false","0.9"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

On tto the current saga and i must say i love this game. Having played a demo i wasnt overlly impressed with the handelling but it seems this has been addressed with the game playing very well with enough challenge to entertain the die hard of drivers in a fun arcadey style. The storyline whilst insane think quantum leap is done very well with rich cgi animation. One particular highlight is the ability to leap from one body to another and jump into the world of another character. The stories of individuals and their reactions as you drive madly is very entertaining.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CreepyLilNAME/recommended/33440/","CreepyLilNAME","Creepy Lil' Llama","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CreepyLilNAME/","34 products in account","Yes, it's a good game. It's extremely fun messing about, just maxing cars on the streets of San Francisco, weaving through traffic, drifting around town, taking huge jumps or just rallying about the off-road section in your Pagani or Audi. The story isn't bad, either. I am more of a casual gamer, I personally rather faffing about, instead of doing things I'm meant to do, and this game allows me to do just that. So here are my scores for this game:\n\nEngine Sounds: 6/10. Why? Well, some of the noises are recycled, and you just don't get a v12 bellow from your Lambo or Pagani, but get a more hallow noise, that you heard a million times before.  Also, the American cars, like Mustangs and Corvettes, seem to have a more realistic noise. In the ZR1, for instance you can hear a supercharger, and also in the GT500. The Nissans also seem to have higher quality sound.\n\nGraphics: 7/10. Why? For a car game, from Ubisoft, from 2011, the graphics are NOT Battlefield 3 level, yet not Modern Warfare 3, either. (Forgive my FPS referances)\n\nPhysics: 6/10. Well, you seem to get a ton a scrapes from a little crash in some cars. Also, the camera bugs out if you do doughnuts. It keeps reseting it self to behind the car, even if you moved it a tiny bit, if you are "nutting" for a long time.\n\nAI: 5/10. Why? Well, the cops sometimes ram into you for no reason, ESPECIALLY the big Caddilacs, even when you are also in a cop car. Sometimes the normal people go crazy, drive on the wrong side, smash into others, drive on the footpath, that kinda thing. They also drive 30mph in a 70mph zone, which is a bit weird. The AI seems to be rushed, and is one of the two factors that let this game down, the other being Engine Sounds. I don't know if this should be put in AI or Physics, so I'm putting it here: Police chases just happen around you every 5 minutes which can be annoying. It's like the game is trying to FORCE you into doing things. "CHASE THIS CRAPPY LITTLE CAR IN YOUR 669 BHP PAGANI, OR THE POLICE OFFICERS WILL JUST BOTHER YOU AND SMASH INTO YOU AND RUIN YOUR FUN. HAHA, I'M SUCH A GOOD GAME"-yeah, no. I don't like that kind of thing.\n\nDo I reccommend this game?

The story is really dull and it never really gets to a point where you feel the need to see how it goes further not to mention its extremely short.\n\nNow its nice they have licensed cars but it does not seem to add any value.

Every game that I reach that number gets reviewed. This is no exception. I have spent nearly 100 hours into this. The only game I have played more than this is the original Deus Ex.\n\nDriver: San Fransisco is an excellent game. You play as the detective John Tanner. You are watching a police convoy transporting the criminal Charles Jericho, when he escapes. You chase him down, only to be sideswiped by a semi. You wake up in your car, completely fine. After a few minutes of cutscenes and a few driving sections, you learn you have the ability to "Shift" from one car to the next. What is Shifting? Shifting is when you assume control over the driver of the vehicle you have selected. You continue to hunt down Jericho, unlocking more powers along the way.\n\nPROS:\n-Detailed traffic system\n-Decent graphics\n-For hardbody physics, the damage is better than average\n-In game physics are detailed, but a bit arcadey\n-Many challenges to test your skills\n-Multiplayer gamemodes\n-Large variety of cars to choose from\n-Only driving game I have played that has a decent storyline\n\nCONS:\n- EXTREMELY  odd storyline (but it describes your "Shift" ability)\n-The multiplayer community is nearly dead\n\n\nConclusion: 89%, Definitely worth looking into, if you are into this style of game.","April 20, 2014","true","95.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That is, you can jump from one car to another, taking control of it on a whim.\n\nDriver: SF takes this concept and runs with it. For example, if you are chasing a bad guy down, you can shift out of your police car, take control of a car in oncoming traffic, and drive head-on into the bad guy, and probably stall him! On the flipside, if you are running from the cops, you can take control of other cars to block or smash into cop cars! This concept is as awesome as it sounds, and gives a sense of strategy to your driving.\n\nAs for the driving itself, it's arcadey. Not too slippery, not too stiff. However, the handling is super-tight for large vehicles like firetrucks and bigrigs, but that's to be expected. You get to drive muscle cars like the Ford Challenger though, so it balances out.\n\nDriver: SF is a worthwhile buy if you like racing games!

I was pleasantly surprised.  It's not spectacular or anything, but it's fun.  The "Shift" mechanic might seem like a cheap ploy to allow players to drive different vehicles while avoiding on-foot sections, but it's well-implemented and the many cars are detailed inside and out and fun to drive.  (One of my favorite things to do was just Shift around looking at vehicle interiors in first-person mode.)  Certain mission types can be repetitive, the city has a sterile feel compared to certain other virtual worlds, and I felt like more could have been done story-wise tying your actions into the end-game plot, but all-in-all it's a great find from the bargain-bin.","December 27, 2012","true","22.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It brings back the feeling of the first Driver I played on PS1 a long time ago. The game is full of contents :\n\n1. A hughe San Fransisco is waiting to be explored step by step as progressing in the storyline opens up different parts of the city. Lots of landmarks around, living and breating traffic (even pedestrians who are very good at dodging cars :)) and much more to see.\n\n2. There are endless fun in the missions. The main storyline in chapters, and impressive amount of side missions we can take. I've never seen this extra wide variety of fun related to driving in any games yet. Actually it took a time for me to figure out what and how - at first look it's simply overwhelming. And this game is not easy at all. You may find yourself repeating challenges  until dawn because you fail one try after the other. (Fortunately your career progresses wile you are driving anyway so it's not a waste of time "loosing" but serious fun.)\n\n3. The main storyline is absolutely out of the mainstream examples, so as the way we can interact with all the cars in the city.\n\n4. Countless cars we can drive. All of them are nicely modelled inside out. Hard to stick to a favourite when a Grand Torino is in my garage but that Charger comes up too. Lots of modern European cars, American classics, it's possible to jump even in a bus or truck if you feel. The cars can be damaged until they are useless wreck. Hard to avoid sometimes...\n\n5. It's just brilliant.\n\n6. The graphics are excellent, sounds and music wonderful and atmospheric - it all feels like being in the '70-80s. A must have for retro lovers.\n\n7. This is an arcade game for sure but I am always cautious using these terms. It's also a simulator if you take a look at how to drift using the handbrake and how loong you need that handbrake pulled, when to press the pedal again to accelerate out of a corner, etc.\n\n8. The multiplayer is also really nice, many great ideas implemented in driving context. All challenging and fast paced. Actually I would love to see "simple" and "conventional" ways of multiplaying sometimes :)\n\nOne (manageable) downside is a strange surprise: the game supports only a few steering wheels. Mine is a Logitech Formula Force FX and I had to make a small detour to make it accepted by the game. (There's a good vid on YT how to make the game accept some controllers.)\nSo overall I'm a happy guy because I have found this title here on Steam. Highly recommended.","September 6, 2014","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can switch cars at any moment with the "Shift" mechanic in the game which basically allows you to spirtually take over another person in another car. This may sound stupid to some of you but let me assure you...the mechanic works well and without cheapening the game at all and plays well into the storyline even.\n\nOh but there is so much more, from side quests to different challenges and racking up enough will power and money to buy new cars and upgrades for them...you will never be bored.\n\n\nThe negatives:\nThere isn't many negatives but a couple qualms i have with the game is no "night and day" cycle or any weather change.

After the fairly solid first and second game, the abysmal third one and the mediocre at best follow-up, I can confidently say: this is an absolutely great Driver game! Two things you need to know: 1) The driving may feel a bit unusual at first, but it's easy to accustom oneself with it. 2) The story may seem a bit outlandish, but as long as you can accept a slight amount of supernatural story-telling, you won't have much of a problem. Aside from the well designed story missions, there are plenty of side-missions and activities to complete (for example taking down criminals and performing stunts and racing). Definitely recommended.","January 10, 2013","true","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"Driver: San Fransisco" isn't a racing game (it does include a heavy bit of racing thou). It's a car game, think GTA-style without walking and shooting. Maybe that's why I, surprisingly enough, did enjoy it. If by enjoying you mean screaming your lungs out at the computer when you drive 120 mph head-on into an oncoming car while duing pursuit (and yes, I do!). Forget the story, it's completely ludicrous and meaningless, just go with the major adrenaline-boost you'll get. The variety of missions and sidemissions are nice, a bit repetitive after a while thou but the "shifting" is a very cool and innovative alternative to generic boosting of cars and makes for some new tactical choices, not to mention fun moments. Cool game, give it a try if you like high-speed action and you aren't bothered by a story that isn't even campy, it's just plain silly.","September 20, 2012","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've never been much of a fan of driving games. I've tried a lot of them: Burnout, Need for Speed, Forza, Gran Turismo, even the previous Driver games left me lukewarm on the genre. I mean there's only so much one could do with using a car to get to another end of a race. At least, so was thought until this came around.\n\nUsing the novel car-swapping mechanic, you can jump in and out of different cars in open world San Francisco as you take on the devious Jericho. The car-swap allows for some great times; you could eliminate your fellow racers with headlong collisons or crash in a spectacular chase and in a couple button presses, be on your way as normal. That's the best thing about this game; the flow. It flows perfectly from car chases to street races to mission stages (:P).\n\nI have a couple minor gripes: the cars seem to spin out pretty easily and the missions sometimes feel a bit unforgiving when I just barely fail them. But even then, they never at any point stopped me from enjoying the game. I recommend this one wholeheartedly and hope that you pick it up!\n\nP.S.

Loads of variety of missions from scaring driving instructors to evading the police. One interesting addition to the game as many have said already is the ability to take over control of any vehicle on the road (be it school bus or a Ford GT) via the 'coma system' as I call it. Shouldn't work so well on paper when you read it but believe it does. It also adds opportunities to sabotage opposition with other cars on the road (say during a police chase, you could put a big ♥♥♥ lorry to block the road behind your chased car) as well as a smart opportunity for random driver character narrative (police banter or say a freaked out passenger spouse) which gives the world a life / realism of it's own.\n\nYou also have upgrades, loads of vehicles to purchase and many missions scattered across the high sloped roads of San Fran.\n\nThe only negative I could say so far is it doesn't 100% match the moments / focus of the adrenaline / depth of the chase as was the case in the original Driver game where that and it's Director mode were the centre piece, but it's pretty close mostly!\n\nGood times!","February 28, 2014","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

After the fairly solid first and second game, the abysmal third one and the mediocre at best follow-up, I can confidently say: this is an absolutely great Driver game! Two things you need to know: 1) The driving may feel a bit unusual at first, but it's easy to accustom oneself with it. 2) The story may seem a bit outlandish, but as long as you can accept a slight amount of supernatural story-telling, you won't have much of a problem. Aside from the well designed story missions, there are plenty of side-missions and activities to complete (for example taking down criminals and performing stunts and racing).

"Driver: San Fransisco" isn't a racing game (it does include a heavy bit of racing thou). It's a car game, think GTA-style without walking and shooting. Maybe that's why I, surprisingly enough, did enjoy it. If by enjoying you mean screaming your lungs out at the computer when you drive 120 mph head-on into an oncoming car while duing pursuit (and yes, I do!). Forget the story, it's completely ludicrous and meaningless, just go with the major adrenaline-boost you'll get. The variety of missions and sidemissions are nice, a bit repetitive after a while thou but the "shifting" is a very cool and innovative alternative to generic boosting of cars and makes for some new tactical choices, not to mention fun moments.

I was pleasantly surprised.  It's not spectacular or anything, but it's fun.  The "Shift" mechanic might seem like a cheap ploy to allow players to drive different vehicles while avoiding on-foot sections, but it's well-implemented and the many cars are detailed inside and out and fun to drive.  (One of my favorite things to do was just Shift around looking at vehicle interiors in first-person mode.)  Certain mission types can be repetitive, the city has a sterile feel compared to certain other virtual worlds, and I felt like more could have been done story-wise tying your actions into the end-game plot, but all-in-all it's a great find from the bargain-bin.","December 27, 2012","true","22.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is the latest full AAA title in the Driver franchise, number five I believe, the encounter in question is an unlockable challenge which pays homage to the opening level of the original game from 1999 on the first Playstation.\nDriver for me holds a spot close to my heart as it was the first AAA title I ever owned on my first console the resized PSone. Anyway onto this new version.\nYou once again step into the shoes of John Tanner, ex racing driver come hard driving cop. San Francisco has taken a step back to the roots of the game series and has gone back to focusing on the driving. You will not be running around or shooting in this game, which is a relief as Driver is all about tearing through back alleys sending tables flying chased by the police in the style of classic car chases in movies.\n\nAnd this is a good move for the series. Despite the not running about you still have the option to switch the car you are in through the mechanic of “shift” into one of about 90 licenced vehicles all of which have a damage meter which will force you to jump out and try new approaches.\n\nThe driving mechanics in this game is pretty solid, the game is an obvious console port, through the lack of graphics tweaking options and the depth of field is shallower than one might expect. I did not see many car pop ins but definitely saw some buildings pop in. The driving as per the rest of the series is very arcade inspired. Drifting, power slides and high speed corners are not a problem in this game, whether in a bus or a zonda.\n\nI tried playing this game with a  keyboard and with a 360 pad and neither seems to be a definitive winner for a driving platform in this game, so down feel put off if you don’t own a game pad.\n\nThe story isn’t bad, but it’s not going to win any awards for narrative. The voice acting is good, with a lot of comedy from the leading roles as well as the interactions between Tanner and the passengers of cars that you shift into.\nSo if you are after an arcade driving game with an open world environment or you’re after a nostalgia trip to a game with its roots back in the nineties then you could do worse than Driver: San Francisco.\n","December 22, 2013","true","21.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However I was blown away by just how much fun it realy is. Picture Midtown Madness meets Burnout in crash mode. The gimick here is that you can switch cars in the middle of a race or a chase or what have you. The reason it took so much crap is it plays out like a bad buddy cop movie but it has fun with it. Claims you can telepathicly control other drivers as your super power.

Races are frustrating with difficult turns that expect too much from the average player and rubberbanding that is very hard to beat.

This opens up additional game play such as controlling other cars to ram your opponents off the road in a race or having to defend an armored car against lots of attackers by well .. ramming them off the road.  In addition, the ability to shift means that you don't have to stuff around driving around the city to get to the next mission or dare which significantly speeds up the overall game (less boring stuff!).  Some of the challenges and dares are quite hard but the vast majority of them are 3-4 minutes in length which means it isn't too bad to have to do them again.\n\nThe story is kinda cheesy - intentionally - but doesn't really negatively impact the overall game.\n\nThe main negative that I had was that I found it quite hard to control the vehicles.  I did find it took time and obtaining new higher end vehicles before it became easier to drive.\n\nOverall, the game is a lot of fun and I enjoyed it intensely.\n\nNote:  I only played single player\n","April 21, 2014","true","387.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's extremely fun messing about, just maxing cars on the streets of San Francisco, weaving through traffic, drifting around town, taking huge jumps or just rallying about the off-road section in your Pagani or Audi. The story isn't bad, either. I am more of a casual gamer, I personally rather faffing about, instead of doing things I'm meant to do, and this game allows me to do just that. So here are my scores for this game:\n\nEngine Sounds: 6/10. Why? Well, some of the noises are recycled, and you just don't get a v12 bellow from your Lambo or Pagani, but get a more hallow noise, that you heard a million times before.  Also, the American cars, like Mustangs and Corvettes, seem to have a more realistic noise. In the ZR1, for instance you can hear a supercharger, and also in the GT500. The Nissans also seem to have higher quality sound.\n\nGraphics: 7/10. Why? For a car game, from Ubisoft, from 2011, the graphics are NOT Battlefield 3 level, yet not Modern Warfare 3, either. (Forgive my FPS referances)\n\nPhysics: 6/10. Well, you seem to get a ton a scrapes from a little crash in some cars. Also, the camera bugs out if you do doughnuts. It keeps reseting it self to behind the car, even if you moved it a tiny bit, if you are "nutting" for a long time.\n\nAI: 5/10. Why? Well, the cops sometimes ram into you for no reason, ESPECIALLY the big Caddilacs, even when you are also in a cop car. Sometimes the normal people go crazy, drive on the wrong side, smash into others, drive on the footpath, that kinda thing. They also drive 30mph in a 70mph zone, which is a bit weird. The AI seems to be rushed, and is one of the two factors that let this game down, the other being Engine Sounds. I don't know if this should be put in AI or Physics, so I'm putting it here: Police chases just happen around you every 5 minutes which can be annoying. It's like the game is trying to FORCE you into doing things. "CHASE THIS CRAPPY LITTLE CAR IN YOUR 669 BHP PAGANI, OR THE POLICE OFFICERS WILL JUST BOTHER YOU AND SMASH INTO YOU AND RUIN YOUR FUN. HAHA, I'M SUCH A GOOD GAME"-yeah, no. I don't like that kind of thing.\n\nDo I reccommend this game? Well, this game is not brilliant, but it is fun for messing about, if you can handle the annoying cops. The AI may be bad, but that's nit-picking. Well, picking GIANT nits because AI is a big part of the gam- you know what I mean","April 23, 2014","true","36.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Loads of variety of missions from scaring driving instructors to evading the police. One interesting addition to the game as many have said already is the ability to take over control of any vehicle on the road (be it school bus or a Ford GT) via the 'coma system' as I call it. Shouldn't work so well on paper when you read it but believe it does. It also adds opportunities to sabotage opposition with other cars on the road (say during a police chase, you could put a big ♥♥♥ lorry to block the road behind your chased car) as well as a smart opportunity for random driver character narrative (police banter or say a freaked out passenger spouse) which gives the world a life / realism of it's own.\n\nYou also have upgrades, loads of vehicles to purchase and many missions scattered across the high sloped roads of San Fran.\n\nThe only negative I could say so far is it doesn't 100% match the moments / focus of the adrenaline / depth of the chase as was the case in the original Driver game where that and it's Director mode were the centre piece, but it's pretty close mostly!\n\nGood times!","February 28, 2014","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

After the fairly solid first and second game, the abysmal third one and the mediocre at best follow-up, I can confidently say: this is an absolutely great Driver game! Two things you need to know: 1) The driving may feel a bit unusual at first, but it's easy to accustom oneself with it. 2) The story may seem a bit outlandish, but as long as you can accept a slight amount of supernatural story-telling, you won't have much of a problem. Aside from the well designed story missions, there are plenty of side-missions and activities to complete (for example taking down criminals and performing stunts and racing).

"Driver: San Fransisco" isn't a racing game (it does include a heavy bit of racing thou). It's a car game, think GTA-style without walking and shooting. Maybe that's why I, surprisingly enough, did enjoy it. If by enjoying you mean screaming your lungs out at the computer when you drive 120 mph head-on into an oncoming car while duing pursuit (and yes, I do!). Forget the story, it's completely ludicrous and meaningless, just go with the major adrenaline-boost you'll get. The variety of missions and sidemissions are nice, a bit repetitive after a while thou but the "shifting" is a very cool and innovative alternative to generic boosting of cars and makes for some new tactical choices, not to mention fun moments.

The last time I had a moment where I said to myself, "Wow, i can't believe I'm actually doing this in a game", I'd have to go all the way back to Portal.  Remember the Agents in the Matrix and how they could take over any person they wanted?  Now imagine you doing that in a racing game.  That's what Driver: San Francisco is all about.  You soar above the traffic of the city jumping in and out of cars at will.  There are way too many way to have fun with this.  Still in 2nd?  Hop into a car in the oncoming lane and hit the leader head-first.  Spot a shiny new Lamborghini?  Take it without hesitation.  Someone you're chasing manage to shake you?  Jump into the car in front of them and slam the brakes.\n\nThe racing aspect of the game is average, it's the same kind of high octane thrill you can get from Need For Speed: Undergroung 2.  Also just like Underground 2, the music selection is annoyingly limited.  But these are just minor complaints, the action packed gameplay is what makes the game so addictive.

I was pleasantly surprised.  It's not spectacular or anything, but it's fun.  The "Shift" mechanic might seem like a cheap ploy to allow players to drive different vehicles while avoiding on-foot sections, but it's well-implemented and the many cars are detailed inside and out and fun to drive.  (One of my favorite things to do was just Shift around looking at vehicle interiors in first-person mode.)  Certain mission types can be repetitive, the city has a sterile feel compared to certain other virtual worlds, and I felt like more could have been done story-wise tying your actions into the end-game plot, but all-in-all it's a great find from the bargain-bin.","December 27, 2012","true","22.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Drive: San Fran is a great driving game and keeps me entertained like Burnout Paradise or Midnight Club 3 does and I'm glad I can experience what this game has to offer - both in the singleplayer and multiplayer.\n\nIf you have played the demo and did not like the driving, you probably aren't good at driving games or don't like the style of driving.

Luckily for me, the game takes an interesting spin on the average driving game by allowing you to possess the driver of any car and use it to your advantage. Mission variations get repetitive, but almost alwasy there's a twist thrown in to make it interesting. The most surprising thing for me in the game was the great writing (aside from the obnoxiously see-through main story). Whenever you pop in someone's car, there's a chance there's a passenger or two with you.

Remember when the first Driver came out and everyone complained that you couldn't travel on foot, then Driver 2 was released with this feature and it was VERY poorly done? Well, in Driver SF, the developers went in a completely original direction; the "Shift" function. Instead of physically exiting your current vehicle to get into another, you press a button that gives you a birds-eye view of the city (with various levels of zoom, even down to street level), from there, you can teleport into any vehicle that you see! Sounds crazy, and to avoid spoilers I won't explain why "Shift" exists, but it works well. Now, the best part of Driver SF; the cars. No Infernus or Banshee in this game; EVERY, and I mean EVERY SINGLE IN-GAME CAR, is a car that you can go out and buy in the real world. Ford Mustang, Dodge Charger and Challenger, Jaguars, Chevrolet Corvette; even classic cars like the Fairlane, Mach 1 and Delorean.

Some missions are just stupid for time limits and difficulty while others are too easy. You have to do the boring mini missions to be able to progress through the story, too - why would I want to do lots of stuff that has nothing to do with the story, just to make it progress? Horrible idea.\n\nThe car physics are really nice, but it's the overall design I can't stand. It probably looked good on paper, but after the novelty of the nice physics and cool city wear off there's nothing else worth bothering with.\n\nGraphics are good, but it's pretty drab. It's a big city but it's not exactly brimming with difference - one side of the city feels the same as the other.\n\nThe 70s vibe is good, but I don't know how the story ends because I got bored and uninstalled it.\n\nAlso, UPlay.","February 25, 2015","false","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Trolling the cops,  knocking out enemy racers to brute-force your way to first, or just generally launching unsuspecting civilians off ramps. :P\n\n\nAnd if you can find some people to play online with, the shenanigans amplify.

This is the latest full AAA title in the Driver franchise, number five I believe, the encounter in question is an unlockable challenge which pays homage to the opening level of the original game from 1999 on the first Playstation.\nDriver for me holds a spot close to my heart as it was the first AAA title I ever owned on my first console the resized PSone. Anyway onto this new version.\nYou once again step into the shoes of John Tanner, ex racing driver come hard driving cop. San Francisco has taken a step back to the roots of the game series and has gone back to focusing on the driving. You will not be running around or shooting in this game, which is a relief as Driver is all about tearing through back alleys sending tables flying chased by the police in the style of classic car chases in movies.\n\nAnd this is a good move for the series. Despite the not running about you still have the option to switch the car you are in through the mechanic of “shift” into one of about 90 licenced vehicles all of which have a damage meter which will force you to jump out and try new approaches.\n\nThe driving mechanics in this game is pretty solid, the game is an obvious console port, through the lack of graphics tweaking options and the depth of field is shallower than one might expect. I did not see many car pop ins but definitely saw some buildings pop in. The driving as per the rest of the series is very arcade inspired. Drifting, power slides and high speed corners are not a problem in this game, whether in a bus or a zonda.\n\nI tried playing this game with a  keyboard and with a 360 pad and neither seems to be a definitive winner for a driving platform in this game, so down feel put off if you don’t own a game pad.\n\nThe story isn’t bad, but it’s not going to win any awards for narrative. The voice acting is good, with a lot of comedy from the leading roles as well as the interactions between Tanner and the passengers of cars that you shift into.\nSo if you are after an arcade driving game with an open world environment or you’re after a nostalgia trip to a game with its roots back in the nineties then you could do worse than Driver: San Francisco.\n","December 22, 2013","true","21.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Many mission also tend to feel repetitive but the dialogue makes most missions interesting, especially the city missions.

I've never been much of a fan of driving games. I've tried a lot of them: Burnout, Need for Speed, Forza, Gran Turismo, even the previous Driver games left me lukewarm on the genre. I mean there's only so much one could do with using a car to get to another end of a race. At least, so was thought until this came around.\n\nUsing the novel car-swapping mechanic, you can jump in and out of different cars in open world San Francisco as you take on the devious Jericho. The car-swap allows for some great times; you could eliminate your fellow racers with headlong collisons or crash in a spectacular chase and in a couple button presses, be on your way as normal. That's the best thing about this game; the flow. It flows perfectly from car chases to street races to mission stages (:P).\n\nI have a couple minor gripes: the cars seem to spin out pretty easily and the missions sometimes feel a bit unforgiving when I just barely fail them. But even then, they never at any point stopped me from enjoying the game. I recommend this one wholeheartedly and hope that you pick it up!\n\nP.S.

The graphics are lackluster but serviceable (I've had zero frame rate drops at max settings), the cars are widely varied and show a decent amount of detail, the soundtrack is completely devoted to '70s funk and Motown (okay at times, but straight-up annoying and misplaced at others), and the city of San Francisco actually feels like a city. There are still parts I haven't unlocked, and I can't wait to do so to get access to more cars! It also really feels like a Driver game to me, with a wide expanse to explore and do burnouts in, dodge traffic and people, and get in trouble with the cops every now and again. A big point to bring up is the "Shift" mechanic, which basically takes you out of the car you're driving and makes it possible to switch to some other vehicle on the fly. I was pretty wary of this, as it sounded like something that the game would only make available during certain scripted segments of missions. I was pleasantly surprised to find out this wasn't the case. It turns out that you can Shift from car to car anywhere, anytime during free drives and certain missions, and it really feels fleshed out. This is thanks the ability to zoom in and out for better views, a popup that displays the stats of a certain vehicle, and the ability to quick-switch at later points in the game, like during cop chases. It's practically seamless and a lot of fun to use, plus it doesn't hurt to hear some funny dialogue like when you possess a woman driving her kid to school, a feuding couple, or some other such silly nonsense. I'm five hours into the game and loving every minute of it; I get to drive a DeLorean, a Ford GT, Oldsmobile Cutlass 442, Dodge Viper, and even dumb old beaters like a Vista Cruiser, Vandura, and Dodge Monaco. Cars, destruction, racing, unlockables, missions, huge city, 1st-person driving views on every car--aside from the soundtrack, this game is a touch of vehicular gaming perfection. 9/10.\n\n","February 25, 2014","true","29.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It eliminates the tedium of having to drive back to a garage if you want a different car, it adds a whole other level to the gameplay, and it ties into the story beautifully.\n\nThough like all car games, D:SF is probably only half as fun when you're using the keyboard.

It has the wackiness and solid storytelling of GTA, but with a heart (and without the tedious running around on foot). It has the intense cop chases of NFS:Hot Pursuit, but with much more soul. It has nice big open city like Burnout Paradise, but one that has people in it and feels lived in (plus far less annoying crashing).\n\nOverall, a great fun story, some genuinely laugh-out-loud moments, great soundtrack, and great physics that make all the cars believeable but fun and easy to drive.\n\nThe shift mechanic rocks. It eliminates the tedium of having to drive back to a garage if you want a different car, it adds a whole other level to the gameplay, and it ties into the story beautifully.\n\nThough like all car games, D:SF is probably only half as fun when you're using the keyboard. A wheel probably is overkill in this one - play it with an xbox gamepad.","December 27, 2011","true","19.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Decent graphics.  Interesting game mechanic.  Looks like there is lots to see and do in a GTA-style, but confined to (lots of) driving, rather than activities on-foot.\n\nThe actual driving seems like it would be fun: throwing big, floaty, American cars around the streets... if only it supported my Thrustmaster T500 wheel!  I can't face going back to other control methods like KB or gamepads, but they probably work OK.  About 10 other (older) Thrustmater & Logitech wheels are, however, supported by the game and you can edit their settings files in folders in the following location if your wheel isn't (Google for further details):\n\nC:\Steam\SteamApps\common\Driver San Francisco\Input.\n\n... At the moment, I can get the game to recocognise my wheel & pedals, but centering and force-feedback won't work.  It really needs wheel centering, at least.

Currently i'm approx. 1.5 hours into the game and it did not disapoint me (due to the discount).\n\nThe story; yes! there is a story! is not the best thing of the game. Actually the story is aweful. But if you like race around in nice cars through San Francisco this is your game.\nThe game let's you (after the tutorial section) drive around the city. In the meantime there are certain areas where you can start challenges. e.g. race against others, make jumps, drive around without bumping into people.\n\nWorth noticing before buying this game makes use of UPlay. UPlay is the ubisoft's game library like Steam but than more like his evil twinbrother. I experienced several problems with UPlay in the past, because it actually needs admin rights to start up. (imho riddiculous )\n\nI would recommend picking up the game when it is on sale.","November 29, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was the perfect mix of destruction and exploration, where you could just go around and jump, smash, and crash your way to victory.\n\nNow, Driver: San Francisco is similar to Burnout Paradise, but conveys the claustrophobic environment that wreckless driving despises. The close-quarters, hilly environment of the bay area adds so much more to intense car chases, wailing sirens and all. The physics engine and environment rewards the player greatly for tight vehicle handling and situational awareness. The dreamy lighting makes the game teeter perfectly on the borderline that separates plausibility and creativity.\n\nFinally, the most creative part of the game: The "Shift" component. I love how you can just move ahead to a semi in oncoming traffic so you can head-on fleeing suspects. It's really creative and unique, and as far as I know, hasn't really been done in a driving game before. Anyways, it's a good game. You should pick it up sometime.","December 11, 2015","true","62.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
