I love it so much. But first the basics. Company of Heroes is a real-time strategy game in the times of WW2, directly after the D-Day. It features 1 campaign for vanilla, but you can expand that number by buying the really good DLCs. But the best about this game is the mp. All the factions (America,Commonwealth,Wehrmacht and Panzer Elite) are really well balanced and if you loose, it's only your fault. Every faction has 3 different trees of abilities, but you can only choose one per game. The abilities reach from little boosts or infantry drops to V1 Rockets or mighty king tiger tanks. Thanks to the "new steam version" the mp still works and many people are still playing it (up to 4000 people peak, source Steamcharts by 21st of february), so there's no reason to not get it. Thanks for reading and i hope you endorse this little review of me. ^^ And now go ahead, scroll up and buy it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198053111355/recommended/4560/","76561198053111355","Lead (Probably won't talk much)","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198053111355/","89 products in account","(Something to quickly note first - Don't let the amount of time I have put into this game misguide you. This review was actually meant for Company of Heroes (New Steam Version) which I have put over 120 hours into but for some reason, you cannot do reviews of it and can only do reviews for COH itself as well as its two expansion packs.)\n\nAlright, enough dilly-dallying. Let's get this show on the road.\n\nWhen it comes to games that try to capture the hard, bloody and steely conflicts of World War II then one game usually comes to mind (my mind that is) and that is Company of Heroes.\n\nA game I would easily consider to be one of the greatest RTSs of all time alongside the likes of Age of Empires II, Rome: Total War, Men of War and Dawn of War (So many wars!). I would also say it is one of my own personal favourite games of all time.\n\nSet in the western front of the European Theatre of World War II. Company of Heroes sees the US Army (As well as the British Army with Opposing Fronts installed) and the Wehrmacht (As well as the Panzer Elite {Waffen SS in reality} with OF installed) battling each other for the control of France and the Netherlands in the numerous conflicts and engagements of that era.\n\nCompany of Heroes is a game that just does so many things right when it comes to strategy. It has a user friendly interface and easy to learn controls which are key to any strategy game in my opinion – both real-time and turn-based – and gives a really realistic and striking depiction of the war. It has easy to understand game mechanics and it is quite literally a blast to play as it takes little time before the action begins and gets intense real fast when there is so much happening at once in devastating and explosive fire fights.\n\nWhen it comes to its gameplay, it seems fairly simple enough. You start off with a single building for a base and a group of engineers (your builders in the game), a big map to explore and expand into as well as using what resources you can secure from the area to use so you can try to build up your base and call in what units or support options you need to attain victory, such as infantry, paratroopers, special weapons teams, armoured cars, medium and heavy tanks, artillery barrages, P-51 strafing runs and V1 Rocket strikes etc. It’s your standard RTS mash up.\n\nThis game is the epitome of how a strategy game should play out; rather than just the usual strategy game method of having larger numbers than the other guy (Although that certainly helps in this game). COH requires you to utilise your given surroundings, putting soldiers in buildings and environmental cover to give them an edge in the fight while also attempting to use your units special abilities like throwing grenades and sticky bombs or using flamethrowers to try and maximise enemy casualties.\n\nMaybe trying to exploit certain tactics like flanking maneuverers, suppression of an enemy squad, going around the back of an enemy tank and hitting it in its vulnerable sides and rear armour or trying to hold onto a strategic position with well-placed fortifications, traps and emplacements. That is what real strategy and tactical prowess is about and COH does it beautifully.\n\nThis means that you must be cunning and always planning for the unexpected, always being one step ahead of the opposing commander. Be ready for when the enemy comes charging at you with everything they have while calling in whatever long range assets they can muster against your forces.\n\nGraphics are decent, they may not be all the way up there when compared to the likes of StarCraft 2 or the Total War games but they do the job as far as I’m concerned and still hold up pretty well to this day. When you see an artillery barrage devastate a patch of land, turning it into a series of craters while a nearby squad of soldiers gets blown apart (literally) by the shrieking shells all the while screaming that “They don’t want to be there, they just want to go home, man!” then I would definitely say that the graphics and audio department have very much done their job to the nth degree.\n\nThere are problems with the game though. The AI is questionable at times with enemies running entire platoon sized forces into fortified positions without trying to soften up the defenders with artillery or anything first, more often or not I saw the spamming of the same unit over again from my AI controlled enemies also while not trying to diversify their unit types to counter any certain units I had. The AI also cheats sometimes, knowing exactly where to call in an artillery barrage on your units despite that the fog of war would prevent them from knowing their exact location. The campaign(s) are quite scripted and often don’t present much of a challenge, even on the harder difficulties.\n\nIt’s not a perfect game by any means but I still recommend it for all the good I have mentioned above and hope this review can help your perspective should you think about purchasing it.\n\nOn the side as well, I just want to say that this game has some of the best voice acting I have ever heard with soldiers spouting some really emotional and funny dialogue with professional voice talent provided from the likes of Steve Blum and of course, dear old Nolan North. Somehow the creators even managed to work in some humorous fourth wall breaking dialogue as well, my favourite having to be from a British Infantry Section, “Excuse me, sir, would you mind not clicking me anymore?” or “Oi! Get your bloody hands off the mouse!”\n\nAnd if you do ever think about getting Company of Heroes then I highly recommend that you download the Blitzkrieg mod which amplifies the game like 10 times in terms of gameplay and player choice, making it even more gripping and awesome to play.\n\nSo there you have it. Sorry about the length of this review but I simply had to put down what I liked about this game, which unfortunately was a lot….sorry.\n\nHave a good day, sir or madam.\n\n\nQuote of the day - “We’re f*cked, crew! Command is drunk again!” - US Artillery crewman.","July 5, 2015","true","1.5"," 98 of 104 people (94%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","94","98","104","18","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yuber8f/recommended/4560/","Yuber8f","Yuber8f","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yuber8f/","114 products in account","Most Innovative RTS Game of all time.\n\nCompany of Heroes is unlike any other traditional RTS games. Many have tried to innovate the RTS genre, but none that has been more successful over Company of Heroes. Relic has always been in the forefront of innovtive RTS experiences, But I have to say CoH is their ultimate masterpiece, not even its sequel, can beat it.\n\nEverything in CoH is realistic without compromising balanced gameplay mechanics and fun. I have yet to see a new RTS game to beat this game as of this writing.\n\nIn CoH, massing units do not work when a horde of infantry is halted by single tank, or even worse: face a hail of mortar strikes. Your seemingly unstoppable tank column can be put to a halt with well placed gun enplacement in a superior position  . Simly put, you cannot steamroll to victory in this game like you would in any other RTS games.\n\nTechnically speaking CoH revolves around tactics, resources and base building is still a major mechanic in the game, but superior maneuvers and positioning is everything. Resource management is a zero-sum tug of war as the only way to secure more resources is to hod more teritorries, the more territories you hold the harder it is defend.\n\nThe units are consisted of infantry squads or singular tank units. These units are very accurate to its real-life counterparts,  a US rifleman squad armed with M1 Garrand rifles will defeat KAR98-wielding german counterparts at medium to close range, but the opposite happens in long range engagements. Heavy Machine gun emplacements provide supressing fire that reduces the target's ability to fight or maneuver well. Long range artillery is inaccurate but deadly when it lands home - tanks are impervious to anti infantry weaponry giving them free reign to dominate an opponent with no proper anti-tank response.\n\nFurthermore, as the game progresses, every action in the battlefield earn you commander points which allow the playerto level up and gain access to special units, powers, or even superweapons such as the V1 Rocket strike or even call out powerful german Tiger Tanks. This allows the player to adapt apidly varying battlefield conditions.\n\nThere are many more innovative gameplay mechanics such as Directional cover, retreat mechanic, triage, battlefield destruction and many more. It also has a very compelling single player campaign - long enough for you to grasp and master these mechanics. And if that isn't good enough for you, gimping and gore in this game is fantastic. Nothing more exhilirating and satisfying seeing your opponents army's flying limbs and smoking scrap by a well placed artillery barrage.\n\nCoh is an absolute get and an instant timeless piece - I seriously doubt anything coming out sooner or later will top the bar this game has set so high.","June 22, 2014","true","54.9"," 78 of 82 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","78","82","0","0"

See Conclusion\nINTRODUCTION:Company of Heroes is a real-time strategy game developed by Relic Entertainment and published by THQ (RIP). It boasts an authentic World War 2 RTS experience with a squad based infantry mechanic, tactical and strategic map control, realistic armored combat and intense battles that will leave players at the edge of their seats. The game was originally released in 2006 and the first game to be labeled with the Games for Windows tag on the box cover.\n\nMuch like other World War 2 video game stories, Company of Heroes lets you take the role of an American army company called 'Able Company' who takes part in some of the most major operations of the allied forces during the war such as D-Day and the Falaise Pocket.\n\nPROS:+ Great graphics that looks good even in today's standards\n+ Great sound effects\n+ Amazing voice acting that gives life to the battlefield (probably my favorite PRO)\n+ Dark humor from the units “Main gun is out, we're screwed, we're screwed!” - Allied tank when the Main Gun is disabled and low on HP “I don't want to die...in FRAAANCCCEE” -Wehrmacht Soldier when low in HP.\n+ Intense action packed combat\n+ Great atmosphere (A PRO I rarely put on an RTS title)\n+ Great core game mechanic\n+ Faction versatility: Each faction has 3 'branches' where the player can adopt different bonuses to better suit their play style.\n+ Fully destructible environment that leaves the battlefield deformed after each match\n\nCONS:- Low quality textures when zoomed in (probably because of the game's age)\n- No melee or close quarter combat like Relic's other series 'Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War'\n- Relatively long load times\n- Occasional pathfinding problems\n- No Axis / German Campaign (Added in the Expansions)\n- AI could use some improvement\n- Relic Entertainment Account (DRM)\n\n\nCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME and comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. The game provides one of the most authentic experiences I have ever gotten on a World War 2 RTS game. It has excellent game mechanics; great graphics that aged really well despite some low textures; awesome voice acting from the cast; fun factions with a good variety of units to play with; and an over all solid core gameplay. It has its fair share of CONS but in my opinion, the PROS definitely outweighs them by a large margin specially with the removal of Games for Windows Live and its migration on Steam.\n\nMUST BUY for RTS and World War 2 fans whether at full price or on sale although, I highly advice the 'Complete Pack' (which includes the original game and the 2 expansions) to have the full Company of Heroes 1 experience.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

I purchased the complete pack on Steam that contains the original copy, which I had a non-steam copy that had over 100 hours, and the new steam version. To play this game, you have to install the new steam version, which I have 40 hours on.\n\nCompany of Heroes is a great game set in World War II with Nazi Germany and the Allies. It is a strategy game with a overhead camera in-game. The game features six different campaigns if you own the base game and all expansions. Each campaign allows the player to either play as the British, Americans or Germans through a rich storyline. For example, the Invasion of Normady campaign is self-explanatory. Each specific campaign has a good story that cover various aspects of that timeframe. For example, the Liberation of Caen campaign has missions such as attempting to take Hill 112 prior to the invasion of Caen to help the allies with supplies. Some campaigns are better than others such as Tiger Ace and the Invasion of Normandy compared to ones that do drag including Operation Market Garden. I got about 35+ out of all six campaigns. All in all, all campaigns are good enough to hold the interest of the player and are fun to play.\n\nThe graphics are really good for a 2006 game. The sound is perfect to what the game is about and the setting it is portrayed in. The dialogue is varied and is strong to negate the feeling of repeatitive dialogue. The gameplay is really good. There are multiple relatively minor glitches including the pathfinding system and the population system that add up over time that affect the overall approval rating of the game. All in all, these four catagories are positives.\n\nThe multiplayer is excellent. There are various modes tha help with variety in the game from the Operation Stonewall mode to just normal 1v1, 2v2, etc. The population of online is at a reasonable amount currently. Nothing more to say, just a typical multiplayer that excels.\n\nOverall, an excellent game. The campaigns are diverse and entertaining, the multiplayer is superb and the graphics, dialogue, etc. is great. There are some minor issues as I said with the gameplay but it doesn't hurt the game that much. Highly recommended game. 9.5/10\n\n----\n\nThanks for reading my review!

This game broke the build up a base and stomp routine, you had to pay attention to individual battles, and it's fantastic while doing so. The music and graphics at the time in 2006 were top notch, and you had to have a nice pc to run this game on full settings, the destructible environments blew me away, watching shells bounce off enemies tanks, or ricochet off the ground and into your own team, watching the ground scorch over time, and trees up rooted by tanks. Even writing this review makes me want to play right now, i've put over 600 hours into this game easy, and multi player is edge of your seat action the whole time, constantly changing strategy.\n\nTwo primary modes, destruction and king of the hill esseintialy, resources are spread out on maps and you must take them with units, keep them and hold them.\n\nWhat I didn't like about the game: The game stopped updating and CoH2 was dissapointing, this has nothing to do with this game though this game is must own.\n\nWould I buy at current asking price of 9.99? Must own game, all time favorite list.\n\n**Disclaimer**\nI would like to state all changes made by the developers of the game after this review could potentially make this entire review irrelevant.\nThe current date of review 12/5/2014.","December 5, 2014","true","4.2"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","19","19","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/greyknight/recommended/4560/","greyknight","Commissar Blam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/greyknight/","74 products in account","Company of Heroes is, quite simply, the best RTS I have ever played - I would even go as far as saying that it's one of my top five favourite games of all time. The visuals are excellent in spite of its old age; though there are several mods available that improve upon these for those of you who enjoy super close-ups of your units.\n\nThe campaigns are enjoyable and offer a solid amount of single-player gameplay. However, I personally did not find them to be particularly replayable. The meat of the game is in the excellent skirmish and multiplayer modes, which offers up a huge range of maps - though there are only two game modes (point capture and good old fashioned annihilate), no two matches ever come out the same. The scale of the action is just right; small enough to allow for tactical squad gameplay while being large enough to feel like an actual battlefield, unlike Dawn of War II (which was oddly enough inspired by CoH).\n\nAs for mods, there are many very high quality ones available. Want the Eastern Front without the pain of CoH 2? Sure! The Trenches of the First World War? Of course! More 'realistic' gameplay, North Africa, shedloads of new historic vehicles, weapons and infantry? There are mods for all of that. There's even a mod for German prototype supertanks and exploding donkeys with rocket launchers strapped to them, if that's what you're into.\n\nIn short, Company of Heroes is a superb game that I cannot recommed enough, whether you're already into RTS games or looking for your first one. It has given me dozens of hours of entertainment and I am sure that it will provide dozens more. As it's a relatively old game now it's very cheap for what you get; so there's no reason not to buy and install it right now!","January 5, 2014","true","168.1"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","0"

Here goes.\n\nSo, to better understand my review I have to give a little about me.\n\nI am a history buff, and a HUGE World War 2 enthusiast. From televised media like games, movies, documentaries and interviews, to written literature like stories and reports. Since I was a wee little tyke I've been taking in and absorbing as much as one can about this bit of history. Strategy/RTS games are my favorite genre and to finally see a World War 2 game executed on this level has my heart exploding from the rooftops of sheer excitement and nostalgia. The amount of depth and complexity in this game still astounds me. I need to position my armor right to score critical hits, I can move my rifleman squad on to that previously occupied PAK 38, and use their own weapon against the enemy team. Cover comes into play. There is just so much here to love, compared to the right click to win of other RTS.\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough.","April 18","true","0.1"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","4"

Well, "Company of Heroes" is not that type of game. In this game a simple move can change the whole outcome of the match. You don't have to amass thousands of units in order to be strong. Actually, the game can support very few units per player. But that it the beauty of the game, because with the units that you have (this game includes infantry, armor, light armor and emplacements, such as artillery etc) you can make smart moves and change the tide of the game to your favor. You've got to use your units. You've got to use the environment. You've got to use your brain!\n\nThe game includes 4 factions (2 in the original game and 2 in "Opposing Fronts"), all with their unique set of units and abilities. All of them have their own strategies to lead you to victory. I believe they were all carefully made, are absolutely balanced and very interesting.\n\nThe single player includes 6 campaigns (2 in the original, 1 in opposing fronts and 3 in tales of valor), which are absolutely outstanding. You can never get bored by those campaigns, simply because you don't have just to destroy the enemy's base or defend your base against the enemy's attacks, but you sometimes control only the units and you have to make careful decisions in order to execute a mission. The game itself makes you live the moments! I mean it! You have to try it!\n\nThe multiplayer is also fantastic. The main idea of it is that you have to defend some key points and the enemy starts losing points until their point reach zero (starting at 500). The multiplayer system has the "Play now" function, which finds you a game almost instantly (even in the new servers, I'm now encountering no problem at all). You can also create and find a game in the standard way, but automatic mathmaking saves you the trouble. Your stats get recorded and you can download a replay of every match that you play, making easy to find any mistakes that you've done and improve your strategy.\n\nDo not be afraid of the recent move to the steam servers. I bought the game 10 days ago and by the time this review is written I have encountered zero problems. I'd like to congratulate  the company for doing so, because most companies would have just quit the project and let it die. By this move I had the chance to experience the game, too, because I bought it a little late (better late than never though).\n\nI haven't regret having bought this game. It is a unique, once in a lifetime game. It's one of those games that I will be speaking about when I get older and have nostalgia about. Simply the best strategy game I have ever played.\n\n10/10","January 10, 2014","true","0.1"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

The game not only has an intense multiplayer but pretty nice features for an RTS. You pick between the Germans or the Allies in this game. The German you can be the Panzer Elite or another branch of their military or you can be the Allies which are British and Americans. The game has 3 specialities. Air, Armor and Land. Each have their own special skills. The environment is destructable, so mortar strikes and air bombings cause the terrian to change. You can blow up buildings or even use the buildings as cover. You can literally zoom into the battlefield so close that you can see the troops bodies blow up to pieces. The animations are very realistic and it actually makes you feel like you're watching a real life scenerio of WW2.\n\nIn short- This is one of the best RTS games you can play...

Company of Heroes takes place in 1944, Europe, when and after the Allies launch the Operation Overlord.\n\nCompany of Heroes has good gameplay. You build your base camp and fortify it before assaulting the enemy base camp and destroy it. Infantry unit can take cover on walls, fence or garrison themselves in houses or any other buildings that garrisonable. Unlike many other RTS game, infantry in Company of Heroes is a force to be reckoned with. They can be upgraded with better weapons or even be equiped with anti-tank weapons to engage armored vehicles. Vehicles and tanks also has unique damage system. Their engine can be blown off, immobilizing them. When vehicle unit finally destroyed, they can be "out of control" that they will hit something and explode. Each faction has 3 unique command tree with each command tree has its own special ability.\n\nGraphics of Company of Heroes is beautiful on its age. Explosion effect, skies, muzzle flash and weapon tracers are amazing. Animation are even more realistic as it can be. Infantry will act based on the battlefield situation and the state of the infantry, like when they are pinned down or retreating. Smoke and fire effect is also great.\n\nPerformance of Company of Heroes is quite bad. Most of the time you will run the game just fine, but sometimes you will encounter sudden stutters or even lags even on advanced computers. The engine still need to be optimized. AI performance still quite good regarding this, and will give challenge on harder difficulty.\n\nOverall, Company of Heroes is amazing real-time strategy game with advanced graphics and decent style of gameplay. With a bit more optimization, the game will be even more amazing. I recommend this.\n\nRating 8/10","October 12, 2013","true","9.8"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

It removes resource gathering of traditional RTS games , and replace it with capturable resource points and victory points , which forces players from both sides to constantly fight all over the map . The graphic is good even by nowaday's standard and the sound effect / voice acting are great . The single player campaign will take some time to complete but the real fun lies in Multiplayer once you get used to game mechanics , a match against an equally skilled opponent can usually last over 40mins , its very intense and even more satisfying if you manage to defeat your opponant .

You don't just kill the enemy infantry. You use propaganda to force retreat a huge clump of expensive heavy infantry, timing it in tandem with a V-1 flying bomb attack on their base that vaporizes them just as they arrive.\n\nThere's no units that serve a redundant purpose. The abilities are also very strong regardless of which faction you pick, especially compared to CoH 2 and you'll be hard pressed to blame the game balance for a defeat. There's also extensive options for bot matches and a pretty decent campaign if you don't do much offline.

IN FRAAANNCCE- low health werhmacht soldier\n+ action packed (somtimes extremely frustrating) combat\n+ critical vehical damage system EX: main gun, engine destroyed and tracks being blown off\n+ diverse factions which all have 3 branches that provide extra commander and unit abilities aswell as units or\ngroups of units asertaining to the specific branches purpose EX infantry armor airbourne and (british) artillery\n+ additions of two new factions in DLC which is also a con because you have to pay for them but also adds new\ncampaings\n+ british are great a great addition to the allies\n+ panzer elite are a great addition to the axis\n+ both the british and panzer elite can counter each other with their own units and branches\n+cheap pricing and alot of replayability with mods for the core game EX" europe at war blitzkrieg\nbattle of the bulge and modern combat. (you could get a new triple A game for the price of two\ncompany of heroes complete packs and still won't offer the replayability that CoH has)\n\nand now to do the part i like the least the cons\n\nCONS:\n-path finding problems\n-occasionally the AI goes full ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and doesn't really build many defences and puts them in terrible places which\nisn't part of going it going full ♥♥♥♥♥♥ thats just how the AI rolls, it does place mines around capture points though\n-british can be OP when spaming emplacements especially 25 pounders\n-panzer elite don't have a decent buildable medium tank like the Panzer IV F2 and up instead it gets the F1 which\nhas less armor and a short barrel 75mm gun which has terrible armor penatration but can at least kill stuarts.\n-panzer elite players who are smart can use bergertiger recover tank to recover panther battle groups after calling\nin more to get ridiculous numbers of panther tanks while going over pop cap (it is a viable strategy but it's costly\nand takes alot time)\nIn conclusion if your a RTS fan and like WW2 this is a great game for you and you'll probably want to go with the complete pack but you can get the base game for $10 or €9 and if your still not sure you want to spend money on it there is a free demo. I strongly recommend this game due to the (as mentioned before)  great core gameplay replayability and mods avaliable for the game that can give it an entirely new flavour like BOTB and modern combat or just make the core game it self harder, more extensive or both like europe at war and blitzkreig(yes i do know there are ALOT more pros than cons and thats because it's a solid game but those cons can be game breaking and yes for you veteran players i know i left some thing out but if i included everything this would take up more space than 4 brit players on semois and the people who are reading this and don't have the game wouldn't have anything to find out them selves)","June 1, 2015","true","0.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateAzib/recommended/4560/","PrivateAzib","PrivateAzib","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateAzib/","44 products in account","*NOTE: Review is based on my 30+ hours in the "New Steam Version", which is not listed in the Steam Store.\n\nFor a game made in 2006, Company of Heroes (and its expansions) still holds up well today. The game still looks pretty decent for our current time, which says something about how well made it is. The environments are very well detailed though the models don't look all that great (by today's standards that is), but that's acceptable as it is an RTS, where players would be looking at the whole map more than getting up close and personal with the units.\n\nThis game is not just a looker too, it sounds great as well. The units all sound very unique and have their own lines, plus some hidden (and quite funny) ones when you click on them too much. The sound effects are also great and really immerse you in the battle at hand.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, CoH is no slouch. The AI is pretty decent and can sometimes surprise you, though it does do stupid things from time to time. Many systems and mechanics are also present in this game, such as Cover & Suppression for infantry, Resource Sectors, and even positional damage for vehicles. Besides that, both the Americans and German Wehrmacht differ between each other and confer to different playstyles. On top of that, each faction also has a sub-faction, in the form of its Company Commanders that have its won unique set of abilities and perks. All of these mechanics and systems help in adding more depth to the game, and also makes it all that more enjoyable to play.\n\nThe Campaign progresses linearly, but its also quite well done. The story of Able & Fox Companies are pretty decent and the missions are very enjoyable, though the difficulty of the missions increase quite fast. Each mission also offers Awards, which are only gained by completing special challenges in the missions, which can range from easy to hard depending on the player's skill level.\n\nThere are, however, some negatives that must be mentioned about the game. The game is quite heavy on the micromanaging side, so it might be a bit hard for newcomers to the RTS genre. Besides that, only the Americans get a campaign and only two sides are available in the base game (Opposing Fronts fixes this by adding in two newAllied and Axis campaigns, plus two more factions). Also you can't match the same sides against each other, such as Americans vs Americas, or vice versa. That being said, it does not hinder the game from being an amazing title.\n\nIn conclusion, Company of Heroes is a very good to amazing game that all RTS fans should play, as it is not just fun, but immersive and deep too. It is recommended to get the Complete version, as it adds in 5 new campaigns and 2 new sides to the base game's already solid Americans and Wehrmacht. And for the price that its being sold now, its pretty much a must-have.","June 16, 2015","true","0.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Nicely balanced. works great. Hexalots of fun, Multiplayer works, as well as dozens of mods. and best of all, you don't need no DLC to enjoy the base game. and the base game is only 7.99! (thats like 2 commanders for COH 2)\n\nSpeaking about the DLC's they add a ton of extra. 2 new playable factions, with their respective campaigns, The british and the panzer elite(opposing fronts) and as well 3 mini campaigns (tales of valor)\n\nNo need for pointless commanders costing 3.99 here.

I like to use this game as something to calm me down, after playing another game which frustrates me a lot. it's very satisfying to build up a whole assault, and then just unleash it on the enemies. I haven't tried online, so i can't say if the online is any good, but i have played the majority of the campaign and a lot of skirmish battles. I also played most of the "Tales of Valor" campaign on my old computer a few years ago, but i unfortunately couldn't save it.\nTO ANYONE CONSIDERING BUYING THE GAME: just note that the majority of battles aren't quick, in both campaign and in skirmish. I personally have had battles that have gone for 6 hours+, so it's definitely not a "might just play a little" game, if you want to play and complete a battle, you will have to put in a few good hours.","September 22, 2015","true","21.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's tactically complex with flanking maneuvers, defensive advantages, and special abilities, but easy to pick up. It's brutally difficult with its extremely tough AI, but ultimately isn't frustrating. The campaign is phenomenal, and the expansions are well worth playing (though Tales of Valor isn't quite as good as Opposing Fronts), so if you're an RTS fan, you owe it to yourself to play this.

While not being always historicly correct, the campaign is incredibly fun to play and offers a challenge to dedicated players on a higher difficutly.\n\nThe single player consists of the just now mentioned campaign and the skirmish mode, where you can play with and against AI players on different maps.\n\nThe Multiplayer Part is the same, just that you can play together with other human players too.\n\nWhat does the skirmish offer?\nYou can play either Germany of the USA and build infantry, heavy weapons, armored cars, tanks, artillery, bunkers [...] to conquer territory & ultimatively destroy your enemy.  To do that you have to build a base, research upgrades, conquer waypoints and logistic spots.\nYou gain ressources thanks to those and can build/upgrade whatever you desire.   The variety of units is totally ok and there are countless strategies on how to win a round. The different commander perks which you can choose ingame add new ways of tactic too. You can drop supplies, call in air support, ask for veteran tanks [...]\n\nThe graphics are top notch. If you are not satisfied with the allready existing one you can even use a few HD mods to imporve them even more.  This leads to another topic: Mods. You can download and install free mods to add new maps, commanders, armies (russians, eastern armies [...]) to add even more variety and fun!\n\nI totally recommend this game to anyone who enjoys RTS games in the WW II setting! 10/10","December 13, 2015","true","0.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

If you're experienced with the RTS genre games but love WW2, this is also for you. This game pits you in multiple campaigns containing missions from anything from full-on armored convoy ambushes, stealth missions, to delivering supplies to a certain location. The mechanics of the AI however, are very frustrating at times. Example being, if you're trying to get your squad out of a middle of the road under heavy MG fire, sometimes they refuse to run and just decided to lay there, and your squad ends up dying rather than having a chance of survival for future encounters.\n\nThe tank movement is a bit gritty aswell, when it comes to rotation. The tanks seem to back up when you don't want them to. Or they will rotate their rears where you do not want them to be vulnerable, and your rear hull armor/engines will get end up getting blown to bits. Besides these two small things, I have found it rather amusing that when one of your units get set ablaze, sometimes they will run towards an enemy squad and attempt to spread fire to the enemy units. Also if you have the Minesweeper attachment for your shermans, you can use it to tear away the limbs of your foes as it is just a bunch of spinning metal blades.\n\nEverything in this game is both good against certain things, and weak against others which makes this incredibly balanced, and you find yourself producing a wide variety of units and forming many kinds of tactics. What i love aswell, is that you can position your MG teams and mortars in a specific direction, and they will attack anything in that view which makes it super easy to attack and defend certain areas on a map.\n\nI truly enjoy this game, with the combination of epic soundtrack, explosions, and people screaming. 10/10\n\n","February 22, 2015","true","17.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

There are a large number of factors and tactical considerations to ponder, and a majority of the maps are not really fair. I would warn players that many would find this game tedious and boring if they are not in the right mindset when playing the game.\n\nYou have infantry and tanks, as well as everything in between. The objectives are dynamic, in that the game presents them in a way that does not seem like the entire mission is "go here and kill everything along the way". Progress is generally slow, and the game tends to rush you.\n\nThe pathfinding is a bit suspect. The satisfaction is not.\n\nThere have been times that I had to quit playing to keep cool since the game likes to suggest that you do stupid things and then scold you for screwing up. It is really annoying when it YELLS at you to do A, then A is obviously going to end in death.\n\nThe expansions are more of the same. One thing I cannot easily comprehend is how this game manages to make tank battles kinda boring and tedious.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brendissimo/recommended/4560/","brendissimo","Brendissimo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brendissimo/","277 products in account","Originally posted on October 8, 2006\n\nCompany of Heroes is a very focused and engaging game that plays off of squad dynamics and control point mechanics on a larger scale than seen before. It captures the WWII setting most admirably, with many historical weapons and vehicles, not to mention settings. Lets get to it then. Gameplay- The gameplay of company of heroes is fast paced and action oriented. The only way you are going to be able to sit back in your base and get rich on resources is if you have already taken most of the map. You win though fast decision making and decisive action, and mistakes are costly. Units cost quite a bit, and resource flow is rather slow, so make wise choices. The cover and physics system works very well to make the game feel real, and come alive as you play it. The enviornment changes with your progress.Dynamic cratering provides a new element of gameplay as well.\n\nThe A.I. is really incredible for this game, both for the enemy and for your men. Anything higher than easy in the difficulty setting is decently challenging, and it just ramps up and up. your men know when to take cover, reorient, to return fire, and take tactical initiative in fire fights. The enemy flanks, counterattacks, uses smoke screens, airstrikes, and even fients. Overall, the squad system works well with single vehicle and upgradable unit and veterancy sytem. This , complimented by doctrine trees, creates quite alot of gameplay variety. The few complaints I have in this game are about gameplay, however. As great as it is, it is very focused. There is no ww2 rts that could benefit from seeing more content like company of heroes. There are only 2 factions (very deep ones, abelit) US, and Germany, and the campaign is entirely from the US point of view in Normandy. If this game had different theatres, years, and maybe a russian or japanese faction. I could see it being proelled to monumental hieghts. I understand it does not focus on naval or air combat, so the pacific theatre is not such a good idea, although it could work, with the doctrine abilities (airstrikes, navla bombardment, landing craft reinforemnts etc.). However, the Eastern front and a russian faction is a must do for an expansion, along with a battle of the bulge/ market garden/ berlin campaign. A British faction would serve well here. But I digress. What the game does do, it does well\n\nGraphics-The graphics are brilliant. modern effects mixed with the detail of an fps from a few years ago in an RTS? it is insane. The units are the best I've ever seen in an rts. normal and specular mapping are put to goo use here, and the physics engine is beautiful. However, the game does need more blood, and more damage modeling for tanks. When a tank takes a round (when it doesnt bounce off) it should at least dent it. Sound- Very nice, though limited score of music. It really adds to the atmosphere. The sounds themselves are immersive and amazing. This game withe bass on my sub all the way up is incredible. very good attention to detail in the sound area.\n\nValue- 15 very tough missions, AI skirmishes, and multiplayer ship with this game, along with 2 factions, and a great variety in units, upgrades, abilities, and tactics. The scope could have been more, especially in the area of missions and factons, but it isn't that big of a deal. CoH is a very focused game.\n\nI would reccomend this game to any RTS fan, but be warned, dont start here if you are new to the gnere, this game is TOUGH.","March 1, 2014","true","0.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are a large number of factors and tactical considerations to ponder, and a majority of the maps are not really fair. I would warn players that many would find this game tedious and boring if they are not in the right mindset when playing the game.\n\nYou have infantry and tanks, as well as everything in between. The objectives are dynamic, in that the game presents them in a way that does not seem like the entire mission is "go here and kill everything along the way". Progress is generally slow, and the game tends to rush you.\n\nThe pathfinding is a bit suspect. The satisfaction is not.\n\nThere have been times that I had to quit playing to keep cool since the game likes to suggest that you do stupid things and then scold you for screwing up. It is really annoying when it YELLS at you to do A, then A is obviously going to end in death.\n\nThe expansions are more of the same. One thing I cannot easily comprehend is how this game manages to make tank battles kinda boring and tedious. Probably has to do with the pathfinding.","November 25, 2013","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Battles are glorious and (For those fellow DoW fans) This is nothing like Dawn of War, Sure the core structure is similar but everything is different. This game requires you to be constantly on the move, you cannot camp your army at your base until its fully upgraded because the Axis/Allies WILL dominate the map and they can be ruthless. As soon as your spawn you'll want to send out troops to gain land by capturing control points (Strategic points) These points are far more important as they give you Fuel (For cars etc) weaponry (Upgrades). Although at times I think that the accuracy of guns should of been increased, the game is fairly balanced.\n9/10 - It's just a shame that there aren't more factions to play as (US and Germnay for Vanilla game, British and Panzer elite for Opposing Fronts DLC)","November 30, 2014","true","17.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Use artillery, call in air support, control squads of infantry and heavy support weaponry, build defenses, tanks, snipers, rocket launchers, etc. The multiplayer networks are a bit weird now that they've been transferred over from THQ to Steam, but it's still very worth a try.","July 14, 2013","true","595.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The ability to construct defenses is great.\n\nThe armor system is nice as it includes deflection, engine damage, penetration based on area armor thickness and angle of impact and shot distance, but values seem a little off (sometimes tank rounds won't kill armored cars). Vehicle gunners can be killed and main guns can be disabled.\n\nEasily the most frustrating game I've ever played.\n\nThe community is worse than Call of Duty's. It consists primarily of bossy talentless kids who cling to good players to get winning scores and throw a fit if they aren't on the best team or if someone with fewer wins joins their team they will remove and block them.\n\nPoor pathing and behavior; a tank facing toward an enemy in range will not always simply fire on it from where it is, but will unnecessarily turn is vulnerable rear armor toward the enemy and drive backwards right up next to it while using its main gun to attack the least threatening things it can first. A tank told to back up a short distance will often turn around instead of using reverse. A tank under player control will do everything it can to avoid running over enemy infantry, but enemy tanks - even stationary - will crush infantry if they merely happen to be close by (not to say that player infantry won't occassionaly try to jump in front of the tank's treads instead of fire on it from where they are).\n\nIn the latest versions, beltfed machine gun fire doesn't supress well. AI can casually stroll across the center crossing in "Vire River Valley" with a dozen machine gun teams firing on them *without using special abilities/modifiers*.\n\nSnipers being made invisible instead of just hard to see with translucency or reduction of detail was a mistake.\n\nCompared to Blitzkrieg, it has similar but slightly easier more mouse based controls, a lower but adjustable overhead camera angle showing more detail in a narrower field of view, a more limited number of smoother models, and in the steam version an easier way to connect via internet but not LAN (there may not be any current option for LAN in CoH).\n\nI don't think it has the option to break up squads and control individuals like Men of War or Blitzkrieg.\n\nMy favorite mod is "Modern Combat". It has a "Hardcore Annihilate" mode that makes play more realistic and less frustrating by increasing range and damage, making suppression work well again, allowing everyone to sprint/fire up, snipers aren't invisible unless they are stationary and behind cover/concealment etc..\nhttp://coh-moderncombat.com/\n\nThe Great War 1918 is also nice and can be found on Steam. Its play usually lasts much longer than that of the base game. Crew served weapons have larger unit sizes making them less vulnerable to snipers.","May 20","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has been my favorite strategy game since I was much younger; in my teenagehood. I have played it on and off almost since it came out! The community hasnt been the greatest since the switchover to Steam/when SEGA bought the rights to the game; but there is still a large population on daily. Multiplayer is simply amazing; such a great feeling when you get to artillery a bunch of troops; or an enemy base/fortification.... or landing airborne troops behind enemy lines to cause havok. There is definitley the ability to implement strategy into the game; every decision in the beginning of a match (((In my opinion)) will determine the outcome of the rest of the match... matches can last anywhere from 15 minutes to 2 or more hours depending on how good the players are defensively and offensively. The game is based on strategic points on the given map being host; maps can be small-very large.... each team much advance towards the enemy team; while capturing points ((Its sort of like territory)) - the more territory you grab and hold; the more resources and population cap you aquire; giving you the edge over the enemy team. Whats awesome about long multiplayer matches; is that you can be winning for a very long time; and then be losing out of no where... its the same vice-versa. I would recommend this game to anyone interested in a good strategy game that will keep them interested for hours on end.","April 24","true","0.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Amazing gameplay, extreme detail, really well balanced (even though the wermarcht seem overpowered with their tanks, the more you play the more you realize it really is well balanced), good story, and absolutely addicitng multiplayer.  It always entertaining to see how the battlefiled changes in multiplayer, the front can quickly change if you are not careful or decisive.\n\nYou can still find quite a few people online playing online, so there is no problem finidng a game. Its definitly better playing with friends as its easier to communicate strategy.  The modding community is also top notch.

Well, lets kick this review off by me saying this, I enjoy playing this game whenever I get on. This game is very enjoyable each time I hop on. But there are somethings people who will be getting into the game.\n\n#1. You will get ♥♥♥♥♥ if you've never played this game.\n\n#2. If your win/loss ratio isn't at least above .500 expect to be kicked for being a noob.\n\n#3. Learn the factions:\nA. Allies- Overall under dogs compared to the overwhemly German Factions of the Panzer Elite and Wermacht. One way to beat the axis, is to at all costs stop them from producing tanks. Get good infantry such as Rangers, or upgrade your airborne.For Britain, I like producing my Sherman Fireflys, and basically using Artillery.\nB. Axis- My favorite faction(can you tell by my name?) which has the best tanks in the damn game. If you can get panzers with a good amount of infantry to support your tanks call most of the game GG.\n\nOverall Grsde of the Game-A\n\nIf your new don't expect to automatically get in a game and whoop some butt. Chances are your going to get kicked. Play up to 100 Skirms with the Computer then begin playing more Multiplayer.\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to comment.","February 28, 2015","true","16.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","2","3","3","0"

It gives you a perspective that no other game does. Me and my friend Jonny played this game all the time. We spent hours on it and could not think about missing out on a game. We used to support each other through battles and always joked about the lighter things. It was some of the best times of our life not counting on the whole war and all. We fought with honour and courage like no other men. During one battle we were side by side; surrounded by advancing German troops. Our gunner team was hit and we had no suppressive fire covering us and the advancing enemy was drawing close. Soon they were around us in a horse shoe shape. Me and Jonny fought with fire in our hearts, victory in our mind and fear in our eyes. We held off the advancing enemy troops with our machine guns and snipers but that's were it got worse. Panzer amour was coming up the road and we had only our bazooka which would not do a thing to it.\n\nAt this moment me and Jonny faced each other and gave a look that would only come from a man who knows that the risk he is putting to save his country has just become real. Despite from this we kept on fighting; holding of the enemy advance but whatever we did we could not hold on for much longer. We knew that for one of us that this trench will be our final resting place. We took a few seconds to rest to contemplate our lives and what we are proud of and what we regret. We fought on and on, not letting up. I kept turning to Jonny for reassurance making sure that he is always there. We held off the attack for another 5 minutes.\n\nBut at that moment my worst fears had become true. I heard a distinct ping sound and as I turned to him all I was greeted with was a dead body. At first I only thought that someone had taken Jonny's place and was killed but on closer inspection I feared the truth. The sinking feeling was like a dagger in the gut; a feeling I would never want to feel again. And at that moment I held him in my arms, in a way that would seem to save him and I wept like a baby that had just been born. During this the enemy advanced to our trench and saw me cradling this body which had no meaning to anyone anymore. To my luck these Germans took pity on my and spared my life but at that moment I wanted to join Jonny in the afterlife. I went through denial, saying to myself "You can't be dead, you can't!". I even tested the existence of God. Why would God take a good man off this earth when there are people who exist such as the SS. Then I came back around to the Germans pointing rifles at me when they proceeded to fall to the ground. The sound of Spitfires filled the sky and the advancement of allied forces took control of the battle.\n\nJonny was only 2 minutes away from living but as war goes, 'a man must lay his life for the greater good of his country'. And for so many other men this was just a dot in the progress of war. And who will remember Jonny. Not for just a man but for who he really was. The only way to find this is through war so the bond between soldiers is stronger than any other. He will be remembered for who he was but I will remember for who he is and who he will always be- A true hero.\n\nSo yeh. This was a pretty good game; I give it an 6.5/10","July 14, 2014","true","65.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I'm talking about single player mode ofcourse. The AI always uses distraction tactics that can make it very hard to get a good hold of what's going on soon enough. (EDIT: After 30 hours of gameplay, it occurred to me to google up the hotkeys since I suspected there must me more than the game shows us. AND THERE ARE. The game menu does not list the keyboard bindings and so I had no idea that the pause key could actually pause the game. This isn't indicated as an option on the gamplay HUD either :/  )\n\nWhile it truly is a fun game. It comes with it's fair share of big bugs. The biggest was that the game would always start in windowed mode. There is no setting in the options that can change this.\n\nI had to look up the issue to find these solutions :\n\nSolution 1: ALT+ENTER worked once.\n\nSolution 2: The one that worked so far is:\n\n- go to Documents\My Games\Company of Heroes\n\nOpen Local.ini with Notepad.\n\nChange the line\n'screendevice=DirectX10 rendering device'\nTo\n'screendevice=DirectX9 rendering device'\n\nSave and start COH\n\nBug #2: The halftrack vehicles are supposed to be APVs. We should be able to load personnel into them, and you can... ONCE. You load one group into a truck and that's it for the rest of the level. (EDIT: 20 hours of gameplay and I now find out that this happens once you upgrade the half track. Which is a shame really. )\n\nBug #3: The save game function is faulty. It does not save the game properly most of the time. If you choose to load a saved game, instead of picking up where you left off, it will start from the beginning of the mission. I thought this was done purposely by the developers. But it doesnt always work this way. This means I have wasted a lot of ime in being forced to restart the game level. I'm a risk averse player, which means I like to take my time and set up a flawless defence. This takes up a LOT of time. So being forced to restart a level because of a chink just upsets me.","April 28","true","60.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

I got into the gameplay with the first hour of playing. There are so many play styles and game modes. 4v4, 3v3, 2v2, 1v1 with an assortment of AI difficulties, 60+ Maps, 2 gamemodes and many unique factions to choose from. I chose to do a full tank squad that consisted of 10 tanks that would dominate. The commanders options are pretty cool but get old quite quick.\n\nPros 1. Great gameplay\n2. Multiple units to play with\n3. Wide varient of maps\n4. Battles\n5. Single-Player/skirmish\n6. Replayable\n7. The graphics have aged well\n8. Commander mode (Air/Infantry/Armoured focus modes)\n9. Cheap\n10. Amazing unit strats and commands\n\nCons 1. Crashing is common\n2. 16 gig download but 7.6 gig download for the new steam version?\n3. Only 2 fractions without dlc\n4. Multiplayer is slightly dead\n5. Annoying camera controls\n6. Strange money system\n7. Tedious gameplay that can drag on if something stupid happens\n8. Fullscreen is bugged\n9. CoH 2 is out and only a bit more expensive ($8 price difference)\n10. Tanks dont always follow commands\n\nOverall\nI love this game due to the amount of maps and units. I personally give it 8.4/10\n\n\nExtras\nThere is a HL2 mod that is basically a reskin of this game.\nLambda wars, at this time the game is in Beta so it isn't finished obv, alot of things with be getting added such as Vehicles, more units and more factions. So far its combine vs rebels. Also its free!\nIts really cool playing from the perspective of a rebel/combine commander from the Hl2 universe.\nAlso, hl2 being based in the future means more advanced tools such as invisible scanners, headcrab launchers, dark matter cannon, striders and more strange futuristic weaponry/items.\n\nGet it here http://store.steampowered.com/app/270370/","March 29, 2015","true","7.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Relic is at the top of their game here and have set the bar high for any future World War II strategy titles and RTS games in general. Completely destructible environments are used to enhance gameplay and create some of the most satisfyingly war torn landscapes seen in video games. A fulfilling campaign, addictive gameplay, detailed visuals, and powerful use of sound make up a complete experience with very few problems.","December 2, 2013","true","6.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

As the CEO of Gyros 'n Stuff, you control the national (and eventually multinational) policies of your gigantic corporation, but the game also allows you to micromanage various franchise owners if you wish. This is its greatest strength, because franchises in different regions have different challenges and objectives, and the higher level gameplay mirrors this, so that by spending time playing as these different franchises, you'll learn about the "realities on the ground" that are so crucial to success as a CEO. The endgame gets pretty bogged down because the game starts throwing lawsuits at you over the most tedious, petty details, and God help you if you actually did something REALLY bad. If your very first restaurant 10 years ago served ONE half-rat, half-lamb gyro on accident, you'll probably lose, long after you've quicksaved.","November 25, 2010","true","148.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

A hybrid space sim/racer/fps/jrpg didn't seem doable, but Relic Entertainment somehow pulled it off. The gameplay requires a lot of skill from the player, but rewards smart play more than most modern games.\nThe boss fights are all brilliantly executed, and the puzzles are a perfect balance of challenging and enjoyable.\n\nAn edgy, thought provoking plot about modern imperialism and its effects on the geopolitical landscape in the year 2045 could easily have fallen flat, but writers Steven King and Neil Degrasse Tyson have managed to create a terrifying dystopia in which anything seems possible. This gives Company of Heroes a heightened sense of terror and surrealism that sets it apart from the rest.\n\nI only have a couple of complaints. The graphics on level 3 definitely need some tightening up, the 3rd fetch quest you do for the "Horse" character becomes a bit tedious, and the all-rap soundtrack felt a bit inapproriate considering the serene environments, particularly in the hell level. This isn't enough to put a damper on the overall experience, though. Solid gameplay and a cartoonish aesthetic coupled with whimsical minigames and a surprisingly deep sandbox mode make Company of Heroes an easy GOTY contender. The boss fights are all brilliantly executed, and the puzzles were the perfect balance of challenging and enjoyable.\n\nRaccoon/Turtle","December 26, 2014","true","13.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You never know how a battle will end and the battle can swing back and forth at a moments notice. Every little detail counts in this game, as simply facing a machine gun a certain direction can have it either hold off waves and waves of infantry or become easily overrun by a single squad of riflemen.\n\nUnits are also a great aspect of this game, as every faction has tons of unique and individual units, and each army feels completely different from the others. These units all complement each other very nicely, and no sole unit can win the game. You must use your units to work together to defeat the enemy.\n\nVisually and graphically this game is very pleasing as well. Graphics are nice and detailed and the terrain is fully destructable. Sound is also great in this game, with especially great voice acting for all of the units keeping the game from becoming completely dark and depressing, with units occasionally cracking truly humorous remarks.\n\nOverall, this is a great game for anyone who likes strategy and tactics, and if you aren't sure if you want to get the second one yet due to it's still high price(although it is just as good as this game but even more improved) this is a great game to get into real time tactics.","November 23, 2013","true","2.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Instead CoH imposes you to gather resources (Manpower, munitions, fuel) by taking over as many zones of the map as possible by capturing the control points (flags) of each one.\n\nBy doing so the game merges the resource-gathering part and the warfare part of RTS and thereby the stragegy itself is moved all the way to the frontline.\n\nTop quality game!","May 9, 2013","true","8.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Because of that let me recommend this game but put a huge disclaimer about this Steam version of CoH right at the start:\n\n***What this game SAYS it is giving you and what is actually SOLD are two different items. LAN is not included in this sale; you will have to use SteamWorks which means if your internet is crap and you want this game for LAN games you are screwed (even thought it says it is offered). Buy used versions of this game and the expansions (seriously like $2.50, a massive difference in price) and then plug in your cd key into Steam and get the Steam version for free while retaining your ability to play LAN games. You get more for much less currently by going used and plugging in the keys. Until the issues are fixed this game and its expansions are grossly overpriced. Amazing game, don't waste the money on the current Steam versions.\n\n**The game (Current Steam Version with update) is suffering from major online failures across the board. Don't buy the game hoping to jump into PvP as it looks to be broken and doesn't look to have a fix in sight.\n\n*Buying the expansion Tales of Valor will open up LAN options for networked PC's, the base game will not allow it. Also you will have to buy the expansions in order to play as the British.\n\nGamplay:\n\nThis game is the greatest to date RTS game surrounding the events of WWII and might even be the greatest RTS game of all time. They introduced many things into the genre that hadn’t been seen before and honestly haven’t really been seen since as the genre seems to be dying out. Instead of having to manage hundreds of villagers telling them to get wood/stone etc (building an economy), you build structures that produce units and capture and hold key points on the map that give you resources to build said units. Some features such as having all your units visible on a side bar plus all of your groups you have created clearly labeled on the same side bar (as group 1, 2, etc) is absolutely priceless. You will never lose track of any of your units ever again. Also the ‘retreat’ option; oh… my… word… THANK YOU! SO often in these games you just want to have your people FLEEEEE! You can in this, and they will run (faster than normal) straight back to your base (not really firing in the process BUT taking less damage). These features are huge improvements to such a stale genre.\n\nAnother huge factor that plays into this game play is that THIS IS NOT A 20 MINUTE RUSH GAME! As far as Starcraft and AoE’s are played most games are over in 15 minutes with a rush; this game is all tactics. Someone rushes something there are huge counter measures where certain troops do terrible vs others so you cannot just rush a single unit and go; huge tactics in this game. The majority of the game play involves fighting over key points and ‘bleeding’ the enemy out of resources as you chip away at his defenses. Snipers, MG teams, rifle squads, etc make up the bulk of what you build; most of the units are in ‘squad’s or ‘groups’ vs just being alone and you have to bunch them up. Cover (in buildings and in the world) is important and has huge effects on who will win the battle. All in all an extremely well-polished RTS with well-polished RTS mechanics.\n\nTo see my thoughts on other games, movies, and music (and their complete reviews) check out my blog found in my Steam profile or by Google (Search Ashley and Micah English) Thanks.","November 11, 2014","true","0.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

You can't simply throw your basic unit at the enemy base until they eventually break down. You must use your rifle men to take out small squadrons of of the enemy, your snipers to sneak up on the mortar team that has the rest of your men pinned, and your tank to blow that MG nest sky high and keep it from plastering your soldiers. Then as you close on the enemy base, you must use your own mortar teams to take out the anti tank units that will quickly destroy your heavy calvary.\nWhen your men are under heavy fire, they wont stand there and take it, they will drop down, get pinned, and be unable to attack. Yet if you place them in good cover, (which you can actually pick where they will take cover) and the enemy is exposed on advancement they will be the ones pinned. This is really a great game, and well worth the money.\nBUY THIS CRAP!","February 9, 2015","true","1.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/4560/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1772 products in account","This is one of the most overrated games I have played in many years. The praise given by critics and gamers to Company of Heroes is truly alarming. To play the game, you will be forced into signing up and logging into a Relic-Online account with your CD key. It doesn't matter if you're playing single player. Relic forces you into this DRM style process that is not even listed with Steam. This is absolutely unnacceptable and I feel misinformed by Steam and Relic. Relic had another idiotic idea. Menus for all three standalone Company of Heroes games are included, but locked. There are also two training missions from the second standalone game that appear, but are locked as well. Ridiculous. Upon first impressions (first four missions), the tactics appear to be slow, unrealistic, lacking in response, and surprisingly linear for a real-time strategy game. I am somewhat shocked, as this game has secured much hype over the years. The AI (of your own units and the enemy) is amazingly simple and limited. The units often have a hard time with your directions, and all units appear to be suffering from Alzheimer's disease. The AI is simply not up to standard. Many of your troops stand or sit around during a large generalized firefight, or have extremely bad shot accuracy. Saving and loading times (especially) are unexcusably long even with a modern computer. After you quit the game, Steam uploads/synchronizes several hundred megs each time. I understand I can turn this off. My complaint is the amount of space the Company of Heroes save games occupy without allowing you to delete previously saved games. Company of Heroes does not make this simple save game housekeeping possible. The game has some serious sound volume troubles in general, as it is abnormally low. Between the live action portion and the cutscenes, this problem is most serious. The cutscenes are much lower in volume in comparison. You will be restricted to constructing a very small amount of buildings (six) and only seven types of infantry troops. If the aforementioned buildings and units were more extensive with their usage and utility, I would not have much to gripe about. In reality, you will find that what you have access to is quite abridged for a game that came out in 2006. From the fifth mission on, things do get better and a tiny bit more exciting, even though it will continue to be almost an exact repetition of the first four missions. The gameplay is abbreviated, strikingly dull, laggard, close to being boring, and with little to no excitement. You select your squad(s), point them in a certain direction, select some inexstensive actions, watch some mildly interesting battle take place until the enemy troops are all dead, then capture a strategic point. That's it. There is really not much else to it. Even if the mission objectives change from mission to mission, the means you will exercise to achieve those goals will be the same. Construct buildings, generate units, upgrade, take over strategic points, repair units, replenish units, and then repeat. Once again, that's it. Company of Heroes does not provide the player with any fresh real-time strategy scope. This clumsy piece of software also managed to crash multiple times during the final mission.\n\nCompany of Heroes is okay.","March 20, 2014","true","19.8"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

But currently there are so many problems with this game and it is sort of ruining the fun in the game and I'll explain them all.\n\n1. The gameplay is extremly unbalanced: Mostly in favor of the axis. The axis tanks can easily counter almost anything that the allies through at them. For all honesty Panzer Elite can be extremly op first of all and the british are not certainly a good balancing factor to help out the allies. Panzer Elite has scout cars almost within minutes of starting the game and they can capture points and wipe out squads of engineers easily trying to capture them. They also extremly OP artillery based tanks which can easily be manuevered while the allies do not have manueverable aritillery which and unbalances the game even more. Second some infantry notes the Knights Cross holders are THREE MEN and are capable of wiping out 2 or even 3 squads easily. Their health is too high for infantry units and they are impossible to stop when they are in a cluster of 20-30. In fact I find it easier in some cases to take out axis tanks as allies then knights cross holders. Point is they are too OP and the allies do not even have any infantry troops to successfully counter them. Second a problem with both sides is that snipers are so OP. They uncover themselves and can easily go back into hiding after shooting. In all honesty, the camoflague feature should be wiped out and maybe instead of an extremly long range of site in that snipers could hide in the fog of war but become visible when shooting which would add to realism and help balance for the fact that snipers can camp inside a base and just keep on firing aritillery at the enemy base without even coming out of sight.\nBut to some up you almost start to forget that the Allies won World War 2 for the fact that the Germans always win matches and destroy the ally armies so easily.\n\n2. The community isn't that great anymore. The old veteran players are running the show and pretty much taking up all the axis slots and dominating with the OP armies. In fact you can barely pull any wins as the allies anymore unless the axis players are noobs which is extremly rare. Also the veteran players don't even want to play with noobs and you will probably get kicked out of the game or moved to allies and called a noob just because you won 4 out 39 matches as allies. Its like sort of the community is redefining the word all together in that a noob is just someone who sucks instead of someone who is new to the game.\n\nAlso to note I did not buy this game off steam and in fact i had it pretty much since it came out. It transfered to the steam version and it says I have 2 versions of the game for some reason a (New Steam Version and Regular). I have 42 hours on record for the (New Steam Version) and probably over 100 before I added it on steam. I know this game extremly well and love it but this review is out of complete honesty that this game has turned awful.","March 13, 2015","false","2.7"," 13 of 33 people (39%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","39","13","33","2","0"

Disable all mods (although they fixed it... sorta), and 2. had to transition to an old update to successfully transition the game's servers. This update was pretty broken, it crashed, it bugged, it pretty much did everything but WORK CORRECTLY. They did fix it... sorta. I'm rating it a negative because the crap they broke in the beginning of the transition hasnt really been fixed well, and there's only been... what 2 or 3 updates to this? That's kind of sad. But I guess they want to divert more (and by more i mean pretty much everyone) to CoH 2, which I hear isnt even that great to begin with.

The worst element however is the difficulty in both connecting and maintaining connection online and the number of glitches in even Player vs. Computer matches are substantial. The last problem is that the Steam version does not accept Mods which takes a great deal away from my overall enjoyment of the game and removes any ability to correct the balancing issues in the game.\n\nThe game itself was originally 10/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/black_wolf301/recommended/4560/","black_wolf301","Squirrel Salesman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/black_wolf301/","88 products in account","Allies are just a lot easier to play. My stats with brits are 1.6 Americans are something like 1.2 which is nothing to boast about but I almost got on the leaderboards for brit 1v1. While my wehr stats are 0.75. My 1v1 stats are all positive as every faction though, although, not by much when I play as Germans. Games as allies don't seem very stressful compared to games where I play as axis, I feel like I'm holding on by the skin of my teeth for the entire match. Maybe I'm a noob but staghounds and brens just aren't fun to play against. Calliopes destroy everything, allied war machine makes sure that you never take any real losses when you launch an attack. Canister shots with stuarts are just plain ridiculous. 75 munitions for an instant squad wipe I put 150 munitions into for an anti tank squad? What about lieutennant arty? absolutely no time to react to the first shell that decimates blobs. I'm sure you're thinking "don't blob up then". Just think about that for 1 second mr. brit blob. I feel like a bad player everytime I use those things because it doesn't require any skill.\n\nGrenades nullify mg's which is really the only advantage wehr gets early game, that being said mg's are a lot harder to use than rifles because they can be flanked fairly easily and you're forced to retreat them otherwise you're just giving your opponent the means to defeat you. Don't even bother using the wehr grenade though. You'll never get the mg clearing properties that the americans have. Another thing I hate about americans: WHY ARE CALLIOPES SO TOUGH? They have the armour of a sherman and they're an artillery unit. Back in the day I heard they had a turret too. Nothing but stupid in my opinion. Even if you do get a kill, its likely, they just used allied war machine anyway and they're about to fire another round of rockets on your army from the fresh calliope you just gave them.\n\nWhat I really have a problem with is that allies require so much less thought than what you would need as a wehr player.  Rifles are literally the answer to everything. infantry? Rifles. MGs? Rifles. Panthers? Rifles. When I use my panthers, I'm more scared of rifles than I am of almost anything else. Besides, panthers come out so late in the game, you should have 3 m10s waiting for it already. I see players with really good stats and all they do is para-snipe spam. In other words, they just make 2 units for the majority of the game. I've won like that before and I feel disgusted with myself. Although force retreat works well against that so potientally there is a counter to that if you choose terror as your doctrine. Honestly, what they should do is make reinforcing on the battle field more expensive than reinforcing in your base. Because that just means that the axis player might get a little bit of a rest from the endless assault.\n\nHonestly with all of that being said, I still think 1v1s are still pretty balanced for vanilla armies. Team games on the other hand, don't seem balanced to me. Brits can just set up halfway across the map and suddenly you're fighting to hold 25% of the map as the german player. The Brits weakness is that they're slow but an american player fills that gap. I used to think axis where OP simply because I used to be an allied player. As soon as I started playing wehr, my attitude completely changed. No matter how hard I try, I simply can't get good as axis.","August 10, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 of 11 people (9%) found this review helpful","9","1","11","0","0"

Which results in 2 minutes of missing one soldier.\nI miss the direct control over units, cause they REALLY like to put their backs toward enemies.\nI don't get the point why the enemy keeps getting Stugs and Pz, while all I can do is set up mines which takes forever,\nresulting in leaving me defenseless.\nI have no idea why units can't throw multiple grenades (must wait 5 seconds), and why are they infinite.\nUnits cannot run for their lives when pinned but throw themselves right into enemy fire. Like it would save them.\nIn general the game is hard to understand because it isn't made in a way anyone could easily understand.\nSoldiers are really a general "thing" without different weapons.\nI am not sure if they can take a couple of hits or are this bad at aiming.\n\nWHAT I DID LIKE:\nThe cinematics, they remind me of Band Of Brothers a little, are well made and makes you kind of bond with the NPC soldiers.\nLoved the TF2/AoE2 reference hitting things makes other things.\n\nI wouldn't reccomend this game for anyone new to strategy games, nor a veteran who has many more better games.","December 26, 2015","false","3.7"," 1 of 11 people (9%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","9","1","11","0","0"

Very enjoyable, realistic and logical mechanics to the game. The aim is similiar to DoW; capture and hold strategic points to benefit your outcome to the game.

It provides an immersive WWII combat system allowing players to use the environment to their advantage while forcing them to act quickly to major assaults. The game graphics and mechanics are very realistic and utilize an impressive physics engine coupled with a decent unit balancing. The only problem with Company of Heroes is its extreme unfriendliness to those unacquainted with micromanaging. There are no control customization and the lack of unit AI options can cause them to frequently perform idiotic actions such as running out of cover to engage slightly out of range targets or the inability of deployed units to turn themselves around when attacked from the rear.","December 13, 2014","true","18.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Instead of just sitting back and researching and fortifying while hoarding resources as you can do in other Strategy games, Company of Heroes requires you to constantly push the line forward in order to keep control of your territory and its resource points. Dawn of War II players, please note that this is the same engine and gameplay style, so it doesn't take long to get used to. However, it does feature quite a lot more than DoW II, in that you can build base structures, further customise the loadouts of squads and use special abilities without the need for a Commander unit.

Its wonderful, brilliants, fantastic and infuriating all at once!\n\nThe ammount of damage to the environment that can be done is awesome, the damage mechanics are some of the best I've ever seen! You get a tank to shoot a building from the back and the back wall will fall apart, shoot it from the front and the front all will fall, its really that detailed.\n\nThe thing is, the game is HUGELY unfair, the AI has what I call "The all-seeing A-eye" Its annoyingly accurate at throwing its units at points that you hav no defences and missing all of your defences. and if you use a long range artillary strike the enemy units will 9 out of 10 times move from that area. But that doesnt mean this game is bad, it just means its annoyingly difficult.\n\nOh and dont try to cheat - The one time I simply had to turn off the game was because I built tank traps spanning the width of the map and the AI - instead of shooting them apart - drove through them, It was horrible to see but I guess if you cheat the AI will cheat back.","April 26, 2014","true","23.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It provides an immersive WWII combat system allowing players to use the environment to their advantage while forcing them to act quickly to major assaults. The game graphics and mechanics are very realistic and utilize an impressive physics engine coupled with a decent unit balancing. The only problem with Company of Heroes is its extreme unfriendliness to those unacquainted with micromanaging. There are no control customization and the lack of unit AI options can cause them to frequently perform idiotic actions such as running out of cover to engage slightly out of range targets or the inability of deployed units to turn themselves around when attacked from the rear.","December 13, 2014","true","18.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But there's base-building, which is almost always a poor contrivance of a game mechanic, and in this case it's pretty clunky. If it was just straight up squad-based RTS, this game would get an A from me. But the base-building just slows down the game. Hopefully the sequel will do away with that.\n\nStill a very fun game.

Definitely not worth the normal fifty. I wanted a new WW2 theme game and they were all out of good FPS games so I went for RTS instead. This doesn't disappoint. Excellent music and sounds, destructible environment physics, and intuitive interface--but that's about it for praise. The voice acting is cliché to the point it'd be better suited as a comedy, not a Brothers in Arms -style drama. The AI opponents are cheating ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, and multiplayer is buggier than a rural Texan motel. Speaking of bugs, there's a nice memory leak going on. Also, the RelicOnline DRM is a tad annoying, and far more than a tad when it erroneously tells you your account is in use. Other than that... worth ten bucks for the complete pack. Don't waste your money getting only a small part of the game for the same price.","May 15, 2012","true","28.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even years after release this is still one of the best RTS games I have ever played. The combat is intense (especially with headphones turned way up) and the calm before the storm can be invigorating. The ability to build your own defenses at strategic points makes me want to replay each level to get it perfect. The multiplayer is fun, although don't plan on playing it often as servers can hard to find. Luckily the skirmish mode is a lot of fun with AI allies. I would recommend this to any RTS fans who haven't been burnt out on the WWII genre.\n\nRead more of my reviews @ www.thetechthrowdown.com","December 4, 2010","true","48.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
