Did you ever wish that you could have that very game wrapped up in a semi pointless 3D world you could navigate by clicking on someone's name to instantly teleport to them instead of walking all that distance? Did you ever wish that you could do all that and get to utilize those elite twitch shooter skills you gained through endless hours of Quake III Arena while all of your friends left you behind to obtain quality educations, well-paying jobs and loving spouses?\n\nI know I did!\n\nSo when I came across Space Trader: Merchant Marine I knew I'd found the game for me. Marvel at the 2004 era graphics in a game that came out in 2008! (Same year as that housing market crash, I smell the NWO behind this) Throw your hands to the sky when you first break the 7-figure ceiling just by virtue of buying things when they're crashing hard because it's bound to bounce back in the next 48 hours!\n\nWeep when you realize your job is terrible, you're lucky if you have thee figures in the bank and rent is coming due, the Illuminati forced the bank to foreclose on your house four years ago, (BECAUSE YOU KNOW TOO MUCH, DAMN IT!) and you aren't actually flitting between the stars flogging over priced Bananabis at every starport between Earth and Cygnus, you're sitting at your computer waiting to die.\n\n9.5/10 it's okay from a gameplay persepctive.\n\n1/10 for being a front for the Bilderberg group and secretly manipulating the masses, you foolish sheep.","December 24, 2013","true","5.4"," 422 of 474 people (89%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","89","422","474","40","18"

You mostly trade stuff and try to make as much profit as possible in a predifined timelimit. Trading side is like playing the old drug wars but it has some extra quests dialogs and events added.\n\nOn top of that there are bounties you can collect which take you to combat mode. If you catch the target, it's just more money. Additionally you will occationally get boarded by officials who try to make you pay taxes. If you are greedy, you will try and fight em, which will make the game even more interesting. Hard Stakes =) While the basic game is easy, the challenges can feel ridicilously hard giving something extra to the game.\n\nIf you are looking for something special you will definitely be disappointed, but I found it to be a fun and easy going game.","December 21, 2013","true","13.7"," 74 of 82 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","74","82","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sensanaty/recommended/11240/","sensanaty","Sensanaty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sensanaty/","114 products in account","Honestly, the game completely lacks any and all substance. It's bland, forgettable, boring and tedious.\n\nIn the game, you play as an unnamed adventurer/trader, that sets forth to do one thing, become the Master Trader of the known universe/galaxy. One of the first missions is to find some chick that will give you a million credits on loan in order for you to buy a ship and start trading. You have a deadline when to get the million credits needed, and this formula repeats itself several times throughout the game, so much so that even the multiplayer is basically only that. Oh, and no one plays the multiplayer. In order to GET the million credits, you have to buy some commodities on Earth, and go to the Moon (which is just clicking a button) and selling your merchandise. Or you can do contracts. More on that later.\n\nThe trading system is very simple. You get to one of the merchants, you see the commodities they have for sale, and you buy it. There is a bar graph showcasing whether the market price for the item is declining or not, however the graph is pretty much nonsense, seeing as there's no trend whatsoever, and seems to be entirely, 100% random. To add to that, the trading is a pretty pathetic source of income, as even if you get lucky, you won't really earn a huge profit on anything you sell.\n\nYou can also find random commodities strewn throughout the worlds you find yourself, so there's no real reason to actually BUY commodities, as you'll find some semi-valuable stuff just laying on the floor in the map, free for the taking. Items range from wool to fetuses and radioactive metals and whatnot, and the "illegal" stuff is more valuable than the legitimate trading commodities. The game doesn't punish you for owning or selling illegal commodities, which was a wasted opportunity for some amusing gameplay as an actual smuggler. Shame.\n\nThe second source of money is through doing contracts or helping people out with arduous tasks. To get a contract, you have to go to the bar, where the barman will give you a target which you have to kill. This is where the game gets a slight instance of gameplay, by introducing an FPS arena, however, this falls flat as well, because the gunplay is so barebones it physically hurts to play through the FPS stages. The missions where you help people out aren't much better, as the case often is that you're simply collecting or buying X commodity and bringing it to some random dude or chick. Again, incredibly tedious.\n\nAlso, the game came out 2008 if I'm not wrong. I originally thought it came out around 1999, when Freelancer came out, but holy ♥♥♥♥ 2008????????????????????????????????\n\nThe music is obnoxious and not memorable in any way (read: elevator music), it features abysmal graphics, the little mechanics the game has are horribly unrefined, the economic system is non functioning, trading is next to useless unless you get some very rare, expensive commodities from missions, and the entire game feels like a chore.\n\nOverall, I'd give it a 3/10, would not recommend unless you have literally nothing else to do in your life.","July 1, 2014","false","3.5"," 96 of 119 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","96","119","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/an0malies/recommended/11240/","an0malies","An0malies","http://steamcommunity.com/id/an0malies/","77 products in account","Space Trader Merchant Marine was released in Oct 23, 2008. It boasts a score of 89% from a review by GameFocus saying, ""One of the best indie games of 2008. An innovative and addictive experience. Addictive, very fun and innovative are the best words to describe the game and the bottom line is this is a welcome addition to any gamer's library so buy this game and enjoy it."\n\nThis is very akin to the how 'reviews' reflected Bubsy 3D on its own packaging, to those that remember.\n\nThe game is broken down into four different areas, exploration, trading, time management, and fighting/bounty hunting.\n\nThe exploration is very limited, your only goal being to find crates of goods floating about, merchants, and the bar keep. The problem is that once you've gone through it once, you know where it all is, no variation, same boring bland walls, ect., and it honestly starts to feel like a chore.\n\nThe time management is very simple. Go to X location from y location = z time spent. You have a set amount of time in every 'chapter' to complete a set $$$ quota. Besides the time spent traveling through the travel menu, any time spent at a location does not diminish the time that you have left. And as thus, does not really give you any time pressure.\n\nThe trading is a joke, as, all you do it buy what's not doing well, and travel, and get guaranteed profit. It hardly reflects actual market value in the real world and makes the game largely unchallenging.\n\nThe fighting/bounty hunting is terribly bland and cycles through the same maps. Stupid AI, overpowered guns, and cheap kills, makes it horrid.\n\nNow, all that said, this was made in 2008, 2-0-0-8, to be sure. Other games that were made in this period were:\n\nFable 2\nFallout 3\nLittleBIGPlanet\nRock Band 2\nGears Of War 2\nSpore\nGrand Theft Auto IV\nNo More Heroes\nLeft 4 Dead\nProfessor Layton & The Curious Village\n\nCompared to that list, the time period the game was released, and actual content in the game... it makes it look mediocre, a joke, something that belongs in a 2000 release.","August 12, 2014","false","21.3"," 32 of 39 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","32","39","2","7"

Space Trader doesn't quite hit that special recipe however.\n\nSpace Trader is a combination of a numbers trading simulator and a first person shooter and by far and large the biggest problem is that playing the game you have trouble telling which of these two aspects feel the most tacked on.\n\nThe trading part of the game is simple enough. You travel between various planets in the solar system, each planet has a a few merchants each selling a few goods. You buy as much as your bank account and cargo space will allow and then travel to the next world. Space Trader has no real in game economy however and everything is decided by the almighty Random Number Generator. The challenge of choosing which products to buy is virtually non-existent as all items for sale lists how below normal market value they are next to their name. There is also a legal/non-legal system in place however it has no real effect in game making the actual buying and selling of products extremely dull and predictable.\n\nYou explore the various locations on foot, in a first person shooter aspect. The various trade hubs allow you run around a small area, collecting various sellable items littered about the place, trade with the local merchants and take on a number of missions. The missions mostly come down to "Bring X items", "Transport X items" or, the more common, shooter mission. The majority of the missions in the game, and perhaps one of the easiest ways to make money early on in the campaigns is the various bounty missions which are your basic FPS. You spawn in one of a few predetermined maps, kill a few henchmen and eventually a boss will spawn. All the while you can pick up loot that you can sell out in the proper game, and weapons, health and shields that'll help you on this mission only. The shooting is fairly poorly implemented, even for it's time. The weapons feel like pellet guns, the enemy AI is non-existent and the whole experience usually boils down to just sniping at enemies from around a corner.\n\nThe music throughout the game is a high speed techno beat that, while I am sure some of you will love it, made me play with the sound off after a few sessions. There is no voice-acting and very little ambiance. Even gun shots and hit sounds leave much to be desired. Graphically the game is nothing to write home about but not much below what you would expect from an indie title either.\n\nAll in all, Space Trader Merchant Marine is a game that tries to do two things and fails at doing either in an acceptable fashion. It's not a very good trading simulation and not a very good shooter. It doesn't sound or look very good and it doesn't feel very good. This is a game that can easily be skipped.","May 24, 2013","false","82.7"," 28 of 35 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","28","35","0","1"

While I admit that I enjoy playing it, there is a ridiculously unfair difficulty spike during the FPS missions. Basically, anytime you have to go kill someone, you get tossed into this terrible FPS minigame where the guns are crap, your controls are crap, and the AI is beyond unfair.\n\nWorst of all, if you fail an important FPS mission, you have to travel to another planet, then return to the previous planet to attempt the mission again, thus wasting a lot of time (the game uses time units to create an artificial challenge). I don't have a problem with that, except in the third chapter you are forced to make $20,000,000 for this woman who put a bomb on your ship. After you make the $20,000,000 you get an option to kill her instead. If you fail at killing her you have to travel away to reset the mission. But what happened to me is when I traveled away I ended up running out of time and failed the entire chapter.\n\nThe reason I kept failing to kill her is because she is unfairly strong (combined with the crappy FPS gameplay and unfair AI). But what I don't understand is that the game plays off your failure as though you actually failed, and not as though it's just resetting you back before you attempted the mission. So why doesn't she just blow up your ship? If your failure happens in real time then she should be aware that you're trying to kill her and it would make sense for her to just blow up your ship and kill you - except she doesn't. But the time factor still remains and you can still lose by running out of time (remember the time limit was for you to make $20,000,000 for the woman you're now trying to kill).\n\nI don't know, maybe it's because I'm fresh off a rage quit, but the unfair FPS gameplay and unfair use of the time restrictions really ♥♥♥♥ me off.

The premise of the game is simple: you are a new trader trying to find your way in this business and since you don't own a ship yet you need to find someone who is willing to give you one. What follows is a simple story and you will see the little twists coming from miles away, but even with that in mind, the missing excitement of what's going to happen next isn't the thing that will keep you around. The campaign has only five chapters and once you understand the mechanics of the game you will have no problem making millions from trading food stamps, oil or even organs. This game simulates the stocks trades perfectly, following the same: buy low, sell high premise, and even though at first it may be hard to figure out how to make all those millions, once you get the idea, it will be only profit for you from that point on. There's no real reward for doing this except the fact that once you reach a goal you will advance to the next chapter and start all over, trading between different planets, but that little sense of advancement is what will keep you playing.\nRating: 5.5\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay in Space Trader is pretty straight forward: you start on a planet and you have to buy commodities that will bring a profit and travel to another planet to sell them at a higher price, keeping a constant watch on the time limit that each mission has, calculating the profit per shipment and the travel time in order to choose the best option. Finding good deals is easy since those always have a gold star indicating that you should buy them, so eventually it becomes just a matter of having enough money in your pocket or enough cargo space, and your only enemy becomes the time as you carefully have to choose where to sell the stuff you just bought. You can make money by taking bounty missions from bartenders or by completing small tasks for different people, so it's always a good idea to talk with everybody because you might find out some interesting things or take on some missions that will give you some extra cash. The shooting mechanic feels old, but that's probably why it feels so addictive at the same time, as you will most likely instantly connect the dots between those shooting sequences and games like Doom, and even though all those bounty missions will get boring pretty soon as each map looks and feels the same and there are only two to three different types of enemies plus the target that you're supposed to assassinate, it is a good distraction from the boring buy and sell mechanic that the game generally delivers.\nRating: 6\n\nGraphics\nIf you look at this game you will assume it was released in the early 2000's because it looks like it was made a generation ago; from the simple and stiff characters to the environments everything looks pretty bad and the repetitive level design doesn't help either. By the end of the game you will know every corner of each planet, you will start to love a certain section for how easy it is to complete a combat mission and you will hate another for how difficult it is.\nRating: 5\n\nAudio\nThe sound in this game ain't exactly bad, but it's simply mediocre at best. The voice acting is horrible, but the soundtrack manages to save it sometimes, especially in the heat of a battle, but otherwise there is nothing that stands out, it simply gets boring as you will end up ignoring the other characters or laugh at how bad they sound no matter the serious, story essential thing they just said. There are intentional comic lines too, such as the robot that answers by saying WTF, but those only make the entire thing feel worse, as the game is undecided between trying to be serious and making fun of itself.\nRating: 5\n\nExtras\nAfter completing the main campaign you can also try the challenge mode that offers three extra missions that are pretty easy to complete and the only real challenge comes when you try to get the achievements, and if you're into that the game can get interesting and it has even some decent replay value as you can spend up to 18 hours struggling to complete everything. It's also supposed to have a multiplayer mode, which puts you and a friend in a race to get the most cash from those challenge missions, but after an hour of banging my head against the wall I couldn't figure out a way of making it work.\nRating: 5\n\nVerdict\nWhen a game is getting such a low score no one would actually recommend buying it, but in this case I'll make an exception: you should give it a try if it's on sale and you can get it for less than an euro, as for that amount of money it will keep you busy more than enough to justify the purchase. It is in no way a great game, one that you will remember after leaving it aside, but as long as you play it you will be entertained simply because it's so stupid it becomes like a good parody.\nRating Overall: 5.3","May 29, 2014","true","1.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Your only restriction to making money is finding the best profit margin, and the size of your cargo hold (& working capital).\n\n...but hey; you don't even really need to worry about trading to get up these thinly-justified goals for earning - a) you can usually find piles of items just sitting in nooks and corners on the trading hub maps, which you can then sell to collectors for a decent starting stake, b) you can also pick up a considerable amount of cash from doing the bounty (aka FPS) missions - not always from the up-front wages of that, but from looting commodities from the 'hideout' of whatever low-life you're supposed to assassinate.\n\n2) As others have said, the FPS is similarly unchallenging - the maps are limited in quantity and variety, the 'power ups' are uninspired (and ephemeral), and the opposing AI is laughable, resulting in no point in any gameplay strategy apart from sneaking quickly to a good vantage point and then sniping everyone just aimlessly standing around.\n\nAs such, you have two poor component-games, that barely feel like they should even belong together; the overall story is threadbare and challenges even the most credulous willing suspension of disbelief.\n\nNormally, I have very low standards to play a game (gfx, music, v/o, story, etc.) but this game managed to sink below even those unchallenging requirements.\n\nDo not even bother with this on a steam sale - the ONLY reasonable justification I could say for buying this game would be to bump up your XP from sheer quantity of game-ownership, and even then, a heavy discount would be necessary.\n\n...but even so, I would under NO account EVER suggest you PLAY this 'game'...","August 26, 2013","false","6.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Unfortunately there aren't that many things to buy and sell, but nevertheless the concept of trading and traveling between space stations is quite well implemented and works. This part is relatively easy, and once you get the hang of the game you'll see the numbers in your bank account grow exponentially. If you need some extra cash you can try your hand at bountyhunting, which teleports you to one of a series of FPS arenas where you get to shoot people. Very basic but enjoyable while it lasts.\n\nThe biggest annoyance I found in this game is the lack of a sandbox / open-ended mode. The game is divided up into missions, guiding you through the stages of development for your very own space trading enterprise, but after each mission you basically start over.\n\nOther than that, this game is a lot of fun to play and although it won't be able to keep your attention forever (it can get a bit repetitive over time) it is a fun little game and a great timekiller if you have nothing to do for a couple of hours. The price is already fairly low, and if you can get this game in a sale like I did you basically just can't go wrong.","February 15, 2014","true","6.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/recommended/11240/","gdnighthawk","Nighthawk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/","206 products in account","Presentation\nSteam Sales are always a great way to buy more games than you'll ever be able to play, but between all the big purchases you will often find some random games to keep you busy when there's nothing else; Space Trader: Merchant Marine is exactly that kind of game, but unlike most small, indie games this one managed somehow to keep me around more than it should have, just because at its core, it's an addictive experience. The premise of the game is simple: you are a new trader trying to find your way in this business and since you don't own a ship yet you need to find someone who is willing to give you one. What follows is a simple story and you will see the little twists coming from miles away, but even with that in mind, the missing excitement of what's going to happen next isn't the thing that will keep you around. The campaign has only five chapters and once you understand the mechanics of the game you will have no problem making millions from trading food stamps, oil or even organs. This game simulates the stocks trades perfectly, following the same: buy low, sell high premise, and even though at first it may be hard to figure out how to make all those millions, once you get the idea, it will be only profit for you from that point on. There's no real reward for doing this except the fact that once you reach a goal you will advance to the next chapter and start all over, trading between different planets, but that little sense of advancement is what will keep you playing.\nRating: 5.5\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay in Space Trader is pretty straight forward: you start on a planet and you have to buy commodities that will bring a profit and travel to another planet to sell them at a higher price, keeping a constant watch on the time limit that each mission has, calculating the profit per shipment and the travel time in order to choose the best option. Finding good deals is easy since those always have a gold star indicating that you should buy them, so eventually it becomes just a matter of having enough money in your pocket or enough cargo space, and your only enemy becomes the time as you carefully have to choose where to sell the stuff you just bought. You can make money by taking bounty missions from bartenders or by completing small tasks for different people, so it's always a good idea to talk with everybody because you might find out some interesting things or take on some missions that will give you some extra cash. The shooting mechanic feels old, but that's probably why it feels so addictive at the same time, as you will most likely instantly connect the dots between those shooting sequences and games like Doom, and even though all those bounty missions will get boring pretty soon as each map looks and feels the same and there are only two to three different types of enemies plus the target that you're supposed to assassinate, it is a good distraction from the boring buy and sell mechanic that the game generally delivers.\nRating: 6\n\nGraphics\nIf you look at this game you will assume it was released in the early 2000's because it looks like it was made a generation ago; from the simple and stiff characters to the environments everything looks pretty bad and the repetitive level design doesn't help either. By the end of the game you will know every corner of each planet, you will start to love a certain section for how easy it is to complete a combat mission and you will hate another for how difficult it is.\nRating: 5\n\nAudio\nThe sound in this game ain't exactly bad, but it's simply mediocre at best. The voice acting is horrible, but the soundtrack manages to save it sometimes, especially in the heat of a battle, but otherwise there is nothing that stands out, it simply gets boring as you will end up ignoring the other characters or laugh at how bad they sound no matter the serious, story essential thing they just said. There are intentional comic lines too, such as the robot that answers by saying WTF, but those only make the entire thing feel worse, as the game is undecided between trying to be serious and making fun of itself.\nRating: 5\n\nExtras\nAfter completing the main campaign you can also try the challenge mode that offers three extra missions that are pretty easy to complete and the only real challenge comes when you try to get the achievements, and if you're into that the game can get interesting and it has even some decent replay value as you can spend up to 18 hours struggling to complete everything. It's also supposed to have a multiplayer mode, which puts you and a friend in a race to get the most cash from those challenge missions, but after an hour of banging my head against the wall I couldn't figure out a way of making it work.\nRating: 5\n\nVerdict\nWhen a game is getting such a low score no one would actually recommend buying it, but in this case I'll make an exception: you should give it a try if it's on sale and you can get it for less than an euro, as for that amount of money it will keep you busy more than enough to justify the purchase. It is in no way a great game, one that you will remember after leaving it aside, but as long as you play it you will be entertained simply because it's so stupid it becomes like a good parody.\nRating Overall: 5.3\n\nCheck the full review and a lot more about Space Trader: Merchant Marine at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=233","March 9, 2014","true","15.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It sounds really boring but it's pretty easy and simple, buy low and sell high, there are stars next to amazing selling opportunities so it isn't super difficult.\n\nSo you buy and sell stuff to earn enough money to pay off debts, you can also earn money through hunting down bounties.\n\nThis is the coolest part of the game, you get to go into a Quake 3 Arena style FPS where you kill goons and lackeys until the bounty appears and you have to shoot him down, you have to pick up better weapons, health, shields, and sellable materials in this mode, it's a simple arena style FPS, but it's still fun.\n\nThis game is an alright budget indie experience, it is not worth $5.00, but for $0.50 it's fun enough that I would reccomend it.","February 16, 2014","true","1.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It grips you from the first moment when you are left beaten and bloodied in a back alley of a traders asteroid to the climatic battle between you and the shadown orgnization that holds your family captive. Graphics are very detailed and immersive, with dx11 really shining here. Be prepared to have a powerfull system though, an i7 chipset with 6g ddr3 can barely handle this powerhorse. Sound is crisp with realistic detail coming though in every action you take, from the smallest rustle of papers on a desk to awe inspiring explosions ripping a frieghter hull apart.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you want a game with endless replayability, insane customization, rpg style progression, an advanced ai that will have you cursing your screen and The best damn campaign probably eve, then give Stmm a try.","December 18, 2010","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The controls are clunky, the weapons barely do anything at all to your enemies, the enemies to way too much damage to you, and unless you grind up to 1000 shields, you won't last ten seconds in the combat segments. The HUD isn't well thought-out either, using numbers instead of bars or icons for your health and shields, forcing you to take a crucial moment to read out your health and shields while the grunts pound them away. The graphics aren't appealing, either. The characters look only semi-realistic, fitting into the "Uncanny Valley" making them look actually really creepy, and the world models are too blocky and low-res to be serious-looking. The story just feels like an excuse plot, too. This game is definitely NOT worth the $4.99 normal price. If anything, 50 cents feels just about right for the little time and effort that was put into this game. Seriously, there must have been NO playtesting at all on this. The only thing I do like is the trading, and even then it's not enough to save this game. 2/10.","May 4, 2014","false","1.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/puppychow/recommended/11240/","puppychow","puppychow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/puppychow/","1093 products in account","Space Trader: Merchant Marine is a bipolar game.  On the one hand, it tries to capture gamer interest as a commodities trading game, where you would buy and sell different commodities seeking to make a profit.  Yet, the game developers seem to realize the major flaw with this game--it gets boring quickly.  So they made a hackneyed attempt to spruce it up by adding a bulky, vastly inferior First Person Shooter component with graphics that are reminiscent of Doom.  I think the developers should have focused solely on the trading aspect, because consumers do realize the commodity trading simulation is the major draw of this game, and certainly not the FPS aspect.\n\nHow would I improve the commodity trading aspect?  I would offer unlockable merchants when certain conditions are met (i.e. a million dollars worth of legit inventory, or x number of cargo holds added to your ship), or create another category of goods.  What about the trader's personal reputation? What if the trader's reputation changes over time, as he deals in certain types of goods, and that influences pricing of wares from the NPC merchants?  These are some simple ways to spice up the trading simulation, and I'm sure the game developers could implement these additions quite easily.\n\nAs it stands now, the game will capture your interest only until you get bored and tired of the commodity trading aspect.  How long will depend on personal tastes.","April 6, 2014","false","2.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

They won't even attack you 90% of the time you're on a different floor, so snipe away with the assault rifle and you automatically win. You have limited time to reach the campaign's money goal (money disappears after chapter), and time passes depending on the distance you travel.

I wasn't disappointed! Have you ever heard of that movie The Room? It's supposed to be the Citizen Cane of bad films. Well if that's true, Space Trader is the Mass Effect 2 of terrible space games.\n\nIt's hard to even describe exactly what makes this game so bad. Some games are so buggy or broken or just unplayable that they accumulate terrible reviews. Not Space Trader, it works totally fine! I couldn't find a single bug. Its problem is just a complete lack of ambition at every level. Everything about it is just earnest, straightforward and completely incompetent. It's almost like it wasn't made by a person at all but by an outside observer of the human condition - someone who just fundamentally misunderstands why humans enjoy things. Like, I don't know, a Martian or a hyper-intelligent dog or a robot from an 80's movie.\n\nThe main mechanic of the game is an arbitrage simulator, kind of like Drug Wars - you know, that game for the TI82 graphing calculator that you could play in math class without getting in trouble? The main difference is that in Space Trader, it's pretty much on autopilot since the game marks the good deals for you. Also it's not about drugs, it's about such exciting futuristic commodities as "Manufactured Goods" and "Copper Ore."\n\nThe combat mechanic is even worse. It's floaty and unreal, like trying to go back and play an old sprite based shooter from 1993. True this isn't a brand new game, but it is from 2008. That's the year Bioshock came out. Think about that for a second. Space Trader's gameplay was out of date by over a decade even back then.\n\nI think my favorite ridiculous detail about the game is in the dialogue. They got the perspective wrong, so when you're talking to the lumpy NPCs, you seem to be at about their nipple level. Sometimes... lower.\n\nIf you have two quarters burning a hole in your pocket and you want to see just how bad this game is, give it a shot. On the other hand, you could just use the quarters to do your laundry instead. The Room is available on Netflix if you need something awful to watch while you fold.","August 27, 2014","false","2.1"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","6","11","2","1"

The game is graphically inferior and at time, even comedic to the point of leaving your PC because a character looks so much like a potato you can't stop laughing. The voice acting is hilariously bad, especially the mechanic which comes into the game later in the plot (what 'ave you broken today). However bad some of the features in this game are, it does offer a unique and addictive experience in terms of game play. Buy low, sell high. This is what you need to remember as a merchant marine, although it's never usually so simple, buying any item is a risk to your bank account, a gamble even. But the payoff for a successful trade is extremely satisfying considering it's just words on the screen. Besides the addictive and risky trading, some NPC's will offer side quests in the form of assassinations for the most part. These will play out like a good old match of Quake 3 Arena, with fast paced combat, futuristic weapons and contained, yet large areas. Power ups and shields lay around the arena for the player to pick up and any enemy can be a serious threat if not taken care of quickly. In short, this game is a fun little title, worth your time, and considering how often it is on special for under $1, there's no real reason for you to not own it.","April 30, 2014","true","1.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Let me tell you that this game does not involve space in the slightest. The screenshots give you an extremely misleading view on the game, I read all the negative reviews, but i thought it just looked like plain classic awesomeness.\n\nI was really dissapointed.\n\nThe only goal in this game is to sell random things. The stock market doesn't even make sense in this game either, the graphs show the possible profit, but they aren't even real, they're just there to make it look a bit cooler. I got this game for 40p, I think, and I feel as if I wasted way to much money on this. It does involve some shooter parts, but these are as bland as the trading itself. The guns you are provided with have no ability to upgrade, and you have no choice as to what gun you get. It's like a really, really, really bad Quake 3 Arena.\n\nJust don't get it. Do yourself a favour and go buy a bar of chocolate or something.","June 20, 2014","false","1.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","4"

The idea of growth and becoming a better and more important trader should have carried, but because of the artificial reset, fell very flat. I stopped playing the campaign after seeing my progression removed for no reason.\n\nAnd the free for all mode is lacking: from what I can tell, there is a mode that is basically unlimited time and complete freedom, but in order to get it, you have to beat the first challenge which is impossibly difficult.\n\nIf even one of these issues were different, I would consider playing again, as the premise is solid and fun, but the execution here is not worth the time.","March 8, 2015","false","2.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's a nice way to kill time if you like to travel from one planet to another meeting demand with supply and occasionally finding a funny Internet reference or fighting some mean guys with guns.\n\nI had bought it in some bundle with at least half a dozen other games - I feel I payed the right price for it. I don't think I could recommend this game at $5, but I can think of much worse things to spend $5 on.\n\nI beat the final Challenge with ~$65m out of the necessary $25m without over-analyzing things - it's that kind of an "easy game." Don't play it to be challenged or amazed, it's more of a relaxing First Person game.\n\nCouldn't find anyone to play multiplayer with - so I don't know if that makes the game any more challenging.\n\nDon't expect to learn a whole lot about trading from this game unless you've simply never heard of "buy low, sell high" and pay-attention-to-when-the-game-tells-you-something-is-ridiculously-more-valuable-on-another-planet-before-you-get-there. Also, you need to spend money to make money - you won't get rich in this game if you piddle around with the least expensive commodities.\n\nc:\n\nP.S.

The trading element lacks any subtlety or deeper strategy than "buy low, sell high."  The FPS portion is incredibly repetitive with laughable graphics and mechanics.  It's hard to believe this game came out in 2008.  In 2008, you could buy Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and it looks light years better than this.  This game barely compares to games that came out a decade earlier (think Half-Life).

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Ok, let's start with the beginning. I was just about ready to let off the fact that this piece of ♥♥♥♥ game should've been an iOS game all along, yeah, it's THAT complex, but ok, I let that slide, I said, why not give it a chance. And from then on, it NEVER STOPPED DISAPPOINTING! I would need a whole ♥♥♥♥ing book to detail precisely what's wrong with this game, but I'll try to keep it short. You never know what the ♥♥♥♥ are you doing. The game is never clear when it gives you a mission, the "quest log" which is a two line snippet of every mission on the ESCAPE SCREEN is ♥♥♥♥ing laughable at. NO INFORMATION WHAT SO EVER! You don't know where to go to find the person, it just say "HE'S ON THE MOON", well gee, ♥♥♥♥ING THANKS THEN! The "planets" themselves are a ♥♥♥♥ing joke, it's only one level the size of your average living room... And even then you can't find who you're supposed to talk to to finish your damn quest. Logical conclusion, MANY QUESTS ARE BROKEN! The "trading" part of the game, which is it's main gimmick is simple as hell, but guess what, no information there as well, I couldn't figure out what the ♥♥♥♥ the information it gives me on the screen is, and I'm not that dumb in real life, I got a good results diploma every year in high-school, but still, this game is a complete mistery to me. Interwoven along the "trading" part is some random shooting sections thrown out of nowhere, as a result of some "missions" you pick up randomly from strangers... you get insta-teleported to the "mission area" and ista-teleported back when you kill a guy. That's about as deep as the missions go. ALL OF THEM, hit missions, "kill this guy". Gun play is TERRIBLE, enemies bullet spongy as ♥♥♥♥, is basically DOOM with better graphics, let's put it that way. You CAN NOT save them game when you want, it has it's own stupid auto-save at the worst times mechanic, and then when you fail the main chapter mission, IT RESTARTS THE WHOLE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ CHAPTER, god forbit it takes you to the previous auto-save. That was the drop that filled the glass. I lost HOURS of progress because of it's stupid MORONIC saving system. This game is a royal mess. It doesn't know what it wants to be, it tries to be everything, from trading game to RPG to FPS, and it fails miserably at ALL OF THEM! Coupled with a badly constructed game, it makes the whole package a MASSIVE FAIL. DO NOT BUY, under any circumstances, these filths don't deserve a single cent! It's like they tried to make EVERY single bad decision a game developer can while making a game, then after they finished, they released this ♥♥♥♥♥torm!

I searched high and low for the lady to pay her back and couldn't find her.  I did not find any quests to turn in.  The goal is 1.5m and I hit roughly 4m the second time.  I had 2m in cash and 2m in the bank, and it still failed the mission.  The game requires that you play part of it as a FPS.  Normally that doesn't bother me, but being that it is required, you would think they would put a little more time and effort into that part of the game.

I picked it up as a part of the Meridian4 pack when it was on significant discount.\n\nThe story basically isn't there. There are objectives given at the start with poor resolutions at the end of a chapter but no real development. There's intrigue with a corrupt trade police but it doesn't actually go anywhere. While the main character does change over time, he doesn't feel like he's in any better a position at the end than when he starts despite significantly different circumstances.\n\nThe time constrains make pure trading unfeasible, so you're going to be doing a lot of FPS arenas to make your goals with the bountys.\n\nThe only good thing I've seen about this game is in the later stages with Jupiters moons having variable travel time depending on their orbits.

The music during tradeing is a generic loop of boreingness wich makes me tired. The fighting music sound like a motarcycle going off but muffled.

It is mainly a buy/sell stock market type video game of the future. It tries to incorporate first person shooter action as well.\n\nIf you're looking for a market based game where you trade commodities based on their profits, this is your game. There are interesting characters to trade with a quite a bit to do. The voice acting is simply a joke. One of the most annoying sounds I've ever heard in my life occurs when you walk up to civilians and they say "later" or whatever it is. Makes me cringe every time! The tutorial was quite lacking, although I understand there is a fine line between innundating/confusing players with too much detail and letting them actually play the game. It will take you a couple times through to understand the nuances of it.\n\nFor the first person shooter crowd, this is a definite pass. The "run and gun" aspect of this is simply a joke. There are three guns, a starter pistol, a shotgun, and a machine gun. Not exactly a wide selection by any means. When you pick up a new gun, some times the game will automatically switch to it, others it will not. This can be quite frustrating as you can imagine. Another issue is respawning location. You have 3 chances to defeat the bounty. The game randomly drops you off in locations, some times right by a henchmen. After a respawn, you stand very little chance defeating a well equipped good, meaning another chance wasted. The game randomly stops you midstride, which sucks if you're running away from someone who is shooting in your direction. Lastly, perhaps the biggest disappointment of all, there are no upgrades of any sort. You'd expect to improve your skills the more bounties you attempted or completed, but that is not the case. Every time is almost the same, making it quite repetitive.\n\nI'm rating this game as barely passable because I do enjoy playing it, despite its many flaws (mostly on the bounty hunter side).\n","February 14, 2014","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That pretty much sums up my expeirence with this game. You play as a "Space Trader" which is really a bounty hunter with a keen eye for stocks.\n\nPresentation\nThis game is an ugly child. It says 2008 but it looks like early PS2. The sound design is okay nothing really outstanding or really terrible.\n\nStory\nBare-bones at best. You get a ship, pay off your debt, get betrayed, etc. etc. The characters aren't really engaging or interesting and you probably won't remember their names.\n\nGameplay\nThis is where this ugly duckling turns into a regular looking duck. The goal of the game is simple, collect money to pay off your debt. There are three ways to do this: bounty hunt, trade, and do side missions. Bounty Hunting is a personal favorite of mine, you get transported to one of like 5 locations, kill some gaurds and collect the goods, and when your target arrives you kick his/her respective ♥♥♥. While the repeating stages can get annoying it does help you remember where all the items are to get the most profit. Trading is simply selling items to the shops, the twist is the prices rise and fall like stocks which depending on your stash can mean a big payday or patiently waiting for the value to go up. The sidequests can either be more bounty hunting, finding people and talking, or collectng x amount of objects. these can pay very well and give you the occasional options like when these two thugs wanted to poison the water supply you could do it and make some serious bank from selling water, or report them.\n\nReally worth a look and a high point of this bundle.\n\n\n","April 9, 2014","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its a game that you play to get out of debt and make a profit, though that being said all you are going to do is run around with boring missions. Granted the game has decent graphics but lacking in the whole space travel when you basic teleport everywhere leaving really noting to do but lose time. The game also misleads you into thinking something will sell well and when it dose not all the money you made is pretty much lost and you have to start a new game, they also start you out at a debt of  $150,000,000 I think it was. That's just for the ship! You will also get $500 to spend on buying (that's all debt you have to pay back with Interest). This make's it vary hard to progress and be able to act if you decide to sell illegal items in the game (if caught its pretty much game over). There is also a part in the start where you are a hit man and earn cash, though this is pretty much in the Quake/Doom 1 style shooter. Which I don't mind, though it lacked ammo and health which made the guy you needed to kill off OP even when he just set in one area  and you sniped him. So this can be a hard thing to overcome if you wanted something laid back to play.\nIt was a good idea, with vary lacking effort put into it.

That pretty much sums up my expeirence with this game. You play as a "Space Trader" which is really a bounty hunter with a keen eye for stocks.\n\nPresentation\nThis game is an ugly child. It says 2008 but it looks like early PS2. The sound design is okay nothing really outstanding or really terrible.\n\nStory\nBare-bones at best. You get a ship, pay off your debt, get betrayed, etc. etc. The characters aren't really engaging or interesting and you probably won't remember their names.\n\nGameplay\nThis is where this ugly duckling turns into a regular looking duck. The goal of the game is simple, collect money to pay off your debt. There are three ways to do this: bounty hunt, trade, and do side missions. Bounty Hunting is a personal favorite of mine, you get transported to one of like 5 locations, kill some gaurds and collect the goods, and when your target arrives you kick his/her respective ♥♥♥. While the repeating stages can get annoying it does help you remember where all the items are to get the most profit. Trading is simply selling items to the shops, the twist is the prices rise and fall like stocks which depending on your stash can mean a big payday or patiently waiting for the value to go up. The sidequests can either be more bounty hunting, finding people and talking, or collectng x amount of objects. these can pay very well and give you the occasional options like when these two thugs wanted to poison the water supply you could do it and make some serious bank from selling water, or report them.\n\nReally worth a look and a high point of this bundle.\n\n\n","April 9, 2014","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its a game that you play to get out of debt and make a profit, though that being said all you are going to do is run around with boring missions. Granted the game has decent graphics but lacking in the whole space travel when you basic teleport everywhere leaving really noting to do but lose time. The game also misleads you into thinking something will sell well and when it dose not all the money you made is pretty much lost and you have to start a new game, they also start you out at a debt of  $150,000,000 I think it was. That's just for the ship! You will also get $500 to spend on buying (that's all debt you have to pay back with Interest). This make's it vary hard to progress and be able to act if you decide to sell illegal items in the game (if caught its pretty much game over). There is also a part in the start where you are a hit man and earn cash, though this is pretty much in the Quake/Doom 1 style shooter. Which I don't mind, though it lacked ammo and health which made the guy you needed to kill off OP even when he just set in one area  and you sniped him. So this can be a hard thing to overcome if you wanted something laid back to play.\nIt was a good idea, with vary lacking effort put into it. Over all if you want a nice laid back game to play then do not get this, if you don't mind wasting your cash/time and getting angry when losing all the cash you earned by one or two mistake's then by all means buy this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AveryGlendale/recommended/11240/","AveryGlendale","Avery Glendale","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AveryGlendale/","114 products in account","The idea seemed so great - a space trading game in which you fly around the galaxy and occasionally defend yourself from pirates in a first person shooter mode. That's what the description on the store page led me to believe. But after I bought the game, I found that the FPS screenshots are actually bounty hunting missions. Also that the shooting isn't very good. It's generic, cookie cutter, and seems as if it were tacked on as a means to sell the game. Speaking of which, the trading mechanics aren't that great either. I made it through the first few campaigns by buying the same "illicit" goods (which you're never confronted for selling as far as I can tell) and selling them at the Moon over and over. Heck, some flash games on Kongregate pull this general idea off better than this game did.\n\nThe graphics are nothing spectacular to look at, but it's an indie game from 2008, so I can't blame the developers for it, and same goes for the voice acting. The character models don't go as far as to move their mouths at all and the UI in the FPS mode make the Unreal Tournament and (original) Counter-Strike UIs look astoundingly progressive.\n\nIn other words, it isn't very good. It's fun at first, but quickly becomes extremely repetitive and annoying. It's definitely not worth $5, but may be worth the 49 cents if you don't mind having to see it in your Steam library for the rest of time.","April 28, 2014","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
