"YES, hell, YES!"- BUT PLAY IT WITH FRIEND !!!!!\n\nThe stuff i love about this game:\n1) Well, first off it is completely free (everything in it).\n2) It is unique and it tries to be as realistic as possible (unlike l4d for example)\n3) It is unforgiving and yet very enjoyable (every mistake is punished hard but if you are doing well you feel like a boss!)\n4) Brilliant animations (gun fire, reloadings, melee swings, healing animations, pill taking animations, suicide animations, ammo checking animations...)\n5) Music (fits the game perfectly)\n6) Maps (sewers, houses, abandoned churches, large cities, narrow streets, grave yards, bridges  and much more)\n+tons of other great things (kid zombies, realistic guns, weapon varieties, zombie traps in certain maps etc. etc. etc.)\n-------------------------------------------------------\nUnfortunately, here are some cons:\n1) Mentality of the players (sh!ttons of newbies, i mean thousands of them just wasting ammo and resources in wave1, then dying, and disconnecting- repeat)- I STRONGLY RECOMMEND grab a friend or two, show them how to play this game and enjoy it to the bits.\n\n2) Hit detection can let you down....sometimes... (Yeah, the hit detection is weird from time to time.

Zeds ain't joking, you have trouble if you go anywhere than teh head. You'll see some runners here and there but with a good teamwork they can be dispatched real easily without taking a scratch. There are also child zombies, taking them down is a bit sad really. Overall a real hardcore experience, you'll stress out a lot. Lemme explain.\n\nAlmost all teammates are down, some were eaten by zombies, some were put down by you when their dead bodies attacked you... Not even a single bullet in the mag, only your axe and you. Shatload of zombies slowly making their way to you... And then you see the escape vehicle! Your teammate and you rush towards it but he gets grabbed at the last second.. Nothing you can do but escape while listening to the sound of flesh getting ripped off behind you... Dat feeling when you finish a campaign...\n\nTalking about teammates... You'll have some trouble finding decent ones because oh boy.. This game has one of the worst communities I've seen. You usually run into 9 yo kids who spam mic and take all the ammo they can carry (which'll leave the rest of the team a lot less especially on objective maps where ammo is scarce) and then proceed to spend a whole mag on 1 zombie. Of course when they die, you'll find all kinds of ammunition dropped from their bodies. That is if you can GET to the body before one of the vulture players pick all the ammo clean. NO. This is not how it works. This is not L4D.\n\nIf I buy a game that I KNOW it requires teamwork, I read the guides to have an idea what I'm about to do before joining a game. Just to not make the older players sick. I might perform bad, not everyone will succeed on their first try. ESPECIALLY in this game... But not these people. Hell I'll be happy if newbies just listened to older players instead of running around wasting bullets. Sadly no. You got hoarders, spray n prayers, little kids and people who don't understand English. This is %90 on public servers. BUT if you play with your friends or find at least 3-4 people that uses mic/chat by any chance, then you can go on for hours.\n\nI'd pay the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game just to have a decent player-base. Because it definitely has lots of content, even more than some $$ games I'd say...","October 19, 2014","true","130.9"," 751 of 818 people (92%) found this review helpful 77 people found this review funny","92","751","818","77","36"

No More Room in Hell is that mod. Starting out as a stand-alone mod for the Source engine, No More Room in Hell is a zombie outbreak simulator that is unlike any other that has ever been made. The game features a unique atmosphere, AI, weapons, and maps that can keep people satisfied during their play. Even though it may not be as exciting as other zombie games, such as Dead Rising, the game centers more around fear and survival more than just fun antics. Now, the big question is, is No More Room in Hell worth my hard drive space? If you are a die hard fan of zombies, and want to have a more realistic approach at it, I'd definetly reccommend it.\n\nThe Verdict: I give No More Room in Hell a 9.5/10 for it's deep approach at survival and realism","November 27, 2013","true","257.5"," 679 of 767 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","679","767","0","23"

But after initially playing it non-stop of a few hours, I soon realised that this is a real gem of a game. It stays true to the classic zombie genre with the slow walking zombies but it has it's fair share of "runners" too. The atmosphere is very dark and gritty, it's perfect for zombies and I love it. There's dozens of weapons ranging from guns to melee. There's always room for trying new strategies for the hordes of undead. There's a modest number of maps but each map has a changing structure that makes it different each playthrough. And both objective and survival gamemodes are equally fun. But as a personal opinion, objective maps are too easy as sometimes you can pretty much speedrun your way through the map and leave everyone behind with the zombies. Overall, it's a perfect zombie game and hearing the accompanying "pop" when you blow a zombies head off is pretty damn awesome. Compared to the L4D series, I'd say NMRIH is more realistic so it gets my preference in this genre. Give it a try, it's worth many hours of zombie killing.","March 1, 2014","true","378.5"," 260 of 273 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","260","273","0","4"

A game which is not gentle, that does not have a learning cure so much as a learning cliff. A game which shows nothing but brutality to it's players. This game is a labour of love, with many, many hours obviously put into it to make as best a game as the developers could. They knew what they were going for, a semi-realistic zombie apocalypse that shows no mercy and they went for it.\n\nOf course, this introduces problems.\n\nLet's start with the learning curve. As mentioned before, this game has not so much a learning curve as a learning cliff, so you might expect a short moment on how to explain game mechanics, or at least, hints and tips while the game loads for you? Reasonable to expect, isn't it? Well, no. You don't get that at all. There is no kindness, no compassion, no one or nothing to give you a holding hand; this game chucks you in the deep end, then expects you to know breast stroke. Now other games have done this, Dark Souls being the most infamous, but Dark Souls took a moment to explain what was going on. It told you how to raise your shield, explained how to equip, and how to use the bonfies. No such luck here. You're in a bulding that is secure, and the moment you walk out that door, zombies. Lots and lots of zombies.\n\nNow having one or two zombies at first to get used to them, to know how to deal with them, again, would be standard fare. Nothing wrong with being exposed to a new enemy type slowly, to let you understand and get used to. Not so with this game, oh no. Try a few dozen. And you don't know what to do beyond kill. You might have a few weapons, but they float through the air, seemingly not connecting to anything, which means that you have to spend a few swings getting used to weapons. And in a game this lethal and unforgiving, those few practice swings will cost you dearly. And you will die.\n\nNow one mechaninc that you might know is that being grabbed can only be resolved by pushing (which is V by default). What you may not know is that zombies can grab through wire fences and windows (wether or not this is a bug is something else entirely) and if that happens, you are beyond all hope. Another thing that you might guess that being grabbed and then bitten is bad, and it is, but being bitten is not well shown. Beyond the zombie jerking a bit, you may not even know you've been bitten until you begin to show the signs. And if you are bitten, death is inevitable. You have two minutes. Spend them well by either finding pills to buy you more time (no cure here), jump off a ledge, or simply beg someone to kill you.\n\nNow the inventory may take some getting used to. You have two inventory wheels, one for ammo, one for weapons. The bigger, bulkier, and heavier something is, the more space it takes, and you don't have many pockets. So of course you need to manage inventory space, which is perfectly fine, this is a horror survival game after all. Nothing wrong with that. In fact, I applaud it. I don't want to be carrying two rifles, three pistols, and a big ♥♥♥ sledge hammer. I'm not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ space marine here, and this isn't the game for them. Ammo is counted in weight and mass as well, which makes sense.\n\nAnd, of course, the zombies. Oh, the Zombies. These are standard Romero-Zombies. Undead who feel no pain, fear, or emotion and operate entirely on instinct. Woth noting, hwoever, that the eyesight of a zombie is perfect. I'm not kidding;  they have perfect, near 360 degree awareness of everything that not even you or I should be able to see. Two stories directly overhead? They can see you. Small dot on the horizon in a darkened room? They know you're there. Pitch blackness? Sure as ♥♥♥♥ they know you're there.\n\nAnd while this does make for a fun and entertaining horror game, there is one more flaw. Multiplayer. Now, I know what you're saying: But Left 4 Dead and Payday did it perfectly! How can this be possible!? Well here's why. For starters, Valve knew that players can't communicate well with strangers on the other side of the world. They knew that coordination was next to impossible. They knew that players naturally deviate from each other at all times. So how did they solve this? Simple. You always knew, at a glance, how your fellow players were doing, and where they were. They had glowing outlines that showed at any distance, and maps were linear to prevent fanning out by players. Maps in valves games were funnels, and even Overkill understood this by making the map around easy to navigate and open buldings made as simplistic as possible.\n\nMultiplayer is a mess. Players do not communicate well with others over large distances. Most players don't even have microphones, so that idea with walkie talkies where players far away can't talk without them? A waste of time since text speech does not work with walkie talkies, so you must be right next to them to work. Maps are cramped, narrow things that while linear, often curve in on themselves and encourage exporation. Again, not a problem, except that players naturally do not drift together, they drift apart because they have no sense of surroundings at the best of times and are given no way to drift back together.\n\nThis game strikes me as a single player game trying to do the work of multiplayer. It just can't work. It doesn't work. Bad bugs (or bad mechanics, that's unclear), an extreme difficulty curve beyond any sane resembelance and poor combat mechanics and jerky, overwhelming numbers of undead at all times mean that players will only have an experience of death, more death, and of course death, all without any real progression. This game isn't just hard, it's near unplayable through it's obscene diffculty spikes and poorly designed multiplayer maps.\n\nThis is not to say that it's bad, heck, I had loads of fun playing it, but it is very much a niche game. If you don't want to play this sort of game, skip it over, but I reccomend playing this game just for the experience.","April 14, 2014","true","26.4"," 310 of 339 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","310","339","0","10"

It's free for one thing. It can't be compared to Left 4 Dead because it takes things a lot slower. It's not a ridiculous mad rush. Getting infected is a interesting mechanic and can really spice up your match and, as said above, they can come back to life and they're can be very dangerous due to being able to run.\nHowever, there are some big problems. One, the voice acting...\nWell, nuff said.\nSecond, it can get quite repititive. It boils down to the same thing basically. Defend this location or do these things. Not really much variety.\nA LOT of the servers use unlimited ammo too which can really dim the gameplay down. Just avoid those.\nOverall, it's nice but it's not gonna last you. It's free so play it for a bit but you might want to try a game with more substance to it.","July 12, 2015","true","15.7"," 397 of 451 people (88%) found this review helpful 337 people found this review funny","88","397","451","337","11"

You can see blood, death, and despair everywhere. Body bags on the street, with crashed cars and stores that are boarded up. There's a few weapons left, and you plus up to 5 other survivors have to make it to an extraction point by doing many different objectives. One objective could be quick as hell. Another might take tons of minutes.\n\nThere are tons of zombies that are all really slow. It'll take a while before they'll get you, Barbara, but when they do, unless you're prepared you're pretty much dead. There are normal zombies, fast zombies, and child zombies. Normal are easy to kill, just hold down Mouse 1, release and then quickly press the V button (THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT! It pushes zombies back, and has saved my life A ♥♥♥♥ TON of times) and then do it again until they're dead. Fast zombies are the same as normal zombies, but they go faster and attack faster. Child zombies are quick too, but they can't bite you, only make you bleed. Melee weapons usually take two or three hits to the head, charged before they'll kill one zombie. If you just sway your weapon back and forth you'll find yourself either empty on stamina, or dead.\n\nA gun is good, but they're not common and ammo for the right gun, YOUR gun, is even more rare. A Beretta 92 or a Glock 17 will take 2 hits to the head (Or 1 if you stand still for a while, this is called "Deadeye") but their ammo is common and they have a large capacity. A 1911 will only need 1 bullet to the head, but ammo for that is rare and so is the gun itself, and it's only got a capacity of 7+1, but it will bring a world of pain to the zombies. A revolver is handy but it's got a lot of recoil, 6 shots and rare as hell ammo. Then there's big guns, MAC-10, MP5, M16A4, CZ858, Shotguns and Sniper Rifles, all of which take a lot of inventory space and have rare ammo (Except for MAC-10 and MP5, who uses .45ACP and 9mm), and they're all rare too. What I'm trying to say here is that all you need is a pistol and a good melee weapon to survive.\n\nThen there are survival maps, which are about you and your team bunkering down and trying to protect one, two or three areas at the same time. These maps are very intense, and your team has to survive some waves with limited supplies and a horde of zombies. Hammer and planks are going to be your best friend, since they can slow down the zombies, but not forever. And sometimes The National Guard will drop in supplies for you and your team. This can include melee weapons, guns & ammo, medical supplies and other useful and handy supplies.\n\nHowever, do not download this game if you are easily scared, this is a pretty scary games with dark enviroments and scary enemies.","April 4, 2015","true","47.6"," 225 of 244 people (92%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","92","225","244","26","3"

There are 2 modes, one called Survival and one called Objective. Survival is where you (and your teammates) have to hold down an area or multiple areas from waves of zombies until the extraction comes. If your area(s) go down to 0% HP, then you will not be able to be extracted and therefore, will have to restart. The other mode, called Objective, is where you (and your teammates) will have to do certain objectives leading to extraction. The objectives range from blowing up something to placing certain objects somewhere. There are 2 difficulties as well, one called Classic, and one called Casual.\n\nClassic is where you spawn with nothing, and you don't spawn at all when you die unless a major objective is completed or a wave is completed. Casual is where you will always spawn with a melee weapon, and you have respawn tokens. You have 3 when you join/start, but every 10 zombie kills will earn you a token. Each token will allow you to spawn in 5 seconds near a player when you die.\n\nThere are 3 zombie types in the game. The most common is slow, walking zombies. These guys just walk very slowly and attack if you get close. Be careful though, because these are common they can swarm you if your not careful. Less common is running zombies, which don't appear too often in the game. These guys run towards you very fast and sometimes require good timing to take down. The last is child zombies, which are basically childs that are zombies. These little guys are slower then runners, but faster then slow zombies. They will attack you, and it will not do that much damage but they can attack fast and can be a pain. They have a lower hitbox therefore requires you to aim a bit down to hit them. They have less health too and will usually die by one or two hits by a melee or gun to the head.\n\nThe game, overall, is really fun, especially with friends to play it with. The game, at first, may seem really hard to play, as guns and ammo are scarce, and melee you have the risk of getting hurt while striking. However, as you get more used to it, the game will turn out to be much easier. It is good to read the players survival guide for the game by clicking where it is located at the right where it says "Players Survival Guide" when you play the game at first, or if you need to be reminded about something.\n\nThere is a good range of guns and melee weapons you can find, and even get achievements for getting certain amount of kills with them. The game's engine is the Source Engine, which means that the game might be similar to Valve games such as TF2 and CS, such as the Developer Console. There is a few glitches in the game which may seem to make the game easier or slightly break the game, however it doesn't seem like a major thing. Most games have glitches sometimes, so it's fine. The developers of the game are constantly working on adding new content and fixing glitches. The developers also interact with the community in forums, and such as get players' opinions on certain things, which is nice. It's also free to play!\n\n(TL;DR Really fun realistic zombie survival game that has multiple modes and zombie types that requires teamwork and coordination.)\n\nOverall, I rate this game 10/10. Keep up the great work developers! :D","November 1, 2014","true","176.1"," 207 of 232 people (89%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","89","207","232","8","4"

But after a while you learn the range of different weapons and you might actually complete an objective map! Tip: start with Toxtet, that is the easiest level to complete.\n\nYou can also play survival maps, which is the standard "kill all zombies in a wave" affair. I think the easiest level to start survival is "Night of the living dead".\n\nObjective maps are best played with a few friends because cooperation is key in this game. Another golden tip is to kill as few zombies as possible, run run run and shove shove shove! It is possible to reach the extraction point without even kill one zombie in this game mode (and an achievement: pacifist).\n\nOverall a nice game with a steep learning curve.","March 8, 2014","true","118.8"," 159 of 173 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","159","173","0","10"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/soundofthelyre/recommended/224260/","soundofthelyre","Pistol Messiah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/soundofthelyre/","179 products in account","No More Room in Hell, at its simplest, is a brutal, "Romero-On-Steroids" take on the zombie apocalypse sub-genre. Intent on creating as realistic (or, in the words of the developer, "Romero-style") an experience as possible, nearly everything is accounted for in this game, outside of the usual "stamina" and "limited HUD" features. Each individual item has its own weight, and is allocated to an inventory wheel, which the player can access at any time. A shotgun, for example, will weigh more than a machete (and consequently, take up more space than that machete on the wheel). Even your total ammount of ammunition is accounted for, and thusly limits your inventory space. Don't take this to be an inhibiting feature, though. If anything, this system adds to the terrifying immersion of the game. Certain items that are normally a "given", such as the flashlight, must be picked up manually to be used at all (but can be accessed quicker than other items by the usual 'F' key once it's picked up). The zombies themselves, as they always have in Romero's movies, are generally slow, and do not pose any threat if they're alone. As you progress through the waves, however, this "lone target" situation becomes decreasingly common, and replaced with crowds of zombies, often numbered in the tens to even twenties. Unlike other horror (or even generalized co-op) games that permit cooperation but do not enforce it, No More Room in Hell sternly (but not forcefully) nudges players into a peacefully-woven experience, complete with suppressing and covering fire, shared supplies, and coordinated strategy.\n\ntl;dr - No More Room in Hell is one of the best zombie games you'll find this decade. Play it.","November 25, 2013","true","10.8"," 375 of 457 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","375","457","0","0"

I've played this game since it came out and I have to say I'm really impressed with it. Yes there are some bugs but they're rarely game breaking and usually not too much of a problem. The weapons are fun to use and actually require a decent amount of skill (what with the lack of crosshairs, limited amount of ammo, and wide variety of melee weapons). The zombies work well too, crawlers, walkers, runners, and kids all provide a bit of variety and can spice up the game/scare the hell out of you. All in all it's a very enjoyable game and I hope the developers continue to work on it and the community continues to support it.\n\nTIPS:\n1. Use your sights.\n2. If you melee, PUSH the zombies away after every swing.\n3. Communicate, even without a mic it's really useful.\n4. Don't waste ammo. (Especially on the first few rounds of a survival map)\n5. Don't hoard ammo you aren't using, chances are someone else needs it.\n6. Don't attack the same zombie at once. It wastes ammo or it clusters people up so they miss their swings.\n7. Use the flare gun to call in supplies (Survival).\n8. Conserve your energy, if you're out of breath, back away for a few seconds.\n9. If you're infected call it out. If there are no pills at all, shoot yourself.\n10.

I turn around, jason bateman points a 22 pistol at my head. His name-tag reads 'darkman'.\n\n"No, you got a gun already."\n\n"nah man it's a 22- it's ♥♥♥♥."\n\n"You can't have the ak."\n\n"♥♥♥♥ you."\n\nNecessary dialogue is exchanged in the starting area, people form alliances, grudges, allies and enemies.

Moans can be heard on the other side, along with the unmistakable slapping of feet on the ground.\n\n"Hey heshy, you go first, you got the ak." someone says.\n\nI oblige, pushing open the door and entering partly.\n\nIt's a medium sized car park area, cars srewn about, left like ghosts of some ancient civilisation, and plenty of zombies too, slower ones, walking around aimlessly, and perhaps three runners at the back.\n\nI focus my attention on the immediate danger, centre the iron sights and take aim on the closest runner, about four metres away, making a beeline straight for me.\n\nI stay trained on it's head, waiting for the right moment, ready to pull the trigger before I hear the door behind me creak shut.\n\n"Shoulda given the ak." It's darkman, decided to trap me in here in hopes of satisfying some mis-guided want for revenge.\n\nI pull the trigger, or rather hit mouse1, but the sound of the door put me out of focus and jutted my aim off to the left.\n\nThe bullet whizzes through the air, and chunks of rock and dust particles fly out from the wall behind the runner.\n\nToo late.\n\nThe runner is upon me now, and my only reaction is to frantically hit 'v' as fast as I can. I push him away with the side of my rifle, stumbling it.\n\nThis gives me enough time to point my gun in its general direction, wildly firing into the oncoming swarm of zombies.\n\nI waste about twelve rounds before two runners and a walker goes down.\n\nEight rounds left.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mightyescapism/recommended/224260/","mightyescapism","Mighty Escapism","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mightyescapism/","122 products in account","When I originally tried out this game, I had no idea it would become one of my all time favorite games ever.\nWhen you first start playing, you join an online lobby or make a lobby with friends on a map you're not familiar with. Nothing makes sense and everything is confusing. The default controls aren't incredibly intuitive, melee feels like it's worthless, you run out of stamina as with as little as two or three swings for some weapons, and although the guns feel great, good luck finding a decent amount of ammo (especially if you're playing online). But if you just have a bit a patience, remap some of the controls and understand that this isn't meant to be a fast-paced guns blazing action game, you might find yourself enjoying the game a little. Or a lot.\n\nSomeone, maybe one of the curators, I can't remember, said this game is similar to Resident Evil 2 only in first person, and I just love that comparison. I mentioned earlier that generally you might have a hard time finding a decent amount of ammo. If you're playing online with strangers, this pretty much always applies, however if you're playing with some friends, it's very possible you could get a nice stockpile of ammo going, especially if you're playing a survival map. In objective maps, however, ammo is very scarce for the most part. Occasionally, you might be blessed with more ammo than other runs, but the thing that makes this game always interesting and stressful (in a good way!) is that it's not usually very efficient trying to take on a horde of zombies, even with all the ammo you have. You're standing there, unleashing all of your might, but the longer you stand in one place, the more zombies start to come your way. It becomes too much, so your best chance is to try and run through and dodge as many zombies as you can, saving any ammo for when you really need it. It's really satisfying making it through the small openings you're given in a horde and potentially saving tons of ammo.\n\nI also mentioned above that guns feel good, which is very true. Guns are a lot of fun to use in this game, and popping heads with bullets into a bloody burst feels as good as Resident Evil 4. They even made the piece of ♥♥♥♥ Ruger gun sounds way more satisfying in the last update they did, so even though the guns are still a piece of crap, at least they feel nice to use.\n\nOne thing that I love about this game is the difficulty. It's not easy. My friends and I have beaten every single official map, with one map in particular taking what seemed like weeks to get through (FEMA) and others taking days of attempts (Junction, Zephyr, and... Most of the survival maps, actually). This might seem like a weird comparison, but this game almost has that old "NES Hard" feel to it, because even though a lot of the times your plans are  foiled by zombies growing elastic arms and somehow hitting you after you shoved them away and blasted them point blank in the face with a ♥♥♥♥ing shotgun come ON HOW DOES THAT NOT KILL YOU, there's still an incredibly rewarding feeling from beating a map that kicked your ♥♥♥ tons of times. Oh, but uh, get some friends if you can, at least one, because I don't think most maps can be beaten solo. Also adding to the NES hard feel of the game is that most survival maps can actually be beaten in 10-20 minutes once you know what to do. They're fun to replay through too, because every single weapon in this game has an achievement, so if you're not playing with greedy scumbag strangers online, you and your friend(s) can decide over which weapons to use, changing how the run will go, even if slightly. Also adding to the replayability factor is that a lot of the item locations on maps are randomized. Some might dislike that sometimes you can get a fully loaded FN Fal on a table and other times a ♥♥♥♥ing flashlight, but in most cases, it's just different kinds of ammo, so it's nice to have some variety for the many times you will have to try to complete certain maps.\n\nSpeaking of maps, there are a lot of custom maps for this game too, which is awesome, because sometimes you just want something different. Truth be told, a lot of the custom maps I've played, survival ones especially, are easier than official maps, so if you're new to the game and having difficulties, it might be wise to try out some of the more lenient custom maps there are. I personally recommend a map called Museum, as it has a LOT of supplies to start you out with, and I really do mean a lot, and there are supply drops every few rounds as well. Plus the map looks good.\n\n...And if you REALLY want to have a good time, download a map called "Mansion." You'll know you have one I'm talking about if the spawn point is always around a poker table on the second floor. Here's what you want to do, open the console command with the ~ button and bind the kill command to a key, preferrably one that's away from most of your other commmonly used keys so you don't acidentally kill yourself. Anyway, jump off the balcony towards the small railing and kill yourself in midair and watch your ragdoll smack against the railing and spaz out while it does flips and twirls as it flies off. Pure comedy gold, I promise you. Even better if you have a buddy to watch/join the fun.\n\nAside from that, do what you want! This game has a lot to offer, and it's FREE! This game made me buy Contagion, a $20 game also about zombies and survival. It's a piece of ♥♥♥♥, at least compared to this completely free game. A darn shame, but now you have $20 bucks that you didn't spend on ♥♥♥♥, you could buy TWO copies of the soundtrack for this game if you wanted.\n\nA couple things to mention if you're still reading and are interested in the game:\n"Mastering" melee combat is essential. First off, everytime you swing, SHOVE IMMEDIATELY AFTER. This will almost always hit the enemy and push them back, stopping them from attacking you, because you see, melee hits don't always stagger zombies, so you could swing a giant fubar at a zombie, crack its skull, and it's still swinging at you. Don't let that ♥♥♥♥ fly. Shove, shove, and shove again. Also, melee attacks can be charged by holding down the attack button. If you charge a melee attack for a full 3 seconds or longer and aim for the head, it will almost always kill any enemy with  the exception of armored zombies. This works with nearly every weapon, even the wrench, but not your fists.\n\nAnd finally, some good maps to start playing are\nObjective:\nLakeside (Easiest objective map by far. It's short and pretty straightforward and gives you a decent amount of supplies.)\nChinatown (Not exactly easy, but a very fun map to play because overall it isn't very long and there's gun shop!)\nCabin (Also not extremely easy, but short.)\n\nSurvival:\nFlooded (Supply drops after every second round and wide open ranges for melee attacking.)\nMidwest (This map might seem hard at first, but if you search for the key to the locker in the gun shop, all of your problems are solved.)\nSilence (Great atmosphere, lots of areas that you need to find keys and blowtorches to get into for more supplies.)","October 14, 2015","true","305.0"," 74 of 79 people (94%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","94","74","79","13","3"

It does what other zombie games doesn't and with no price tag.  I absolutely love the game, have got tons of enjoyment out of it and still continue to do so. I highly recommend giving it a try, it is free and you may have a blast like I do with this amazing game.\n\nPros:\n\n+Free\n+Tons of reply value\n+Up to 8 player co-op\n+Several Fun game modes\n+Combat is great and works well\n+Maps are well done and thought out\n+Has Achievements and trading cards\n+Wide range of weapons, each with different stats\n+Most realistic Zombie game on steam I've played\n+Infection and bleeding mechanics add more challenge\n+Great custom made content such as walking dead maps\n+Several character models to choose from, each with their own voices\n+Several types of zombies, children, walkers, runners armored and crawlers\n+Custom servers (Pro and con) Some are good with new maps and gamemodes and a lot are bad such as the infinite ammo ones\n\nCons:\n\n-Infinite ammo servers, tons of these servers and it take away any challenge to the game\n-Playerbase, most have no idea what they are doing and will get you killed, or you may meet some trolls\n- Bumping, a mechanic in the game that makes you push people slighly when bumping into them, this results in unwanted bleeding, infection, loss of health or death\n-Infection chances, it is random but apparently the higher your health is the less chance you have of getting infected, regardless it is annoying getting hurt once and being infected.\n\nDownload Size: 8700mb\nTrading Cards: 8 cards in the set\nAchievement Difficulty: Hard to 100%\nHours to 100%: If using certain servers you can get all achievements around 100 hours\n\nRating: ♥♥♥♥♥/♥♥♥♥♥ Full hearts!\nRecommendation: Must play","January 18","true","435.8"," 64 of 66 people (97%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","97","64","66","6","6"

Teamwork is key in any hope for survival.  Yet again, selfishness is another alternative.\n\nDetailed Review:\n\nThe wait is finally over for anyone who has been searching for a free zombie fps game!  This game has just about every aspect of a normal zombie inspired game, but is free (unlike most).  Even though its free, the graphics don't suffer.  Also, there are different game modes you can play which allows for great replay value.  A downside to the game involves the community which will be addressed later on.  This game sure makes up for the install time.\n\nAs many of us know, free games can be... kind of... crappy.  From the graphics to the rough game play, free to play games can make you cringe.  This one, however, is not like those awful let downs.  No More Room In Hell offers average graphics and smooth game play for free.  You cannot say that about a lot of games now, even games that cost an arm and a leg.  If you are familiar to Garry's Mod, then those are the graphics you can expect (many props can be found in GMod).  As long as your internet is half decent, this game will run smoothly.  This is coming from me with 150 KB/s internet speed.  Loading is quick and downloads take a few minutes.\n\nThere is a surprising amount of replay value in this game.  Normally, free to play games don't offer a lot of playtime.  With No More Room In Hell, there are many game modes involved.  You can either survive several hordes of zombies or battle to be extracted by the military.  Another bonus to this game is the amount of achievements it has.  For anyone who is like me and loves getting achievements, this game is great for you.  You can get almost 100 achievements which will have you coming back to get more.  You can expect to find yourself playing countless hours on this game.\n\nThe only downside I see in this game is the player base.  By this I mean the people playing the game (obviously).  These people that you are playing with are supposed to be there to help you fight off the brain dead flesh eaters.  Instead, you can find yourself screaming your head off as your teammate becomes one of those brain dead morons.  This is not very common, but should be expected.  This game is best played with friends, as many zombie games are.  However, you really should expect those “trolls” in all games.  Do not feed the trolls and move on.  Chances are they will just crawl back under the bridges from which they came.\n\nAll things considered, this game is really fun.  It is a real time killer that you will actually enjoy.  For anyone out there will poor internet or a bad computer, you can more than likely play this game with ease.  I hope this review helped you get an idea of the game.  It is a lot to read for a free game but at least you won't need to worry about wasted download time.","August 11, 2015","true","122.7"," 70 of 78 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","70","78","5","2"

No way is it a 10/10 for me... But for a Free to Play title, it deserves a good 8.5/10\nOne thing that really is heartwarming is the lack of microtransactions, this game is purely based on luck and co-operation... You cannot do it alone, there's no way you will survive alone...\nThe features I love to see are:\nPlayers don't turn into Walkers, they are entirely AI...\nInfection, there is a chance you will get infected if a walker bites you, not a 100% chance, but it's still there, and once you do get infected, there is no going back, you have about 2 or 3 minutes left to live, your screen gets grey, veins start running towards the center from the sides... It's a bit freaky the first time around.\nOnly way you can (temporarily) stop the infection are Phalanx Pills... The secure you for another 3 minutes I believe, but after your time is up, the course starts again...\nAnother feature I love to see, challenging maps, they can be really hard to complete, and if your team of say, 10 people actually makes it, only about 1 or 2 people make it to the end, the rest usually die due to getting left behind, getting cornered, or running ahead...\nGetting lost and seperated from your team in this game is suicide... One time I was cornered, went into a back alley with only 1 entrance, I had a gun with about 25 round, shot them all out, but the more I shot the more came into the door, I tried to run out when I saw an opening, I asked for help from my team but they didn't hear me... I got pinned and died\nThat is how unforgiving No More Room In Hell is...\nIt's a very good game... but not perfect\n8.5/10 it is\nMust try this title","October 12, 2014","true","25.1"," 106 of 133 people (80%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","80","106","133","9","3"

First off, I assume that you are here because you like zombie games. If that is the case, GET THIS NOW.\n\nI can now assume that because you are still reading, you are unconvinced. Alright. Let the true review begin.\n\nI stumbled across this when it was first Greenlighted. My friends were playing it (a LOT), so I figured I would see what it was about. It turned out to be a ZOMBIE game (NOT a fan)...so I was discouraged. But then, I watched some brief gameplay of it. This WASN'T like the others. It wasn't a pointless gore fest. No, this one was different...very different. You see, the core aspect of this game is NOT killing zombies. It's accomplishing objectives to call for help, while being outnumbered and trying to hold the Zs back. Accomplishing this requires TEAMWORK and of course, your trusty flashlight. You may be thinking: "Like I'll find a good server with teamwork...". Well, you couldn't be more wrong! The community actually drives these players away, the game's entire population are GOOD people! So, wrapping it up, just get this game. It's only 2 GB, free, and has an active dev profile that listens to the suggestions of good people like me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/schnellspritzer/recommended/224260/","schnellspritzer","Schnellspritzer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/schnellspritzer/","151 products in account","This game is a new genre of zombie games (at least to me anyway) the game is unforgiving and and slow which makes this game unique. The maps are originally very bare with just enough weapons for 8 people (max per server), weapons are the standard melee or firearms, however, given the unforgiving nature of this game, you may not have enough bullets in your gun to protect you from the various zombies you will encounter, including runners, walkers, crawlers, children, and armoured zombies. Your best bet on survival is top notch accuracy and the ability to use all types of melee weapons (including your fists).\n\nThere are 3 different game difficulties that you can choose from when looking for a server; classic mode, casual mode and modded.\n\n-Classic mode: Can be divided into two types which are, objective and wave maps. Objective maps require the player(s) to complete objectives all over the map before they can be extracted. Wave maps are straight forward, survive all the waves to get extracted. If you die during a wave, with no respawn tickets, you will automatically respawn at the start of the next wave.\n\nWith both game types, consecutive kills with no deaths is rewarded in respawn tickets.\n\n\n\n-Casual mode: Similar to classic, however, the player spawns with a random melee weapon in-hand and start off with 3 respawn tickets. Players are also spawned at any point in the game whether it be an objective or wave map.\n\nNew players may want to join these types of game types as they are easier to get accustomed to and learn the ways of the zombieslayer.\n\n\n\n-Modded: Personally, I find this very lacking, repetetive and boring. Modded servers usually provide players with infinite ammo and all weapons. This gametype is usually played by those who are somehow very bad at the game. I believe these servers were originally a casual mode map, so respawn ticket rules are the same.\n\nFin.","June 21, 2015","true","140.9"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","29","31","0","3"

The problem is, the game at first felt a little ‘’stiff ‘’.  It is definitely nothing like Dead Island, and the gameplay mechanics are not fluid.  However…..\nAfter few tries, I definitely did get used to it. If you ever played counter strike or any other game running on source, you will have no problems with this.\nNow, onto the actual game. No more room in hell is a basic cooperative survival zombie game. It started off as a mod for Half-life 2.\nThere are a few game modes, such as the survival mode, where basically you have to hold up as long as you possibly can, fighting off the waves of undead. The objective, where your team has to accomplish a task in given time. Also the developers have promised to release more game modes in the future.\nThere are 30+ weapons in the game, ranging from a small axe to FN FAL or a .45 revolver. You can use a hammer and wooden planks to board up an entrance, in order to keep the zombies out. You can actually get infected by a zombie that bitt you. There is also voice chat for easier communication with other players. The graphics are surprisingly good and I have not encountered any server issues or lags during my short game play. Even though at its early stages, NMRIH (No more room in hell) is a very polished game. If you have ever played DayZ….don’t worry, this game is actually playable in its standalone form \nOverall, this is a brilliant zombie survival game. It has a really gloomy feel to it and descent soundtrack, like any zombie game should have, cool looking maps and plenty of features to keep you busy kicking undead ♥♥♥. I thoroughly recommend it to all zombie fans out there. Definitely worth checking out and playing with your friends.\n\n","October 30, 2014","true","6.6"," 36 of 44 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","36","44","5","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/croy12/recommended/224260/","croy12","Pip Boy Roy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/croy12/","415 products in account","This is how you build the foundation for a great coop zombie experience. No more room in hell is a free game which started out as a mod and puts most games like L4d2 and every early access zombie game to shame. If the creator and his team were funded a quarter as much as AAA game or did a kickstarter this game could easily hold the title of top zombie game.\n\nWith that said this is all free so while it has amazing ideas it is held back by an aged source engine and lack of funds to keep it well polished. Hitboxes are inconsistent with melee shots, guns sometime wiff at point blank, and the graphics and audio is limited. However if you can look past some of its faults it is a very fun and terrifying survival game where you can die at any point and watch your poor friends have to fight and claw there way to the end if they can make it! When you die you come back as a zombie AI and try to put any humans left down. The gore is satisfying especially when you hit one of those fast little ♥♥♥♥s in the head. Or ya there's zombie kids. 2 Kinds of map types objective with a L4d type mission to escape the city only it doesn't suck. Also survival mode where waves of zombies come after you in crazy enviorments. The game is updated every so often but still sufferes from bugs here and there.\n\nIn the end this is a game you and a group of buddies will deff want to screw around in. It's free go try it!\n\n\nFinal score 7/10","October 16, 2014","true","18.3"," 38 of 48 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","38","48","5","1"

A 3/10 With other people.\n\nIf this is too much text, read the last 5 paragraphs.\n\nAs stated above, it is really fun to play with your friends, because it's a teamwork game, friends won't let you down unlike the jackasses in the game and the communicating is also very important.\n\nIf you die in a campaign playing with public, you will have to wait around 10 or more minutes before the round is over either by everyone dies or they finish the map. Before you know it, 2 hours will have already passed and you still have not achieved anything in the day.\n\n(Not to mention you also have to wait when you just joined a server and waiting for players to be done with the round) (So it goes like: you die(or join), wait 10 minutes, restart, repeat.)\n\nSo far I stated like there involves alot of waiting, that is because there is no time limit, so a guy can stay AFK in spawn and wait forever untill he times out or a zombie from all the way at the main area makes it way slowly to the spawn.\n\nWhatever mode you are playing, weapons and ammunition will always spawn around you at the begin point and scattered throughout the map, not to mention, there is around 12 kinds of ammunition and it is pretty scarce. What every round goes is like the following: people rush and take all the stuff they can, even if they have the wrong ammunition and gun, they wont and will never share, (Some people don't even know how to drop it or use them!)  Good luck there with your kitchen knife and a gun with no magazine. And guess what, to melee zombies you will need a VERY good momentum, and most people fail meleeing. Now if you get caught once, you will most likely get infected already, and you will need pills to cure your infection. What if you don't have pills? You ask for pills. I don't even have to answer if anybody is gonna give you pills because obviously no they won't(Pills are also very scarce). People would then die, turn into fast-agile like zombies which are really hard to deal with especially for newcomers and average players and most likely infect you and everybody that is near. Which results in a ruined round for everybody.\n\nBesides, if you play campaign. You could pretty much rush to the end point WITHOUT KILLING any zombies.(By pushing zombies away, luring them to one point and run pass them) But people JUST want to kill them because "Pew, pew! it is fun to kill zombies!" and eventually die by them. So you never get something done unless you do all the objectives by yourself every single time.\nF.Y.I: The zombies respawn and the rate is also quick. There is no point in trying to killing them all.\n\nIf you play Survival/Defending(Zombies come in waves and you have to protect the zones from being overrun) with other people. They won't be defending sh*t, instead they chill outside and solo the zombies like this is dead island and then die like a fool. (As everyone slowly dies, zone's get overrun, gameover by default. Restart. Repeat.)\n\nAnd did you know? In survival/defending there is only this limited ammunition and weapons throughout the map. The only way to get more is to find a flare gun and HOPEFULLY finding flare gun ammo for the flare gun and fire it into the sky. Around 15 seconds later a helicopter will drop a huge ♥♥♥ supply crate and there will be tons of weapons including flare gun ammo. But that is only if you manage to both get the FLARE GUN and the FLAREGUN AMMO.\n\nThe gun and ammo doesn't spawn together, which means you gotta find em both. But it's almost impossible because players are spawned all over the map next to a item spawn point. So whatever items there are, people would have taken it and kept it for themselves.\nF.Y.I: Nearly nobody knows that you can get a supply crate by firing flare gun into the sky.\n\nYou can't complete any campaign (Unless you are a skilled player and carry all their asses)\nIn Survival/defending (Which has a 0% of winning even if you carry them so damn hard, Because you can't defend two zones at a time.)\n\nI've got a ton more critisism like people shooting a whole mag and missing them on one single zombie and still not kill them. I'd leave it at here.\nF.Y.I: Bodyshots are so weak so you gotta go for the head. And the HITBOX on the head is pretty ♥♥♥♥.\n\nBtw you are like a crooked old man with a stick if you run out of stamina. Making sprinting useless at times.\n\n\n\n\nNow time for some positive things.\n\n- The game is a little bit spooky, especially if everyone is dead and you are alone,\n\n- Guns do look cool, but with the amount of ammo you get. There is not alot of action.\n\n- There are zombie kiddos that can totally annihliate newbs. (It's just so entertaining to watch somebody getting ♥♥♥♥♥ by them)\n\n- Secrets and a bit of puzzle, there are some secrets on some maps, have fun trying to discover them in your spectating ghost form\n\nSummary:\n\nPlaying on public servers:\nIt wastes a lot of time in your life, not worth it.\nObjectives are confusing even for average players.\n30% of the people are kids that doesn't know how to properly play this game.\n50%+ ^ Are greedy people including kids that never shares and are socially awkward.\n10% Are people adults that swears and do whatever the hell they want like being your boss.\n5% Delays the game as long as they can by being a dumbo, scared hiding in some corner and look around. (There is no time limit at all..)\n5% People are actually nice, which is rare. So if you ever meet one, I suggest to add them.\n\nSo gather your 3 or more friends on skype/teamspeak and what I just said about playing on public servers will all be null. Join an empty server with as less capacity as there is to prevent from more people joining and screw everything up = Profit.\n(Everyone is happy)\n\n\nOnly worth with friends. Trust me. You'll be remembering this review if you just join a random server.","November 7, 2014","false","90.2"," 180 of 287 people (63%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","63","180","287","12","23"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jimhox/recommended/224260/","jimhox","Holy Crap","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jimhox/","63 products in account","No More Room in Hell is a fantastic co-op survival-horror FPS. It nails almost every aspect that makes a zombie game terrifying (lots of gore, difficult to kill enemies, relatively frail characters, scarce weapons and ammo, claustrophobia, creepy lighting, etc.). It's quite impressive how the developers were able to create such a great game, out of the relatively old Source Engine and without any financing whatsoever (except for their paid sountrack).\n\nI will now list the pros and cons of the game:\n\nPros:\n• Spectacular atmosphere, where horrible sights are abundant\n• Great objective-based maps, that usually switch from different sets of objectives to complete, in order to finish a level\n• Very good soundtrack, mixing tension and desolation with its electronic vibe\n• Gruesome combat (some zombie maiming is missing, but it's not a big deal)\n• Simple and functional co-op, where the more players there are, it gets easier to complete the objectives, and zombies don't focus on only one player. Also, helping other players to get past a hoard, healing them, preventing them from becoming a walking corpse, feels great, as well as when they help you in return\n• Zombies are disgusting, very dangerous and hard to kill, making you hate the moment they grab you, or when they decide to swing their arms at you. The sheer number of them helps build the desperation in the player's mind\n• The inclusion of zombie children is nice, because it helps with immersion and realism, as well as freaking the player out\n• Scarcity of weapons and ammo keep the tensions high, especially when there are 8 players in the server\n• Both firearms and melee weapons are very satisfying to use and pack a punch\n• The minimalistic HUD is excellent and surprisingly comfortable to use (at least in my experience)\n• Bleeding and infection are some good game mechanics that up the difficulty and realism\n• Realism mode is brutal but very, very thrilling to play, once you have the skill for it\n• Some of the achievements are really good and can prove a real challenge, like "We Got This!"\n• Even after completing all objective maps several times and learning all the tricks, it's still a thrill to complete each of them. As an extra challenge, you can try finishing every objective map on your own, which feels like a fantastic accomplishment (for example, "nmo_brooklyn")\n• An abundance of free, custom made maps can keep you entertained for a long time, especially since many of them are really hard (namely, underground_a9, subside_v5, sweden_v1, urbanharzard_v4. hospitality_v2, genex, anxiety, ghostbuster, ravenholm_v2, ocwd_a1, and some others).\n• It's free to play, as if everything before that wasn't enough for you to try it out\n\nCons:\n• It's still a mod, so some clunkyness, bugs and glitches will be present at all times, breaking some of the immersion\n• Although gruesome, the combat is finicky and requires some serious practice and experience to fully dominate, adding some unnecessary challenge to the game.\n• The textures of the game are quite good, but the graphics in general aren't spectacular (only a minor con in my opinion, since the atmosphere is amazing)\n• Survival maps tend to be somewhat boring and stale, not to mention almost impossible to beat solo and laggy when playing online, where more than 100 zombies can spawn at a time. You should only play them in a public server.\n• The tutorial is limited to an image of the main keyboard controls during the loading screens, which isn't the best way to teach players. It all ends up in a good old trial and error type of learning curve\n• Co-op is quite bad when your team is filled with new players that are still figuring out the controls (or even trolls), and if you haven't mastered the game, it can prove difficult to complete most of the maps. If you have mastered the game, then you can usually ignore other players and win.\n• Zombie models lack variety which breaks the realistic gameplay to some degree. It's kind of dumb when you encounter the same old man zombie for the tenth time on a single map.\n• Third person character animations are a little bit funky. Walk, run and melee attack cycles are stiff.\n\nSo, do I recommend NMRiH? DEFINATELY. If you like zombie/co-op/FPS games, this is one of the best I've seen, and it's really impressive for a mod, similarly to Black Mesa, a Half-Life remake. Even if you're not particularly excited about zombies, but you're into horror games, you will love this one. If you can look past all the bugs, which are not as noticeable as I made them look in the review, then you're in for a treat. This review is also a personal opinion based on my experience with the game (no less than 450 hours), so it's ok if you end up disagreeing with me. I won't give a numeric rating, because I think the review speaks for itself.\n\nHappy skull-bashing everyone.","April 4, 2015","true","640.5"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","16","16","0","0"

YOUR SCREEN TURNS SEPIA. QUIT WASTING AMMO NOW.\n\nYou remember Condemned: Criminal Origins? This is just like that, except the insane drug addict felons are your teammates AND your enemies. Also there's less 2x4s. Seriously though, if you played that game you're in familiar territory. No UI to speak of, you check your gun's load manually. Medication is hard to find, and there's no PULL ME TO MY FEET PLS here. The core of the game is beating zombies (and infected teammates) in the head with pipes, hatchets, FUBARs to get to an objective and escape, movie-style. Or just to protect some rooms that magically get damaged by zombies (survival mode, denoted by 'nms' in map names kinda sucks.)\n\nNMRIH is based of George Romero's classic zombie films and features both slow and fast zombies. You have to hit them in the head, and even though using depth perception to hit with melee in a 2D game is a ♥♥♥♥ idea, it adds to the drama and laughing-till-you-can't-breathe-because-your-friends-suck factor.\n\nThis is the most cut-throat and realistic zombie game you'll ever play. Basically, when the match starts you run around collecting your preferred melee weapon (one-handers can use the maglite, two-handers hit hard), pick up guns and frantically empty the bullets out of them (U) since you can carry only one of each specific model at a time. If all goes well, all the stupid people die and you finish the objective.\n\n...or if doesn't they have a suicide feature now. :D\n\nThe game had some crazy framerate issues last patch, but they're gone now. You can alt tab without explosion now, too! The guns are varied and not just taken from CS:S - lots of civilian zombie movie guns, as well as M4s and all that. Everything is very very polished and feels like an actual gun / axe / grenade. It's like Killing Floor but with less grenades and more screaming deaths, or like Day Z with less crashes and... less crashes, but still plenty of paranoid murder. It's like Zombie Panic Source (Or Contagion) but with more realism and screaming, or Doom 3 with the starting gun and that flashlight thing.\n\nWhat's awesome is that the NMRIH team, while not really one to update frequently usually adds three or four maps, a new character and one or two new weapons per patch. For freeeeeee!\n\nAlso, if you like murdering children with fire axes it's one of the few modern zombie games with kid zombies. If the children are on your team, remember that you only do team damage if they're already infected. AXE THEM IN THE HEAD.*\n\n*Not applicable w/Friendly Fire on servers.","August 2, 2014","true","72.0"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","21","26","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mafiaguy7/recommended/224260/","mafiaguy7","Mister Maf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mafiaguy7/","235 products in account","The word "realism" in the context of a fantastical setting such as that of a zombie apocalypse may seem a little bit out-of-place, but No More Room in Hell is to Left 4 Dead as Insurgency is to Call of Duty.  The overall concept may be similar to other zombie apocalypse co-op adventure games, but the mechanics favor a level of real-life authenticity that others lack, and it's much stronger for it.\n\nOne of the biggest differences is how rare guns and ammunition are.  Finding an M-16 with a whole entire full magazine is a treasure to be coveted and a tool not to be wasted.  Much more common are six-shooters, 9mm handguns, lead pipes, fire axes, and more of their ilk.\n\nAmmunition comes in different calibers that must be matched to the appropriate weapon.  5.56×45mm NATO cartridges used in the M-16 won't fit into a .357 revolver, and .22s useful for a Ruger rifle will be rather useless when you only have a double-barrel hunting shotgun instead.  It's paramount that the players share ammunition with each other to keep everyone armed, especially when someone finds ammo they can't use but know someone else can.\n\nMelee weapons, which come in a wide variety in levels of effectiveness and inventory weight (more on this later), will be the real primary weapon for dealing with most zombies, especially when there are many players in a game (resulting in a much thinner distribution of ammo; unlike Left 4 Dead, more than four players can play together, depending on server settings).  While melee weapons do indeed follow the zombie apocalypse adage "swords don't need reloading", using them comes with a significant risk: not only can players not see their own health levels and take no insignificant amount of damage with hit, and not only will zombies sometimes grapple onto victims and stop them from moving, but players run the risk of being bitten and infected.\n\nInfection cannot be cured; only temporarily staved off with pills.  Infected players can ultimately complete levels together with non-infected players, but without a steady supply of pills, they will eventually drop dead and their corpse reanimate as a fast zombie.  As infection worsens, the player's vision will gradually become more obscured, until they are eventually completely blind.  If friendly fire is enabled in the game, this would generally be a good time for another player to put the victim out of their misery before they have to deal with another zombie.\n\nPlayers can also start bleeding out after being hit.  Their health levels will slowly deteriorate over time until a bandage is applied, adding another important tool to keep an eye out for.  When a player’s health becomes critically low, their vision will turn to black and white.  This is the player’s urgent warning: find a medkit, find a bandage, find something or you’re toast.\n\nThere are a multitude of tools and items to be found in No More Room in Hell.  Pills, medkits, grenades, guns, melee weapons, and gas cans all make an appearance in identical or similar roles to their Left 4 Dead 2 counterparts, but added are flashlights, radios (players can only hear each others' microphones if they are near each other unless they are carrying radios), welding torches, bandages, individual ammunition boxes/half-spent magazines, and more.  Every map is peppered with item spawns, but the sheer variety of them can make it difficult to find the specific one that's actually needed.\n\nIt's entirely reasonable to leave an item pickup where it is because it might not be worth carrying in your inventory at the moment.  Inventories are separated into two sections: guns/items, and ammunition.  Both work on the same system - the item's size and weight affects how much space it takes up in your inventory.  The closer your inventory is to being full, the slower the player will run.  Carrying around both a sniper rifle and a pump-action shotgun may be a powerful combination, but it will also leave very little room for other equipment.  It might be wiser to give one of the weapons and its accompanying ammo to a teammate, or even to simply leave one of them behind.\n\nThe zombies themselves come in the slow, shambling variety, many of whom will ignore the player if they don’t linger around for too long.  They can soak up many bullets to the chest, but will crumple quickly with one or two shots to the temple.  Occasionally, a fast runner - or even worse, a half-height running child - will appear and chase down the players; these enemies especially dangerous not just because they can attack the player faster, but also because they are harder to hit while being just as durable as a normal zombie.  This forces the players to make a split-second decision: risk infection by trying to hit it with a melee weapon, or burn through large amounts of precious ammunition to gun it down before it gets close.\n\nLevels come in two modes: objective and survival.  Objective mode is analogous to Left 4 Dead's main adventure mode.  Players must work together to travel from point A to point B, scavenging for supplies and overcoming obstacles along the way.  Routes and obstacles, in a similar manner to Left 4 Dead’s system, vary randomly.  However, unlike in Left 4 Dead, the different routes can sometimes be dramatically different from the others, and some levels even can be played backwards.  This adds a great amount of replayability to the official levels, and there are many quality player-made maps floating about, as well.\n\nSurvival mode tasks the players with not only simply surviving successive waves of zombies, but also with defending certain zones on the map from zombies.  Players will receive a supply drop at a random spot between waves containing random weapons and items, which must be found and used in enough time to return to the holdout area before the next horde of shambling monsters arrives.  Both surviving every wave and protecting at least one of the zones will achieve victory, but failing in either will result in a defeat.  The quality in survival maps varies; some are significantly more fun to play than others, but there are, of course, many custom maps for this mode as well.  Simply put, it’s an interesting alternative to the Objective mode that some players might hate and some might prefer.\n\nThe game definitely has that distinct “Half-Life 2 mod” feel to it (which is to be expected given that that’s what it started as), so don’t expect any revolutionary graphics or animations.  The gameplay is the important aspect here, though; No More Room in Hell is an excellent example of the “graphics alone don’t make a good game” argument.  That said, the age of the Half-Life 2 engine does come with some limitations, namely in the netcode: a high ping to the server can make zombies significantly more difficult to hit, especially given how important headshots are.\n\ntl;dr: No More Room in Hell is a unique take on the co-op zombie survival adventure game that puts a slower, more realistic spin on Left 4 Dead’s formula.  It demands that players work together and share resources if they hope to survive, but that makes the grand achievement of simply completing the level all the more rewarding.  Being a standalone version of what used to be a mod, the game is free (not free-to-play-with-strings-attached; just free), so you have nothing to lose by trying it out.","September 23, 2014","true","38.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/davidshakugan/recommended/224260/","davidshakugan","Cléber","http://steamcommunity.com/id/davidshakugan/","88 products in account","Since I have a decent amount of hours, I think I might be able to write a review about NMRIH. This game has got to be one of the best zombie games out there. It is a free co-op survival horror game where your ammo is scarce, you dont get to respawn so easily unlike any other type of game and has a deep strategy in it. Here are some of the pros:\n- Its free\n- Unlike L4D, its a much slower paced game\n- The infection system is unique and challenging. Once you get bitten, you need to decide quickly if you take some pills to delay the symptoms or just throw yourself to death and wait for the next wave (or use a respawn token)\n- Like any other type of game, NMRIH tries to be as realistic as possible, this is why the difficulty can be hard for new players but once you get the hang of it, its challenging and enthusiastic\n- Its free\n- Despite the fact that there are many official maps you can also play community maps, these can be a fresh air if you are getti tired of the same maps\n- Over 90 achievements (some are relatively easy tbh) to bring you even more stuff to do since you can become bored after a couple of hours of the game\n- Its free\n- Ammo and medical supplies are rare so think before you throw yourself to a zombie orgy with a TNT or a Colt\n- Like I said before, in this game everybody needs to work together in order to win, so if you like to be a lone-wolf in games you either carry your team to victory or you die on wave 2 to a kid zombie\n- if you dont like to just hold positions on survival maps you can try objective maps, where your team has to rush through locations to be rescued. Its a mission type of map where you only have 1 life so try to not suck\n- Did i mentioned its free? oh sorry about that\n\nNow seriously, NMRIH is one of the best zombie games today and if you like challenges what are you waiting for?  Grab a friend or 2 and go kick some zombie ♥♥♥!","December 31, 2015","true","214.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peksel/recommended/224260/","peksel","Peksel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peksel/","156 products in account","No More Room in Hell is an unique zombie survival experience. The game started out as a mod and I used to play this game as a mod before it came out as an standalone game on Steam.\nWhen I heard that this game was going to be out on steam I got really excited, hoping for a bigger community and more maps etc. Well wish became true but people kept complaining about the games difficulty. Difficulty is the idea of this game! It is supposed to be hard so it can support team play! I have to admit that the game WAS difficult when I first started but I learned. The learning curve is indeed pretty big.\nWhen you manage to learn most of the game you will survive big hordes of zombies with just a melee weapon, still that doesn't mean that the game is going to be easy because most of the objective maps are going to be really hard to complete alone.\nBecause the game is a challenge, completing a hard objective/survival maps is a really rewarding experience and makes you feel good.\n\nLet's talk about the weapons a little bit. Every weapon in my opinion has at least some difference. In melee the difference occurs in damage and the speed you can use it in. Also the range of the melee weapon and how much it uses your stamina are both elements you should pay attention to. For example, a sledgehammer can be used for long range but it has a big stamina cost which will get your character exhausted and most likely killed if you can't swing soon enough. And fire arms have their obvious differences damage, recoil, accuracy, reload speed etc. An important thing about firearms is to learn some of the bullet calibers so you can pick up the right ammo for your gun. (12 gauge, .22 caliber etc.)\n\nIf you are willing to go through some learning and a bit of frustration I assure you that you will not regret that descision and have fun in this game! That is my review and now I'd like to apologize about any grammatical and comma errors in the review. Thank you for reading :)","July 1, 2014","true","33.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","1"

You can even kill yourself, and steal other people's loot if they die before they even come back to get their items back! Awesome looking maps, and it's very fun to play with some friends.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Haxett/recommended/224260/","Haxett","Party Llama","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Haxett/","27 products in account","Axett's Review\nThis is my first review. Feedback is appreciated.\n\nAlso, GAME MECHANIC SPOILERS BELOW!!!\n\nI've played this game for a long time, and I still play it weekly with my friends.\nIt's also to go at it alone.\n\nFirst-off, I want to warn you, keep away from Friendly-fire ON and unlimited ammo servers, they are the worst for your enjoyment. Only go in Unlimited Ammo Servers if you need an achievement or want to work on your aim.\nFriendly-fire servers are full of team-killers and trolls. Only have FF on if you are with your friends and want to add in some "more realism".\n\n\nGraphically, the game looks pretty neat, and the sounds of the zombies are good. You can hear a zombie approaching you from behind (footsteps) and such.\n\n\nZombies\nThere are plenty of zombies to go around.\n\nYou have your common walkers, some slightly faster than others, with different walking animations, your slightly rarer runners, and of course, something you'd rarely see in a game and that I LOVE for the added realism, children. Children only scratch you, they don't bite and they also run.\nRecently the developers have also added soldier zombie. They have a helmet that decreases head damage. They might also drop supplies.\nThere are no player-controlled zombies, however, when a player dies, he can become a runner controlled by AI and attack other survivors. By observing a player's death, one can usually tell whether the corpse will raise or not.\n\n\n\nWeapons\nThe variety of weaponry is nice, and it still increases every now and then when updates are released.\nYou have melee weapons, firearms, explosives, and others, such as the bow.\n\nAll of the weapons have different weights.\n\nMelee\nMelee weapons have different damage outputs and stamina usage, and some are efficiently used in a certain way than others. For example, the fireaxe is very good if you charge the attack before striking the head of a zombie, usually resulting in an instant-showering-pop for a reasonable stamina drain, while a sledgehammer or a fubar is very efficient against multiple enemies standing next to each other if you use a 'quick' swing towards the head, usually killing several zombies at once, costing you however a colossal amount of stamina.\n\nOh crap, did I mention there's a chainsaw that consumes fuel?\n\n(Leaving a tip here, if you are meleeing a zombie, always BASH them away once you finish your hit if it didn't instantly die, because it still can and probably will hit you with its scratch attack!)\n\nFirearms\nYou have lots of firearms: pistols, sniper-rifles, rifles, submachine-guns, shotguns.\n\nThe only automatic weapons so far are the MP5A4 and the Ingram Mac-10, both submachine-guns.\n\nFirearms use different kinds of ammo.\nNot all of the firearms instantly kill on headshots (unless realism is activated).\nYou can check how much ammo your current gun has by holding your reload button.\nYou can kill yourself with your gun. :D\n\nThere are throwable explosives, such as the grenade, the TNT (huge range, keep away from it, seriously) and the molotov.\nThe molotov will lit zombies on fire. Zombies on fire can sometimes begin to sprint towards you, so yeah, you've been warned. Usually, bashing them away or simply walking (yes walking, not walking backwards though) away will be enough to let them die off.\nThere's also a flare gun! Zombies become darker and darker as they burn.\n\nFinally, you also have a bow... and you can pickup the arrows. Even if they are stuck on a zombie as they walk. :)\n\n\n\nHUD\nYou cannot see how much health you have (unless the server is modded), however, another player can tell you your name's color so you can have an idea. I believe 70+ hp is green, and it gets worse and worse until it goes red.\n\nThe stamina I speak of cannot be seen in the game, there's nothing on your screen that tells you how much of it is left, you can only know your stamina by hearing your breathing.\n\nPressing 1, 2 or 3 shows your weapons, ammo, and voice-commands respectively.\n\n\n\nOther Gameplay Features\nWeight:\nAffects how many items you can have in your inventory and how quickly you run out of stamina while running. Although I don't usually pay much attention to this, and correct me if I'm wrong, I've also noticed an increase in overall movement speed if the player has less weight.\n\nBleeding:\nWhen you suffer damage, there is a chance for you to start bleeding. This includes fall-damage as well, my friend fell from a vent and started bleeding on the FEMA map, luckily, there was a bandage under the bed.\nWhile bleeding, you start to lose 1 HP every few seconds. Bleeding can be cured with bandages or a first-aid kit.\n\nInfetion:\nWell you got bit... and suddenly some veins begin to surround your field of view. A few minutes later, you are completely blind, and within seconds, you collapse, only to raise and begin to feast on the other survivors (controlled by AI).\nIf you are infected, the best thing you can do is to shoot yourself in the head with a gun, yes, kill yourself, that way you won't ♥♥♥♥ people over. .-.\nOr you can just become a pill hog and rely on them until the end of the round... Yes, you have to take pills every few minutes, because they start to wear off. Oh, and be careful around infected players, you can kill them, and they can't kill you (unless friendly fire is already on the server).\nRecently they have also added a rare item that is very small and possibly hard for some to see called Gene Therapy, permanently curing your infection and making you immune. There is a chance for you to be partially blinded for 10 seconds or something around that though.\n\n\n\nMaps\nThere are lots of maps, that's for sure. They can be split into two big groups. You have your survival maps where you hold down somewhere for a certain amount of waves of zombies, with supply drops every few, and then you have your objective map, in which you do... objectives.\nSome maps also change objectives, which adds for replayability.\n\nCommunity\nBeing a realistic survival horror game, where zombies are actually dangerous, specially in large groups, teamwork is essential. A single zombie can screw you, simply due to the fact that you can get infected.\n\nBut the community... oh the community...\nLots of players that don't even speak english, so teamwork there is usually a no-no.\nOthers are newbies and don't listen to veterans, ending up dead and wasting a great amount of resources (ammo, medical items, ...).\nThen there's also mic-spammers.\n\nAll of the above are even more common in unlimited ammo servers, you've been warned.\n\nIn Realism mode + FF on servers for example, communication is extremely important, mainly because if there's no communication, players will just try to melee the zombies while pushing eachother / teamkilling by accident, or throw an explosive somewhere, killing others because there was no pre-warning ("Throwing a grenade!" -- The character says, but too late :P)\n\n\n\nPersonal notes\nIn other games I've always been slightly disappointed at the lack of children in the middle of an apocalypse. Well, immersion = fun for me. In an occasion, I've found a player who didn't want to shoot the children, saying it was too much for him. That was enjoyable to watch...\n"THEY AREN'T ♥♥♥♥ING CHILDREN, THEY'RE MONSTERS!"\n\nUpdates, although not frequent, are very nice. They recently revamped the medical system and I must say it turned out pretty good!\n\nThe zombie hitboxes need some more work. I've had occasions (and so have my friends) where I've shot the head several times but the bullet didn't insta-kill when it should have, sometimes even twice or more. This is slightly rare though.\n\nFeel free to add me, maybe we can play sometime!","December 22, 2014","true","174.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

Very little sound has been recycled from Half-Life 2, which is a good thing.\nGood looking zombies with realistic animations.\nTextures and Props are all custom and really good looking. Once again very little has been recycled from Half-Life 2.\nDevs seem to be updating this still and are adding more maps, all of which are pretty big and most look great.\nMaps design is damn impressive and they have a real zombie apocalypse feel to them.\nZombie AI is very good for a Half-Life 2 mod, they never get stuck and they can't be exploited.\nThe zombies are no threat on there own but when they gang up on you they kill you really quickly, this I like because it really adds to the realism.\nPlenty of weapons with nice reloading animations.\nNo HUD what so ever which is great.\nYou can get infected and your character will rise as a zombie when you die, awesome feature.\nMultiple playermodels with decent voice acting.\nZombie children.\nCons:\n\nThe Community - With this being a free-to-play game the community is not good, not good at all. Players in this game are beyond incompetent and never play as team. Most players will collect ammo they don't need, take weapons they can't carry and will never share medical supplies even if you're bleeding right in front of them while they're holding a bandage.\n\nNearly every player I've come across has no trigger discipline and will waste 30 rounds on a single zombie that isn't even in there way, they'll also stand in the middle of street and attempt to defeat the endless hordes because they think this is Call of Duty Zombies and that the objective is to kill every zombie they can see on screen before moving on.\n\nOverall the community is bloody terrible and will never help each other survive. Some players don't even do the objective they just sit and shoot zombies until they run out of ammo and die.\n\nModded Servers - Modded servers that allow you to spawn weapons and ammo are cancer to this game, blacklist them.","March 4","true","21.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Infyre/recommended/224260/","Infyre","Pyrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Infyre/","363 products in account","It's a zombie shooter. What more can you say?\n\nProbably one of the more realistically-geared shooters based on zombies out there. It's not your typical Left 4 Dead-style gameplay. There are no special infected zombies to be found here. The idea is simple - survive hordes of zombies with what you can. The best part? This is all free to do.\n\nYou must be resourceful in what you use and spare what you can. Normally, you see a gun and your first idea is to shoot every single zombie that's slowly making it's way towards you. Until you run out of ammo and realize that sometimes, there just isn't stockpiles laying around. You must conserve and strategically use what you've got in any gun you pick up, because it's not gonna last forever.\n\nThere are a varied set of maps to choose from and they all can be either easy or hard to do based on how big they are. Toxteth for example, can be done in less than 5 minutes compared to maps like Chinatown and Junction where they provide more of a challenge and may take longer. Also there is some homage maps, most notably "Night of the Living Dead" based on the movie with the same name. There are two modes in this game, Survival and Objective. Objective has you do a set of objectives in order to survive the map. Survival is where you're pitted in an area and the only way out is to battle wave after wave of zombies.\n\nThe zombies are your typical slow-walking, dead-looking beings wanting all of your flesh. Zombies can actually come at you in three speeds. Slow walking, speed-walking or limping and running. The running zombies are simply called "Runners" and while easy to take out, they can do heavy damage. In fact, zombies can do a lot of damage attacking you and it's varied which may or may not frustrate you. The only differentiation of zombies is that there are children zombies. Because this game focuses on a realistic-tone, zombies are capable of infecting you, with no cure around it. So it's best you make the time last while you can if there are no pills around.\n\nThe controls for this game is easy to get accustomed to. If you've played any Source-based games, this game's engine is built off of that so some of the controls is there while the gameplay plays like the other games built on Source.\n\nGraphics are decent and nicely detailed between some of the models of the zombies to the characters you use. You'll notice that some of the characters you use may look familiar. Notable examples are the Batesman, which looks like Christian Bale from American Psycho and that chubby guy with the yellow-tinted glasses has a similar appearance to John Goodman in the Big Lebowski. Nice touches. With the recent update (to date that I know of), you finally are able to play a female character amongst the sausage-fest cast of characters.\n\nYou have a variety of weapons, both melee and guns at "civilian level", to choose from to kill zombies with. Such weapons like a fireman's axe, a crowbar, a aluminum baseball bat, hatchets etc. Colt 1911, M16A Assault Rifle, Winchester Rifles etc.\n\nNow, I'm going to conclude that this game is actually good. Despite my previous reviews saying it's a piece of ♥♥♥♥. I know I've said that to get the community of this game riled up. It really is a fun game and I would have recommended it if you want a more realistic zombie shooter.\n\nHowever, I can't recommend this game at the same time and I'm sticking with that. Not because of the game itself, but because of the multiplayer aspect and community. You will find that a lot of servers are filled with infinite ammo which would defeat any challenge this game tries to give you. So your best bet is to use the filter function to get them out, but there is still a good amount of vanilla servers too.\n\nYou will be hard-pressed to find a decent team. A team that will focus on surviving than screwing around and making a big deal on how good they are or how they want to micro-manage things so that it's easier on them than it is for the whole group. So, you will find your fair share of teenagers with a superiority complex as well as elitist players telling you on how wrong you are at playing the game and how much of a noob you are. That isn't to say no nice players exist, but some do, it's just hard to find.\n\nAs well as you have to weed through the foreigner crowd who you can't understand for the life of them and are sortof responsible for a lot of the infinite ammo servers. It is because of all of these aspects, the community is really divided between noobs, elitists, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, foreigners and trolls. That's really a shame too because this is a fairly good game to play.\n\nLastly, this is coming from someone who had put in over 530+ hours into this game, so I know what I'm talking about.\n\nSo, just stick to your friends. Avoid the beehive that is the community. It is simply because of the multiplayer/community that I cannot recommend this game. Case closed.","September 16, 2014","false","636.8"," 148 of 276 people (54%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","54","148","276","11","11"

I like the fact their is 8 player co-op, but sadly hard to find people to fill up the servers. Decent amount of guns, love the ironsight feature wich lets you put that precise headshot to save bullets. what is wrong this game? nothing really.

When I downloaded it, I thought it was just another little demo or ripoff. I was totally unprepared for a game that rivals Left 4 Dead in sheer awesomeness! With 10 offical objective maps, and 7 or 8 survival maps, it never gets boring, especially since there's multiple different courses and objectives within each level. For example, on Lakeside, you might go down into the underground substation to reset the power to call for help, or you may just need to find a gas can and adjust the satellite dish. And that's not all! Tons of custom maps, from Sweden to Dodgeball (yes, it is a fully-functioning game of killing and dodging zombies - kudos to the maker) provide hours of entertainment. Also try Survival mode, a game type similar to COD: Zombies, complete with barricades and health crates.\n\nOh, and did I mention this is a MULTIPLAYER game? team up with up to 7 of your friends to smash some heads and take it seriously, or just ♥♥♥♥ around and talk about Walking Dead spoilers and watch that one new player try to kill every zombie in Manhatten (trust me, you can't do it. Just run through the hordes).\n\nThis is the only game I've played on my PC in almost two weeks, and with good reason. I highly recommend this game, because even if you don't have Internet connection, you can still try to solo a level, which is very difficult, but entirely possible.\n\nConclusion: don't waste twenty bucks on Contagion or Left 4 Dead (actually, L4D is great, too!), just get this game, which is amazingly well-made, for what used to be a Half-Life 2 mod and created by a very small team of maybe 20 people...\n\n9 OUT OF 10\n\nP.S.

Situations are set up with enough randomness to generate your own little zombie survivor moments. Sometimes you might find yourself split from the group, in the sewers desperately trying to catch up in the dark. As the low moans of zombies enclose around you. You may have a heroic moment where you think all is lost, before picking up the axe and cutting your way to the helicopter that's just about to leave you behind. The game has provided many players plenty of small zombie stories that wouldn't be possible in a highly scripted title. Sure the graphics aren't much but it conveys what it needs. The games a classic that never gets old, it has its issues though. Mainly with other players, either dropping or running around in circles. Working together, even loosely is key to surviving but regardless....\n\nWhen you're running towards a leaving train or a helicopter, times ticking down, zombies making a grab for you, you're falling behind..Panic is setting in, your team mates can't hear you. You get blindsided by a zombie who grabs at your weapon. You knock it away you're hurt, the world is grey. You limp your way towards extraction, do you make it in time?...\n\nWell that's up to you.\n\n(for added effect play any of the original zombie movies soundtracks in the background.

Gameplay feels alive all the time, you don't know where the enemies are, you got a stamina and health system you don't see.\nIt's fairy realistic most of the time.\n\n2. You actually gotta aim for the head most of the time, and this isn't a typical shooter based zombie game, you will actually need to switch to a melee weapon often due to the scarce of ammo, you will have to manage your ammo otherwise you won't get far.\n\n3. Inventory system that is pretty simple once you get used to, there are 2 inventories, you can drop items for other survivors or just drop them to pick another item up, Holding 1 will show up the items/weapons inventory, Holding 2 will show up the ammo/fuel/etc inventory.\nLeft clicking on an inventory item will consume the item if its a bandage, etc.\nRight clicking on an inventory item will drop the item.\n\n4. Several kinds of ammo in this game, each kind of ammo needs the correct weapon to work, you don't just pick up ammo and it would work magically with every weapon, this reduces ammo hoarding as people will generally only need to pick up ammo for a weapon they have rather than all the weapon, and encourages Co-Op so you can drop ammo that you don't need for others or can't use.\n\n5. The game soundtrack feels fairly alive, please be aware that the game is much better with friends and i found games where most people had a microphone (I only played the game in public servers with random people) the game did feel more enjoyable with people with microphones, however if you are going solo  like i did, it's still one of my favorite zombie games.\n\n6. Free, And made in the source engine which is optimized well, most PC's can run this game.\n\nCons:\n1. When joining a server, there will be an Advertisement sometimes on the top left, this is pretty damn annoying because when you click on Ok, sometimes it opens another Advertisement, so you might have to click Ok several times.\nNOTE: You don't have to click ok, first click on join game at the bottom right of the screen, if you aren't in the game dead or alive, then you are gonna have to click OK to close the ad's, this only happend to me once however, everytime i clicked Join Game i never had to click Ok and close the AD's.\n\n2. No friend add-system in the game, the only way you can add people is through the players option OUTSIDE the game, it dosen't work INSIDE the game, for some reason it dosen't show up as previously played with Inside the game, you have to exit the game, then click on steam's View > Players > Recently Played With > Then add whoever you want as a friend, or whatever you wanna do with them.\n\nI have wrote this review as honest as possible, i don't think i missed anything, but if i do i'll probably edit this out and fix what i missed.","July 5, 2014","true","48.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hollywoodlives/recommended/224260/","hollywoodlives","Hollywood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hollywoodlives/","486 products in account","I silently wend my way through derelict streets where the only light comes from the abandoned police cruiser  up ahead. I check to see how much ammunition I have left in my 686 revolver and it's almost full. Then I hear a slow moan come from the darkness on my right, so I flick on my flashlight to see how many of them are there. It looks like 5 of them but my light also picks up a glint of green and white on a small box, and that means 12 gauge for my Mossberg 500. The shamblers are already approaching and I take careful aim.  The first of the group falls with one shot, and I've already lined up the next. I fire and I turn her head into a canoe. As I slowly back up to keep distance, I realize that I've cornered myself. No matter though, as I have enough bullets to finish the fight.\n\nThe next two fall with each successive trigger pull and the last is two feet away. I fire and graze his ear... I quickly line up another shot and... click. ♥♥♥♥, I pull out my shotgun and bring up the sights... click. I realize that I forgot to reload after the last encounter.  Now it's too late and his teeth sink into my arm as I shove him violently away. I then pull out my machete and bury it into his skull. He slumps sideways and I step over his body to retrieve my spoils, but my vision goes blurry and my skin prickles and crawls. I know it's only a matter of time now before I share their fate and turn. I calmly walk over to the shotgun shells and take inventory. I have 10 shells now, which means I have 9 zombies to blow away before that last shell ends me... This scenario actually happened, and it's a new experience each time you play. This game is the closest thing to zombie apocalypse training you will come by.  The zombies are slow and traditional unless they have been freshly turned.  In which case they run quickly towards you and make it extremely difficult to line up that critical headshot.  Which also makes it more interesting when someone in your party gets the infection.  Do you take the time and effort to find the medicine that will slow the change and risk him turning into a speed demon? Or do you end it quickly and take whatever gear he was carrying. More than once I found myself infected and I wound up dropping all of the gear I had and sprinting headlong into a horde in order to buy my friends time to slip by.  It's those moments that make this game truly special.\n\nThe cardinal rule is also broken in this game, because it features zombie children.  They are few and far between but that makes encountering them all the more disturbing.  The guns are the most realistic I have ever played, and that is a true compliment.  Never before have I seen a better depiction than NMRiH. The models and animations are SPOT ON, as is the time it takes to reload.  You have to physically check your magazine to know an exact count if you've lost track, and that makes the tension rise.  Attention to detail is astounding, as the more you play the more you realize how much effort went toward making this beautiful game.  Forget realistic hunting simulators, if you're looking for gun porn it's right here. If you are using a mic in game people can only hear you when you are within a certain distance.  Zombie Apocalypse Simulator  has arrived and it is a joy to play.

The zombies are slow so its less of a fps like left 4 dead and more of a classic zombie survival, where things like bleeding, infection and hordes are the biggest problems. Now seriously you join a server and you wait in spawn, use your teammates as bait, why even rush for the medkits where u can just search ur dead mates bodies? watch everyone die in blazing glory as u just wait in spawn, so later you walk to the rescue zone with no zombies in sight. The only time I tryed to cooperate I made a really good job with some other guy, only to reach near the rescue zone and get bitted from behind by my zombie teammate, he tryed to warn me but while you are dead you can't comunicate with anyone.\nKids running to me to hit me and pale girls trying to bite my neck 10/10 like highschool all over again.","April 4","true","30.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","4","4","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Millionaire314/recommended/224260/","Millionaire314","KönigsTiger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Millionaire314/","36 products in account","I strongly suggest this game for several reasons.\n\nIt's fun, challenging, intense, and requires you to think. In a market oversaturated with mediocre zombie games, it spreads somewhat like a.. virus (Punny)? In all seriousness, this game is a breath of fresh air. Made by a small team of caring developers, this game is 7+ years in the making.\n\nTime, effort, and responsibility has been put into this game, and it clearly shows. You are NOT a juggernaut of invincible proportions who carries unrealistic amounts of ammo into the battlefield, with inhuman reloading speeds. Ammo is scarce, you are just as vulnerable as everyone else. Your best friends include the melee weapon in your hand, and yourself.\n\nThe risk of infection must always be taken into account. One wrong move could turn you into a liability to the team. Do you keep hoarding pills to stay alive? Or do you accept your fate and have your best friend put a bullet in your skull? Decisions, decisions. Scavenging is a huge factor as well, and with that comes weight. You can only carry so much. You're human. You only have two arms, and so many pockets.\n\nWith being human, that brings us to stamina. If you and I got up and went outside to find the world gone to pot, we wouldn't stand a chance. Nobody cares if you read Max Brook's Zombie Survival Guide. Nobody cares if you've "thought it out" and tell your friends where you'd hold up. Most of the people I know who say that are scared of the dark and check twice for a spider in their shoe. The zombies certainly don't care either. If you bash your weapon and swing it around like a helicopter, you're going to get tired. If you get tired, you can't run. If you can't run, you might as well get acquainted with your undead co-workers.\n\nThe only downside to this game is the community. As I said before, the game market is oversaturated with cookie-cutter zombie games that don't promote horror. Hell, even Resident Evil fell to that with 5-6. Okay, 5 was a good action game all around, but a horrible Resident Evil. 6? Well, 6 was just pure trash all around.\n\nBut my point; People are too used to these games. I'm not saying Left For Dead 2 is bad, I've clocked a few hours into the game. But this game is so radically different, nobody can seem to adjust to it. The community is awful. Servers are ALWAYS the following, making a good game nearly impossible to find;\n\n1.) High Latency (I live in PA, and even NY servers sometimes lag. It's the host's responsibility to port forward and insure a stable connection. They almost never do.)\n\n2.) Terrible Players (I realize that not everyone is an instant professional at this game, but it's been out for a long time. People with 2-3x the amount of hours I have put into the game can't even survive the first few waves without wasting all their ammo then running into a huge horde.)\n\n3.) Vacancy (The only servers you can find without terrible players are the ones with literally nobody in them.)\n\nOverall, this is an amazing game. I just wish that less inept players were part of it.","April 14, 2014","true","604.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This is one of the only zombie games in which you play as a fat guy fending off the undead. At laest that's the only reason that i can come up with as to why your character's movement speed is so appallingly slow. It also makes more attempts at realism by giving you a limited inventory with smaller and bigger items taking up a certain amount of space. In attition, there is quite a detailed level of item tweeking you can do. You have your melee weapons' heavy and light attacks, your gun's have safety switches, fire settings, ammo check and ironsight aiming. You have first aid kits, bandiges, anti-infection pills, torches, pipe bombs and molotovs. The one thing you don't have however, is a HUD which gives the impression that you are actually a person in the middle of a crisis. All in all, there are certainly worst free-to-play games and four player co-op is available as well, so that's nice.","May 7","true","77.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OriginalIDlolz/recommended/224260/","OriginalIDlolz","Zyroxer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OriginalIDlolz/","50 products in account","This game is a masterpiece. Even though it might not appear tobe much on the outside, after all, it is a Half-Life 2 mod, it is surprisingly fun, and never really gets boring. You have a wide array of guns at your disposal, along with unique melee weapons, from kitchen knives to chainsaws. There are two gamemodes, objective and survival.\nObjective has you and a group of other survivors get from Point A to Point B, while completing objectives along the way to get rescue. Survival has you and other survivors defending zones from waves of zombies, with scripted supply drops.\n\nOne of the best aspects of this game is it's focus on teamwork. While objective is possible to solo, it is still hard, and survival is practically impossible without a team. Where it really becomes noticable is in certain objectivd missions, though.\nFor examples, Cabin has you hooking a car battery up to a generator to call for rexcue, except the generator is surrounded by zombies, requiring one of the survivors to grab the battery, and the others protect him.\n\nAnother aspect is that this game is actually quite difficult. Ammunition tends to be scarce, requring you to only take shots that you really need to take, instead of just mowing down hordes with a run-n-gun strategy. Every time a zombie bits you, you have a chance of bleeding or infection. Bleeding does damage to you over time, and can only be stopped by bandages, while infection is permanent, and can only be put off for three minutes by taking pills.\n\nOne of the best loadouts is the SKS, Beretta M9, and Baseball Bat.\n\nPlay this game, it is absolutly fantastic.","February 15, 2014","true","102.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Began to think with the fact that first before her to add to your library (and it is free), I thought well, the usual zombie shooter, the trailer was impressed, well, decided to add, loaded and immediately went to the game, like the very melody that played in the main menu , sincere and giving to understand that all is not lost, okay conspiracy. First, and this is my favorite map Broadway, as soon as she walked in, the first just listened to the atmosphere of the game, it is just amazing, it is on this map, you hear as somewhere to fly a helicopter, howling zombies, people screaming, shots a couple of blocks from the you, police sirens are moving away from you ... and you're just after a while you realize that no one will come to save you yourself must be chosen and seek a way out of this terrible place.Tell for more on the game mechanics in this game you do not will kill all the zombies quickly and a couple of shots in '' Left 4 Dead 2 '', there is a real hardcore and if you do not like him then you are not at that-well go on, all the weapons in the game is well balanced, no such weapons which will all kill with one shot to shoot accurately in the head and save ammo, they are at a premium, the same way the cold steel about to say, the protagonist named swing long he can not, he just gives out and you will eat the zombies, or you can still infect and after a while you'll attack your teammates, and even your character a lot will not be able to bring things in your inventory, something will have to throw out, take a little of everything, and what you are most useful, is also the game has a variety of characters, though their identity is not disclosed, but there is a variety of cards pretty enough, they are divided into two categories, those where you need to perform the mission is to survive waves of zombies and deterrence, as well still have another card made polzavatelskie only the fans of the game, after going through all the original maps, custom maps can try, well, this want to summarize the + and -\n+ Atmosphere\n+ Co-op\n+ Zombie apocalypse\n+ Interesting Achievement\n\n-Realism (You will be killed,eat up or you become one of them)\n-Beginners Difficult to master in this game, a couple of days you need to play is to understand what's what\n\n\n\n\nЭто самая хардкордная игра про зомби-аппокалипсис,в которую,я когда либо играл,и моя самая любимая. Начать думаю с того,что сначало еще до того как ее добавить в свою библиотеку(а она бесплатная),думал ну обычная зомби стрелялка,трейлер впечатлил,ну решил добавить,загрузил и зашел сразу в игру,понравилась очень мелодия которая играла в главном меню,душевная и дающая понять что еще не все потеряно,ладно заговорился. Первая и моя любимая карта это Broadway,как только зашел в нее,первое просто прислушивался к атмосфере игры,она здесь проста восхитительна,именно на этой карте,слышишь как куда-то летит вертолет,вой зомби,крики людей,выстрелы за пару кварталов от тебя,полицейские сирены которые отдаляются от тебя...и ты лишь через некоторое время понимаешь что тебя никто не придет спасать,ты сам должен выбираться и искать выход из этого ужасного места.Расскажу по подробнее об игровой механике,в этой игре у вас не получится убивать всех зомби быстро и парочкой выстрелов как в ''Left 4 Dead 2'',здесь самый настоящий хардкор и если вы его не любите то вы не по адресу,что-ж продолжу,все оружие в игре хорошо сбалансировано,нету такого оружие которое будет всех убивать с одного выстрела нужно стрелять точно в голову и экономить патроны,они здесь на вес золота,так же само и про холодное оружие хочу сказать,главный герой им махаться долго не сможет,он просто выдохнется и вас сожрут зомби,или вас могут еще заразить и вы через некоторое время будете нападать на ваших товарищей по команде,а еще ваш персонаж много не сможет взять с собой вещей в инвентарь,что-то придется выкинуть,берите всего понемножку и то что вам больше всего пригодится,так-же в игре присутствует выбор персонажей,хоть их личности не раскрыты,но уже есть разнообразие,карт довольно таки достаточно,они разделены на две категории,те где нужно выполнять миссии что-бы спастись и сдерживание волн зомби,так же еще есть еще пользавательские карты сделанные исключительно фанатами этой игры,после прохождения всех оригинальных карт,можете попробывать пользовательские карты,ну и на этом хочу подвести итоги + и -\n+Атмосфера\n+Кооператив\n+Зомби-аппокалипсии\n+Интересные ачивменты\n\n-Хардкор(вас убьют или загрызут)\n-Новичкам сложно освоится в этой игре,пару дней нужно поиграть что-бы понять что к чему","January 17, 2015","true","124.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","1"

Its immense important on team work makes the game much more enjoyable. Virtually everytime I play objective maps, I find myself making new friends. This game also somewhat builds character. It puts players on the spot on what to do in a given situation.\n\nThis game is not a 'Run and Gun' game like Left 4 Dead. It's very slow paced which hightens suspense.

You must play this game or at least try it, the levels will get you hooked until you complete them. (They're quite difficult)\n\nIf you enjoy this game as much as be you'd agree with my 9/10 rating, the only downside is that because it's a mod they're limited with physics and it'd be nice to see some graphical improvements.","July 24, 2014","true","26.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But I was wrong. The Pace of this game is a lot slower than in other zombie games, but that`s not a disadvantage at all. The Zombies can`t run and only get dangerous in big groups, when they corner you. There are guns in this game, but mainly you will use infight-weapons to survive the apocalypse. At the beginning this might seem a bit strange, but after a couple of tries you will eventually figure out how this game works and then the fun begins. You feel like playing one of the "Living Dead" movies of the great George Romero and as the title of the game already indicates, that is totally the purpose.\n\nThere are the official "Story" maps, where you fight your way through the level to an extraction point and there are the survival maps, where you just got to defend yourself and defeat waves of zombies to succeed. I personally like the story maps much more, but survival can also be fun for a short time. The story maps also got different targets, which guide you through the map and there are 2 oder 3 alternates for every map. Sometimes you got to fight your way through a cinema and a another time you have to pass a small and dark passage. To reach the end of the level you also get quests like to use fuel to activate a car or to destroy a barricade or to activate a switch to open a gate.\n\nIn the story maps there are also special infects: The mature runners and the children zombies, both can run and are a lot quicker than the usual zombies. At the end of a mission you will see more of them and they can be a real danger for your survival. In General it can be said, that you will die pretty soon after a few hits. A special thing in this game is that every hit of the enemies can make you infected. The less life you got the higher the chances to get the disease. Sometimes you are unlucky after the first hit, sometimes you can survive a couple. After you are infected you can take pills to buy yourself some time, but if you are infected just once you cannot finally cure your disease and must rush towards the exit.\n\nWhat I still have to point out is, that this game can be played by up to 8 Players at the same time, so that it is great fun in multiplayer. A little negative aspect is that, there is an substantial number of players online, who do not really understand the game and do not speak a single word of English. But I guess that`s the case in a lot of f2p games.\n\nResult: Even for money I would definitely recommend this game to literally every zombie fan or friend of coop games. The Developers published it f2p, so there are no excuses at all to not play this game.\n9/10\n","February 12","true","36.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The graphics are not that great but its a mod. The game has objective mode and wave mode. I love the wave mode, because it is what i think a zombie game should be like. The objective makes you kinda of feel like you are in a zombie movie. If you are on a normal sever, ammo is scare and you depend more on melee weapons. This makes it alot more challenging, and you take a lot more care. There is also the fact that you can bleed out and/or get infected. You cant play as the zombie though but this make the objective easier for the rest of the survivors.\n\n10/10 would give a great game a great review again.","August 21, 2014","true","61.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

To those who don't know, NMRiH is a zombie survival-horror game that intensifies the experience of an actual zombie apocalypse. Weapons and supplies are scarce, so you can't just charge through each level and blast any zombie that comes your way to pieces, along with almost every corner of each level engulfed in darkness. Strength is in numbers, making going it alone rather difficult with the crowds of the undead trying to stop you dead in your tracks. (no pun intended) And getting bit by one of these zombies will cost you dearly, for within seconds begins the process of turning, so you won't be blessed with the gift of immunity. Despite all these factors that must be taken into consideration, it's a fun game to play with anyone, and is a challenge to those who find L4D or any other zombie game too based on action or too easy.

You need to be aware of everything around you and where you are. This game pushes you to the limits when it comes to teamwork. There is absolutely no way to win this if you dont work as a team. You need to defend zones or do specific tasks in order to survive the zombie apocalypse. This is probably the most realistic zombie game you will find. If you like survival games you will love this game. It a great game to kill some time and play with friends. It is also one of the hardest games ive ever played. Its going to take a while before you successfully survive or escape in a map. Once you know what you're doing though, its incredible fun.\n\nPros:\n-You need to coordinate with your teammates. I see this more as a pro than a con, but I know some people will see it as a con when you get teammates who are just wasting ammo and dying. But being forced to work together whether its with strangers,friends, or both makes the game realistic and really give you the feeling of "i cant survive the zombie apocalypse alone, i have to work with people i may never meet in real life"\n-Realistic environment\n-Really requires you to think about what you are doing\n-Variety of weapons\n-Tons of zombies to kill :D\n\nCons:\n-The characters have no personality. You can choose from voice sets but no personality slightly makes the game feel less realistic.\n-No variety of characters. Most wont see this as a downside But all the characters are male caucasian adults besides one who is african american. No old survivors or young survivors, no females. They are working on a female character but for now this is a pretty noticable downside.\n-Beginners will be turned off by long respawn times in conjunction with them dying multiple times. This comes with a lot of games but most dont have really long respawn times which is the next round, which can last up to ten more minutes if your teammates are having trouble and dont have the items to start hunting.\n\nI definitely recommend the game even with those cons. The characters cons arent too big a problem and easy to get over and theyre very small points. In terms of long respawn times, yes incredibly frustrating but once you know what you are doing you can survive multiple rounds without dying.","March 23, 2014","true","73.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Gotta hold off for about 10 hordes of zombies to get evac.We hold off for a while with melee weapons and pistols.Then we found a flare gun and around 25 flares and we got an airdrop for EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE FLARES.i had around a thousand shotgun rounds.there was a kitchen in some house where the sink was just 45 acp rounds and it looked like some dark ♥♥♥♥ water. mate had a cz with a room full of ammunition(literally a counter was dedicated just for 7.62 ammunition).there was a table with unknown amount of m16s full of ammo.i was personally having such a blast with my automatic shotgun when evac came i literally got sad and wanted to kill more zombies.that was the easiest game i ever had.after every wave we still had an arsenal of weapons and a 2 zones with supplies of every sort","March 30, 2015","true","140.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

But I was wrong. The Pace of this game is a lot slower than in other zombie games, but that`s not a disadvantage at all. The Zombies can`t run and only get dangerous in big groups, when they corner you. There are guns in this game, but mainly you will use infight-weapons to survive the apocalypse. At the beginning this might seem a bit strange, but after a couple of tries you will eventually figure out how this game works and then the fun begins. You feel like playing one of the "Living Dead" movies of the great George Romero and as the title of the game already indicates, that is totally the purpose.\n\nThere are the official "Story" maps, where you fight your way through the level to an extraction point and there are the survival maps, where you just got to defend yourself and defeat waves of zombies to succeed. I personally like the story maps much more, but survival can also be fun for a short time. The story maps also got different targets, which guide you through the map and there are 2 oder 3 alternates for every map. Sometimes you got to fight your way through a cinema and a another time you have to pass a small and dark passage. To reach the end of the level you also get quests like to use fuel to activate a car or to destroy a barricade or to activate a switch to open a gate.\n\nIn the story maps there are also special infects: The mature runners and the children zombies, both can run and are a lot quicker than the usual zombies. At the end of a mission you will see more of them and they can be a real danger for your survival. In General it can be said, that you will die pretty soon after a few hits. A special thing in this game is that every hit of the enemies can make you infected. The less life you got the higher the chances to get the disease. Sometimes you are unlucky after the first hit, sometimes you can survive a couple. After you are infected you can take pills to buy yourself some time, but if you are infected just once you cannot finally cure your disease and must rush towards the exit.\n\nWhat I still have to point out is, that this game can be played by up to 8 Players at the same time, so that it is great fun in multiplayer. A little negative aspect is that, there is an substantial number of players online, who do not really understand the game and do not speak a single word of English. But I guess that`s the case in a lot of f2p games.\n\nResult: Even for money I would definitely recommend this game to literally every zombie fan or friend of coop games. The Developers published it f2p, so there are no excuses at all to not play this game.\n9/10\n","February 12","true","36.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. Completely and truly freeeeeeeeeee. That fact alone gives no excuse to not try this game out.\n\nRealistic zombies (they look lonely, give one a hug :3). Realistic jumping (bunny hop). Realistic fatigue (nooo no no no nononono pick your arms up pickyourarmsup hit him hit him HIT HIM!). Not-so-realistic arrow flight paths (completely straight at any range? no drop? wut.)\n\nRight off the bat, anyone will notice that this game has a particularly high difficulty curve. Pretty much gotta hit the ground running with this one. It's a good idea to look up all the controls, items, effects, and statuses BEFORE playing it. Check out the wiki while downloading it, but be prepared for a LOT of reading.\n\n"But isn't there a tutorial?" Not an in-game one. In fact, what pops up these days is a link to the wiki! When I first started, I didn't know what the hell I was doing (didn't have the link back then). I got killed within 5-10 minutes EVERY FREAKIN' TIME! Then I got mad, looked up what I was doing wrong, said,"Ohhhh...", then I went and completed my first objective map. xD\n\nThis ain't Left 4 Dead. It's not fast paced, the zombies are VERY strong, you are VERY weak, and runners are your WORST nightmare. That said, it's still VERY fun, just like L4D. Just fun in a different way. :)\n\nPros:\n\n+Plenty of adrenaline when you know you could die to pack of runners every time you turn a corner\n+High difficulty curve keeps many of the "12 year olds" away (I run into one every now and again, though)\n+Realistic gameplay\n+FREE\n+Head popping (fits in with realistic gameplay, but deserves a plus on its own :)\n\nCons:\n\n-High difficulty curve (You gun git rekt.)\n-ADS!!!!! It's a free game. The developers rely on ads and donations ( :( there's never enough) The ads can be VERY annoying\n\nQ&A:\n\nQ: Worth it?\nA: Duh, it's free. I know what you mean, though. "Is it worth my time?" HELL YEAH, come on in, newcomer!\n\nQ: Difficult? How difficult?\nA: Refer to Con #1.\n\nQ: Zombies, right? I can just shoot 'em, right?\nA: Sure, if you have a gun, can find ammo for it, and are a good enough shot to pop 'em in the head.\n\nQ: So you said I gotta look up everything about this before playing it... Ain't nobody got you know whatever.\nA: Trust me, you're gonna be hurtin' if you don't. There's no real story or spoilers or anything like that, so it's a very good idea to run yourself through the basics.\n\nQ: No story? What's the point, then? I mean, even L4D had some slight plot it followed.\nA: True, but once again, this ain't L4D. The point is survival against very bad odds by yourself or with your fellow survivors. The high difficulty makes success feel oh so good.\n\nTry this game out for about a week. Takes about 3 days to get used to it, I think. Still don't like it? Hey, it's free. No harm done. Purty sure it'll grow on y'all, though. :)\n\nGood luck!\n\nP.S.: In the event of infection, please refer to Wheaton's Law. Blatant teamkilling isn't funny when about 3 minutes later one realises they could've used the extra help.","March 20","true","162.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

First of all, it's a must play for everyone who loves this kind of games: Left 4 Dead or Killing Floor. This FREE game is just amazing. You start without a clue how to survive and progress on maps and a little bit later you find yourself truly enjoying killing zombies, planning your equipment and doing objectives. Playing No More Room in Hell with full party is great fun but even with less players you won't have any less joy. What can you expect more from survival game filled with zombies? Amazing atmosphere, great music and cooperation in order to do something - sure, you can wander around alone but that's not the point. With so many maps (official and fanmade), achievements, few difficulty levels, you can spend in this game MANY hours. Look at me. At the time I made this review I had on my count around 24 hours spend playing - and I feel like it's just beggining and there is much more for me to learn on how to survive in No More Room in Hell.\n\nPS. Did I mention that No More Room in Hell is FREE game? With that kind of games, the best you can is test it out and see yourself if it's something for you.","December 26, 2015","true","25.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. Completely and truly freeeeeeeeeee. That fact alone gives no excuse to not try this game out.\n\nRealistic zombies (they look lonely, give one a hug :3). Realistic jumping (bunny hop). Realistic fatigue (nooo no no no nononono pick your arms up pickyourarmsup hit him hit him HIT HIM!). Not-so-realistic arrow flight paths (completely straight at any range? no drop? wut.)\n\nRight off the bat, anyone will notice that this game has a particularly high difficulty curve. Pretty much gotta hit the ground running with this one. It's a good idea to look up all the controls, items, effects, and statuses BEFORE playing it. Check out the wiki while downloading it, but be prepared for a LOT of reading.\n\n"But isn't there a tutorial?" Not an in-game one. In fact, what pops up these days is a link to the wiki! When I first started, I didn't know what the hell I was doing (didn't have the link back then). I got killed within 5-10 minutes EVERY FREAKIN' TIME! Then I got mad, looked up what I was doing wrong, said,"Ohhhh...", then I went and completed my first objective map. xD\n\nThis ain't Left 4 Dead. It's not fast paced, the zombies are VERY strong, you are VERY weak, and runners are your WORST nightmare. That said, it's still VERY fun, just like L4D. Just fun in a different way. :)\n\nPros:\n\n+Plenty of adrenaline when you know you could die to pack of runners every time you turn a corner\n+High difficulty curve keeps many of the "12 year olds" away (I run into one every now and again, though)\n+Realistic gameplay\n+FREE\n+Head popping (fits in with realistic gameplay, but deserves a plus on its own :)\n\nCons:\n\n-High difficulty curve (You gun git rekt.)\n-ADS!!!!! It's a free game. The developers rely on ads and donations ( :( there's never enough) The ads can be VERY annoying\n\nQ&A:\n\nQ: Worth it?\nA: Duh, it's free. I know what you mean, though. "Is it worth my time?" HELL YEAH, come on in, newcomer!\n\nQ: Difficult? How difficult?\nA: Refer to Con #1.\n\nQ: Zombies, right? I can just shoot 'em, right?\nA: Sure, if you have a gun, can find ammo for it, and are a good enough shot to pop 'em in the head.\n\nQ: So you said I gotta look up everything about this before playing it... Ain't nobody got you know whatever.\nA: Trust me, you're gonna be hurtin' if you don't. There's no real story or spoilers or anything like that, so it's a very good idea to run yourself through the basics.\n\nQ: No story? What's the point, then? I mean, even L4D had some slight plot it followed.\nA: True, but once again, this ain't L4D. The point is survival against very bad odds by yourself or with your fellow survivors. The high difficulty makes success feel oh so good.\n\nTry this game out for about a week. Takes about 3 days to get used to it, I think. Still don't like it? Hey, it's free. No harm done. Purty sure it'll grow on y'all, though. :)\n\nGood luck!\n\nP.S.: In the event of infection, please refer to Wheaton's Law. Blatant teamkilling isn't funny when about 3 minutes later one realises they could've used the extra help.","March 20","true","162.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you get bit, you have a high chance of infection. If you DO become infected, pills will slow it down, but it's inevitible. You're GOING to die. Ranging from a fire extiguisher to a machete, melee combat is great. Ammo for a gun is also hard to find, which is nice because it is realistic.\nHonestly, the only thing that I believe could make this game better is if they added a "free roam" mode, where you were able to just survive in a small or large town/city, scavenging for supplize like food and water, which you would bring back to your safehouse. But alas, this game does not have that.\nIt started out as a mod and has grown way past that.

This is not a game like Left 4 Dead, all you do in that game is waste ammo, tons and tons of ammo. But here, here you need to work with your teammates, save ammo, and i always have a plan. But unfortunatly there are a lot of newbs and trollers so you cant have a good time playing the game. If you want a good experience, try playing with your friends, on a private server, thats the only solution to playing the game like it was meant to be played. The game has some up's and down's, like the new map Junction, well i have a glitch or a bug whatever it is,  i see everything purple, wich is anoying. I think this game needs more players, and i mean good players not the ones that will just hit you or waste all your ammo, im talking about players who work with their teammates. If NMRiH had that...

You want a new zombie apocalypse game... You want to relive the carnage of death and the storm of lead fired from guns, burrowing into mutated former people that want your BRAINS!!! Something like Left 4 Dead or Killing Floor, right?\n\nThen this game is not for you! Why? Because No More Room in Hell tries its very hardest to be the most accurate visualisation on a realistic zombie apocolypse. And it does it so very well!\n\nHow? First of all guns are scarce and ammo for said weapons even more so, so say good bye to the gun totten ways of L4D! The game focuses on making use of what you have around you, no gun store or supply shed, later KF! The melee is intensive, with the weight system making you decide whether to have the heavy zombie killers and give up your mobility? Or the light weapons which put your life in danger at every swing, but allow you to make a quick escape?\n\nThere are no special zombies which can spit acid or climb walls, or even just freakishly large ones which eat a ton of lead. Just walkers, runners and children. That's right, children! What? Do you think once the apoclypse begins children are just going to become immune or simply vanish?\n\nThese are some of the things that make me love this game! Of course there is so much depth to the game which Im not going to show here, but for such a great game to be free, who wouldn't download this!\n\n10/10","May 31, 2014","true","100.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","3"

It is very fun, however it suffers from problems that make it incredibly frustrating at most times, and other moments laughable. No more room in a hell is a SURVIVAL CO OP game, you need teammates, and you need ones that are willing to communicate with you. Most players will take everything in a room preventing you from supplies you need. However you can't fault the game for it's players. The games main mode is objective mode. It's fun, and gives you purpose, but at times the missions, can be challenging especially when new to the game. However once you get, an understanding of the games mechanics you will be able to do these missions with some effort, and cooperation. I would not attempt doing these until you know how to play the game first, unless you don't mind spectating. These missions can be done alone, and when done you get a really good sense of accomplishment. On the other side of the games content. are the survival missions. They are fun, addicting, and as they can be a challenge. You work with your team to defend, an area, against waves of zombies. So far i have had, a lot of fun with the game it is very addicting, and i will play a whole lot more. My score is 9.5/10, and it’s free. Never can go wrong with free there is no reason to not download this game. Bring friends, and for the love of god search up a video, on how to play the game, it will make it a ton more fun.","January 23, 2014","true","80.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","4"

This sensation is hard to come by nowadays. Most people aren't willing to sacrifice their body the our true lord Satan, who gives me permission after the sacrifice to fondle the remnants. I have sacrificed all of my friends and family already, so trying to sacrifice a complete stranger would be a bit awkward. Fortunately, virtual reality steps in and brings my fond childhood memories to life.\n\nNormally these shooters cost money, which in my opinion, does not make me moist. I used to be able to receive the sensations from the trailers and demos, but I had a craving for more. Unfortunately, I haven't figured out which bodily fluid to go in which slot on my computer, but eventually I will be able to deposit some money. For right now, No More Room In Hell has satisfied almost all of my cravings and twisted desires, and heck, the graphics can look booty-laceratin' good with a beefy computer.\n\nOverall, I'd give it a 9/10.

The survival mode surely is way too cheap. The zombie AI is too bland and gives no real challenge at all. Waiting for waves with few zombies, easily bested in a few min will quickly get boring...\n- Too little objective mode maps. Obviously I understand that there is more effort needed into objective maps. However the objective maps surely are the most entertaining part of NMRiH.\n- Good textures, weapon animations and level design. I really can't complain on the quality made there.

My friends are terrible at this game but we have a laugh killing zombies and spectating each other afterwards.\n\nIt does feel very realistic and it succeeds at not crossing the line between realistic and fun.

When L4D turned out to be more along the vein of 28 days, it would be a lie to say I wasn't a little disappointed.\n\nNo more room in Hell is the best zombie game I've ever played. Mainstream titles have been reluctant to follow the classic Romero zombie formula and NMRIH fills that great big gap. Although it's clunky it's perfectly playable and heaps of fun -headshots only, scarce ammo and zombie bites make for an incredible and tense experience.\n\nThe game's free so there is absolutely no reason not to check it out. One can hope that this mod will blow up and one day have it's own fully fledged retail release.","December 29, 2013","true","26.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Well with this only a single  bite can make you turn if you do not treat it imedietly.\nNo More Room in Hell features proximity-based voice chat, meaning only teammates and zombies near you can hear you, a stripped-down HUD, limited ammo, and a lot of teamwork is needed if you want to survive some of the maps. I absolutley recomend you to try this game especially if you got a friend or two to play with.\nWith all thos good things there are also some bad things about this game. To start wiht tha animations sucks. Your guy runs around like he ♥♥♥♥ his pant. A lot of bugs with the hitboxes and a lot of lag whith servers. But keep in mind that they are fixing these things and it will get a lot better!\n\nMy final thought: If you like FPS games with Zombies then get this and play with your friends!

The level design could do with some work, I've noticed some areas on maps that are just ridiculous and not well suited for the mods style of gameplay. However the settings it portrays are realistic and very immersive. The atmosphere is created very well not only from the map design but also from the sounds, the lighting as well as the gloomy soundtrack in the background. It all creates for a eery and perfectly matched apocalyptic setting.\n\nThe core gameplay mixes dependant on the gamemode and maps and other aspects. Most of the time you'll be doing pretty much the same thing, but it can get pretty intense and NMRIH does well to remind you just how realisitcly challenging a zombie apocalypse could really be. You'll have to spare ammo to other surivors or saviour your firearms for when you really need them. You'll have to quickly decide what tools and weapons to take as you only have a set limit of items you can carry. You'll have to learn to identify ammo types and weather or not you need them for your weapons or not. You'd be wise to avoid combat with zombies unless you really need to...\n\nThat last bit of advice goes without saying, the melee system in this mod is flawed. If you can manage it, you'll be lucky to club a zombie around the head as hard as you humanly can (forceful blunt weapon trauma to the head clearly isn't the way to KO a zombie) and get away with it.  Most of the time, you'll get grabbed and be forced to shove the zombie off of you, before realising that you've almost instantantiously been infected from barely seconds of being throttled...\n\nPersonally I'm all for realism but NMRIH really fails to deliver a satisying approach to the melee and survival approach when you've been, pardon my French, "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tted" by a mere shambler despite how full your health is or despite your best efforts to redecorate a zombies face. The melee system isn't rewarding in the slightest, it's damn right awkward and just ridiculous. The way around I found is to charge up your attack, then carefully execute an attack from behind or at a distance. A lot of livid fans have spoken up and mentioned that this adds to the realism. It doesn't. It makes the gameplay an annoying struggle. The concept of little ammo and salvaging precious items is fun, but badly made melee combat in a zombie apocalypse game that offers that concept of combat more, over firing precious rounds is scandalous.\n\nI guess in a sense, it adds to the realism of how difficult a zombie outbreak really is. There are servers that offer infinite ammo if you do get sick of every other player stealing the goods or just being selfish, these servers are usually pretty fun to play on and still offer a challenge as you can't sprint around and you still have the realistically slow reload times. Other than that, the gamemodes offer, or rather push the players to test their survival skills as well as teamwork capability. However when so many players are used to being the lone wolf, it's often hard to succeed in this area. The gamemodes are rather fun and do offer a challenge and be you lucky to make it to the end - you might be met with a satisfying achievement!\n\nThe mod feels fantastic, I personally love immersion and atmosphere. I've often been terrified when turning round to see a zombie spawn out of no-where right behind me - even after double checking the area was clear. I kid of course, I won't punish this mod any further, but the child zombies - yes if you've not played NMRIH yet, there are child zombies (Which I personally found quite interesting considering it would possibly bring controversy, however it didn't... so good job guys :D). NMRIH definitely brings a fresh experience to the zombie apocalypse theme, however nothing ground breaking. If you're looking for a fairly substantial and "realistic" experience, NMRIH might just be for you.\n\nOh and it's free, so it really won't hurt you at all to pick it up and have a shot ;) (Unless the mods flaws ♥♥♥♥ you off xD)\n\nA good mod that really still needs a bit of tweaking to make things more enjoyable, however it is a solid and well created mod. I recommend this game to zombie lovers and fps fans, also realism lovers too.\n\nI rate NMRIH a 7.1/10","April 6, 2015","true","23.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I am a lifelong zombie afficionado. I love zombie related games, movies, and all things of the walking corpse variety. That being said there is only one thing I have to say about this game. This game is a zombie lover's dream. It's pretty spot on for the look and feel of the things that made the genre great. There's that feeling of isolation,  having to counting your ammo, being forced to rely on people you may not like in order to survive, and of course hordes of the walking dead coming at you at all times. In my opinion it is a game made for fans of the genre by the fans of the genre. Although anyone who enjoys a good game should most assuredly give it a shot as well. There are a few things that need a little more polish but the developers of this game are active in it's community and seem to be always continuing to make this game even better. Even if you don't like the counting the ammo aspect of this game there are more than enough private servers on this game with infinite ammo enabled to get rid of that problem if it isn't your thing (I for one enjoy having to count my shells from time to time because of the challenge it represents). I love how each weapon has it's own distinctive feel (even if it's only a subtle difference) and the little details on each map that displays how much time was put into this game to make it awesome. There's nothing bad I can find to say about this game other than the movement of the players is interesting to watch to say the least.","March 5, 2014","true","31.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The maps are very well detailed and the lighting is excellent. It doesn't even feel like a source engine game at times. The animations are okay but some of the voice acting is bad. I never once noticed a dip in framerate.\n\nThis mod's biggest problem is the clunky mechanics and bad/nonexistant lag compensation, even with a low ping. Most of the melee weapons are total crap but even they are better than the guns. You always want to aim where a zombies head is going to be, not where they are.

I absolutley recomend you to try this game especially if you got a friend or two to play with.\nWith all thos good things there are also some bad things about this game. To start wiht tha animations sucks. Your guy runs around like he ♥♥♥♥ his pant. A lot of bugs with the hitboxes and a lot of lag whith servers.

Your character can get tired from running or swinging melee weapons too much, which adds realism. You can delay an infection with pills and use bandages to stop bleeding. I recommend this to all zombie fans that haven`t played it. It is a unique game in the genre. And everything in the game is free, so there's no reason not to try it.","February 15, 2014","true","172.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Depending on the gamemode, survival being my favorite, You usually spawn with some supplies, and need to find more around the map. a hammer and boards are practically essential, by placing 2 of usually 3 boards, your team is usually able to either crouch-jump over them or crouch under them, all while leaving the Zeds outside. careful though, even though i am somewhat against it, there are runner zombies and kid zombies. runners chase you down and try to grab you. kid zombies can run as well, however they cant grab you, only hit you faster than the rest.\n\nits a great game, and its FREE!!! have fun and good luck, maybe we'll meet sometime?","February 3, 2014","true","36.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So the mod holds a dear place in my heart because of what it opened up for me. I have to admit I like the mod better than the full game, but the full game is just as fun and I enjoy it greatly. NMRIH is one of my all time favorite zombie games. I love the realism in the game. If there was a zombie apocalypse to ever break out, I feel like this game shows how it would really be. Ammo is rare, and you have to rely on a melee weapon most of the time. I love playing with my friends and having the team work to complete the game, and trying your best to survive as long as you can.","February 26, 2015","true","25.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","4"

The level design could do with some work, I've noticed some areas on maps that are just ridiculous and not well suited for the mods style of gameplay. However the settings it portrays are realistic and very immersive. The atmosphere is created very well not only from the map design but also from the sounds, the lighting as well as the gloomy soundtrack in the background. It all creates for a eery and perfectly matched apocalyptic setting.\n\nThe core gameplay mixes dependant on the gamemode and maps and other aspects. Most of the time you'll be doing pretty much the same thing, but it can get pretty intense and NMRIH does well to remind you just how realisitcly challenging a zombie apocalypse could really be. You'll have to spare ammo to other surivors or saviour your firearms for when you really need them. You'll have to quickly decide what tools and weapons to take as you only have a set limit of items you can carry. You'll have to learn to identify ammo types and weather or not you need them for your weapons or not. You'd be wise to avoid combat with zombies unless you really need to...\n\nThat last bit of advice goes without saying, the melee system in this mod is flawed. If you can manage it, you'll be lucky to club a zombie around the head as hard as you humanly can (forceful blunt weapon trauma to the head clearly isn't the way to KO a zombie) and get away with it.  Most of the time, you'll get grabbed and be forced to shove the zombie off of you, before realising that you've almost instantantiously been infected from barely seconds of being throttled...\n\nPersonally I'm all for realism but NMRIH really fails to deliver a satisying approach to the melee and survival approach when you've been, pardon my French, "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tted" by a mere shambler despite how full your health is or despite your best efforts to redecorate a zombies face. The melee system isn't rewarding in the slightest, it's damn right awkward and just ridiculous. The way around I found is to charge up your attack, then carefully execute an attack from behind or at a distance. A lot of livid fans have spoken up and mentioned that this adds to the realism. It doesn't. It makes the gameplay an annoying struggle. The concept of little ammo and salvaging precious items is fun, but badly made melee combat in a zombie apocalypse game that offers that concept of combat more, over firing precious rounds is scandalous.\n\nI guess in a sense, it adds to the realism of how difficult a zombie outbreak really is. There are servers that offer infinite ammo if you do get sick of every other player stealing the goods or just being selfish, these servers are usually pretty fun to play on and still offer a challenge as you can't sprint around and you still have the realistically slow reload times. Other than that, the gamemodes offer, or rather push the players to test their survival skills as well as teamwork capability. However when so many players are used to being the lone wolf, it's often hard to succeed in this area. The gamemodes are rather fun and do offer a challenge and be you lucky to make it to the end - you might be met with a satisfying achievement!\n\nThe mod feels fantastic, I personally love immersion and atmosphere. I've often been terrified when turning round to see a zombie spawn out of no-where right behind me - even after double checking the area was clear. I kid of course, I won't punish this mod any further, but the child zombies - yes if you've not played NMRIH yet, there are child zombies (Which I personally found quite interesting considering it would possibly bring controversy, however it didn't... so good job guys :D). NMRIH definitely brings a fresh experience to the zombie apocalypse theme, however nothing ground breaking. If you're looking for a fairly substantial and "realistic" experience, NMRIH might just be for you.\n\nOh and it's free, so it really won't hurt you at all to pick it up and have a shot ;) (Unless the mods flaws ♥♥♥♥ you off xD)\n\nA good mod that really still needs a bit of tweaking to make things more enjoyable, however it is a solid and well created mod. I recommend this game to zombie lovers and fps fans, also realism lovers too.\n\nI rate NMRIH a 7.1/10","April 6, 2015","true","23.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

From the start I thought that this game was just another one of this free to play games that think they are good. But I turned out to be wrong after all! There's just so much to do in this game, and the objectives are kind of hard when you've progressed in the game. There's no "campaign" really, the game is made for co-op so I recommend playing this with friends. 10/10 really fun to play this game, why? Because: Okay lets but it this way, the graphics are not the best, but the gameplay is a lot of fun. Especially with friends. You get to choose weapons in the start, but only a limited amount of weapons, and mostly meele in the start so it makes it harder and more realistic. Your main objective in the start depends on the map, but mostly it's to brake through something or escape something. There's much action, once you're back on the streets, zombies are everywhere.

In all my experience of playing this game, only like 2 times I won an objective map and once I won a survival map. To expand a little, objective maps place you and your buddies in a series of mostly linear events, whereas survival maps are about holding a certain area off from the zombies which get harder every wave. First few waves you get slow, easy to kill zombies, then you get a tad bit stronger zombies with slight chances for some zombies to have the ability to run, then you get even harder zombies with the chance to infect you and rarely a little zombie kid who hits you and runs away. Oh, and when you get infected, you can either tell your team that you are infected so that they can kill you, find and swallow a pack of pills to stop your transformation into a zombie or just suicide by pointing your weapon, say, a pistol, at your head.\nWeapons are pretty rare in this game, like their ammo, but what I found best was using an axe, a sledgehammer or, best of all, a tomahawk and just hold your primary attack button to charge your swing. You can weild with certain weapons a flashlight, and that's where I say that the best weapon in this game is the tomahawk, because it's small, deals a pretty nice amout of damage, and it's also the only melee weapon that you can use your flashlight with (but if you count your fists as melee weapons then it's the second only melee weapon with which you can carry a flashlight). When I said that the tomahawk is small I said that because there is also a pretty nice inventory system, where you can either hold a sledgehammer and an axe and nothing else and move super slow, all your healthpacks, bandages, flashlights and pills with an unlikely chance of having a pistol/tomahawk and a shotgun with ammo aplenty. In this game, you don't have a HUD most of the time, but you do have your ammo bar show up whenever you check how much ammo you have left in your clip by holding down the reload button (and occasionally shouting like an idiot that you have 6 shells left in your shotgun). And you can choose which character you want to play as and what voice to have.\nThe only downside in the game is that the community can be a little bit bad at some times but if you play with your friends, you will have a ton of fun! And just as I'm writing the review I remembered that you can also have a hammer with which you can nail planks on walls and windows, and that the same hammer is, in my opinion, a direct upgrade of the tomahawk since it does a little bit more damage, has the same inventory space and you can hold a flashlight with it.\nTL;DR: This game is fantastic, and above all else, it's FREE!","February 11, 2014","true","36.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I also really like how you can't buy anything on this game that gives you an unfair advantage over other people so it makes everyone equal. Plus if you get bored of playing this you can always buy admin which adds even more fun to it. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes FPS shooter games and zombies. Most free games aren't that great but this one is definitely worth it.","October 28, 2014","true","395.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I am a lifelong zombie afficionado. I love zombie related games, movies, and all things of the walking corpse variety. That being said there is only one thing I have to say about this game. This game is a zombie lover's dream. It's pretty spot on for the look and feel of the things that made the genre great. There's that feeling of isolation,  having to counting your ammo, being forced to rely on people you may not like in order to survive, and of course hordes of the walking dead coming at you at all times. In my opinion it is a game made for fans of the genre by the fans of the genre. Although anyone who enjoys a good game should most assuredly give it a shot as well. There are a few things that need a little more polish but the developers of this game are active in it's community and seem to be always continuing to make this game even better. Even if you don't like the counting the ammo aspect of this game there are more than enough private servers on this game with infinite ammo enabled to get rid of that problem if it isn't your thing (I for one enjoy having to count my shells from time to time because of the challenge it represents). I love how each weapon has it's own distinctive feel (even if it's only a subtle difference) and the little details on each map that displays how much time was put into this game to make it awesome. There's nothing bad I can find to say about this game other than the movement of the players is interesting to watch to say the least.","March 5, 2014","true","31.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In all my experience of playing this game, only like 2 times I won an objective map and once I won a survival map. To expand a little, objective maps place you and your buddies in a series of mostly linear events, whereas survival maps are about holding a certain area off from the zombies which get harder every wave. First few waves you get slow, easy to kill zombies, then you get a tad bit stronger zombies with slight chances for some zombies to have the ability to run, then you get even harder zombies with the chance to infect you and rarely a little zombie kid who hits you and runs away. Oh, and when you get infected, you can either tell your team that you are infected so that they can kill you, find and swallow a pack of pills to stop your transformation into a zombie or just suicide by pointing your weapon, say, a pistol, at your head.\nWeapons are pretty rare in this game, like their ammo, but what I found best was using an axe, a sledgehammer or, best of all, a tomahawk and just hold your primary attack button to charge your swing. You can weild with certain weapons a flashlight, and that's where I say that the best weapon in this game is the tomahawk, because it's small, deals a pretty nice amout of damage, and it's also the only melee weapon that you can use your flashlight with (but if you count your fists as melee weapons then it's the second only melee weapon with which you can carry a flashlight). When I said that the tomahawk is small I said that because there is also a pretty nice inventory system, where you can either hold a sledgehammer and an axe and nothing else and move super slow, all your healthpacks, bandages, flashlights and pills with an unlikely chance of having a pistol/tomahawk and a shotgun with ammo aplenty. In this game, you don't have a HUD most of the time, but you do have your ammo bar show up whenever you check how much ammo you have left in your clip by holding down the reload button (and occasionally shouting like an idiot that you have 6 shells left in your shotgun). And you can choose which character you want to play as and what voice to have.\nThe only downside in the game is that the community can be a little bit bad at some times but if you play with your friends, you will have a ton of fun! And just as I'm writing the review I remembered that you can also have a hammer with which you can nail planks on walls and windows, and that the same hammer is, in my opinion, a direct upgrade of the tomahawk since it does a little bit more damage, has the same inventory space and you can hold a flashlight with it.\nTL;DR: This game is fantastic, and above all else, it's FREE!","February 11, 2014","true","36.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you want to avoid that, however, you could always join a server with !guns enabled. The !gun servers allow you to pick a gun a melee weapon and a few grenades. This would most likely avoid the conflict with screamin little kids.\n\nNow, to the game itself. This game has nice graphics for a 4-5 year old game, gives you a creepy feeling if you are alone in a hallway, not knowing what would happen next. You get ambushed by a few zombies, but you still manage to beat the living Shrek outta dem. You join back with your team with very low health, another bite and you would be dead, so you hang back and run away from fights while shouting on the mic: "SAVE ME SENPAI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"\n\n\n8/10 Nice Game\n-5/10 Screaming Kids\n10/10 Exploding Zombie Heads While Using Shotgun\n1/10 ♥♥♥♥♥ takes all the ammo\n3/10 Team mates suddenly turn to zombies and murder you D:","January 21, 2015","true","20.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

However, when I played the game, I was amazed by the gameplay, attention to detail and little 'easter eggs' thrown in here and there. It's a pretty team-based game because when you play objective mode, you have to stick with your group or else you run the risk of becoming overrun. As far as being realistic, this is the most realistic zombie FPS that I've played thus far.\n\nA word of advice, however. Finding a good group is difficult, at least it is for me, and in my experience once you find a good game people start to lag out or simply leave the game and the quality of the team goes down substantially.\n\nAll in all, this is my favorite zombie game on PC, and maybe even my favorite zombie game of all time.","June 4, 2015","true","30.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However, the learning curve is a bit too steep and keeps people from coming back (according to global achievements, only 30% of all players have even bothered to press "R"). As the levels require teamwork, its very difficult to find quality players to actually finish maps. Combine this with having to wait to get into servers, and this game can get very frustrating very fast.\n\nAside from that, its a free game and the gameplay is great when you've got a good team.

Not only it is the old fashioned zombie game without any weird mutating zombies, but because it has a certain feel of urgency when there are twenty four zombies walking toward you and you have only five bullets left. It also makes you think for the team, because even if it is possible to survive for a short period of time without any teammates, it isn't survivable for long. The infection and bleeding effects are also great addition to the experience. If you are infected, and in relatively safe location with your teammates, you can cause a lot of trouble, when you turn.  There is nothing more stressful than being with your friends and no meds, it makes you think how to save at least them from you, and thats when realism comes to play, what would one do in this kind of scenario?

And it's a lot of fun. Some of the game modes are a little unclear, but you can kill a lot of zombies, with ammo being in a seriously short supply, resulting in the use of melee weapons. Sometimes this can be mind-numbingly frustrating, but you're hardly likely to stumble across a box of shotgun shells in a patch of grass in real life now, are you? You can also bleed, only prevented by using bandages, also in short supply, as well as be infected, which can be slowed by either using pills, or gamble by being cured by using gene therapy- yes it's a cure, but if you're really unfortunate, can blind you. Some of the voice acting is hilarious, but it's the only way to tell which character you've selected. Your viewpoint is that of a skinny white guy with a white buttoned shirt with his sleeves rolled up- hardly immersive if you've selected a female with a sleeveless shirt now.","January 3","true","37.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game means so much to me that I am personally paying more so that I can feel as though I am helping the developers (Canadians (I think?) that seem so helpful on forums, by the way~) I am really at a loss to what I should say, for experiencing the game yourself will be all the more useful; my words can't do it justice.\n\nAlas, I do realise that a review should be more than ♥♥♥-kissing. So, let's turn on the jazz, grab some Monster, and discuss No More Room in Hell a little more.\n\nThis game is not perfect; this should be an expectation void from every game, though. While I, personally, find this slow, co-op-orientated zombie-smashing game fun, I do concede that this would seem strange (if not plain unenjoyable) to someone more inclined to a game like Left 4 Dead. NMRiH  is, by no means, one were ammo can be squandered; to make this fact apparent, join any nightmare server running survival maps. You must think about the shots you make, your stamina, your health and the health of those around you, what's behind you... In essense, I feel as though you will enjoy this sort of atmosphere if you like long-term goals, tense points and the relief that will follow. An added bonus to this slower, staggered gameplay as opposed to L4D is that the weapons mean a lot more. A shotgun decimating 2 zombies in a row feels impactful, meaningful; not many games can boast this feeling, at least to me.\n\nThere are more superficial complaints that I have heard (third-person animations, voice acting, etc.) that I really do not feel like arguing over. My philosophy on this matter is that if you enjoy the core gameplay of a title, you can look over a lot. Through the updates still applied to this game, I can only expect that NMRiH will improve.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go hit some of these zed sods with a shovel.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CarlPlus/recommended/224260/","CarlPlus","Carl+","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CarlPlus/","1016 products in account","A perfect example of a hardcore zombie experience that works\nSo I'll start by saying the game is 100% free! That means no microtransactions, paid DLC or marketplace to buy skins so you can't really complain.\nThis game started as a Half-Life 2 Mod but is literally a full conversion, there’s not much that still remains from Half-Life 2 in terms of weapons, characters, gameplay features and animations.\nThe game is designed to be a hardcore experience, limited resources, ammo, guns, a weight system that forces you to make choices on what you will keep and what will work better for in the long run. In a few hits you can go from being perfectly healthy to dead, either just from being hit to much, bleeding or worst of all.... Infection. Now there are medical supplies to help aid in these effects like medkits, bandages, Infection Pills and even a cure but they can be hard to find when needed the most but that’s part of what makes the game so enjoyable is the realistic experience it provides. It forces teamwork, ammo and supply conservation and many other things.\n\nThere are 2 modes, Objective and Survival. Objective is basically a campaign mode where you need to complete objectives and escape. This is a great mode and really fun to play co-op or with many other players. There are about 9 levels that offer different experiences and challenges, some very difficult with never ending zombie hordes that require quick navigation around the hordes and the objectives themselves.\nSurvival is the typical round by round mode that lasts for 10 rounds with a increasing rate of zombies. Not to fun on your own but enjoyable with a few others.\n\nProfessional level animations, hardcore features like no HUD, manually unload your guns and checking of your ammo means you need to be aware of how many rounds you have fired or face the consequences.\n\nThe only things I can say against it is, it would be cool to have more Objective maps or a proper campaign but I know how much work that can be, let’s hope they are working on a No More Room in Hell 2 for that :P there’s defiantly a market for hardcore zombie games.\nThe other is the achievements... as someone who cares about achievements, aka "completionist" I like to be able to complete all achievements but some of these are just far to time consuming or unrealistically hard, I feel as though when designing an achievement the developer should try to complete it themselves before they add it. I'm not sure that was the case for some of these, for example: "You like a good challenge? Engage 1000 zombies in fisticuffs and win" and "Complete the following maps with AT LEAST 6 players without losing a single safe zone or incurring any casualties: Favela, Northway, Flooded, Isolated, NotLD, Ransack" yeah..... the last achievement has a 0% global completion rate which means no one has 100% of the achievements for this game which is just not good enough.\n\n7.8/10- A Free, Fun, Realistic and Hardcore zombie experience, unrealistically designed achievements :/","September 23, 2015","true","80.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are multiple maps with their own unique set ups. The gameplay MAIN modes are PvP, Objectives, and Survival. Within the gamemodes there are a variety of plays to it, an example would be the Dodgeball match. There is one thing that I would like to see more to No More Room in Hell, and that would be a more variety on zombies in game. I can understand that the Developers want to keep this as realistic as possible, but it wouldnt hurt to try to put in a zombie who has been a test subject to scientist  and what so ever. Overall, the game is really good. Graphics are not the best, but better than most zombies I have played.

And it's a lot of fun. Some of the game modes are a little unclear, but you can kill a lot of zombies, with ammo being in a seriously short supply, resulting in the use of melee weapons. Sometimes this can be mind-numbingly frustrating, but you're hardly likely to stumble across a box of shotgun shells in a patch of grass in real life now, are you? You can also bleed, only prevented by using bandages, also in short supply, as well as be infected, which can be slowed by either using pills, or gamble by being cured by using gene therapy- yes it's a cure, but if you're really unfortunate, can blind you. Some of the voice acting is hilarious, but it's the only way to tell which character you've selected. Your viewpoint is that of a skinny white guy with a white buttoned shirt with his sleeves rolled up- hardly immersive if you've selected a female with a sleeveless shirt now.","January 3","true","37.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You will play again and again untill you finish one mission with all your friends alive :DD\nGood luck doing part 8.

Other's are just plain out unhelpful and or play dumb\nThere are only a couple of standered modes which can get boring after a few hours\nSometimes objectives on  NMO  can become highly unclear making Objective mode difficult at times\nSo Compak is the game  Rad or Bad?\nThe game is deffinetly Rad .

Not only it is the old fashioned zombie game without any weird mutating zombies, but because it has a certain feel of urgency when there are twenty four zombies walking toward you and you have only five bullets left. It also makes you think for the team, because even if it is possible to survive for a short period of time without any teammates, it isn't survivable for long. The infection and bleeding effects are also great addition to the experience. If you are infected, and in relatively safe location with your teammates, you can cause a lot of trouble, when you turn.  There is nothing more stressful than being with your friends and no meds, it makes you think how to save at least them from you, and thats when realism comes to play, what would one do in this kind of scenario? The answer was simple, the game has won my heart when i felt real fear when i pressed the button and the gun was turned toward my head.\nI would recomend this game anytime and to anyone.","November 2, 2014","true","142.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","1"

There are multiple maps with their own unique set ups. The gameplay MAIN modes are PvP, Objectives, and Survival. Within the gamemodes there are a variety of plays to it, an example would be the Dodgeball match. There is one thing that I would like to see more to No More Room in Hell, and that would be a more variety on zombies in game. I can understand that the Developers want to keep this as realistic as possible, but it wouldnt hurt to try to put in a zombie who has been a test subject to scientist  and what so ever. Overall, the game is really good. Graphics are not the best, but better than most zombies I have played.

If not the best.\nIt's challenging, ammo and health are in short supply, you take more than a sliver of health every time you're hit, and some melee weapons feel heavier and bulkier than others, meaning it's harder to swing them around. This game is fun to play with strangers, but the best to play with friends.\nAlso, dicking around with sv_cheats 1 doesn't ruin the game. It opens up exploration if you're stuck and lets you discover easter eggs you can only find by using cheats.\nTL;DR: Fun game with friends and sv_cheats 1 doesn't ruin it.","November 30, 2014","true","27.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It got to the point where he (I'm assuming it was a he) responded with flippant, sarcastic remarks to almost every one of my comments while I was trying to be respectful and serious. I wondered to myself the age and maturity of this developer. It was really disappointing to see that kind of poor attitude from a game developer and it put me off playing this for awhile. That experience doesn't reflect my opinion of this game but it makes me a whole lot less likely to support them in the future.]\n\nNMRIH is a curious game. If you dissect and examine it by its individual flaws and merits, it should be a failure, as the negative aspects appear to outweigh the postives. But when put together I think the adage, “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts” seems to apply appropriately.\n\nLet's look at what I mean. We'll start with the bad. First, the game has severe hit detection problems. Like basically broken. You can have your gun perfectly aimed at a zombie's head, fire, and still miss. Why? The developers have stated that the game lacks "NPC lag compensation". So a moving zombie might not be where they appear to be. They'll be a little off. Their heads also seem to have small hitboxes. Ok this sounds like a huge problem right? A badly coded first-person shooter where you can't hit the enemy consistently because the game is unable to display their correct location? Many people might stop right here and look for another game. And I wouldn't blame you. But yet this seemingly monumental flaw doesn't kill the game. Not really.\n\nThe vast majority of the zombies are the slow moving type right out of a Romero film. That makes up for the lag problem some. The few that are fast run straight at you so the aiming isn't too much of an issue. It's usually when the zombies are moving sideways that it's harder to hit them.\n\nYour melee attacks are also affected by the lag and it will definitely be frustrating at first. You will miss A LOT and get grabbed and bitten a bunch but with practice you learn how to swing each weapon at the right moment to compensate for it (mostly).\n\nMelee range is another issue with the game. Some of the ranges are inconsistent or just plain don't make sense. For instance, you would expect that holding a lengthy object in your hand would naturally extend your reach. But strangely your fists have the longest range of all. Their attack power may be weak but their range seems to be superior to all weapons. Using the flashlight as a weapon has the shortest reach even though it looks like it should give you an extra foot of melee range. Is this logical? No. Does it detract from the gameplay? Again, not really.\n\nI think herein lies the irony. The game thrives on its difficulty. And make no mistake it is hard. You won't know where to go or what to do at first. Your guns never have enough ammo. You will most likely fail and die. But the difficulty of it makes it challenging and these broken features make it more difficult and challenging which adds to the experience. If you were going around chopping heads off like it was nothing, like you were in L4D2, the game wouldn't be as fun. I still want them to fix the broken features, but it kinda works in this game.\n\nAnother gameplay element introduced in NMRIH is proximity chat where players' mics and text have limited range and if you wander too far away other players can no longer hear your mic or see your text chat. There are walkie talkies you can pickup in the game that allow your mic to be used anywhere on the map (other players need the walkie talkies too in order to hear you) but nothing for text chat which is unfortunate because not everyone has mic (like me) so if you're too far away from everyone you are basically cut off from any communication. I'm not really a fan of this feature.\n\nAlso when you're dead you cannot communicate with people still playing. I really don't like this at all because many times you have players who don't know what they're doing and they just wander aimlessly all over the map for what seems like forever and there's nothing you can do to help them because you can't voice or text chat with them. Be prepared to spend a lot of time waiting to play in this game or leaving and joining other servers.\n\nThe game also has magically respawning zombies. Like teleporting right before your very eyes. Blah.\n\nSo, given all the negative stuff I mentioned I still think the game's ok. Because the challenging nature of it is addicting (and also prone to make you ragequit). The atmosphere is dark and spooky. The levels are well designed. The child zombies are a nice creepy touch. When you die and restart, the previous objectives you had routinely changes so it doesn't feel stale. It takes patience to play and truly feels rewarding when you manage to survive and get rescued. And best of all it's free.\n\nWould I recommend this if it wasn't free? Based on the crude attitude of some of the devs and their inability to fix the broken gameplay, the answer is a resounding NO.\n\nBut since it is free you should give it a try and don't give up right away when you notice the game's flaws. Try to play through an objective-based game (There are two game modes, objective and wave. I recommend objective more.) See if you like it. And if you end up hating it, well, I totally understand that too.","July 18, 2014","true","166.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The game is using the HL2 engine, the physics, the movement mechanics, and the object interactions are all the same.  This game is not for the faint of heart and it is ESPECIALLY not for people looking for a L4D alternative.  The game is challenging and more realistic that most zombie survival games (though not as randomly specifically realistic as DayZ).  If you are willing to work at the game, you will have a blast.\n\nFirst things first, the game is gritty and buggy.  The controls are solid and consistent.  There aren't a ton of keybinds to memorize, so the basic movement/fighting/shooting/interaction isn't hard to pick up.  That being said, there is no hand holding in this game.  You can do things like board up a window or door, but to do so, you have to have the right materials and tools (which they don't tell you).  However, they did try to make things intuitive.  For example, to board up a door, you need a hammer (which is both a tool and weapon) and boards (SURPRISE!).\n\nThis leads to the UI.  I feel like the UI needs a bunch of work.  It's not bad, just difficult and unforgiving in terms of use.  For example, in one of the game modes, you hold a location and try to keep zombies out in a wave style format.  However, my team mates died and I was the only one left.  Upon being overrun, I respawned in 5 seconds and my team mates did not.  There were no indications of why or how they were to respawn.  Upon looking through the keybinds (while hiding behind a door so the zombies couldn't get me), I found that there's a suicide button (how morbid).  Upon using it, the entire round ended and everyone was respawned (but why?).  Without knowing that, most people will just leave because spectating some guy getting ripped to shreds by zombies and respawning over and over gets boring.\nThings like boarding up doors is also unintuitive.  You may be looking at the spot you want to board up, but it won't actually nail the board in unless you look at a different spot, leaving you frantically waving your mouse around until your hands decide that the time is right to settle down and board up your base.\n\nThe guns and explosives are varied and interesting.  I really like the attention to detail they put into the varying ammo requirements and how the guns reload (for example, reloading a six shooter takes longer than a magazine fed M1911).  They also varied how the weapons handle (the six shooter is single action, so you must pull back the hammer each time), which only adds to the realism and becomes a serious consideration when choosing weapons.  The explosives are actually explosives (obvious statement is obvious?), I killed myself by accident expecting the explosions to be (as per usual) flashy but with a small radius.  Instead I got tossed across the room and died.  Nice!\n\nThe game feels more like a true survival game.  You have a limited amount of inventory space (you can't even hold unlimited amounts of ammo, each bullet takes up a certain amount of weight), so you MUST choose what you take and what you leave behind.  Want to load up on guns?  Too bad!  They take up a realistic amount of weight, so you cannot carry 9 shotguns, 5 LMGs, 2 pistols, and 10 grenades.\n\nNow for the hard part, multiplayer.  The multiplayer aspect isn't bad.  It was designed to be co-op, which is both a great and terrible aspect.  Because of the realistic nature of the game, the CO-OP part is key.  If you find yourself playing with pugs, you are likely to not get far.  However, if you have a group of friends working together, the game because a new and challenging obstacle filled with close calls and frantic shouting for reinforcement.\n\nThe game is solid enough to be playable and with the gigantic FREE sign on it, it actually becomes a very good game (you get AAA titles that have the same problems, but you pay $60 for them?).  The game definitely needs some refinement, but it is definitely playable.  If you enjoy a challenge (and aren't looking for the feel good jaunt through a field of zombies), this is definitely a game for you!  And at the low low price of ZERO dollars, order now and get it for all of your friends!","August 26, 2014","true","8.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This rare gem here is called No More Room In Hell and it offers a real challenge which leaves you deciding on how to use your ammo wisely, always steadying your aim, always watching your back because of tough zombies that can only die by the brain & many other challenges.\n\nI usually don't enjoy much zombie games anymore but this is a rare gem that I put a few hours into and I'm enjoying it, My only con to this game is that it's impossible to join a server and if you do luckily join a server just be sure that the lag doesn't kill you. Overall this game is amazing and it's way better than what other zombie games have to offer. (I forgot to mention that the music is awesome & I apologize for not pointing out that No More Room In Hell is a mod)","November 6, 2013","true","7.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Limited ammo, limited supplies, limited health. Sounds are ok. When you hit zombies with melee attacks it really sounds like you are hitting human flesh (Not like L4D, Zombies are like paper). Its also unforgiving, no regenerating health (most survival games today is like ♥♥♥♥ing CoD zombies where you stay back and regain health...♥♥♥♥♥♥♥). The only problem is the animations haven't changed since I played back in 2011 (HL2 Mod).\n\nAlso I have nothing against L4D its a great game too but CoD I have no respect for it (except the older titles CoD 1,2,3,4,5)","November 25, 2013","true","7.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
