The only "quests" that you receive are basically just "go to the next level and defeat the boss", nothing more. The villagers that you 'rescue' or acquire from clearing the levels have absolutely no impact on the game. They are just trophies who wander aimlessly in your village, walking on water and spouting nonsense. There's a moderate amount of classes to choose from, which is nice, but some are clearly outshined by others. For example, the vampire is a pretty weak class compared to the wizard who is extremely powerful compared to the rest. Each class has the exact same equipment, which I can only chalk up to laziness.\n\nI was fascinated by the game at first until I realized all of these points mentioned above. I like rogue-like games, but this game honestly needs some polishing. As far as I know, there's not even a Hard difficulty setting, only Easy and Normal. I don't hate the game, but I probably won't be clearing all stages with all classes after beating the game, since it has gotten redundant by now.\n\nHere are my suggestions as to how the game could be improved:\n\n- Make class equipment more unique. Seriously, it's pretty lame to have every character with a weapon that shoots fire or freezes enemies. It shouldn't take much creativity to come up with something less generic.\n\n- More difficulty settings. I'm a sucker for unfair challenge, and I can never understand when game developers don't implement a brutal, hard difficulty option in their games. It shouldn't be a difficult task and it will surely please hardcore gamers.\n\n- REDO THE VILLAGE. I don't even want to look at it, it's hideous. Aside from the villagers being pointless drones walking around (on water I might add, for some inexplicable reason), the quest system serves no purpose either. If you're gonna have a quest system in your game, MAKE ACTUAL QUESTS and not just a pointer saying that I have to kill the evil mushrooms in the next level, which is the only thing I can do anyway!\n\nThis could be a good game if it was more polished and had more content and effort put into it, but as it stands now, I wouldn't recommend it, especially not for 15€.","November 25, 2014","false","14.3"," 75 of 88 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","75","88","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rph133/recommended/311720/","rph133","Skye","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rph133/","790 products in account","PROS:\n*Great variety of skills across unlockable classes\n*Balanced combat, with perhaps some minor exceptions\n*Persistent upgrades for health, experience, etc. across playthroughs\n*Dungeon sizes are just right\n*Amusing, somewhat dark story and dialogue\n*Three difficulty settings that can be changed at any time, the last of which changes enemy behavior instead of merely increasing health or damage\n*Good art and music\n*Changing weapons and armor affects character appearance\n*Monetary incentives for finishing each level with each class\n\nNEUTRAL:\n*Optional town-building elements have no practical value\n\nCONS:\n*Enemy variety is a little disappointing; many are re-used across the game\n*Some classes feel weaker or less versatile than others\n*One boss is used three times\n*A couple of enemies are not well-designed\n*Balance issues on later levels on savage difficulty\n*Perhaps too long\n*Only a handful of environments\n*A few harmless bugs\n\nGAME LENGTH:\nWith the new savage difficulty update, achievement hunters could easily need over 20 hours to finish.  Those who simply want to finish the game with a single class could need as little as 4 hours.\n\nSCORE:\n7.8 out of 10\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the player has only a single class (farmer) and no special equipment.  By finishing levels, the player unlocks new classes (warrior, archer, rogue, vampire, and wizard), each with 4 unique and appropriate skills that genuinely make them feel different.  By opening chests, he unlocks mostly class-specific equipment in the shop that, once purchased, is permanently available for future runs.\n\nItems don't boost damage or defense directly, but affect gameplay.  Weapons might recover a small amount of the player's health upon enemy kills or cast chains of fire, armor might simply offer more health or recover health upon breaking pots, accessories might boost fire damage or give a 20% chance to revive with full health upon death, and consumables might heal health or stamina or turn all nearby enemies into pots.  The variety of consumables here is excellent and, while I would not say the same about the weapons, armor, or accessories, they still provide players with strategic options:  maximize damage and area of effect, prolong survival, or stop enemy movement.  Finally, if the player finds any of these items during a run, he has the option to discard or equip it immediately.  If it's a consumable item, he can use it, keep it (only one at a time), or sell it on the spot.\n\nCombat is turn-based, with the player always moving or attacking first and all enemies moving second simultaneously.  The player can use a normal attack that costs no stamina or one of his four skills, which cost anywhere from 1 to 3 stamina out of a pool of 5.  Since killing any enemy recovers 1-2 stamina, almost all non-boss enemies die in one or two hits, and skills have no cooldown, combat consists largely of skill usage, unlike in games where the player is forced to use normal attacks most of the time or drink mana potions just to be able to use skills.  This does wonders for the feel of combat and lets the uniqueness of each class shine.\n\nThe player obtains skills upon leveling up, which grants a single point.  The first three skills are immediately available and max out at the third upgrade while the fourth skill unlocks at level 5 and maxes out at the second upgrade.  Most skills feel useful and each upgrade definitely is.  For example, the archer's first skill allows him to shoot any visible enemy at level 1, but the next level grants him a 5% bonus (and at level 3, a 10% bonus) to critical hit chance for every empty square around him.  However, the developer kept balance in mind, so the player cannot simply upgrade the same skill with each level.  The archer must wait another level or two before he can get his second upgrade and then another level before he can get the third.  Of course, the player's level is reset after death or killing that area's boss.\n\nThe game is split into 10 areas, each with a quest connected to the story, though that quest always comes down to defeating a boss.  Dungeon sizes are fairly small, consisting of 5 or fewer floors of varying sizes, including a floor devoted to that level's boss.  All of this means that, while there is a lot of game here, the player is only forced to sit through a few levels at a time, allowing him to return to town to spend money at the shop for persistent upgrades or to stop playing if he has other things to do.  This feature and the constant use of skills in combat make the game perhaps a bit more casual, but that is not unwelcome.\n\nUnfortunately, despite being broken up into 10 levels, the game drags on a bit, especially if one is interested in completing every level with every class, which is a requirement for some of the achievements.  This is largely attributable to a lack of enemy variety.  From the first to the last level, slimes make up the majority of enemies, and while different slimes have different properties on death (exploding or leaving residue behind that might cause damage), it becomes tedious to deal with them constantly.  In fact, they even come in larger varieties that spawn three smaller ones on death, some of which leave behind residue that spawns more of them if the player does not walk over that residue.  (On savage difficulty, they create three times more residue, which even further compounds the problem!)  It does help that every enemy has its own unique property, like a goatman that charges or a frog that can pull the player or other monsters to it, but most enemies are used from the early game all the way to the end.  For story-related reasons, one boss is even used three times in a row.  Little variety is bad enough, but it's worse when one feels like he has been fighting the same monsters for the entire game.\n\nAdditionally, I have to question the design of some of the enemies.  First, there is a fish that spawns with a connected, identical companion.  The two must be killed at the same time, otherwise they immediately respawn.  The trouble here is that the player may lack equipment or skills that do damage over an area, either because he hasn't unlocked them yet or because he made a strategic choice to focus on equipment or skills that are better suited to single encounters.  Second, there is a mushroom in the later levels who can summon portals that release 3 more monsters each.  The trouble is that this mushroom runs on sight and continues to summon portals every few turns.  If there is a group of enemies or another such mushroom in the area, a crowd can quickly form, preventing some classes from being able to kill the mushroom.  And this is just on normal difficulty.  An easy fix to both cases and to the respawning slimes on savage difficulty is to limit the number of times that an enemy can summon a portal or respawn.  These enemies would remain obnoxious, but they would no longer create impossible scenarios or force the player to flee, underleveled, to the next level of the dungeon.\n\nRight now, some classes do have an advantage against such enemies without any real weakness against others.  The wizard, for example, can teleport to any tile on the screen, summon 3 minions, and use a powerful area attack.  Once I unlocked him, I equipped him with a staff that does additional area damage and breezed through the entire game.  I could pull it off with the archer, too, but I would have much more trouble with classes like the farmer and vampire, particularly on savage difficulty.\n\nFinally, there are some minor bugs (e.g. spawned wisps sometimes do nothing) and annoyances (e.g. being unable to drop items to use them later), but they have no real impact on my score.\n\nFor its combat, classes, persistent elements, art, and manageable dungeon sizes, but also for some questionable enemy design and a lack of enemy variety, I give Sproggiwood a 7.8 out of 10.","May 29, 2015","true","17.6"," 40 of 42 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","40","42","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aavak/recommended/311720/","Aavak","Aavak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aavak/","773 products in account","With its very soft on the eye aesthetics, charming music, and big friendly UI, Sproggiwood is a difficult rogue-like to place in regards to its peers. It wears the trappings of all rogue-likes, simple mechanics that hide a more complex, strategic element (especially in the later levels), procedural dungeon crawling without the sometimes overwhelming expanses of an overworld landscape to navigate, a focus on items and gear found as loot instead of crafting, and some light RPG elements.\n\nBut where it steps away is how forgiving the game is. It mixes a hybrid of permanent death with a progression saving 'village' from which new expeditions using previously unlocked levels of gear are possible, so dying means you go back to the start of the dungeon, rather than back to the start of the game. Even when you die in a specific dungeon, you keep the small amount of gold you might have accumulated, potentially allowing you to unlock a new item back in town that'll make successive attempts easier.\n\nAdditionally, Sproggiwood has a light hearted story running throughout, and I found myself often amused by the quirky, humorous shenanigans of Sproggi, the charming if hopelessly misguided spirit who seems to be at the heart of everything going on (and going wrong!) in Sprog. And although it is a short game compared to many other rogue-likes, and certainly less full in some ways, everything in Sproggiwood seems to fit well. Nothing seems out of place, or unbalanced that I've found, and I suspect it's precicely that quality that makes the game so appealing. Everything feels nice about the game. It's like a spoonfull of ice-cream for the soul :D\n\nSo, in conclusion: Sproggiwood is a fun, cute, and forgiving roguelike. It is perfect as an introduction to the genre, and offers more than enough hours of casual fun for serious rogue-like fans to be worth considering for the price.\n","February 10, 2015","true","11.3"," 33 of 35 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","33","35","0","4"

Here's why:\n\n1) If you die you're right back on your feet and you simply just 'failed' your mission.\n\n2) Death has little or nothing to do with the progress you've currently obtained in terms of unlocks.  You keep all of your upgrades you have purchased, all of your gold, all of your unlocked characters and all of your unlocked inventory.\n\nThat said, I really enjoy the game.  I like that it's nice to me.\n\nThe enemies don't move unless you move which is similar to something like Crypt of the Necromancer so long as you're on the beat (However, there is no "beat" in Sproggiwood.  It's your own pacing).  Enemies have different attack patterns and some enemies even leave hazards that need to be avoided.\n\nYou unlock different classes which all feel different to play in terms of everything beyond the melee combat.  The thief can swap spots with enemies or leave traps down whereas the farmer just flat out places a bomb or throws his melee weapon along with a heal.  The knight has a circular swipe, a charge, and a move to tank damage.\n\nIf you find a weapon in the dungeon it'll be available for purchase (in-game cash, no microtransactions) back in your town.\n\nI haven't put a ton of time into it yet so I haven't seen everything but I've seen enough to recommend it.","November 11, 2014","true","3.9"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","34","38","3","2"

While simple on the surface, it boils down to a good amount of tactical complexity.\n\n======================================\nPros+Quick download\n+Cute, clean & crisp graphics\n+Good tutorial\n+Great controller support, however, see cons\n+Quick n EZ tutorialization\n+Good writing\n+Good sense of humor\n+Fun storyline\n\nCons-Awkward controller controls (I have a generic though.)\n-Some minor bugs sprinkled throughout.\n\nNeutral+/-Difficulty scaling/class imbalance might be problematic.\n\n======================================\nIntroductionWelcome to Sproggiwood, where you inhabit the island of Cog as a peaceful farmer. One day a talking sheep appears, and obviously you are beholden to it immediately. It tells you to follow it, you do. Monsters appear, you slay them. A mysterious portal appears. You are told to heedlessly waltz through it. You do that as well! Then you discover he is the evil Sproggi! Evil spirit of the realm, and you will do his bidding! What kind of bidding will you do, you wonder?\n\nGameplaySproggiwood is a standard modern rogue-like game with all the bells and whistles that come with them, distilled down to the simplest elements that add back up to tactical complexity. The only thing potentially stopping it from being a true rogue-like would be the permanent progression unlocks earned with gold. Otherwise it's all there. You've got your health, your enemies, your dungeons, your overarcing story, your traps, and a turn-based grid-based floor to slay hordes in.\n\nIn Sproggiwood you will, as previously mentioned, unlock permanent upgrades or better gear by getting gold. You get gold by beating dungeons, you get new gear (purchasable) by finding it in dungeons, and you get bonus gold the first time you beat a dungeon with a new class. These upgrades are very important and having the right gear at the right time can save your life. There are also building upgrades that will enable faster exp gains, more health, and more cryptic statues and things of that like.\n\nMost of your adventuring will be the standard roguelike formula of diving into a dungeon and doing your damnedest to survive as long as you can, though. The difficulty curve spikes up well enough, and there's a good amount of enemy variety that forces tactical decision making, all in all Sproggiwood is a solid rogue-like that is simple to learn and only slightly hard to master, but is fun either way.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics in Sproggiwood are great! They're crisp, clean, and colorful. To me, they seem retro-inspired, but like they would fit in well on a tablet. They scale well with resolution so are likely based on vectors graphics. The simplicity gives off a great vibe and allows you to be immersed in the action.\n\nYou can see for yourself what they look like pretty clearly. To sum up my opinion on them:\n\nEffective.\n\nAudio\nThe sounds in Sproggiwood are pretty okay, but the music is great. It's upbeat. It's springy. It has mellow guitar and flute and stuff, hooray! There's actually some relatively nice ambient noise in the background as well, if you take the time to notice.\n\nConclusionDon't be decieved by the cute graphics, Sproggiwood is a real roguelike with plenty of fun and challenge to be had, and the progression system will keep you moving forward.\n\n======================================\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","July 20, 2015","true","7.9"," 36 of 46 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","36","46","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/311720/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Ah, a new day, a new roguelike. This time I’m reviewing FreeHold Games’ Sproggiwood. The title suggests we’re dealing with a more mildly roguelike here, but is that really true ? After all, looks can be deceiving. Continue reading and you’ll find my conclusion right here, in just a few minutes time:\n\nSproggiwood is a story-driven roguelike with turn-based gameplay. It has a bright presentation, unlike many other games in this genre, which is a bit surprising, but not unique.\nYou begin the game as a simple farmer and within minutes after starting the game you step through a portal that transports you to the land of Sproggiwood. Here begins your quest to thwart the spirit Sproggi’s plans by joining a rival civilization, or… you can choose to keep Sproggiwood all to yourself.\nSproggi will give you quests that you have to complete in order to be able to make progress. Each level has a quest and it speaks for itself that all of these levels are randomized, like what we’ve come to expect from the roguelikes of the last couple of years.\nEach level lets you travel through several floors. The last floor usually has a boss fight. Getting there requires both skill and luck. Thankfully, you can improve your luck by purchasing better gear or upgrades. You see, killing enemies will earn your both experience and gold, and smashing pots and opening chests will also earn you money (and let’s not forget the random items).\nAfter each game you can go to town to buy new gear or to upgrade your stats, like gaining more experience for killing enemies. These items usually come at a hefty price and you usually have to play a couple of times before you’re even able to purchase something worthwhile. But after that the game becomes a bit easier, if only for a little while, because the next quest will be even harder, take it from me. Weapons and other items like scrolls and potions are unlocked by smashing pots, by the way. Note that you won’t be able to purchase anything in the town before you’ve unlocked/found it during a game. After that it’s being added to the town inventory for you to purchase.\nAs I already mentioned killing enemies will also earn you experience that allows you to level up. There are four skills to unlock and each one has several stages. For example, there’s a skill to throw a pitchfork in front of you. The second stage allows you to throw it both backward and forward and the third stage lets you throw it in all directions. Because each stage gives you a better opportunity at killing your foes you can’t unlock them right after each other. I’m not sure but I think you have to level up two or three times before you’re able to select the next stage. This makes sense because it pushes you forward, always looking for more enemies that you can kill.\nIf you’re able to successfully finish a quest you’ll be able to buy a town upgrade. In this case it’s usually a building that unlocks a new class you can play with. The town itself has no real function but you can design it yourself by placing buildings, trees and roads. Completing quests will also add villagers to your town. They can say random (useless) stuff, but they can also tell you more about the (back)story. Overall, this is a fun addition that isn’t really needed in a game like this, but I can appreciate it nevertheless.\nAll in all, the game can be pretty unforgiving, despite its looks. Don’t think you’re dealing with an easier game here because it might be a tad easier; it’s still bloody difficult at times.\n\nThe game has a very cartoony and charming look. Above all, it’s beautiful, colorful and sharp and looks just magnificent in motion.\nThe interface isn’t all that intuitive and it takes some getting used to, but once you get the hang of it it works perfectly fine. Still, it could use a little work.\nThere isn’t any real music except for a track that plays whenever you enter a dungeon. It’s limited, but what’s there is good enough. The sounds play a bigger part here and they do the job just fine. They all supplement the game nicely.\n\nThe game can last quite a while. I haven’t been able to finish it, but let’s say you could spend 10-15 hours here and still not be done with it. It also depends on your luck and skills, so it’s a hard thing to say, but as you can see you get plenty of bang for your buck.\n\nSproggiwood is a great roguelike that tries to add some new stuff to the formula. It only partially succeeds in doing this, however. But let it be clear that it definitely has its heart in the right place. It was clearly made with passion, you can tell by the fact that it tried something new.\nThe final product has become a polished and fun game. Newcomers to the genre will definitely have a blast with this and even veteran roguelike players will have a very good time with it, guaranteed.\n\n[Rating: 78/100]","October 30, 2014","true","7.9"," 33 of 42 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","33","42","0","0"

An adorable little game,Sproggiwood is. If you are looking to try out Rogue-like games,this is a perfect game to start from! :)\n\nStory:A humble but pleasant story. Interested and a bit evil. It has quite suprised me!  :D\nArtwork:Artwork is one of the things that absolutely blown me away and made me fall in love with this game. Something that I had never seen before Sproggiwood. Really unique and special.\nSoundtrack:After artwork this is the second most beautiful thing about this game. It is very, very relaxing. If this game was a song, trust me, it would be a pretty popular one! ^^\nGameplay:Several different classes available which makes the game more interesting to play. Every single one of them has it's own special attacks, items like weapons and suits which give the character more abilities! There are potions and many other unique items. All of these items can be bought through a shop with coins earned by collecting pots and vases, killing enemies and finishing levels. The more you go into the game the tougher enemies will be. At the end of the every level you must fight\nthe great boss. Game controls are easy to catch and pretty usual. This game also has a full controller support, but you can play it using the W,A,S,D and the arrow keys on your keyboard.The maps are always random generated which is a big plus to the game. The combat and the movement system is simple are really easy to catch which is crucial in playing the game. Once you master it, you will get control over the battle! This game has many difficulties every harder than the previous one with the ultimate Savage mode at the top! :D\nThis game has unbelievably low requirements and can be run on a "potato" .\nThere is also a mobile version for iOS and Android users which is same as the PC one.\n\nIn overall this is a really unique, cute and interesting game and everyone should give it a try.\n9.5/10\n\n\nPS.

It's a perfect gateway for anyone new to roguelikes, yet has plenty to offer for veterans of the genre.  It's fantastically cross-platform with a very slick UI that works great on both mobile and desktops.  There are six classes to play, each of which forces a different style of play (well, I guess the archer and the wizard actually play pretty similarly, at least for me).  One of the things that I love about roguelikes, which is very well done in Sproggiwood, is making the decision between staying and getting more experience/loot/whatever vs. running away quite difficult.

Seriously, the art is great.\nStory is well written, and delivered with the right amount of humor.\nRandomized dungeons and rewards for completing stages again using different classes give a lot of replay value.\nTouch-input friendly! Tried the game out on a laptop with a touch-screen and the touch  controls worked very well. Looking forward to trying this on a tablet if they port it to mobile OSes.\nCons:\nThe town building has no real effects on the game. Would be nice if this is added in the future or in a sequel. My understanding is that there was more planned but with limited resources, it had to be scrapped for now. The focus was on the core gameplay, and it is more important to have that be polished.\nMay be in the roadmap for a future update, but controller support would be nice. I do most of my gaming these days in Steam's Big Picture Mode with my TV and a controller.\nAll in all, I highly recommend this game.","November 2, 2014","true","9.9"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","1"

I didn't stop playing until I had defeated every dungeon with every class.  Me likey.  A lot.\n\nThe game leans toward the casual side, but that suits me. Earning new starting equipment, boosts and classes provides long term goals. However, levels have to be earned again in each dungeon so the game doesn't become too easy.  Meanwhile, the starting equipment is optional so those who desire more challenge can ignore it.\n\nAs someone who loathes inventory management, I particularly like that it is kept to a minimum with players only holding one item in each slot at a time.  In a nice touch for hoarders like myself, found consumable items can be used immediately without replacing the held item and there is no such thing as leaving an item on the ground.  Overall, this kept my focus on tactical positioning and strategic leveling of my class skills.  When I worried that I was relying on certain starting items too much, I'd enter a dungeon that revealed their quirks, realize the other items still had a purpose and choose my gear accordingly.\n\nI didn't do much decorating in the town sandbox, but I enjoyed the unlock system it's tied to.  Buildings which grant classes are placed (along with NPCs) by defeating certain dungeons.  Finding new items in a dungeon makes them available in the town store.  Purchasing items in the store makes them available as starting equipment.  Together with the overworld's record of which dungeons were defeated by each class, there was always something new to do for one more round.","October 24, 2014","true","37.8"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","0"

It's not a hardcore Rogue-like, but it never pretends to be. It's a great introduction to the genre and there's enough going on for someone well acquainted with it too.\nMy time with the game so far was spent playing each area until I beat it, and although you can play each area with each class to "100%" the game if you like I felt like I'd gotten enough enjoyment out of the game just playing the story through once. I'm sure I'll come back to it in the future to see if I can beat it with some of the trickier classes but for me, I've already got my money's worth.\nFor fans of Rogue-likes, you'll find familiar game mechanics and possibly a couple of new ones, this game being from the seasoned devs of Caves of Qud. For anyone who's not played a classic turn based Rogue-like, you may find yourself with a new addiction. As the story progresses, you move on to new multi-level areas with a new boss to beat and I found the pacing very refreshing from some of the bigger Rogue-likes. The classes all play very differently and I was pretty quickly able to find a favourite and master their abilites.\nIn short this is a good Rogue-like, with satisfying turn based tactical gameplay and fun themes.

The story also feels a bit lacking.  But hey, it is meant to be a casual game, not an deep drama.\n\nIt is not overly easy - as you do "die" and fail to pass stages until you save enough coin to upgrade your heros' equipment and such.

The cute graphics are paired up with fitting music for a really good gaming experience. It's a story-driven, roguelike, entry-level-turn-based-rpg with procedurally generated dungeons.\nAs you progress through the story, more and more characters unlock for you to play through the dungeons. I have unlocked 4 of 6 at the moment and they really do offer very different playstyle:\nWe have our farmer, the character you start with. Hes more of a tank in my eyes - can stand his ground, heal himself to full, drop pumpkin bombs or fear the enemies.\nThen we have the warrior - a classic "in your face" character, charging into enemies to cleave them down or whirlwind 'em to dust.\nThe archer is as expected a squishy one, "leave me alone" kinda guy, that avoids direct fights and pew-pews from a safe distance.\nAnd the last, that I have unlocked, is the Thief - a stealthy one, jukes enemies around and uses stealth to avoid fights.\nAs you can see, fairly different gameplay is offered by those 4 classes and you get incentive to complete each dungeon with each character to earn that dosh, that you so desperately need.\nMoney is the only thing that persists trough death, character swap and dungeon entrance/exit. Every time you enter a dungeon - you start as level 1 character with the gear/consumable you brought with you from the village. In the village there is a shop, where you buy different character upgrades (faster leveling, more starting hp), gear and consumables. The gear and consumables in the shop are only those, that you have previously seen drop/picked up in the dungeons for you - so I guess there is some luck involved for the best drops, at least initially(as there are not that many weapons and eventually you'll discover them all).\nOn the other hand, totally game irrelevant, as far as I can tell, you can customize your village to your heart's content - you can build bridges, mansions,plant trees and modify the grass around - I think I've spent an hour just messing around with it to make it as cute as possible ;)\nThe humor in the game,and the game in general is fairly amusing and can wholeheartedly recommend it, although I think the price tag is just a bit steep, but you should definitely get it, when it comes on sale.\n\nTL:DR you can check my first impressions video, where I struggle with different characters to complete the 4th dungeon\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=332629973","October 27, 2014","true","5.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It's simplified, true, lacking the crazy depth you'll find in most roguelikes, but in its simplicity you get to the very heart of a roguelike: a turn-based dungeon-crawler that offers you interesting decisions.\n\nIn Sproggiwood, you're going to spend most of your time playing as a single boxy warrior fighting through various single-shot dungeons, but unlike other roguelikes, the character is not persistent. The amount of loot and your town is. Every run in a dungeon produces gold, which you then take to the town in order to upgrade its facilities and buy better equipment. Every run starts by choosing what kind of kit you want to bring along - pick your class, pick your weapon/armor/accessory, and you're off to the races. There's no tedious inventory management - again, it's simple, but elegant. Choose if you want an offensive or a defensive character - in the last run I did, I played as a wizard who summoned yetis and fled from every combat encounter so I could watch my help chump the opposition. In other runs I favor the warrior, who has a great crowd-control skill.\n\nSo, the dungeons! This is where the game shines. Each one is a puzzle and a race - you have limited health and stamina/mana, and there's a boss waiting at the end, and there's no escape but victory or death. Health potions and shrines are rare finds, and you need to somehow guide your little box fellow down to the boss and destroy them. No dungeon will take longer than half an hour at the absolute most, but actually beating it will take a lot longer between the multiple runs, the many deaths, and the moment when you figure out how to play better.\n\nThe graphics are cutesy, the aesthetic is adorable, and it's all meant to lure you into a sense of safety - this is an easy, cute roguelike, you'll think. No. It has teeth. It has three difficulty modes: Easy, Normal, Savage. I'm not good enough for Savage. I'm honing my skills on Normal instead, where I have a chance at making it through.\n\nNow, that leaves one last facet to consider: there is a story in this roguelike! It's strange and surprisingly sad, and I enjoyed playing through it. You're not buying this game for the story, but what's there is interesting and non-intrusive.\n\nIn conclusion, please get this game!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/recommended/311720/","altered_confusion","Altered_Confusion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/","289 products in account","Sproggiwood, developed by FreeHold Games, puts you in the role of a Cloghead individual who has been pulled from another dimension to give this world another shot. Apparently someone has enough pull for a redo. This is a rouge-like adventure game in which you will have to take on many dungeons to see if you can make this world thrive instead of waste away. The problem is that you are not the only being running around, it turns out that a race of Mushrooms is also taking up residence in this world, and it would appear no matter how many times you interact with them you are always going to cause more damage than good.\n\nGraphically this game is a 3/4 view 3Dish game in which you will thrive, or die, in a square grid world. The thing about this game is that since it is rogue-like, you are going to deal with randomized dungeons. That's not to say that the game length with change dramatically between playthroughs, but the levels will always look different, and might contain different enemies that you will have to deal with. Speaking of enemies, I have to say that I like the simple, yet strong design. Yes there are a lot of gelatinous cubes moving around, but the subtle differences in color (yellow, pink, black, blue, etc) can mean a ton of different effects that might make your adventure a bit more perilous. The color scheme is definitely light-hearted, you are not going to get nightmares from playing through the game. Well at least not the look of the game, you might end up having nightmares of being surrounded by enemies that tear you to shreds because you were not careful enough.\n\nTo stop you from being torn to shreds you will have the ability of collecting items in your journey. Now the one thing that you have to watch out for is that since this is a rogue-like game, when you enter a new dungeon it is essentially a new you, you are going to start back at level 1. The thing is that the items (potions, armor, weapons, scrolls, etc) they can be purchased so that you can start at a slight advantage in the next dungeon you find yourself in. Since we are talking about items and weapons, and whatnot one of the BIGGEST things for me when I think of changing equipment, is I want to see an actual change in the character, and this game delivers. Are you wearing different armor, well then you are going to look different. Are you using a new weapon, well your weapon will look different. The little things, like this, usually make the game that much more solid.\n\nNow lets get into the one thing that was a bit of a letdown for me, and fortunately or unfortunately it is not a bug. I'm talking about the music in the game. I liked it, in every level, I thought it was subtle, blended well with the game, and wasn't abrasive to hear in a loop. The thing is that design-wise the music is set to drop out and come back after a certain amount of time, which will leave you playing your game, in which all the rest of the sounds work, in silence.\n\nThe controls of the game are REALLY easy to pick up, you are going to move left, right, up, and down. You are going to use the 1-5 button for skills, and any choices that require other button presses will be clearly labeled for you so that there is no confusion. Oh and the space bar is your friend if you want to wait a turn and have the enemy move that one extra spot so you don't have to take damage first.\n\nSo I don't know what I was expecting out of this game, but what I got was something that I couldn't put down. I decided to test this game out as one of the games I would play during my Extra-Life, 24 hour game-a-thon. The thing is that I kept coming back to this game. It wasn't that it was too easy, in fact there are still many levels that I'm not able to defeat with specific characters, but it was the fact that I knew what I was getting into, I saw the challenge, and it was an easy one to accept over and over again. You see the ease in the ability to pick up the game, understand the game, and play it, made it so that I just had to keep coming back to see if the little bit of time I took off would be enough for the gaming gods to look down upon me and guide me through another level so that I could unlock more of the game.\n\nNow it is possible to play the game all the way through with just one character, but where's the fun in that. You start of as the farmer class, and although it does have some fun special attacks, it is not my favorite class to play as. You also have the warrior, archer, thief, vampire, and wizard. Personally I'm all about the warrior with his attack that will attack every square around him, this has saved my bacon more times than I can count. It also helps to have the shield ability which can absorb a couple of rounds of damage when your life is on the line. I do want to point out, however, that all the other classes are excellent, and well balanced. I do enjoy playing as the thief, and the rest of the gang. If you play this game, you should too, especially since for each class you get through a level you get a bonus of gold, which in turn can greatly help you.\n\nSo lets talk about the gold, the gold is the magical substance that will allow you to level up your buildings which in turn will help your character level up faster, have more hit points, interact with more unique items, etc. You also can use the gold towards unlocking items, weapons, armor, and more so that you can choose to start off with it at the beginning of a level.\n\nLook here's the deal, if you don't really like turn-based, RPG, randomized dungeons, which I can't for the life of me figure out how you couldn't like those things, then this is not the game for you, but if you like those things, as I believe most should, then you need to get this game pronto. It is solid, challenging, fun, and I personally can't wait to dive right back in to see if I can't get another class through a level that I have sadly not conquered with yet. This game gets a 9.5 out of 10.","October 28, 2014","true","6.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cozyghost/recommended/311720/","cozyghost","CozyGhost","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cozyghost/","86 products in account","Picking up Sproggiwood right before exam season was a bad idea. This game is addictingly fun and challenging for the casual and relaxation-seeking gamer. Like a lot of people have said, it's got a similar vibe as classic Zelda. If you're not used to turn-based attacking (like me) it'll take a few tries to get used to it, but once you do it's hard to stop.\n\nThe art is adorable and colourful. The Finnish folklore shines through. The gameplay is tough enough to make you frustrated once in a while, but otherwise it's just pure fun. Hoping the developers will add more and expand on this! Really enjoying it so far and it's fast approaching my favourites list.\n\nHowever, the town really only serves as a dynamic background for your "organizational" activities, and it is a little strange not having to re-purchase potions and things; they're unlimited once you've purchased them once. Levels could be a bit bigger, and like some people have said, the "quests" aren't really quests at this point, it's really linear unless you switch it up yourself by beating levels with the different classes. But even then, it gets a bit old. So, once again, I really hope the developers will expand on this. It's got a lot of potential for a more complex experience.","December 3, 2014","true","10.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

There are 10 stages each with a unique boss and 6 classes each having 4 special skills, and you can unlock global upgrades with your hard-earned coins from the dungeons.\nThese elements are typical for most of the popular rogue-like games, except for the cute art style. However, Sproggiwood fails to offer more. The sound effect and music are okay, but nothing impressive. The story is barely better than nothing. The difference in environment is purely aesthetic and does not influence the battle. Although it may still be an exciting challenge for hardcore fans of this genre to finish all the stages on the savage difficulty with all classes, the game play quickly become old  because of the lackness in variety of the enemies, loots and equipment.\n\nIf you want a short enjoyable time of about 5 hours immersing yourself in a rogue-like game with good arts, I recommend this game when it's on sale.

I found the challenge sneaks up on you as the first level lulls you into a sense of ease, but the difficulty ramps up somewhat unexpectedly and not in a bad way. You slowly find yourself taking more careful steps as you play or you start dying a lot.\n\nIt's not a traditional roguelike in the sense of true permadeath and endless junk inventory management. You gain equipment to take with you and unlock classes through the story as you build up a small village, something akin to Rogue Legacy's method of increasing danger while increasing player resources. There's no inventory. You get one weapon, one armor, one consumable, and one accessory. In your village, you can purchase these items to have available for adventuring. Each class (there are 6) has a separate weapon type and armor type and you unlock new ones to purchase in your village through adventuring as that class.\n\nYou get one chance to clear a dungeon. If you fail, you can start over with a new procedurally generated dungeon that ends in a boss fight. Each dungeon is themed and increases in difficulty at every chapter. You gain gold during your delve which can be spent on upgrades in the village. Previously defeated dungeons will spawn new mobs as the story progresses, which reflects plot developments within the main story.\n\nThe turn-based combat is where Sproggiwood really shines. It feels like a roguelike in the sense of grid-based, turn-based combat, but the enemy and character skills will keep you on your toes. Skills cost stamina to use and killing enemies rewards stamina. It quickly generates a feeling of chess where you're trying to outmaneuver your enemies. Purely bashing your way through the dungeon is not viable. You will need to use your class's four skills cleverly to avoid damage and keep your stamina up. Your gear will have special effects that will help you in the dungeon. Unlike traditional roguelikes, your decision about where to move to, or not move, is very key to survival. There's slimes that create bomberman style explosions when defeated, slippery puddles, and a host of other effects. Spiderwebs will make you lose a turn. Goatmen will charge across the map to ram you. I find the combat in this game to be a very fun exercise in proactive and reactive thinking.\n\nFinally, the story is a fun read. It's humorous, well-written, and makes sense within the Sproggiwood universe. You will quell the dissention of a blob social philosopher, deliver messages of peace (by any means necessary), and generally bungle your way to victory.\n\nThe devs are responsive on the forums and have ideas for post release. I'm hoping to see the addition of an "endless" dungeon, but even so, going back and replaying previously beaten levels with the various classes really offers a new challenge, ultimately providing quite a bit of replay value.\n\nI would be inclined to point out bad things about this game, but for what the game is designed to be, it does everything very well. I honestly can't think of anything bad to say about this game.\n\nAh, yes, I thought of something. The village decoration. A point I forgot about. You can apparently decorate your village with pleasing aesthetics, such as placing a bridge over the river. I'm not sure why the devs added this content and I have not really done much with it. I won't begrudge giving the player the ability to decorate his village, but it seems to have no real purpose in the game and I'd much rather the devs work on the actual gameplay than playing village dress-up.","January 16, 2015","true","13.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The humor is good, although nothing to write home about; I don't think I ever laughed outloud, but I almost always played it with a smile plastered across my face.\n\nAs for the combat system, it's just barely deep enough to carry you through the length of the game without getting overly repetitive.  Barely.  There is definitely a learning curve, as you figure out the skills, weapons, and armor, and how to use them all properly in tandem with each other (not to mention learning how to defeat the tougher opponents).  But that learning curve does plateau; thankfully, for me, by the time it did so, the ending was in sight, so the grind never felt overly repetitive or mindless.\n\nSo if you're looking for a Zelda-lite adventure game with a sense of humor, this game is for you.  On the other hand, if you are the type of player who loves dying a lot, who immediately turns the difficulty of all your games to 11... then, be warned, you might find Sproggiwood pretty easy.","January 7, 2015","true","18.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

I look at the screen during the cutscenes and go OMGoud sooooo cute, then before I know it all the talking is over and I'm in a dungeon killing things and getting loot.\n\nGameplay there's not to much to say, it's a Roguelike.... is simple but still hard to master, you have 6 classes to choose from, but 5 of them are locked and need to be unlock first, they each have 4 very distinct skills and play very differently from one another, this is all great for the replay value BTW! Dungeons are short, which is a good thing! they take about 5 to 10 minutes to beat. By beating dungeons (or even dying in them) earns you gold, and with that you can buy upgrades and better equipment that makes your little guy better for even easier dungeoning, shopping is all done from your little Village or Home Base of sorts, that can be customized to your liking, but customizing things around in your Village like adding sidewalks or making a garden are all purely a cosmetic thing, they have no impact on anything unfortunately.\n\nThat's probably the only negative thing I can say about Sproggiwood, is that the 'Village' part seems empty and pointless,  they could have made it into something fun, something to do in between dungeon runs, like by having a garden in your Village would let you harvest ingredients on a timer, then those could be made into powerful one time potions, or having the forge/blacksmith building craft powerful equipment from materials you would find in dungeons or maybe from rare drops from the end bosses, I dunno seems like a missed opportunity here.\n\nAnyway let's wrap this up, if you like Roguelikes, Casual Roguelikes, Coffee break Roguelikes, Cute things, Steam Cards, Achievements, then get this game, it's a very polished gem, I highly recommend it.","October 24, 2014","true","9.8"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

Compared to other Roguelikes on the marketplace, you might find this one a tad on the easy side, but it's nevertheless a wikkid game. You will die quite a bit throughout the game, but it isn't unreasonable to play through a lot of the dungeons and boss battles sans-dying on your first try if you're careful.\nThe way I see it, there are two ways that you can play this game: you can either play individual dungeons in short bursts, or you can do what I did and sit here for several hours killing bright, cute monsters and having a blast.

If you are looking to get as many game hours for your buck as possible, skip Sproggiwood ’til more content has been added.\n\nSproggiwood is a good game and offers exactly what it wants to offer: tight gameplay where dungeons are ran through rather than crawled. A great game to boot, play a dungeon or two, and put down again.\n\nThat’s also where it is currently a little lacking for people who want to game for longer time periods. You will finish the story in a couple of days, if you are a completionist you will then have to add another few days before having gotten everything out of the game there is. Quests are limited to the main story line and a time-based Christmas event (sorry if you missed it).\n\nThe developers have stated that they will keep expanding on the game to add to its replay value, and I for one believe this will be needed. The game is feature complete and definitely not a pre-release (or heaven forbid, ‘early access’), just very compact which takes away from replayability.","February 16, 2015","true","21.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The first thing that struck me about the game were the adorable visuals, but what really makes Sproggiwood stand out is the hilariously quirky writing! Most roguelike games have a very limited story. Sproggiwood takes the time to develop the plot a bit, so you know exactly what you're trying t accomplish as you make you way through the dungeons.\n\nI don't want to discuss the mechanics of the game too much because a big part of what makes roguelike games enjoyable is the sense of discovery as you play. You start each dungeon at level one with the option of being equipped with your choice of items that you already collected and subsequently bought in your town. This helps make luck a bit less of a factor in your dungeon runs, but it also slightly hampers replay value.\n\nThe only criticisms I have are:\nThe tutorial is not robust enough to give a full understanding of the controls/mechanics\nThere is a lack of endgame content, once you're done getting items and experimenting with the classes, there's very little feeling of progression\n\nReccomended for:\nFans of turn based tactical RPGs like Front Mission and Fire Emblem\nPeople who find leveling the most fun part of MMOs\nPeople who like cute things\nPeople new to the roguelike genre\n\nAvoid if:\nYou find endgame the most fun part of MMOs\n\nOverall Sproggiwood is a fun, adorable game. A worthy addition to the roguelike genre that's a great starting point for those intimidated by the high difficulty of traditional roguelikes!\n","February 18, 2015","true","30.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Cute graphics that draw you in, but with a deeper strategy element lurking beneath.  An obvious knowledge of games - what works well, and what doesn't, shows through the design.\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED for those who enjoy turned based strategy/puzzle(ish) games.   One of my new favorite games on Steam, and my iphone.\n\nThe PC interface may be a bit oversized due to Sproggiwood's multi-platform ambitions, but all controls are re-configurable whether using keyboard, mouse, or gamepad.  The game interface works equally well with any - it is truly a question of taste.   Polished and well done interface.\n\nDeath will happen and levels are random (re: rogue) but there is a definite "I can do better" learning curve, and most (but certainly not all) deaths feel that better strategy and choices could have made the difference.  A true plus for that "must try one more time" feeling.\n\nAnd, that one more try does generally leave you a feeling of accomplishment.  Either a level finished with a certain character, or enough extra coins to upgrade something for the next attempt.\n\nOn the downside, the town building aspect doesn't really add anything to the gameplay.  I'm perfectly fine with that.  Importantly, I doesn't take anything away from the game either.  As far as I can tell, you don't need to do anything in the town screen, and it doesn't affect your dungeon experience.   So, I guess, can just be taken as a fun bonus for those interested in have a cute 'upgrade store' (not IAP, or DLC, just in game).\n\nOverall - very good, polished, cute, roguelike, puzzle, dungeon crawl, with a fun story.  If it looks like your type of game... apart from the town development screens... then BUY and ENJOY!!\n\nps. excellent, involved, small dev team.  I've had a couple questions and they've been excellent with support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","June 6, 2015","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The perks passively increase your hp/xp gain/reduce the cost of items, which doesn't have a huge effect on dungeon crawling, but does speed things along as you go.\n\nThere are 6 character classes: The farmer, warrior, archer, thief, mage, and vampire. The farmer uses throwing pitchforks and exploding mushrooms for hit & run tactics. The warrior has a spin move, charge, fortify, and hit everybody in a 5 square radius move. The thief has traps, stealth, and backstabs. The mage is an absolute powerhouse with magic missiles, fireball, teleport, and yeti summoning. And the vampire... drains health or turns into a bat. Many of these special attacks can be augmented with weapon effects for greater destruction. My favorite is to use the Mage's magic missile, combined with a type of fire staff, to shoot multiple magic missiles that explode with an AoE fire effect. As long as you kill one enemy with this attack- you can cast it over and over. It's pretty fun.\n\nThe game especially shines in the writing department, as the characters (despite their short screentime) are fairly unique and amusing- and there's a lot of twisted morality that gets thrown around as well. It's rare that you get to play as a truly evil character, and I think they designed the main character perfectly for the role.\n\nThe game itself is replayable up until you've cleared everything/finished the story. There are some unlockable cosmetic characters for your town, but not much more than that. That said, with random generation and a fair number of dungeons to clear, it's worth the price, especially on sale.\n\nThe UI is fairly mobile-y, but you can adjust it to fit your preferences, which is really nice.","October 24, 2014","true","8.7"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

When buying this I expected an rpg-like roguelike with advanced tactics, simplistic but nice graphics and tons of loot.\n\nThe art style is quite nice, I admit that, however, the game lacks depth drastically.\n\nAt first it may seem fun, but as soon as you unlock few other classes it turns out that there's not much more to see, as every class feels the same apart from the few skills you might use. One might say that every class has probably some over 20 items, however, the items are exactly the same for every class so it's really just 20 items in the whole game (not counting usables and few accessories I found).\n\nThe game is tagged as "roguelike", "strategy" and "RPG", but in my opinion is neither of them.\n- As for being a roguelike, it does not have permanent death, the loot is scarce and the game itself is rather easy.\n- As for strategy, there is not much of strategic thinking in waiting a turn for your enemy to come closer to avoid him attacking you,\n- As for RPG, there are so-called quests in this game, however, each one requires you to clear a small dungeon and that's basically it. The story is probably not too bad, however, I found myself skipping the dialogues as they resolved about the same things all the time (another civilization -> blablabla -> message of peace -> blablabla).\n\nThe game also feels like it was made having mobiles in mind, so it couldn't have been too complicated in terms of strategy and controls. The whole experience is a bit bland, there's no sense of achieving anything when completing a dungeon after you clear first few, it's just pretty much the same over and over again (apart from few new enemies).\n\nI believe some people might actually get hooked on this game, however, I really can't see more play value than 5-10 hours. Personally, it took me 2, to get fed up. I believe this game could be much better, if creators added more different items for each class, maybe work on the village a bit more and implemented more INTERESTING quests.\n\nAll in all, I don't recommend the game. Do not buy it for it's full price, it's not worth it. I've paid 5€ and I think that it still was too much for this game...","December 18, 2014","false","1.8"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","1"

It is a partial-rogue like though, since there is no perma-death, and little fear of doing something stupid. But it can claim rogue like since it does have procedural dungeons.\n\nIt is a fun game, but here is my list of pros/cons (So far):\n\nPros:\n- Cute and fun, doesn't have the "pixel art" graphics a lot of the newer indie games have (I do like the pixel art style, but this graphic style works too)\n\n- You can re-arrange things you earn in your town so that is looks more unique to what you want, and there is no cost to "buy" new "decorations," though some must be unlocked (understandably).\n\n- Fun, useful (if a little overpowered at times) items to find and equip.\n\nCons (This list may seem longer, but honestly, the Pros are still better):\n\n- You have to unlock every other class in the game (besides the initial farmer). While not bad, can be annoying picking between who to unlock. Negated upon playing though, so not horrible.\n\n- Can't rotate buildings you place in your "town."\n\n- Items (Weapons/Armor) found in dungeons cannot be kept; you must buy them in town first then you have perma-use of them.\n\n- (Edit, added) After playing a while longer, seems you don't keep your level(s) between dungeon, so every dungeon you start at level 1, *again* - This is actually a little frustrating, but is also part of the game play I suppose.\n\n- I would like to be able to name my little adventurer(s). I love customizations. Plus, the skills are limited in selection for my taste - especially for a $14.99 game.\n\n- Dungeons can be rather short\n\n- The initial story is some what annoyingly confusing. I don't want to spoil things, but it changes 3 times before you hit the first dungeon (not the tutorial "walk in a straight line"). It makes me almost not want to see what the story line does next, since it does change so much suddenly, in a "ok, I lied, this is what is really up now."\n\nIt is a fun game, and worth a try, but maybe at a discounted price.

Wow! Gosh! "procedural dungeons" "civilization building" "six classes" "rougelike"\n\nI really hate to have to come back to this game having played through its entirety (to get my money's worth) and leave a bad review. In all seriousness, my first five to seven hours of this were great! I love smashing pots. Killing monsters. Making money. Changing classes. Great! But I've come to expect a lot more from games that tout rouge-like elements.\n\nAfter my initial romance with sproggiwood, I realized pretty swiftly that the difficulty was well below anything that required strategy. The total enemy encyclopedia including bosses must total something like twenty? Thirty? Theres slimes, spiders, goats, sheep, creeper farmers, wisps, mushrooms, frogs, and a single fish monster. Then theres a boss for each of the nine "different" levels.\n\nDungeons are about three floors a piece with a total of usually 4 to 9 rooms per. Maybe fifteen minutes to clear a dungeon? Though honestly certain classes can go for about five if you dont care about the money involved (and quickly you wont.)\n\nI will say this. The music, the environmental effects, and the scrolls and potions were a ton of fun. This is a great game until you realize how small it is, and how completely lacking in replayabillity. I buy rougelike games, like dungeons of dredmor, because of the sheer amount of replayabillity they offer.\n\nHowever, sproggiwood doesnt have the story, or the deep gameplay necessary to involve itself with such a shimmering and drawing game description here on steam. By all means, buy the game if youre easily satisfied and are a total beginner when it comes to RPG titles or rougelike genre games.\n\nBut steer clear of sproggiwood if you've already cut your teeth on anything else!

It is a nice, casual RPG that gives a breath of fresh air from the common "you are a hero go slay the bad guys save the whatever." I reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys casual games but also likes the progression of RPGs with loot and what not.\n\nHowever there are a couple things I think could be improved. To move in a direction you have to use the arrow keys or WASD, but you can't hold down a certain key to keep going in that direction. I can see why they did this being the enemies react to your movement, but when you just want to go a far distance pretty quickly and don't have to worry about enemies it can get somewhat annoying to constantly hear "click click click click." Perhaps they should add the ability to hold down shift while pressing a movement key to simulate pressing that key once every half second or so. Also another minor annoyance is the way the text scrolls when characters speak. The text while start to appear and then move upwards to make way for the new text on the line, which makes it difficult to read quickly. Hard to explain, but you will see what I mean next time you look. I don't know why it was programmed like this but it is kind of annoying.\n\nThose two small issues are no reason not to get the game, it really is fun and relaxing. I'd give it an 8/10\n\nJoe","October 26, 2014","true","6.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you've been afraid of how punishing other roguelikes have been, but you're intrigued by the mechanics of roguelikes, Sproggiwood is the game for you. It's a great way to introduce you to the genre and its mechanics in a meaningful and fun way - and the game is a lot of fun once you discover the layers of depth and strategy involved. Six classes in total, lots of loot to be found, all set in a charming and visually pleasing world.","October 24, 2014","true","7.3"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

In case you can't tell from the screenshots, this is a mobile port.  The buttons in game are overly large and even some settings still say swipe.\n\nAs a rogue-lite game, Sproggiwood is....competent.  There are several upgrades you can do to your village which affects how you play the levels.  The issue is, the levels are barely procedurally generated.  Each level all you will see that is differant is the layout of the vases, webs and traps which a few tile sets being different than the last game you played.  It is pretty lazy.  The monster variety is also pretty lazy.  You have oozes, giant goat men, flying pigs with lasers, flame vampires etc.  The enemy variety is what will exhaust you.  You will witness the same mobs level after level.\n\nI got Sproggiwood on sale.  At 50% off I'd say it's worth it, but definately NOT 15.  There isn't enough content here and the level design is flat and just not that procedural for my liking.  If you're a fan of rogue like games, pass this one up and buy the developer's other game, Caves of Qud if you want a true rogue like dungeon crawler.","October 3, 2015","false","7.1"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","1"

The cost: seriously though, for almost 9$ on a 50% off sale this game is brutally overpriced. People like to compare the cost of games to the cost of movies, so hey, I'll do that here and let you know you could have gone to two movies for the cost of this game and two movies might net you 5 hours which is what this game is as far as length.\n\n2. The length: you think that sometimes the cost isn't bad because you can get your money's worth out of the game think again with Sproggiwood, in two hours I have completed 4 missions and replayed each of those missions at least 3 times, there are around a total of 9 missions which means if you don't replay any missions you are talking about beating the game easily in under 5 hours. The game then by all accounts would become a grind game to get enough gold to turn into money to turn into items so that you can play the same missions again on harder difficulties, which brings me to\n\n3. The game is by all accounts designed from the ground up as a FTP phone game: the in game city which amounts to nothing more than the "in game store" coupled with missions that are designed to be grinded over and over again to build up frustration levels to the point that you will just pay real money to buy the items, the "touch screen screen drag", and on and on... After putting in only a few hours it was crystal clear what this game was.\n\n4. Champions (if you can even call them that) don't retain level: meaning this isn't your typical dungeon crawler where you level up and get stronger and stronger as you go along in the game- no, this is broken up into nine "missions" and each mission you start at lv 1 each and everytime you play it you have to relevel up your champion and refind the same items to equip on the same person (that is, unless you went and bought the items in the store, then you can equip said items before the mission, otherwise you go into each mission lv 1 and "naked" again).\n\n5. Ridiculously long tutorial designed to get you over the 2 hour mark on Steam and/or pad out this short, short, short game. This one is self explanitory, it is a very very very long and indepth tutorial for one of the simplest dungeon crawlers you will ever play. Didn't appear like there was any way to skip it so replaying the game seems like even if you wanted to (don't see the reason to as you just replay the same missions over and over again) it would be a nightmare.\n\n6. Reused assets: played in 3-4 missions (50% of game) and I saw the same world, same creatures, same trees to cave to trees in every single mission. People complained about Heroes of a Broken Land having reused assets, this game takes it to a whole new level... This is like The Banner Saga without even trying to be tactical and without an awesome Viking storyline...\n\n7. The "build your town" screenshots and video for the game are a hoax, the city building is nothing more than aestetics that has no impact on the game itself... Like I said before, it is just a "store front"...\n\n8. First strike = the entire game: this game's combat is entirely based on the concept of "first strike", meaning "wait a turn for the enemy to move to the space beside me and then kill it in one hit". Everything dies in the game in one or two hits which means 95%+ of all battles pre-boss fights are just waiting for enemies to come to you and first striking them, the boss fights (the four I fought) were all designed to have you be leveled up (remember you have to level up again each time you play a map) and pick all the "ranged abilities" when you level up so that you could just kill the boss from a distance (as the first four bosses killed you basically in a single hit if they got within range). This is frankly totally unexceptable for a 15$+ game! It is like we just want to pretend that Terraria never happened!\n\n9. Roguelike genre is super saturated: there are a ton of these games, some of them are great some of them are terrible and some are simply overpriced- Sproggiwood is two of those three...","March 27","false","1.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

With better artwork, character design, and environments, this would probably classify as a good game.  The mechanics are really quite solid, with each class genuinely havnig a unique playstyle and there's good balance to the rogue-lite aspects of the experience.  I quite like the notion of each run being balanced around a given quantity of experience, a set number of pots and chests.  There's very good fundamental design in here.  But jesus the art is just not nice to look at.  The whole thing feels like it was made with clip art, and that makes it hard to love or respect the game.  Hell, even the writing - satirical though it mostly is - is fairly intelligent.\n\nIt's tough.  I've played a lot of roguelikes, and this one gets more of the fundamentals right than most games with much larger budgets.  But the presentation really holds it back.  I've seen too many games that go the self-aware parody route, and I think it's just lazy.  Commit to a visual theme.  Build a world around that.

I think many rogue likes have this kind of style and it adds depth to the game where you think there is none.\n\nAll in all, I do not regret playing it, no, I had my fun with it. But it is way too short. Before buying Sproggiwood you may consider waiting for a mobile release, cause it would fit perfect on a mobile device and to fill some time on travels and stuff.","November 1, 2014","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can go back when you unlock a new class and replay older levels to gain those bonuses again. The gameplay is tight, the colors bright, and the artwork cartoony and functional. I had no issue determining what enemy types were or how best to defeat them. I haven't beaten the game yet, but for as far as I have played, it's been an excellent game and worthy of my time.","October 28, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Said story is fun enough and the few characters you meet during your adventure are quite silly and will easily make you smile.\n\nAt 15 to 10 dollars (depending on whether it's on sale or not) it might be a bit overpriced for what it does but it's a good experience nonetheless.","June 25, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
