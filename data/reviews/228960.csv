This quirky turn-based strategy game seems simple at first, but there are actually some surprisingly deep levels of nuance and complexity beneath the surface. You play as a Japanese swordsman General who is trying to reclaim his stolen identity in the afterlife. The art style is very unique and really well done. The cast of characters and story are also very cool. The dialogue, in particular, is a highlight. I wasn't expecting much from that aspect of a seemingly simple strategy game, but I was pleasantly surprised at how funny and entertaining it was.\n\nSo the aesthetic portions of the game are definitely good, but what of the actual gameplay, you ask? In short, it's pretty damn good. Gameplay is turn based, but on each turn you have 5 "orders" that can be performed. Your team is comprised of various types of units (warriors, cavalry, archers), each of which has their own strengths and weaknesses. Instead of moving on tiles like other strategy games, the actions in this game are more free-roaming. Units are able to move anywhere they want, within a certain radius, and are also able to continue moving after performing an action, which adds to the level of strategy involved. One of your main goals is to eat the skulls of defeated opponents, which restores health. However, if a unit is able to eat 3 skulls, they transform into a Demon, which enables them to perform 2 actions per turn, which is a huge advantage. Gameplay becomes a delicate balancing act of attacking, positioning and staying alive long enough to power up.\n\nOutside of these main elements, there are a number of other nuances (summoning monks with special powers, forming spirit walls, environmental hazards, deciding when to bring your general into battle, and more) that add many layers of complexity to the basic strategy. Every level seems to provide some new elements to learn or deal with, and this keeps the main campaign fresh from start to finish. There's no padding at all. The main campaign lasts several hours (more if you play on a higher difficulty or attempt to complete the set of special goals for each level) and is worth the price of admission alone. In addition, the game also features online, local and asynchronous multiplayer matches. So there is plenty of content here for both casual and competitive types.\n\nAll in all, this game is solid and brings some really cool twists to the turn-based strategy genre. If you are into that type of thing, pick this one up. And if not, well, this could be the game that makes you a fan. Check it out.","August 5, 2013","true","23.0"," 92 of 103 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","92","103","0","0"

With the rise in popularity of Turn Based Strategy (TBS) games, It can be difficult for Skulls of Shogun to stood out among the other quality TBS games such as XCOM, Civilization V, and so on.\n\nStill, with its quirky art style and fairly witty humor that is set in Samurai's afterlife, Skulls of Shogun features a well designed and carefully balanced mechanics, I find Skulls of Shogun to be very enjoyable game to play. At the same time, the game tries to introduce a gridless movement system where your unit's movement range is denoted by a white circle with a fixed radius, I find this innovation to a decent change that works well to be an alternative to the typical grid system found in a lot of TBS games. Combining with the cross platform compatibility with iOS, one could even play this game on the go. While Skulls of Shogun looks like a mobile port, it felt more like a PC game with reasonable amount of depth despite having a rather small unit roster. Each unit has its own unique role that can be useful in the right hands. Personally, I find the PC version's UI to be pretty decent and mouse friendly while it is equally playable on a touch screen.\n\nIf you like Turn Based Strategy, give Skulls of Shogun a go if you have the chance. You could find yourself putting a couple of hours into this indie gem.","December 30, 2013","true","9.2"," 41 of 44 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","41","44","0","0"

Units are varied - samurai, cavalry, archers and four types of magic using monks - all with different strengths and weaknesses. Positioning of units is important, because they can counter attack in certain situations, and can also be knocked off ledges for an instant kill. Eating the skulls of dead enemies regains health and increases max health, while controlling rice gardens and shrines lets you summon extra units. The game is challenging, because on most levels you are outnumbered and surrounded, but at the same time well balanced, because each side can only move 5 units per turn. However, any unit that eats three skulls unlocks an extra attack per turn. The game has a wacky sense of humour, particularly with its amusing text only dialogue and animation style. The singleplayer campaign is quite long and very stable. Definitely worth checking out.","September 14, 2013","true","25.3"," 45 of 52 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","45","52","0","0"

Many consider it as a spiritual successor of Advance Wars, and it is in many ways yet by being a  truly unique experience in the even rarer ''cartoony TBS'' sub genre. Don't get it wrong: despite its ( marvelous ) cartoony construct  & hilarious dialogues ( really ), Skulls of the Shogun also shines via a lenghty campaign of well drawn maps.\n\nOverall strategy and multiple tactics may seem basic, but ways to win versus enemies ( AI or multiplayer ) require the full attention of veteran players as well. It's not perfect on crowded bottlenecks when trying to command orders, some little glitch here and there, though nothing to alter an otherwise joyful turn based combat.\n\nPros: vivid cartoony construct and turn based combat mixed pretty well; lenghty campaign and multiplayer modes; hilarious dialogues; great audio track.\n\nCons: ordering units when crowded like sardines; some questionable unit range versus obstacle placement.\n\nBottom line: Highly recommended.

This is a fun game to play because the levels are short and packed with action and tough decision making. It’s also easy to learn and play because there is no hex counting, no charts, and no tables. It has special objectives for completionists including a time attack trial and a developer commentary for all 20 levels.\n\nI like this game because individual levels are short. The long levels can be 30 minutes but you can easily finish most within 15. Skulls doesn’t waste time with load outs or gear management. The only thing you need to manage is your troops and your rice (a currency to buy units). You manage your units with five orders each turn. Activating a unit takes an order. Most decisions are simple yet tough. Do you deal damage? Do you take crucial economy or troop producing buildings? Do you eat skulls to upgrade your troops? Do you provide other units protection from knock back?\n\nMany turn based tactics games rely on special attack and armor types. In Skulls you won’t need to memorize the latest version of rock-paper-scissors. Attacks are easy to understand. Units deal damage and armor subtracts it. No long time investments studying maximum efficiency. Though it is a tactics game and so if hyper efficient decision making is what you like then you’ll be glad to know that each level is scored, even including leaderboards. Each level also has alternate secondary objectives such as winning without losing any units.\n\nOn the negative side I think knock back while intuitive often felt a bit fuzzy. An attack that I thought for sure would knock an opponent over an edge just barely hangs on and vice versa. Also while it’s fun that individual levels are short it would have been nice to have more than 20 levels to play through. Because it’s possible to play through the game in less than ten hours that means Skulls relies a lot on it’s great replayability.\n\nDue to it's campaign length I think the $14.99 asking price might be a bit much but this is definitely a great purchase at $10.","March 9, 2014","true","38.2"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","1"

I've only played the single player/campaign mode and I couldn't find multiplayer match :( . I guess the multiplayer has been "long gone" or maybe I just couldn't find any player online. In this game you are playing as a afterlife general in shogun era (I always think general = shogun himself), nah don't think to much.\n\nyou are able to control several units and it does have the feel of advanced wars on DS without grid. the concept are same, there are resources/paddy field to conquer, statue/jizo that act as unit spawn place or towers that will do 1 damage in the beginning of each player turn. the AI unit and level design is smart, the game doesn't feel too hard or too easy, but the challenge is hard and sometimes you have to repeat few times to get all skulls (like stars from mobile games)\n\nthe music, gameplay and graphics of this game are well done made. the control however does have a bit of problem. I use logitech wireless x-input, I think this game was planned to be steam and mobile game, and to pick a unit from a controller you have to use dpad , sometimes a unit won't be selected -- this is just minor issue and maybe the problem didn't exist if you use mouse as you can select by clicking the unit. I just like to use controller if possible.\n\nI saw the credits and I didn't find japanese name on it.. or maybe I just missed it, I thought the developers are from Japan, but it's not -- well, it's not important where they come from as long as they brought great game to play!","June 2, 2015","true","11.1"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

I have to say that I was immediately impressed from the start.  The art-style, while cartoonish, is eye-catching and flowed very well.  Games that feature turn-based combat are most certainly not a new concept, but the idea of eating the skulls of your enemies to heal and level up is certainly different. Moving characters around with the mouse does admittedly take some getting used to.  I wouldn't go as far as to say that this is the best turn-based strategy game I've ever played, but I am hard-pressed to find any major faults with it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/228960/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2001 products in account","Skulls of the Shogun is a 2D game that mixes real time movement and turn based combat with a lovely cartoony graphics style. I'm gonna be honest here, the first time I heard about this game I thought it was some spin-off Total War Shogun only to soon know that these two games had nothing to do with each other.\n\nThe game starts off with a cutscene of you (General Akamoto) being stabbed in the back and going to the land of the dead and this is where the story starts. In the land of the dead you uncover a plot against the Shogun of the Dead by facing various generals, one on each "sector", until you eventually face the Shogun of the Dead himself. Even though at first the story might not seem that appealing to some people, the game dialogue, which is text based, is extremely funny throughout the entire game and I do think that this is one of the main reasons why I enjoyed Skulls of the Shogun so much.\n\nThe game features both online and local multiplayer along with a single player campaign. Having only played the campaign I can say that it is divided in a number of sectors, one for each season more specifically. Each of these sectors has various levels, usually 4, and each sector/season has a different general and a different army that you will face.\n\nThe more you progress the more the game slowly teaches you how to use newly acquired units, most of those tips are not actually shoved into your face by some text popping on the screen but, instead, your units will sometimes talk with each other, or the enemy, between turns thus making some sweet funny transitions from one turn to another.\n\nThe animations are somewhat lacking in my honest opinion but I think the game gets away with it just because I really like the art style and the way they've done the 2D sprites along with the backgrounds and the map design. The cartoony look certainly adds alot of charm to it. I actually didn't payed much attention to themusic and I think part of it it's because I didn't find it to be that good and maybe even a bit repetitive.\n\nThe core:Gameplay wise the game is a turn based combat game with some minor twists. In each turn you are granted the ability to use or summon 5 units. At first, each unit is only granted one action per turn, but your general can perform 2 actions per turn, and if you lose your general it’s game over. There are a few things you need to keep in mind while playing Skulls of the Shogun, such as, eating skulls heals your units and increases their maximum HP and after eating 3 skulls they will become "possessed" which makes them stronger units. By placing two units close enough to each other will create a "spirit wall" around them which will prevent them from getting knockbacked by enemy melee attacks and reduces incoming damage. You also need to take in consideration the fact that there are rice fields which you can capture that will grant you rice and heal your unit placed there each round, rice can be used to use certain spells with different types of monks (monks are what you could call "mages") and to summon units if you happen to have captured a temple. Monks can be summoned by capturing shrines and there's a specific shrine for each monk along with a shrine that acts as some sort of tower which attacks enemies within range at the end of each turn.\n\nYou also need to take into consideration the unit placement and the terrain, some levels will have abysses and ice on the floor. Ice will increase the knockback on a unit that is not protected by a spirit wall. Iif you manage to knockback someone to an abyss or from higher ground they will get instantly killed no matter how much HP they had previously. This is actually one of the key strategies to progress in various levels. The unit variety is fairly simple, you have your infantry, which are close range, your cavalry which have more range than the infantry but take more damage and of course you have archers which can attack from afar. As I mentioned earlier, there are also monks, one is a healer, another is a fire monk which plays the same role as an archer and you also have some sort of crow monk which instead of attacking can use wind to push enemies away or friendly units closer to a specific point. At last you have your general which is your main unit, if you kill your enemy general you win and if you lose your general you lose.\n\nThe campaign takes around 13 hours to beat and it is extremely enjoyable. They actually released a little campaign which is called "Forgotten Isles", which adds some levels to the single player campaign but in this add-on you keep the units and the rice you have at end of a level and you bring them with you to the next level thus making it somewhat harder, I actually didn't beat this add-on because I didn't really felt it was actually important to the story, even though it has some.\n\nVerdict:Lovely cartoony art style\nVery low system requirements\nFunny dialogue\nTactical combat\nIf you enjoy turn based combat games with some resource management you can't go wrong with Skulls of the Shogun, it is pretty damn good.","February 25, 2014","true","14.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Your cursor is a massive clumsy pointer that makes it extremely difficult to select and move units that are close together.  Getting your units in a proper formation is an exercise in frustration, but managable if that was the only problem.\n\nMaking any moves takes extra clicks because of the limitations of a touch screen first interface.  For example, hovering over units to see their hp doesn't work, you must left-click to select each of them individually to see hp and then click back on the unit you were planning on using (once to select it, once to "activate" it, and a third time to make it actually do anything)  These things were solved in the 90s and so the controls feel similar to a bad console port.\n\nIf you have a windows 8 touchscreen tablet and like games like advance wars this would be great, otherwise avoid it unless you're willing to wrestle with your mouse.","April 18, 2015","false","2.4"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","17","28","0","0"

The gameplay consists of a relatively simple but unique turned-based combat system where the player and the AI each take turns commanding their units in a round to either move, attack, or perform other actions until they run out of moves (5 per side).  The player wins if he/she can kill all of enemy units or the enemy general, but must protect his/her own general in the process.   Three types of basic units are available from start including infantry, cavalry, and archer where they can be utilised to work together for maximum effect in a scenario.   Multiple strategies come into play during each scenario which is unique in their own way such as preventing enemy units from counterattacking when they are being attacked, or positioning one's units properly before the end of a round to minimise the damage received during AI's turn--can be accomplished by either running out of enemy's  movement range or hide in a bush which can grant a 20% chance for an attack to miss.  The gameplay can become stale were it not for golden skulls challenges and the succinct degree of humour present in the game which, surprisingly, can be quite amusing and definitely goes a long way in making the gameplay experience more satisfying.  There are also xp for levelling up and emblems you receive at end of each scenario depending on your performance but otherwise they do not have a direct impact on your gameplay, if at all, whether you are level 1 or 10 you do not possess any distinct advantage whatsoever aside from having bestowed a different title each level.  The emblems are purely for asthetic purposes to show off your dedication or time committed to the game, notwithstanding the amount of repetitive grinding just to be able to collect all the rare/very rare emblems either through gameplay or combining them to hopefully obtain the ones you want and then upgrading all or most of them to Gold rank.\n\nThere is a multiplayer component in addition to the single-player campaign as well.  However, the matchmaking lobby is usually empty majority of times and hence one would have to encompass a gross amount of patience in order to possibly find a mattch courtesy of the ability of the game to continuously search for opponents in the background whilst you wreak havoc in traditional campaign mode or casually browse through the leaderboards and emblems you have amassed.  Despite the near non-existence of an online community, I find the single-player campaign infinitely enjoyable on its own and that alone is enough to make this game remarkably innovative and is a refreshing change from the traditional, stagnant TBS mechanisms","June 3, 2014","true","29.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

There are 4 different "monk" units on top of the 3 basic units, and your general. The monks all have different and unique abilities, most of them cannot directly attack enemies, but instead use spells. Due to the circular movement instead of hexagon based it also offers heavy use of skilled positioning.\n\nThe single player campaign is challenging and fun, and will take you at the very least 10 hours but probably more like 15-20. The dialogue is pretty funny and the missions are well crafted.\n\nThe multiplayer is incredibly fun and will last you for a long time, the only unfortunate thing with this game is that the multiplayer is very deserted, but if you actually get a game going it's good fun. You should try to get some friends who also own this game and play multiplayer with them, seeing as getting strangers is difficult. There are a lot of different multiplayer maps, although some are slightly unbalanced they are overall really good.\n\nThe game also offers a lot of replayability on single player levels. There are three "golden skulls" on each level that you can acquire by fulfilling certain conditions (example: Win without attacking with any other unit than your general), these conditions are different for every map, the example I used is only present on one level.\n\nI also feel like I should point out that the art style is really unique and cool, and I like the sound assets as well.\n\nI can't really discredit the game for a deserted multiplayer, so I will personally rate it 9/10 (because the 10/10 game doesn't exist yet)\n\nFor a large list of what the game contains in mechanics and gameplay, see my thread here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/228960/discussions/0/864972399789762136/","December 1, 2013","true","51.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This is not at all true of Skulls of the Shogun﻿. This highly polished turn-based tactics/strategy game isn't overly complex (it's got a great tutorial), but remains deep enough to be satisfying for higher-level play, with additional rewards for particularly skilled play.\n\nAnd I'm totally uninterested in playing it right now.\n\nWhile I can't say that I'm a huge aficionado of the genre (tactics and/or strategy), I have enjoyed games of this type in the past, and while I would generally consider myself to be "not very good" at strategy/tactics, I think it's important to challenge myself from time-to-time. But right now I'm just not in the mood, so this game will go into the pile labeled "revisit" (a designation for games that I either wish to replay, or games that I didn't feel like playing but think that I should try again later).\n\nI would certainly recommend this game, however, and It's available on many platforms (PC/Mac/Linux, some—but not all—Sony/Microsoft consoles, as well as iOS).","June 23, 2014","true","5.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/micbemac/recommended/228960/","micbemac","micbemac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/micbemac/","146 products in account","A 2D tactical RPG, Skulls of the Shogun takes inspiration from other classic games like Final Fantasy Tactics, and Advance Wars.  Taking place in a colorful cartoon world, Skulls of the Shogun takes this inspiration and rolls with it in all sorts of fun and intuitive ways.\n\n\nSet in ancient Japan, you take the role of a recently deceased Shogun.  Killed by his own lieutenant during battle, he is relegated to the afterlife as a skeleton. Faced with waiting in line with thousands of other fallen soldiers to the end of time waiting to get into the afterlife, the general instead decides to take matters into his own hands and raises an army to push his way to his rightful reward.\n\nThe playful art style mixes well with the almost constant shade of humour in the game.  Dialogue and character choices are both funny, and light hearted.  The third wall is broken often as the characters question not only the game mechanics, but the player's actions.  This cleverness tends to fade a little as the game proceeds, but not so much that it isn't still funny at times.\n\n\nEach character class has a unique look and animations.  The only fault visually is occasionally the screen becomes crowded with units and objects and it can be difficult to pick out the object you want, though the game does try to assist with a pop up when several items are selected close together.\n\nEach battle is a 1v1 turn based affair.  The game starts you out with very basic commands and units and does a good job of dishing out new elements with each new battle.  Every different unit comes with it's own stats and abilities.  Infantry have solid defence and good knockback, but are slow and don't deal that much damage.  Calvary have long movement range and high attack, but no knockback.  There are various other units like archers and magic casters to fill out the ranks.  Your general is also controllable in battle and gains new abilities as the story progresses.\n\n\nEach of these units can be upgraded during any single battle in the unique manner of eating the skulls of fallen foes, even though as they will tell you themselves, it's pretty gross.  Each skull adds hit points to your units including your general, and when 3 skulls are consumed your unit becomes a demon and gains an extra action each turn.  This extra action can be extremely useful in most battles.  Along the way you will also find various potions and power ups to assist you in winning.\n\nOn later maps you will also be tasked with some minor resource management.  Rice paddies can be conquered to give you rice to pay for new troops at barracks.  There are also other buildings to be conquered to give you access to more powerful units.  Rice paddies are limited, and each one including the other buildings can be conquered by the opposing force at any time.  Controlling the map becomes very important on these levels.\n\n\nEach map has different objectives, and several can be won in different ways.  Defeating the enemy general, defeating all troops, or moving a unit to a specific marker may all be ways to win.  Several maps have multiple stages and differing objectives in each stage.  This with the overlapping humour keeps the game fresh and fun throughout.\n\nThis is a fun game with a long campaign, multiplayer options and a ton of laughs.  With a regular price of $10.99 on Steam it's definitely a bargain, and will fill up hours of your time.  If you are a fan of strategy games, good humour and want a game that is easy to get into, this is a great one for you.","July 26, 2015","true","2.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

In fact, I think it may be the best small-scale TBS game released on PC in recent years! Core gameplay draws heavily on the (excellent) Advance Wars series, but swaps out large armies and extensive unit rosters for small-ish scale battles that carry a real sense of streamlined elegance and tactical choice, without losing the crucial magic of turn-by-turn strategic oneupmanship enjoyed by its spiritual predecessors. The gridless movement system works surprisingly well and makes the game feel fresh as a result, and teh campaign is quite meaty and enjoyable too. Oh, and the 'progression system' touted in the trailer alarmed me when I first heard  about it, but it's a strictly cosmetic thing, so multiplayer matches remain 100% fair.

The graphics are clean, and the characters are quirky and fun. At the time of writing this review I haven't completed the game yet, but I don't imagine the game getting drastically worse.\n\nIf you haven't heard of/played Advanced Wars, then the best way I can think of describing the game is a turn based strategy game without leveling or grinding characters. Your starting units are preset for every mission, and it's up to you to plan out the best course of action. You can use the terrain to your advantage, and control rice fields so that you can build more units. When you kill an enemy they leave their skull behind. You can make one of your units eat it to heal+upgrade them during the mission. Once you eat 3 skulls the unit ranks up and can act twice per turn.\n\nThe only downside is that the online community will probably be dead.

Skulls seems to be a casual take of a turn based strategy game at first (similar to what Swords and Soldiers HD did for real time strategy), but there's a surprising amount of depth in its options and gameplay.  New stages gradually introduce the player to classes, helpful spirits, environmental dangers and skill sets.  Actually, I think this gradual integration of mechanics continued until the very end!  The Cartoon Network-style visuals turned me off at first, but they grew on me and now I find them charming haha... same with the dialogue.  Don't expect anything deep from Skull's narrative, but it's fun and not as heavy handed as most strategy games out there.  Skulls can be quite brutal at higher difficulties, and I shamefully admit I had to reduce the difficulty to casual on some of the later levels... enemy AI can be tricky so much strategy and prior planning is necessary.","January 19, 2014","true","11.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Your second in command, who also died shortly after killing you, and has convinced everyone that HE is the great general and taken your rightful place in the paradise of the afterworld, you quickly organize a rebellion in an effort to take back your name and get revenge on the coward who stabbed you in the back. Long story short, the story is funny and entertaining while allowing for some interesting game mechanics\n\nEasy to pick up: This point is really important for me, the game is easy to learn (goes back to not being overly complicated) and fun to play if you don't have a ton of time. Looking at a similar game, like Civ, once you start a game it takes a long time to finish. Skulls of the Shogun has fast paced gameplay that you can get into in only a few minutes, while still being difficult enough to give you an enjoyable challenge.\n\nOverall I really like the game, and I think just completing the campaign, should last you around 20+ hours, I would highly recommend it for a pretty unique strategy game focused more on combat/tactics than other turn based strategy games that require you to build up an army first.","June 23, 2014","true","32.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The creators say they based the game on Advance Wars, and it really does take all the best gameplay elements from that game while developing its own unique feel. It offers the best tactical and strategic gameplay since Fire Emblem, a series I have a great amount of respect for. The only criticism so far is that the dialogue in the campaign mode contains tons of references that feel REALLY forced. The Super Mario Bros. and Anchorman quotes made sense in the context of the story, but the references really got out of hand when one of the characters quoted lyrics from Poison's "Every Rose has its thorns" for no reason (something like this happens at least once per cutscene). But the gameplay is 100% solid. You have multiple viable commands to give your units every turn, and the pacing of aggression versus gaining strength almost always presents a few gripping decision points per turn. This game is absolutely worth the $5 price tag.","December 27, 2014","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has an enjoyable feel and a good unique-feeling premise, and it's just fun to play.\n\nI recommend this to anyone looking for a fun enjoyably simple game that won't bog you down with super-complicated resource management. The mechanics of gameplay here are quite simple, and the game is very easy to pick up and play. Skulls of the Shogun is also humorous enough and fun enough to keep you playing thru to the end. It also tells a story as you progress thru the game, which is a nice touch.\n\nEven though I rate this as a casual game, some missions can get the best of you. There is some thinking involved in how you approach each mission, and the same approach may not work each time. There are a limited amount of resources to gather and manage each mission, so spend that rice wisely.\n\nPick it up, play it, and have fun! Remember to protect your General. If he dies, game over. And save some rice for a last minute revive or summon. And don't forget to convert skulls in order to deny the enemy from eating them. This will help you more than any other strategy.","March 19","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Plenty of maps to keep you busy trying to collect all of the skulls & also the story is pretty damn funny. Also has multiplayer & controller support (never used the mouse).

You come in thinking it will be a very simplistic strategy game. But the only simple thing here is how accessable it is. There is so much depth to this game and it helps that it is loaded with a bunch of extra options for how you want to play it. The diaogue is great, the music is great, the sound design is great. You're getting about 8 hours out of the campaign with deaths for just the base game. The bonefide edition (not labled but the steam version is that) includes another short campaign that involves carry-over progression - units, rice (money) etc- after you beat the main campaign.  It also has online, local, and by-mail multiplayer. If you like turn based strategy games, you need to play this.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3Rwq6hp1ZM","June 21, 2015","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The presentation is top-notch and the setting (the Japanese underworld) seems perfectly suited for this game. Aside from the campaign, there are various multiplayer options, including couch co-op, making it a perfect game to play with friends and loved ones.","June 23, 2013","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A real treasure of a turnbased strategy game that is nearly flawless.\nThis is a simple easy to learn turn based strategy game that is fun from the first few seconds of play yet has  plenty of strategy and is wonderful to play hot seat with a friend.\n\nThe campain is an incredibley well thought out tutorial and is the right level of humor and challenge.\n\nThere are a lot of really cool concepts in this game, hitting enemies knocks them back, and by pushing enemies around cleverly you can deal extra damage or instantly kill them by knocking them into the water.\n\nStanding units next to eachother lets you form walls. Linked units can't be pushed or be crossed or shot over by enemy archers, making formation important.\n\nWhen a unit dies their skull remains. Eating Skulls restores HP, unlock spells for magic users and feeding a unit 3 skulls upgrades them to being able to do an extra attack per turn.\n\nI could just keep going, just trust me this game is worth checking out.\nFurthermore it has the best cross platform system I've ever seen. Not only is there online play across all platforms but your profile and save file carries over too. So I can play this game with my phone on the bus, and continue the campain at home on my PC.\n","June 3, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
