It's quite a challenging game, especially until you get the hang of things. It's a dark, twisted survival game where pretty much everything is trying to kill you. You've got to scavenge, build things, and defend yourself, all while trying to pay attention to the environment (weather) and the fullness of your stomach. The developers also seem to be constantly updating the game and adding huge amounts of awesome content for free. It just keeps expanding and you just keep wanting to play again and again.

Let me explain:\nWhen I saw the game I were like ,,Naahhhh I'm not going to buy this.'' but a few days later I looked a second time and tought ,,Why not?It looks funny. And it says you can celebrate with your piggy friends.''  that was when I bought it. I can tell you I got addicted to the game. The first day I played 12 h's. I told my brother and my friend they should buy it. They did it and got addicted, too. I think nearly every Computer can run the graphics and the the characters are funny, too. With every game I started a new story war born. For example I started my first game and forgot to make a fire when the night came up I died and I was like ,,Why?I should have know''. And I learned with every new day that the game hates me. The game likes to punch you in the face. And the community is amazing. In the forums you can see artist, storywriters, survivers and so on. Pretty fast updates with new content to explore and even merchandise. It's a tip for everyone who like survival games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/herverylowness/recommended/219740/","herverylowness","Altehäus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/herverylowness/","78 products in account","Say pal, this is a nice game we've got over here, better buy it before night comes.\n\nIn all seriousness, Don't Starve is great. You start it up and you have no single clue of who you are and what you're doing, the only thing that you're allowed to know is that you have to "find something to eat before the night comes". From that point on, you learn. You learn which animals you can approach and which you may not, you learn how to craft more advanced tiers of wares than the simple Axe and Pickaxe, you learn how to survive in that particular dystopia you were forced into, but the way you learn about surviving is pretty ironically encountered in death. PERMANENT death, to be specific. In my honest opinion, that is one of the biggest beauties of this game. As a highly unforgiving piece, it just has one strict law you must follow throughout your whole experience: Screw up, and you're done for this life. But then you start a new one, and screw up in that too, sooner or later, until you've witnessed at least a good part of what the game has in its sleeve to kill you, and from that point you can start living longer and longer. Maybe you could even make a town of pig men, maybe you could even unite a herd of beefalo to protect your base, maybe you could even delve deep into the caves to find yourself challenged by many more new mechanics and challenges, or maybe you could just die again. That's always a possibility. The only thing you can't avoid in this game is death, as it comes in all shapes and sizes, and you can never be prepared enough for it.\n\nNow that I took that big chunk of text out of the way, I can talk about something else. The lack of achievements, multiplayer and information in this game. While for many these three factors could be seen as very critical downsides, I see it as what gives the game its format. Let's see: Lack of achievements. Why would they make a game without what's possibly the most common form of reward in the modern age of gaming? The answer is simple: To keep your interest into the game. You see, with achievements, your main goal would just be hunting for them, and then you'd be faced with yourself thinking "What now?" even though the game still has a myriad of experiences to give you. So that's why there are no achievements in this game, to keep the playstyle far from linear. Second point, lack of multiplayer. I don't even feel like there is a lot to talk here. In a game like this one, the aspect of complete loneliness and desertion created by the atmosphere is a critical factor for enjoyment, and the sharing of experiences in the game can be made outside of the game itself, by sharing experiences and weird new discoveries with your friends. I feel like this community wouldn't be the same if Don't Starve had multiplayer. For the third and last point of this review before I wrap it all up, we have the lack of information. This is quite possibly the simplest of the three, as it is explained by a single sentence: Discovery is your biggest reward. Yeah, just that. For dying, you are rewarded with the discovery about something, be it the mechanics of what killed you, be it the existance of a creature you want to find again, be it the fact that you're just stupid and inneficient at doing stuff.\n\nTo wrap it all up, I just wanna say that this game is a real work of art, and that we are getting a DLC!

For the most part, the controls and interface are intuitive, so it's simply a matter of deciding where to go or what to do.\n\nThe game is called Don't Starve, and hunger is indeed a major theme. If you go a few days without food, you will die. That said, there are plenty of other things to kill you - a variety of animals and monsters, environmental hazards, and your own dwindling sanity. To battle this, you rely on building your own equipment, consumables and structures, ranging from weapons and armor to crock pots to unwholesome magical devices.\n\nDon't Starve can be brutal, so you should expect to die, but just making good progress is rewarding in itself. You unlock new characters as you play, each with little touches or specialties to diversify your experience. And while there are some pretty powerful or useful items you can make, there are still a lot of ways to play, and they're all valid (which is good, because sometimes you don't have much choice.)\n\nIf you're bored or frustrated, you can change your experience by starting a new game and adding or removing features. If you're tired of fighting certain monsters, you can just turn them off. I haven't messed with this myself, as I like the feeling of surprise, and playing the game as-is, but the developers have left the doors wide open for custom play experiences. In the same way, you can make use of a wealth of user-created elements.\n\nThere are a few things I missed for awhile, like the fact that you can view a map of everywhere you've been so far, but overall the game doesn't suffer much from lack of tutorial or hand-holding. You can go read everything on a wiki if you prefer, but this is a game where I don't actually begrudge trial and error learning. Encountering strange new things and deciding what to do with them is a ton of fun, even if it sometimes gets you killed.\n\nA warning (at least from my perspective) - this game is so immersive, I prefer to keep playing it for hours on end once I start. It's not a game I enjoy having to stop, unless I come to good stopping point like dying at the end of a long survival run. In fact, sometimes I forget to eat for a long time when I play this.

Or maybe a friendly campfire.Don't Starve is, at its most basic level, a survival game. It features crafting, mysticism, science and all manner of nasty creatures, especially once it gets dark. In order to stay alive, players have to use the surrounding flora and fauna to craft increasingly complex tools, starting with a simple axe and building up to items as intricate as lightning rods and carpeted flooring.When you die in Don't Starve, your current world is destroyed, along with the things you created while surviving in it. There are advanced tricks to escape death – constructing a Meat Effigy or finding an Amulet – but rest assured that you will most likely die before gaining the experience required to craft or dig up these items. A Touch Stone will also resurrect fallen players, but finding that structure early on is more luck than certain death. I did find it, at the beginning of my second run, but I didn't know what the strange circle surrounded by pig heads was, so I didn't use it, and when I died, I was dead.That said, curiosity and a desire to poke at unfamiliar things are essential in Don't Starve.Dying is a fundamental gameplay aspect. Death won't always come from starvation; it inhabits many forms, including beasts large and small, and the terrors that hide in the night. A clock-like status bar in the upper right corner of the map shows how many days you've survived and the current time, and it provides health, hunger and mental gauges. It's an efficient system, the clock hand moving from yellow to red to blue – day, afternoon and night – and circles of health systems draining without proper care. One glance and it's instantly clear how long until you have to build a fire, or if you need to eat or rest.On top of a solid survival game, Don't Starve is a deep, layered experiment in crafting and exploration. Throughout the biomes are wormholes that transport players to different lands, which offer new materials for building science machines – which unlock new crafting recipes – and heartier structures. New characters are unlocked with experience – 20 points per day survived. This is all in Sandbox Mode, but Don't Starve also features an Adventure Mode, which players can enter by finding and activating Maxwell's Door. Adventure Mode is Don't Starve's campaign, pitting Wilson against Maxwell, the demonic genius who brought Wilson to the wilderness in the first place. It's five grueling chapters – upon first entrance, players lose all items and crafting recipes, and can only carry four items between Adventure Mode chapters. Die in Adventure Mode and you're spat back out into Sandbox Mode, precisely where you left it.For its art style, deceptively dark vibe and experimental approach, Don’t Starve is certainly worth a look.","March 15, 2015","true","27.8"," 238 of 257 people (93%) found this review helpful 45 people found this review funny","93","238","257","45","3"

It does a good job.\n\n\n\nThe core gameplay is simply trying to survive. gathering materials and food during the day, and huddling by a fire, trying to craft useful tools at night. As the day to night cycle progresses, so does the seasonal cycle. After a couple days, winter comes, making it harder to collect food, and hunt. The nights become longer and the days become shorter as you huddle by your fire, trying not to freeze to death. During winter, your homemade farms stop becoming useful. Huntable animals disappear and other more dangerous animals come in swarms.\n\n\n\nAs far as the story goes, there is an oddly rich story, which can only be experienced by skilled players. Whenever a new game is started, Maxwell, the games antagonist, warns him to get food. The real story mode cannot be achieved unless the player has found the four pieces, and then moves to the next level. After beating a few levels, they reach the epilogue, where maxwell is unlocked as a playable character and the game is complete.\n\n\n\nDon't starve’s graphics and art style is very Tim Burton. The monsters, alone have a scary but yet cute feel to them. The sound of the game is very creepy yet welcoming. depending on what the player is doing at the time. The music changes whenever the player is in combat or not, making the combat feel even more immersive.\n\n\n\nDon’t stare also has a large amount of options. Not only can you pick your character but you can also modify the world and its many resources. Players can make the world a food rich wonderland, or a barren wasteland, randomized each time. Each playable character has its own stats, and buffs/debuffs, tailoring to each possible playstyle.\n\n\n\n\nThe in game crafting provides a large variety of machines, tools, farms and structures. The player can craft anything from carpets, campfires, spears, drying racks, walls, bee-based mines and a large variety of clothing, all with special perks. Winter coats to keep you warm, mining hats to provide light, feather hats to increase how many birds there are, armour to reduce damage, and a flower garland to keep sanity up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't starve does lots of things right.\n\n\nThe art style and sound design is amazing for this game\n\nThe crafting feels organic and worth the effort.\n\nThe clothes in the game change not only how the player looks, but also has bonuses.\n\nThe Monsters in the game are interesting and fun to hunt.\n\nThe many varieties of food make the game more interesting\n\nThe story is enjoyable, even if you don't play through it.\n\nThe antagonist is one of the best “bad guys” i've seen in games for a while\n\nThe different playable characters are fantastic\n\nThe game has a customizable world setting.\n\nThe game has playing cards\n\n\nDon't starve does a few thing wrong.\n\n\nThe cave mechanic is hardly explored until late game\n\nThe game has a few bugs still needing to be fixed\n\nThe follower mechanic should be touched up\n\nThe vanilla game can be a tad boring\n\nThe player may rage-quit after dieing on a long time world.\n\nThe game lacks achievements\n\nThe game lacks vanilla co-op\n\n\nDon’t Starve isn't only a magnificent survival game, but it is also a well told story, for those who care to play it. I believe that there is a large market for this game, and that market keeps on growing. If you don't already own this game, pick it up on sale. Its on sale almost every winter and summer sale. I payed full price for it and i think its worth it.\n","June 1, 2015","true","82.4"," 172 of 180 people (96%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","96","172","180","18","0"

The not so quick version involves you attempting to survive in a world which is pretty much entirely out to kill you (even the trees will try to kill you...), having been dumped there by a mysterious character called Maxwell. It is down to you to, as with many Minecraft games, start from the ground up by collecting flint and twigs, and putting together rudimentary tools, before hacking down trees and mining rocks for the more advanced stuff. As your toolset grows, so do your options, and thankfully, so does your diet choices (berries work for a while, but there's nothing like cooked rabbit).\n\nThe game now has a fair bit of lore and background to it, and with the addition of caves, and sub areas, now has a more "exploratory" feel on top. Combined with the Steam Workshop, a slew of unlockable characters, and a soundtrack which I seriously suggest everyone who picks up the game -also- collects, results in an outstanding offering that will appeal to survivalists and minecrafters alike.","November 25, 2013","true","21.4"," 337 of 400 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","337","400","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/219740/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","It’s a pity that Tim Burton hasn’t been involved in video games: both his visual style and his storytelling abilities would be welcome additions to our industry. Thankfully, niche approaches to style can find a welcome home in today’s indie market, and the folks down at Klei entertainment have turned that particular style onto the video game scene in their new 2-D open world survival title Don’t Starve. It’s a refreshing and unique entry into the genre, one that puts extra emphasis on the ‘surviving’, and that’s sure to give players a welcome challenge.\n\nThe goal in Don’t Starve is simple and straightforward (hint: read the title). The player takes control of a forlorn, classically British-looking protagonist, and although there is only one default starter character, other playable characters with potentially useful abilities unlock as the game progresses. When you start in the world, you’ve got only your bare hands to work with. There’s no tree-punching, thank goodness, but you’ll need to start off by hunting down some flint and sticks so you can fashion yourself an axe. Your first priorities are simply to acquire fire (which you must have to survive a night) and food (which, as it turns out, delays starvation). As luck would have it, it’s not enough to simply peg down a steady source of calories; if you’re not careful, you can also be killed in the conventional manner, in other words, by being ravenously eaten, poisoned, or pecked to death by some of Mother Nature’s wonders. There are also some native inhabitants, better armed and armored than you, who are probably best avoided. As if that weren’t enough, there’s one more danger that feels just a tad artificial: your character starts to go insane without having new things to think about (aka, crafting new items or gathering pleasant items). This provides an impetus to keep you gathering harder-to-find materials, and although this seems like a bit of a poor man’s way of encouraging you to explore and ‘techify’, the crafting is fun enough that it stands on its own two feet. Generally you’ll be quite happy to spend time gathering special items just because you want to, say, build yourself a suit of armor, or a new kind of animal trap. There are even cute hats to make that have the added bonus of keeping your sanity up.\n\nIf all of this sounds like an open-world creativity journey, think again. Don’t Starve does give you several nice options for survival. For example, your food sources can come from scavenging, farming, hunting, or even cultivating your own bees. However, in the harsh climates that you’ll be fighting through, your options are usually so limited that you’ll need to focus all your efforts on whatever strategy is most likely to let you live another day. It’s not a game of fun and frolicking: you’ve got to fix your problems now, before they grow to big and doom you by your own stupidity.\n\nThat’s all well and good for the basic ‘survive-and-thrive’ aspect of Don’t Starve, but there’s also a form of campaign in the guise of the Adventure Mode. Here, the player is placed into specially created worlds with particularly difficult settings: it might be extra cold, or extra dark, or the food might be extra hard to come by. Surviving in each world long enough to collect pieces of a McGuffin allow the player to progress to the next challenge, slowly uncovering a thin story as the adventure continues. It’s not a strong enough narrative to be an independent draw for most players, but gives a nice added challenge to the standard gameplay.\n\nFrom its title to its music, Don’t Starve does an excellent job of perfectly nailing a unique tone: it’s always a little dark, a little humorous, and a little self-conscious. The soundtrack is mostly made to mimic small-ensemble Victorian era motifs, the sort of thing that you would expect to hear in a haunted mansion movie. That said, it feels like there’s not enough of this high quality music to go around. The light-hearted morbidity of the game is even reflected in what characters you can play with: it’d be so easy to simply make the player a terribly frightened little girl or boy, crying for his or her mommy. Instead, the characters in the game gleefully watch trees burn and take pleasure in slaughtering whatever cute furry animals they can find. It’s a kill-or-be-killed world, and your character loves every minute of it. But the best part about the game is that the environment itself practically has a character. Nature isn’t just a harsh environment: it’s out to get you. Chop up too many trees, or wring the necks of too many fluffy bunnies, and you might find yourself facing some particularly vengeful avatars of the outdoors.\n\nThe worldbuilding in Don’t Starve is a special treat, and is quite possibly the most enjoyable aspect of the game. The scenery and enemies are given a dark, edgy sketch style that looks a bit like a flannelgraph or felt puppet show. Birds and critters all have their distinctive hoots and whistles, and even the trees quiver when they grow new leaves (which, appropriately, happens in a sudden ‘pop’). Genre-wise, Don’t Starve sits nicely in that sweet spot of gothic aesthetics, partway between simple turn-of-the-century technology and homespun magic.\n\nComparisons between Don’t Starve and Minecraft are inevitable, but unfair. Don’t Starve isn’t nearly as open-ended: it’s more focused on the challenge of survival, and there’s very little call for customization at all in the game. All recipes are technically given to you in advance, although you may need to traverse a tech tree in order to gain access to them. The crafting in Don’t Starve is also more focused on utility - generally speaking you’ll be so busy trying desperately to build the weapons or shelter that you require, you won’t ever find yourself making something just for the fun of it. Instead of offering limitless exploration, Don’t Starve offers a particular feeling; that of being in a creepy, kooky horror story.\n\nWith only a few biomes and enemy types currently implemented, the game as it is only carries a decent amount of material, and replay value is sadly limited. The sticking point here is that, like Minecraft, Don’t Starve promises continual updates (and cleverly posts the date of the next game addition on its main menu). This makes the purchase of Don’t Starve something of a gamble: maybe it will fill up to the brim with new content, maybe it won’t, and only time will tell.\n\nMore so than in other genres of games, world building in survival games is important, because the world is your enemy. Just like every good heroic RPG needs a delicious villain to focus your conflict against, a good survival game needs to give the environment itself a personality. While most outdoor survival games do this by making the environment be something like an inviting, friendly host, Don’t Starve goes in the opposite direction by making the Mother Nature seem more like that weird cat lady who lives in the boarded-up house. It’s not so much an invitation to explore and enjoy yourself as it is a long list of dangers to avoid. Don’t pick fights with the locals. Don’t stay in one place for too long. Don’t ignore that growl you hear in the night. Oh, and just in case you forget... try not to starve.\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 9, 2014","true","14.4"," 169 of 194 people (87%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","87","169","194","12","0"

This is a must buy for anyone who enjoys a game where the player is given total freedom to do what they want, how they want and when they want. So as a player and big fan here is my own personal experience on such an awesome single player experience game.\n\nJ20Hawkz Personal Opinion\n\nI have been playing this game since early release and still find it extremely hard to stop playing it. Personally for me I enjoy adventure, action and rpg, Don't Starve combines all three in a unique way and blends in survival horror and a sort of farming, resource hoarding element also. If you enjoyed playing games such as Animal Crossing and Harvest Moon you will definitely feel right at home playing this. The added twist is you are always on your feet to make sure you don't go insane and lose health. Oh and of course don't starve.\n\nSeasons, Days, Interactions\n\nAlmost everything can be interacted with, from catching small butterflies and bees to having epic battles with huge lumbering monsters that hunt you in the coldest and hardest of times. Yes Don't Starve has seasonal changes, and not only do you live to survive, you must survive to live. Days go from light to dark, they don't last very long making it all important you do enough to survive the dark night and start again when the sun comes out. Anything that moves and would potentially pose a threat can harm the player if you choose to get too close or in some way anger it.\n\nWeapons, Traps, Armour, Food\n\nCraft weapons, armour, traps and walls to defend yourself against continuous threat. Capture, kill, gather and cook food to make sure your hunger never drops. Everything you see can be used to collect valuable resources that will be used to craft hundreds of helpful survival items.\n\nExplore a living world\n\nNot only are we free to explore a fairly large open map, we can also go deeper into the caves and explore a strange and creepy ancient world. With the addition of such levels Don't Starve replay ability went through the window. Again exploring either the world above ground or venturing deep into the darkness of the caves, is all up to the player. There are no strings attached. You do as you wish.\n\nMinor Issues\n\nThere are some minor faults with the game, but the team behind this game are very supportive and at least one member is on hand to help sort out any technical issues or those annoying bugs we encounter while playing. Never have I seen a more committed development team than Klei. Most questions can be answered by reading the community made Don't Starve Wiki, you can also visit the Official Klei site and post questions or reply to other friendly members of the Don't Starve community. The Steam Don't Starve forum is also a good place to share or ask what's on your mind.\n\nDeath\n\nDeath can be a pain, if you die that's it, you have to start all over again. The further you get is based on the number of days survived. However you gain experience points based on this number that is used to unlock other playable characters all of which have unique aspects about them. There are ways of avoiding a permanent game ending death so not all hope is lost.\n\nPlay alone or together\n\nDon't Starve was originally planned as a Single player game only. On the 6th of May 2014 multiplayer was announced for late summer 2014. More to follow.\n\nFinally\n\nAll in all, this game is a great single player oriented experience. The achievements we get is what we find hard and over come. With no online capabilities or steam associated achievements, some may find this game not worth buying.

You're low on food and sanity so you start picking up these berries which you haven't thought about doing in the beginning, and you also found flowers. You try eating them but notice that whenever you pick'em up your sanity raises. that's good.\nAfter a while of looting the enviorment you come across a rock biome. Great, you've gathered enough rocks to make yourself nothing because the night came again.\nAfter almost dying at night you start getting stone and come across a gold nugget. What could that be?\nAnd, again, a bulb ontop of the symbol of Atom has caputred your eye.\nYou make a science machine as you start grapsing that basics of this game. After a while of exploring your general land you come across a pig village with, ofcourse, the king pig inside. These pigs will turn out to be your only allies in this game. They have farms, they offer protection for any kind of meat and will save you from some of the horrors of this game. So you start making your base next to them as it is the only logical choice you could make in this game.\nAfter more days of looting and gathering resources you hear a faint woof. What could that be?\nHounds.\nAs you run relentlessly without understanding what's going on, your fellow pigsman are there to save the day, not for long though. You came out clean this time, which you should thank the gods of this cursed land.\nYou started making up a base, you crafted random items from the science tab and again, a bulb has lit up.\nYou craft an alchemy engine which will help you craft more scientific items.\nAfter roaming around in the world yet again, you come across ancient guardians of this cursed land.\nThey work like clockwork, they defend their land like no other creatures. You bribe your fellow pigsman and you go to fight these ancient creatures, winning the battle.\nAfter looting their corpses, you come across gears. When arriving at your house, you craft an Ice Box to slow the spoilage of the food. Neat.\nYou have a base, well protected from the horros of this world, you have everything you'd like in it.\nNow, there are two scenarios which can happen:\n1. Summer starts.\nYou have no idea what to do, your character starts to heat up without any knowledge on what's happening.\nYour house starts burning and you, yourself, is overheating.\nOkay, lets say that didn't happen and you miraculously didn't any fires or didn't overheat because you mined ice.\nGuess what?\nDragonfly. I'll leave that for you to discover what's that.\nScenario 2:\nWinter starts.\nGreat, you're cold, you're almost dead but you came across a failed survivor which had a Puffy Vest, thermal stone and a Cat Cap. How lucky you are. So you barely survive this day and come back to your house, rapidly fueling your campfire as it's the only gateway from this hellish environment. You have food in your ice box, you have enough wood somehow to survive the winter (Who am I kidding, this never happends, but for the purpose of this story let's assume it does).\nA saxphone sound comes out of your characters body and a text appeares, "That sounded big".\nI'll let you guess what's going to happen next.\nOfcourse, there are 2 more seasons, Autumn and Spring, but I feel like they shouldn't be focused on now as they are pretty similliar.\nYou die.\nAgain.\nAnd again.\nAnd again.\nAnd again, until you master the horrors of this cursed land, feeling success after surviving your first winter, summer, autumn, spring. You survive the countless waves of hounds. Great.\nYou come across a sinkhole.\nI'll let you find out what's going to happen next.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll in all, this game is a well polished survival game with a giant replay value, very little bugs are found, great developers who listen to the community, great DLC's which add a LOT to the game which are very cheap aswell.\nIf you like survival games and want to feel what a real survival game is, check this game out, it's on sale right now aswell.\nThis game will always have a special place for me.","February 6","true","84.0"," 38 of 38 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","38","38","3","2"

This game requires its player to always be thinking about what to do next so that they can always be prepared for a bad situation. Don't Starve is a very fun and feels refreshing each time you play, the characters with unique abilities and the randomised maps help the game stay addictive and attractive for a long time.

Like the game says, there really is fear aspect to this game. Every choice is crucial, fraught with unseen consequences. A choice you make 5 minutes into your run could make the difference 50 days in. There are countless terrible creatures out for your blood. One of the worst moments you can experience is in the dead of night as you are racked with pain as insanity takes over. You will hear a child's tune play like that from a Jack-in-a-box.

You will find yourself actively making mental notes on what to do the next day, stocking up on vegtatles for winter and scouting for animals to hunt to get loot which will accelerate you into the games not so obvious progression curve.\n\nEven once you have a fully established base with a constant supply of food and a surplus of anything, you will still end up dying to the natural environment. This game encourages you to be thinking on your feet and be ready for anything, whether that be an incomming wolf attack, or a surprise giant you are always on your toes. Thats what makes this game so unique, there is no time to be bored while playing because you always have something to do and it feels good once you accomplish it. If you are not a fan of busy work tasks then you will also like this game, there are no objectives set in the game, you essentially set your own path and every task you set isnt one you do for the sake of doing it - its because you need to to survive.\n\nLooking forward to the Shipwrecked patched, cannot wait to sink in (lol get it!) hours of fun into the new content to come. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes rewarding games. I was skeptical at first when I saw the graphics, then I realised how ignorant I was, the art fits the theme perfectly and gives the game a bit of charm. Recommend!","October 7, 2015","true","309.3"," 37 of 39 people (95%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","95","37","39","6","0"

Getting Started.\n\nI pick Wilson as my character and start my game. It dumps me in a birch tree biome full of Twigs, Grass, Berries, Carrots and Flint. So I walk around gather all that crap, cut down some trees gathered wood and acorns and made a fire and waited through the night. The next day comes and I start exploring. I come across a biome full of Boulders and Gold nuggets. So I make a Pickaxe and just start going through every Boulder getting Stone, Flint and Gold Nuggets. I did that all day. The next day comes and I went to search for Beefalo. Within the first 2 minutes I find beefalo. My reaction was “Yes! I can now get their poo and start a farm!” I then realise I got excited over poo... So I got a bunch of poo and found a decent spot to make my camp. The next day I cut down a ton of trees and made a lot of stone walls and marked my base. Once I had set my walls, I replaced the floor with wooden flooring. Then I placed my Science Machine, Alchemist Machine, Crock Pot, Drying rack, Lightning rod and made 3 improved farms. Everything was going great!. That was all in the first 7 days.\nA great start for me.\n\nDay 8 through 12. The Rise and Fall of Friendship.\n\nI go exploring looking for spider nests for webs and the Pig King for Gold Nuggets and Pig men to recruit for help. I take 4 steps up and boom! Forrest Biome full of spider nests! And right next to biome was the Pig village with the pig king. Having killed a few spiders on the way to finding the Pig king I had some monster meat. So I recruited 2 Pig men called (And I am not kidding you) Nacho and Libre. They helped me out killing spiders and getting webs and they also helped with cutting down trees. The next 4 days pretty much went like this. I got my webs, made the Bug Net, Bird Trap and Tent and then…something I was not expecting happened. You need to keep giving the Pigs meat for them to keep following you and I have been giving them Monster Meat that the Spiders dropped. Day 12 I give the Pig men Monster Meat for the fourth day and…they turned in to Werepigs… I had to kill them both. So at this point I go on the Don’t Starve Wiki to find out why this had happened. Turns out giving them 4 Monster Meat turns them in to Werepigs… R.I.P Nacho and Libre. Day 8-12.\n\nDay 13 through 21. Preparing for Winter.\n\nSad. Having killed my fellow Pig friends, I continued on. I go to an unexplored area and I find something surprising! A skeleton with an Ice Box next to him. I smash the Ice Box, take the items and ran back to my camp and made an Ice Box. This made me very happy. Now I can now store food without them going bad in 3 days. This also gave me a purpose to go mine the Ice blocks since Ice never melts in an Ice Box. For pretty much day 14 to 21 I stocked right the up on food. Making several meals from the crock pot and stocking up on Berries and Carrots that I could find. Just before day 21 hits, while just looking around in a forest I find yet another skeleton and this time he had a Winter hat and a Breezy Vest. I had loads of food in the Ice Box I had the perfect clothes and a fully heated Thermal Stone and my beard was fully ready. Bring on winter!\n\nDay 21 through 31. Spelunking and Giant encounter.\n\nWinter arrives! Snow everywhere! PENGUINS! And trying not to freeze to death! Winter was a pretty slow and boring time. Can’t really go out much without freezing so I thought to myself “I’m going to go explore the caves!” Expecting it to be dark and full of bats, I prepared myself. As soon as I go down the cave there was yet another skeleton! This time he had a lantern and a chest full of this green slime. I thought “Great! This is will get me around the cave without using 50 torches” It didn’t stop the fact that the caves are terrifying! At first it was just a marsh biome with GIANT TENTICLES! trying to kill you. As soon as am out of that biome I enter this new looking place I haven’t seen before…and I encounter something that made me ♥♥♥♥ myself! Now keep this in mind, the cave is pitch black and you can only see with a lit source. In this case the lantern I found. The lantern does not light the entire screen. You can only see like 3 feet around you. I encounter ROCK LOBSTERS! Which are (As I find out later) these terrifying yet harmless mob. My first reaction was to turn around and run the ♥♥♥♥ out of the cave but I noticed they didn’t follow me. So I approached one and it did not attack me. I learn that you can befriend them by giving them stone. I befriended 1 and continuted. Then I encounter the 2nd most terrifying thing…GIANT BUNNYS! These big furry bunnies are also Harmless and you can befriend them by giving them…Carrots…I also continued on without them. From then on it was just Cave Spiders and Bats. Having explored most of the cave I decide to finally leave it. I resurface only to be attacked by 5 hounds. I don’t attack them. Instead I lure them all the way to the Pig Village and got the pigs to help me out! The hounds died with the cost of 1 Pig man….So I took the meat he dropped and dried it and made Jerky!\n\nHaving not died in the cave and surviving the hounds I decide to just take these next few day’s slowly. Having planted a load of acorns outside my camp I cut down all the trees and made 3 pig houses just outside my camp. Just in case anything comes to attack me (Like a Giant perhaps). I decide to venture out to more unknown area and I encounter a strange bug, I encounter the Goose Moose in winter. It left me confused considering it is a spring giant. So what did I do? Recruited a bunch Pig men and killed it! And it was successful! I gathered the Meat it dropped and yet again headed home. But on my way over I got caught in the darkness and can to settle in the middle of nowhere. During the night I was attacked by like 6 bats. So during night I was just running around my fire like I was doing a rain dance.\n\nDay 32 through 54 The Quest for the Fire Staff and Leaving the World Behind Me.\n\nThe snow has stopped. The rain continued. And I have literary no worries of dying anymore. I have all the food I need and I have my fellow pig Neighbours for protection. At this point I thought I had nothing else to do. So I wanted to start messing with magic! Luckily I found a bunch of collapsed rabbit holes so I caught 4 of them, made a Top Hat and then made the Prestihatitator. The first thing I made with it was the Meat Effigy which pretty much acts as an 2nd chance if you die with the cost of 20% of your total health. But what I really wanted to make was a Fire Staff. But first you needed a Shadow Manipulator. Which are not easy to make due to the fact you need 3 Living logs and 7 Nightmare Fuel. Getting the Nightmare Fuel was easy but getting the Living Logs was a quest in its self. After many days of searching I finally found a Living Tree and got it. Now with my Shadow Manipulator made I needed 1 red gem. So I found graveyard and started digging graves until I got one. Literary the 2nd grave had a red gem. So I was happy. I made my Fire Staff and it was total worth losing lots of my sanity! I burned Bees, Spiders and an ENTIRE FOREST!. So that was fun! and pretty much from then I had a daily life and I left it on day 54. During all of this I happened to find all 4 of the “thing” items to enter a new world. Having explored the entire world and not wanting to stay any longer, I head over to the “Wooden Thing” location. Knowing it is guarded by the Clockwork mobs I of course, yet again, had a pig army!. We made our way over, killed the mobs and I said goodbye to the world and my fellow Pig friends. I have yet to start the new world.\n\nThe End.\n\nI love this game. 10/10","April 16, 2014","true","87.0"," 33 of 35 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","33","35","0","0"

And then, come nightfall, deal with monsters.\n\nThis game is equal parts stressful and fun. In directly proportional amounts.\n\nThe lack of achievements just goes to show the game's focus: You can play this game however you want, change the spawning rate of specific plants and critters, the length of seasons, all of which would undermine achievements and their place in the community. But could make the game more fun, if you want to enjoy it that way.\n\nKLEI seems intent on polishing a single aspect of a game in each release, SHANK the action, Mark of the Ninja the stealth, and now Don't Starve the procedurality. Their previous games were tightly focused and linearly designed, but here we have something almost infinitely replayable. And incredibly unforgiving.\n\nCrafting, managing resources, and carefully avoiding conflict mean that long term you might manage to erect a homestead with a farm and wander the world with a loyal pet. More likely you'll die trying instead.\n\nBut I like that.

I don't know if I can, so instead I wish to share a little version of my journey through video games, and use that to explain why I settled on this huge gem, and why It's the first game in my library (about 420 as of this writing) That I paid full retail for.\n\nI'm a gamer. no, seriously, that's what I am. I play games, I collect games, I live games.\n*For reference,\nFPS=First Person Shooter\nPvP = Player Vs Player\nPvE = Player Vs Environment\n\nI have always liked and preferred FPS single player shooters, and only much later did I start getting into skill based FPS (vs Perk based FPS - read: CoD is not in my games library. Shucks, Battlefield BC2 flet like a mistake to me after playing it, even for $4.89). I only started playing CS:Source to shut up some young know it all in my internet cafe. Next thing I'm playing tier matches on CS:GO with $800 of DLC in my account. Why? It's a tight, fast paced tactical game with the only advantage over the other guy being my skill, not my special gun.\n\nI actually can't remember why, but I got this urge to start playing some slower paced survival type games, I do know I was beginning to tire with the fastest fast paces of PvP, and often not knowing or caring about my teammates, as I'd be in a different match in 4 mins anyway. I tried with Nether which feels like PvE until some base camping 12yo snipes you from 3 blocks away. I got tired of getting 8h in and then permadeath to that. But all of a sudden, I like permadeath. You failed? start again. No, really. Start Again. Perks? Byebye. Guns? Gone. Here's a kitchen knife, go stab some guy with a full kit in the back. If it had true PvE, I might still be there. I wanted to give Nether a go, because other games like DayZ, etc already had a huge negative reputation. And I really don't like Zombie themed games except maybe Killing Floor, which is team based PvE, and they are clones, not zombies, but they are called Zeds... hmmm... Don't even know why I got KF in the first place, I think it was because it looked interesting and I actually wanted one of their other games, "The Ball" - a single player puzzle oriented FPS with no shooting but lots of squishy (Puzzle-Solving via Giant Rolling Artifact Of Death).\n\nSo at some point, I saw this title, and instantly dismissed it as a cheap flash-based game that was popular in a similar way to "Candy Crush". Heh, that's what you get for not looking into something properly before forming an opinion. Wish I had - was on sale for half price with a second copy of the game for free. (I don't think Klei will ever do that again for this game). This game was suggested in a Nether thread I had started about wanting a better PvE experience. I'd put in a  list of requests/prerequisites that would make it a game I would want to play, and someone suggested Don't Starve to me again. I thought 'no', but I saw in one of their threads that they adamantly refused to add multiplayer, because they wanted to create the best single player experience possible. This had my attention, as I saw it as now being a truly PvE experience, and by this time, I was craving it.\n\nI likely would have got into this game much, much sooner if it had ever gone on sale. It only had sales in the early days, whilst it was still gaining traction. Now, they are planning on making it more expensive when they release the next DLC (multiplayer patch). So it's pretty well now-or-never.\n\n___________\nDS is a brutally unforgiving game. You are dropped of in the middle of nowhere, in a foreign world, no idea about anything, except that night is coming. You will die. but you will learn, and live to day two. then day 4, then 7, then 22 (trust me you're gonna die on day 22 the first time). but you learn, you progress, a little bit, a little bit more. You try this mushroom, nope - not good. But cook it, and it is good. There are no quick save / reloads, no retries, no mistakes because you will be greeted with the realities of permadeath and a new world generated, Day 1. The reason that I love it, is that it's open ended - the goal is to get through until tomorrow, and that is always the goal, and it never, never ends. It's often a slower pace than FPS, and you pick days dedicated to exploring, resource gathering, or building better defenses. You gather. You plan. But when the stuff hits the fan, it's all on, and if you get through it, it feels like an accomplishment, and brings a huge feeling of quiet (is that it? are they all gone?) and satisfaction, because, well, it's all you, and the odds are stacked against you. That, right there, might just be the reason this game is so great.\n\nShould you buy it? Is this game for you? Probably. Should you wait for it so go on special? I wouldn't hold my breath. Check out some Let's Plays. Read some reviews. ask an IRL  [In Real Life] friend if you can have a jam (you'll want to put 20h aside to start to get a feel for the mechanics of this game. Anything less wouldn't be a fair assessment. That's how deep it is). But if you want something challenging, rewarding, and a game that is designed around long-term play, you have found it.","July 17, 2014","true","90.2"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","24","30","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scrapmusket/recommended/219740/","scrapmusket","ScrapMusket","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scrapmusket/","119 products in account","Don’t Starve is a survival/sandbox/roguelike game developed by Klei Entertainment.  You take on the role of Wilson, a scientist who wakes up in a strange, untamed land and must battle hunger, hostile creatures, and insanity to stay alive as he searches for a way to escape.  To that end, you gather resources from the mundane (twigs, logs, flint) to the bizarre (ghostly nightmare fuel, exotic animal hides, monster tentacles), explore, build a camp, invent new tools and buildings, and eventually find a door that takes you on a journey to the game’s antagonist, the enigmatic Maxwell.\n\nAgainst all of my expectations, Don’t Starve turned out to be one of my favorite games.  On a first pass, it seemed like a pretty repetitive ordeal: spend 30 minutes watching a nicely animated character pick grass, then mine stone and gold, then accidentally annoy one of the land’s many, many monsters, and start over again.  When I gave it another try, however, I fell in love.  The repetitive parts don’t actually take up that much of your time, and once you start building up a secure spot for yourself, defending it from hound attacks and lightning strikes, and striking out to see just what the heck is out in the beyond, it becomes immensely satisfying.  For those who don’t like slow starts, there are options to customize the world that the game generates (procedural, if that wasn’t obvious), and there are guides aplenty for those struggling with basic questions like “how do I not die when the sun sets.”\n\nThe gameplay is simple and rock solid.  You have three stats (hunger, health, and sanity), and for the most part you have to try to keep them all up.  You roam around, you gather resources, you build what you need to survive, and if you aren’t dead, you start branching out: you discover how to make new things, you explore, you learn how to tame the wilderness, and eventually, you find a mysterious doorway that shows you what the game is REALLY about.  It’s dark.  And if you die somewhere along the way, you unlock new characters that still give you a sense of progression and can present you with entirely new ways to approach the game.\n\nThe sandbox component of the game is definitely not Minecraft by any stretch, and it doesn’t try to be.  If you prefer direction in your gaming, there’s more here than you might expect.  The fighting is pretty simple: you equip a weapon and some armor, you click on whatever you want to kill, your character takes a swing at them, and then you kite backwards to dodge their attack.  Rinse and repeat.  This can feel a little clunky when you’re surrounded by assorted objects, but I got used to it after a while.  Despite its simplicity, the combat can get pretty tense, especially when certain gigantic winter beasts decide to appear inside your warm, cozy campsite.\n\nProsSimple but surprisingly engaging (and dark) narrative, once you discover it\nTaming the wilderness is very satisfying\nWide range of distinctive characters and heavy customization and modding options to tailor the experience\n\nConsNo trading cards\nSome tasks get repetitive\nBad luck can make minor mistakes into restarts\nFinal Thoughts\n\nGet it if you like building stuff, taming hostile environments, and staying out of the dark.\n\nRating (Out of 10): 9\n\nThis review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.","May 14","true","76.0"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

This game has received positive ratings from critics and users alike. Its mostly compared to other games like Minecraft and Terraria where the goal is survival. The main difference is that in those games mentioned above you are digging deeper and deeper and its usually about getting resources from the depths of the world. This game on the other hand is about utilizing resources on the surface for survival. Which brings about many difficulties as a result since you cannot hide in a cave for the winter.\n\nDifficulty:\nThe permanent death component of this game really adds tension to surviving and trying your best to live the cruelty of the world. The difficulty really feels tailored made once you actually get into all the settings for making your own world. You basically have options over all enemies and resources to customize the world you desire in a fashion that you would want to explore it in. By having the player able to change the difficulty dependent on variables to such a degree they have made this game fun to replay over and over.\n\nWorld\nThe world can be medium to grand depending on what options the player chooses. However despite the size you end up with you will always feel like there is plenty to explore which is a important component of this game. The idea of exploring for resources, gathering them and utilizing resources to survive is important.\n\nCrafting\nThe crafting system was well done and has plenty of diversity of what you can create to enhance your odds of survival. Its interesting that you need the labs to first construct the objects but are able to construct them anywhere after your first time.\n\nGraphics\nThe art direction is actually really good, the eeriness of the graphics combined with its other components really makes it stand out from other games, if you were to show me a ton of games i would never confuse it for don't starve.","November 27, 2013","true","9.9"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","20","25","0","0"

You are required to fend for yourself in this unforgiving land of permadeath and bees, and if you are the more casual sort of player i'd highly recommend giving the wiki a look as it may explain some things.\nYou must fend for yourself, build a camp, set up crops and as the title implies...don't starve.\n\nBut starving is the least of your worries. Everything in this game exists to murder you in ways you never thought possible. On top of that, you must worry about your sanity, temperature and health as well. Too many spider bites and you'll die. Been out in the night for too long? You'll go insane and even the shadows will be out to kill you.\n\nOh look, it's become winter! Good luck, because you'll need to wear some nice warm clothes or you'll freeze to death!\n\nThe game does have some less than lethal additions to it as well. You can come across villages of friendly pig men who you can befriend and trade with, which is wonderful since they are can sometimes be farmers, giving you free resources, food and even defence as the pig men are rather hostile towards monsters.\n\nThis game really is bursting at the seams with content here and the maps are even randomly generated to ensure that no playthrough is like another. Even if you manage to "beat" survival mode by finding all of the tele-portato parts an exploring the cave systems for super duper loot, you can always play campaign for increasingly hard scenarios that are really fun as well.\n\nAvoid bees.\nAvoid all the bees.","January 16","true","138.5"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","100","12","12","7","1"

I bought it just as it went out of beta, drawn mostly by the TimBurtonesque graphics.\n\nI feel I gave Don't Starve a fair chance, investing 13 hours into it, although the prospect of abandoning it felt tantalizing after just 5. I have to be honest: 13 hours is far from enough to experience the most sophisticated tiers of crafting. It’s unfortunately more than enough to resent the experience and I’ll soon get to the reasons for that.\n\nBut first, the positive. The initial impressions are excellent. The graphics are intriguing and can best be described as what a children’s pop-up book could look like if it was designed by Tim Burton. Almost all of the game's elements (animals, plants, …) are delightful and original. The only flaw in the graphics concerns some of the ground’s textures, which are slightly pixelated, at least on Full HD resolution. Music is rather sparse, but the sound effects are realistically bucolic and I loved the idea that when your character “talks” (in reaction to one of your commands), he/she does so with the sound of an orchestral instrument (luckily, with English subtitles)\n\nThe first couple of hours with the game are great. You feel very free exploring your environment, and yet captive of the timing: night comes all too soon! At the very minimum, on your first day, you need to collect a couple of food items (even as weak as berries and carrots) and get enough material to make a fire, which itself requires an axe (that you also must craft on the first day). The next day, you must to learn to balance three vital gauges: heath, satiety and sanity. Should any of them reach 0, you’re history. Speaking of which, let me introduce you to your new nemesis…\n\n\nPERMADEATH! If you've played roguelikes in the past, you two have already met. If not, let me explain. Permadeath means that when you die, there is no pressing a load button and re-starting from a safe point from the past. The game allows you to save your progress, but only when you quit, so that you don’t have to play a full game in one session. But should you cross path with the Grim Reaper, Don't Starve will mercilessly and meticulously destroy any save file that might inhabit your hard drive, forcing you to go back to the very beginning each and every time you die. In many games, this is not problematic. Many roguelikes are fun to start again over and over, because their random world generation often comes up with a unique situation and/or because you can try a completely different strategy, maybe by creating a character of a different class.\n\nThe problem with Permadeath in Don't Starve is that there aren't many different strategies in the beginning. Sure, after some in-game days, you can specialise your crafting in one way or another, but the first real-time hour will always be kind of similar. Which means it’s not fun any more after a point, and you’ll start to really dread the endgame, for the wrong reasons. The point of a crafting/surviving game like this, especially one where you have to figure out most everything by yourself, is to experiment, to try crazy things and hope for a reward. But here, with no way of knowing in advance if a new enemy is fair game or completely badass, experimenting often means dying, and being punished by re-playing the same boring first days.\n\nYou’d be forgiven to think that Don't Starve's unlockable characters alleviate the above-mentioned problem. But you’d be wrong: they mostly add a bit of flavour to the game, but don’t offer any real potential for strategic diversification.\n\nAs if repetitiveness wasn't enough, the world generation algorithm hates you. The algorithm basically creates a huge map made of different “biomes” (forests, plains, swamps…). A biome has a specific population of animals, plants and other resources. Some of those resources are really basic building blocks for crafting, yet the algorithm sometimes takes great pride in placing the biomes that host them very far from you. You therefore often have no other solution than to spend several in-game days running around without crafting anything useful, just because there is no gold or even plain rocks, anywhere near your starting position. Judging from my experience, it's not a rare occurrence. There are some interesting special features disseminated across the map, but they’re spread fairly thin. In the end, it's hard to understand why such a huge map was needed in the first place.\n\nThe last major complain I have is perhaps partly inherent to the genre and therefore not entirely the game’s fault: an almost complete lack of information. I already explained how not knowing anything about an enemy could mean death by experimentation. But it’s the same for almost each of the game’s features. The crafting recipes are mostly public, but the uses and strengths of the crafted objects are not. So, I've crafted a helm or an armour: Just what difference does it make? Beats me. So, I see my sanity declining dangerously. Why? What can I do to improve the situation? The game never tells, leaving the player to try things and not always finding a satisfactory answer. There is a fan-made wiki that you can consult if you’re curious about this or that aspect. But it's still very difficult to find just the information you need without having other secrets spoiled for you at the same time. I really wish the game would give you clues, even infrequent and vague ones. At the very least, I expected the game to explain the controls, how to move my character or rotate the view. Turned out, I needed to visit the official forum for that too!\n\nOverall, I was extremely disappointed with Don't Starve. I find it hard to recommend to anyone, save maybe the most patients among you who don’t find repetitive grinding objectionable. It’s a shame really, because for the purpose of this review, I read a significant part of the Wiki, and there are some really neat ideas. But more of them should have been used to diversify the starting strategy and they also need to be spread less thin across the map.","November 30, 2013","false","15.4"," 844 of 1,529 people (55%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","55","844","1","7","69"

This is a recurring theme, too, as the Game is permanently Permadeath, and is incredibly unforgiving. Admittedly, I did only get this game for the pre-order Hats for tf2, but I must say I haven't been disappointed. Don't Starve is small and easy to run on even the oldest computers, and a good way to pass the time if you are unfortunate to not have access to multiplayer games (Like me ;-;). The design scheme is sinister and eerie, but never actually scary. The game is all about surviving, and is more about managing resources than anything. Multiplayer was always a heated de8ate, 8ut finally the developers have decided to add it to the game, finally. So, with more DLCs and Multiplayer to look forward to, the game is only getting 8etter","May 21, 2014","true","110.5"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

It starts off innocent enough, promising a nice "build-to-survive" experience, until you glance at the clock and realise you've lost most your day.\n\nIt takes a fair bit to get into the swing of things, having to learn how to play from scratch as there is absolutely no hand-holding in this game. But it still somehow remains simple enough to grasp quickly, and yet complicated enough that you continue to discover new things with each play.\n\nFirst time I managed to work out how to not die immediately, I lasted 16 days, until death by giant bees. The rage I felt to then have to start again, from scratch, in a new completely randomly generated world left me unable to keep playing. And yet, same time the following day I had returned, if not out of desire to play, as much as a desire to flip the birds at this game, so that it knows it has not beaten me yet.\n\nHighly addictive, very engrossing, and overall just a really awesome concept. I definately would recommend this game.","February 20, 2014","true","16.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

I appear in a strange new world only to be suddenly confonted by a sleek man wearing a rather dapper suit and top hat! I was confused and scared, yet somehow comforted by the man, probably due to the strong sence of security he held. I could roughly make out the words: "Say pal, you don't look so good." "You'd better find something to eat before night comes!" his figure then swiftly decended into the ground in a puff of smoke. I trembled, I had somehow braised my knee, as I rose to my feet, my head dizzy and aching. i didn't have a clue how I got here, I only knew that I had to find some food and some supplies to make it through the night. Frantically, I began to run across the luscious meadow in search of some food that I could ravage.\n\nAfter what seemed hours, I finally spotted a bush that contained some sort of red, exotic berry that I could pick. As I approched the bush It became clear to me that the berries could be poisonous, despite their decieving looks. However as I looked up to the sky and took a glimpse of the savage birds circling me, I saw that the only viable option, and inevitable, was to rob the bush of its resources. I reached for the crimson berries, my mouth watering, when out of the blue a majestic turkey looking creature sprung from the bush, stole the berries and made its escape with great speed. I set off to chase the gobbler, that is what I had come to call it due to its adept ability to steal berries, however realising it was beyond my reach, I took off in another direction looking for another cache of food.\n\nHours later the sun began to set and the birds flew away to some distant land as if they were afraid of something. I had aquired a vast quantity of sticks, flintstones and grass tufts on my travels, but still no food. I had lost all hope on finding any source of sustenance and my chances of survival, yet the image of the dark, sleek man was the coal in the furnace of my shrivelled body. Suddenly a rare sight in this harsh world: a dead rabbit; mine for the taking. I lifted its limp corpse as saliva built up in my mouth. It was time. Without realising, a dark blanket covered the sky in a matter of seconds, envoloping my body in total darkness. But I didn't care. I became a feral beast and ripped into the lifeless rabbit with my teath, tearing its flesh from its body. However I felt a tickle on my leg, something had brushed passed me. I took no notice and continued with my soul rejuvenating meal. Before I realised my legs were ripped out of their sockets, cold blood splattering across my face. I screamed for help, but only recieved the soft, lonely chirping of the crows. I lay there for a few seconds reviewing the few hours I had lived, cuddling what was left of my rabbit, before my head was pulled from my neck in a slight struggle. In my last few seconds all I heard were the wicked screeches of the wind and the laughing of the dark, sleek man.\n\nBrilliant game with a fantastic community, I love this game and is one of my all time games. I can't wait for the multiplayer and some more awesome things that klei will produce. 10/10","July 24, 2014","true","284.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","2"

Pretty much back when it was in beta, back before caves, back before rabbits had an ai. Watching it progress has been interesting.\nSo this game is a survival... sorta horror game? It is hard to say it has things happen that are kinda creepy. The point of this game is to try to stay alive for as long as you can. It is easier said than done. Throughout the game you will have problems trying to stay alive. Hazards include hunger, wetness, heat, freezeing, monsters, giants, the dark, sanity, seasons, thunder, and fire. So basicly you start the game if you can survive long enough you will be able to get a little camp going and have enough food to live off of. But things in this game never go your way. Random mobs sometimes attack at the worst times, and bosses can randomly come and destroy your "house" and set your crops a blaze. This is basicly one of those games where you can be having fun and then your fun will be ruined and you will go sour on the game.

That's cool and all, but, this game does more than that. In this game, you not only eat, but you explore a randomly generated world, ranging from the aboveground and underground, plus many biomes to explore and traverse, like the Forest, Savannah, Swamp, etc.\n\nThere's also a wide range of different characters to unlock. Some unlock by gaining EXP (Which you earn when you die or other reasons), or when you do a in-game action, which unlocks them!\n\nPlus, this game is updated regularly, with all new kinds of new content to explore and discover! There could be simple bug fixes or changes to items, or even something big like a new biome! This brings the player back so they can explore the new content and see what it does and how it's affects them!\n\nThis game reminds me of an arcade game -- you see how many points you get (or, how many days you can survive), until you eventually die. When you do eventually die, you may ask "How the heck did I die!?" But that's the fun in it! As you progress, you face greater and more challenging things to face and survive from! And, by dying, you learn more about the game, so you'll want to do it again and last longer and longer!\n\nSo, that's my two-sense on this game. It's overall a fun little experience those Cod and Minecraft fans should experience, so they can see that there's more to life than gunfire and a bad game!\n\n","March 14, 2014","true","118.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Now that my steam works I can make an honest review :)\n\nPros:\n-Don't Starve has a large world so you can explore a lot (sandbox world) it's great . If the map is too large for you , you can always change the setting to a smaller map.\n-The crafting is just brilliant and don't always follow logic .\n-There is an unlimited amount of things you can do (I'm not kidding ! ) .\n-There is different season .\n-Don't Starve world has a dark twist ... ;)\n-You can unlock all 9 characters and they all have a different quality than the other . If you want more character , you can always get some from the steam workshop (People have a lot of imagination) .\n\nPros/Con:\n-When you die , it's REALLY frustrating but then you want to make another character and try to get much further than the time before .\n\nCon + Guide's link :\n-The only problem that you'll encounter the most for a begginer is : They almost never gives you hint on what to do . It's not that much of a Con if you like doing everything by yourself but it can become very frustrating . So I'm going to give you the link of one of my friend's guide . It's really helpful and he's a pro at Don't Starve :)\n\nLink: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=172423035#134735\n\nI hope you have fun in don't starve :D","January 26, 2014","true","12.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

In this game you will die a lot and realize how much this game hates you. However, for every death you will gain knowledge of the game and experience to unlock other characters whom all are different and unique. You start off by collecting many items such as wildgrass and twigs so that you can survive for the first couple of nights but, the game get progressively harder with each passing night which makes this game so challenging. Once you die in this game, the game deletes your save file and you have to start all over from scratch but, the games world generator always keeps the game fresh and new for you. The community workshop also has many mods to help assist you in learning the game as well as adding new characters that already exist from other games,shows or even just made up.\n\nFor some, Permadeath in this game is what ruins it. For others it gives the game a more realistic feel to the game. There are various guides and tutorials on Don't Starve but, I highly recommend not looking at it because the beauty of Don't Starve is finding out yourself the ups and downs. There are also various ways to give you an "extra" life such as touching the pig alter or the life giving amulet.\n\nHere are some of my experiences of the game:\n-1st time playing-\nDay 0: I spawn and start collecting items. I see a pig alter unsure of what it does and avoid it. I see an odd white sphere out of the ground and proceed to head towards it. I am ambushed by spiders and die.\n\nDay X (Can't Remember what day): I see the odd white sphere which I know now is a spider nest. I approach the nest and kill the first spider that greets me. The other 2 come out of the nest, eat the meat of their fallen brethren and proceed to chase me.\n\nDay 35: The Deerclops is chasing me and has killed all the beefalo with 2 hits. I proceed to shoot a fire dart at him which kills him, and starts burning all the drops from the beefalo. I run to the drops panicing and die to the fire from all the drops. I respawn from one of the pig alters that I had previously touched and immediately get ambushed by 6 hounds.\n\nDay 48: While I am collecting berries from the row of berry bushes I had gathered, it starts to rain. After a couple of minutes a lightning bolt hits one of the nearby trees burning all the bushes. Today is sad day.\n\n11/10 would attempt to survive again","June 30, 2014","true","71.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RileyTheTransDolphin/recommended/219740/","RileyTheTransDolphin","Strugglepuff","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RileyTheTransDolphin/","58 products in account","Don't Starve is an absolutely awesome survival game with a mesmorizing soundtrack and genuine dark, mysterious -- and sometimes satirical aura surrounding it.\n\nYou start off with no weapons, no protection from the elements (aside from the preset clothing the character of your choice is given, which I will get more into later), and most of all, little knowledge as to where in the heck you are -- or how you got there (unless you watched some of the trailers.)\n\nYou are spoken down to by this mysterious and dapper being sporting a traditional suit 'n tie, very reminiscent of the "G-Man" from the Half-Life series, he addresses you with a few words, and then poofs into nonexistance -- though you'll meet up with him in the near future.\n\nDon't Starve may SEEM like an absolutely pointless survival game with an infinite number of days, and that the clock won't stop ticking until you die (permadeath is a real thing, and you can't come back unless you've crafted yourself an effigy!) but fret not, there's more to this game than meets the eye!\n\nAfter what might be hours and hours of grinding, you'll find yourself coming across a variety of different scenarios - what looks like towns inhabited by xenophobic pig-men, stone ruins patrolled by mechanical 'robots', and much more. You'll find mysterious objects like "Box Thing", "Ring Thing", and they might just be miscellaneous objects you can just throw around and never pay any further mind to.. or they might be the key to 'beating' the game.\n\nMy experience with the game has been absolutely splendid, I've encountered moments when I've been absolutely mobbed by armed pig-men, nearly scared to death by what looks like extraordinarily large turkies which pop out of bushes, and nerve-racking moments when my characters sanity begins to deterioate, causing haunting figures to appear..\n\nBut lets break it down, shall we?\n\nPROS -\n\nA Survival Game: But a more well-designed and optimized one, constantly managed and won't be forsaken like what happens to most survivals.. (looking at you, DayZ)\n\nA Neat-o Crafting System: Items can be either very simplistic or slightly trivial to create, starting off is quite easy - mere flint and twigs and you have yourself either a Pickaxe, Shovel, or Chopping Axe, and can now chop down all them trees! ("Take that, Nature!" -- Wilson)\n\nInsanely Vague Story: This can go both ways; some people enjoy a story that's fleshed out, has alot of dialogue, and is clearly presented to you, but not this game - the game itself doesn't provide the player much information to work off of, conclusions will have to be made on your own end, and there are plenty of wiki's that'll help you further understand the game.\n\nWild Encounters: There are alot of things to see in this game, from the occasional mysterious item surrounded by 'Evil Flowers' that'll drain your character's sanity to wormholes that'll consume you whole and transport you to a different part of the map. (Wormhole transport systems are great, yo.) Not to mention the shifting of seasons, an abundance of sinkholes leading to caves, and with the addition of DLCs, you could be taking down colossal giants or sailing the seas. You could also purchase "Don't Starve Together" (free if you've already bought the base game prior to the DLC's release) and try and survive with friends, or random people on the interwebs!\n\nA Variety Of Characters: Wilson is the preset character, and has no other special abilities other than the ability to grow the most manliest of beards (I mean, what more do you need than that, right?) but there are also little old ladies, muscular men afraid of the dark, and even a little pyromaniac girl and her dead sister at your disposal. All with their own unique abilities.\n\nCONS -\n\nTedious Gameplay: There are people who have yet to beat the game despite having weeks logged into it, YouTubers still at the first stage whilst on Day 300, so on and so forth. So if you can't handle devotion or have commitment issues.. might wanna steer away from this game a bit.\n\nRage Factor: The rage factor in this game depends on your progress, really. I wouldn't give two ♥♥♥♥♥ if I was brutally slaughtered by a spider on my first day.. but if you're the kind of person that has over 50 days, collected the items that'll help you progress through the game's "story" and are mistakenly killed by one of those ♥♥♥♥-headed frogs, well.. I'll set up a prayer circle to mend your broken heart and sanity.\n\nGame Length: This goes along with 'Tedious Gameplay', but just take a gander at the people who've actually 'beaten' the game and the hours THEY have. Or just go on YouTube and see for yourself.\n\nTL;DR - An absolutely phenomenial game, the music makes it all better. Don't buy it if you can't handle the whole survival concept, permadeath, and sheer overall length of the game.\n\nGraphics/Art: 4.5 out of 5\nGameplay: 5 out of 5\nStory/Lore: 2.5 out of 5 (if not researched) 4 out of 5 (if researched)\nOverall Grade: 4 out of 5","January 30","true","25.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","7","7","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/simeonwhite/recommended/219740/","simeonwhite","Simeon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/simeonwhite/","78 products in account","Long Story ShortDon’t Starve is an extremely difficult masterpiece that will take you 50+ hours in order to learn how to survive in this unforgiving universe. The art style is unique and the sounds/music is beautiful and creepy.  The game play is outstanding and it will, whether you want it to or not, draw you in for hours of game time without giving you a chance to take a break. You’ll probably starve in real life before you can but your controller down. It’s without a doubt a 10/10 and is one of the few games I think couldn’t even be improved upon.\n\nLong Story Long- The Game PlayDon’t Starve is a survival game and therefore your only natural objective is to survive. This is accomplished by keeping your sanity, hunger, heath, warmth, and sogginess in check. In order to do so, you’ll gather resources, make your camp, plant crops, craft recipes, etc. in order to create a working outpost. The game will constantly become more difficult as Maxwell, the villain, sends his hounds to attack you, you run out of any resource, and then there is the ever looming threat of winter.\n\nVariations to the game playThis game is almost 100% customizable whether you want more or less tall birds, no winter, or if you want to commit suicide by making it permanently night time.  There are also several unlockable characters that all have different stats, starting items, and uses. Lastly, you can, if you’re lucky enough to find a rare portal, switch to adventure mode where you are plopped in a premade world, opposed to the randomly generated worlds in survival mode, where you attempt to live past the more difficult worlds you’re put into in order to make it to the next and, eventually, toss Maxwell off his throne of lies!\n\nMusic and SoundThe creators of Don’t Starve cut no corners when it comes to the music and sound effects. The music is beautiful, exiting, and darn right creepy depending on the circumstances. In fact, me and my roommate once did a scientific experiment in order to see if playing frightening music, in this case music from Don’t Starve, at night while we were asleep would affect our dreams or not. We both had nightmares. The sound is also perfect for whatever action is happening. I often want to eat my food reserve just so I can hear Wilson munching away at the meat or kill a spider so I can hear it shriek.\n\nArtThe art style for Don’t Starve is completely original and shows character for objects through its harsh strokes or gentile lines. Combined with the music and sound, the art gives the player a perfect atmosphere that, in my opinion, has never been matched by another survival game.\n\nDLC and Don’t Starve TogetherThe DLC for Don’t Starve, Reign of Giants, adds craftibles, items, enemies, and even two whole freaking seasons! If you ask me, this DLC adds difficulty and challenge to this already challenging game and, unless you’ve played lots of survival games, I wouldn’t suggest using it till you’ve at least made it till winter in the normal version. As far as Don’t Starve Together goes, it adds a little content as well as making the game significantly easier. I’d suggest you’d get it if you’ve already bought and liked the original but find yourself wanting to shake things up by tossing in some other players.\n\nConclusionGame play- 10/10. Music and sound- 10/10. Customizability - 10/10. Art style- 10/10. DLC- 10/10. This is the best survival game I’ve ever played or ever seen played.  It’s addicting, entertaining, and challenging. Without a doubt it’s on my top ten favorite game list. It’s also one of four games I think is as flawless as humanly possible.  Oh course, like all games, there is those who won’t enjoy it. So if you’re a female of the age 30+ or just someone who doesn’t normally enjoy intense, extremely difficult games, the most likely won’t find Don’t Starve appealing. However, to anyone that doesn’t fall in those categories I’ll say this: Don’t Starve is a chef-d'oeuvre, a masterpiece beyond words, perfected in every way, and I can’t suggest it enough. Final rating- 100/100 one of the few perfect games on this earth.","March 17","true","202.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kawaiiassnigga/recommended/219740/","kawaiiassnigga","tom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kawaiiassnigga/","79 products in account","A very challenging and fun game, Don't Starve brings us the creativity of Minecraft and the adventure of Terraria and mash them together with some lovely art. You play *mainly* as Wilson, a scientist who was whisked away into this hellish world of violent trees, annoying hellhounds, and a deadly night. Although this game is quite challenging, and yes, frustrating, it is a lot of fun to play and experience for yourself. There are gameplay mechanics such as sanity, hunger, and weather. As you see more disturbing things, your sanity drops, making shadows and other hallucinations appear at night, and eventually, at day. Hunger is, obviously, a big problem. As you go throughout your day with food in your inventory, it will decompose and spoil. To combat this, you either eat it or store it in an ice box. Even so, your food still isn't completely safe in the ice box. Finally, there is rain, lightning, snow, and more snow. As the winter months draw near, you will be forced to stay near your fire unless you have the proper attire. Each and every enemy in this game is basically out for your head as well. The hellhounds will come every once in a while to remind you to stay on guard. Swamps come alive with deadly spiked tentacles that lash out if you get too close. Pigmen will defend their brethren to the death if need be. All of this comes with a grim reminder that to survive, you must always be alert, unless you want a beefalo horn shoved up your bum. 9/10 overall score","February 4, 2014","true","5.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The game was initially released via Valve's Steam software for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux on April 23, 2013. A PlayStation 4 port became available the following year and further versions for iOS and mobile phones are under consideration. Downloadable content titled Reign of Giants was released on April 30, 2014, and a multiplayer expansion called Don't Starve Together became free for existing users on June 3, 2015.[1]\n\nThe game follows a scientist named Wilson who finds himself in a dark, dreary world and must survive as long as possible. Toward this end, the player must keep Wilson healthy, fed, and mentally stable as he avoids a variety of surreal and supernatural enemies that will try to kill and devour him. The game's "Adventure" mode adds depth to the sparse plot and pits Wilson against the game's antagonist, Maxwell.\n\nTime by time, you unlock more valuable and specific-abilities characters.'\n\nRate: 11/10","June 17, 2015","true","1.6"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","18","28","2","0"

It failed when it came to replay value, or how much you can play a game after you have finished it once. i felt that it started getting repetetive, doing the same things over and over for the same objective.

Playing Don't Starve without the DLC Reign of Giants does not get old because there are so many map generated worlds to discover and characters to play that you can pit your skills in the game against the elements.  I like the fact that players can choose specific characters that all bring something unique into the game experience. For example, Mrs. Wickerbottom doesn't sleep and anything that is spoiling in her inventory affects and decreases her sanity so you have to think carefully about your food sources including the flowers in your garland! Players who want to add more of a challenge to the game edit their worlds. If you are a hardcore "Don't Starver" you can choose to play a preset world with harsher conditions, maybe add more spiders or Deerclops. It was definitely not fun to have one knock down my walls like dominoes. You can even select a world to play  that only has night as a setting. I just purchased the DLC Reign of Giants and I have already died twice due to the summer heat and me having no idea that the game would roast me in the summer sun, or the birds.

I didn't think much of it in the game menu, but immediately when I spawned in my first world, a man appeared and said I have to prepare food and shelter before dark, I am on my own, and he drops me off in the middle of nowhere. Right when I saw him, I cracked a jolly smile. The man was tall, in a suit, holding a briefcase, and with dark brown hair. Sound familiar? Yes. Very. What? Dafuq? Not familiar? Well, let me give you a hint. GMAAANNNNN. Yea, NOW, does it sound familiar? required resources are randomly scattered along the terrian, and different biomes containing many useful resources. The great thing about these resources, is just so cool. Picked up something useless? Not possible. Everything has it's own purpose. I just love that.

And it was. I played during the first days of release, and didn't give it enough time to get interesting. After sinking a ton of hours into this and still finding new things to want to check out, mess around with, explore and unlock, it's safe to say Don't Starve is a well made and interesting game.\n\nIt's stacked with charm and intrigue. It still has a dead end in terms of discovery, tech and gameplay, like any survival or city sim game, but it's going to take you a lot longer to get there in Don't Starve than most other games. It's also fuelled by lots of strange little gameplay mechanics and items that you find along the way.\n\nI haven't even touched the DLC yet, and I'm not the greatest fan of survival games, but Don't Starve has definitely given me my moneys worth after investing a little time and effort.\n\nPretty boring survival game. Don't Starve starts off with the same feeling you get playing Minecraft for the first time: You want to collect food and items to survive the first night and it's pretty exciting and fun.\n\nUnfortunately this is about it, and after the first few days of experimenting and finding out what everything does all you're left with is exploring and fighting. Fighting never really seems very exciting and has no real purpose other than maybe collecting items, and exploring seems like a waste of time since it doesn't help you survive any longer (which ultimately is the goal of the game). As a result this game gets boring very quickly and there doesn't appear to be much to do.\n\nPretty boring survival game.","July 6, 2013","true","244.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Another Minecraft themed game, not first person, not 3D but that's what makes this game unique, Almost as good as Minecraft if not better. In this game, you are given a character (you unlock characters later) and you need to survive for as long as you can, picking up resources that will aid in getting you a weapon or Light Sources and helping you in battle. There are lots of food for you to pick up which in my opinion was limited in Minecraft. This game also gives you access to Mods so you can download Mods from the steam workshop which i find helpful especially the mods that have a neverending light source. I am loving this game. This game lets you save your progress, Food is much easier to find than in Minecraft. Some of the features are better than Minecraft already. This is a 2D Minecraft! Simple as that. I definitely recommend you buy this game because it has come to the point where every Steam user MUST have a copy of this game.\n\n10/10 Fricking Awesome","December 9, 2013","true","8.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

But then when you play again, it gets slightly better, cuz you'll be smart enough to build a fire. Then, you might start complaining about how there's a lack of stuff to build, and you won't make it far with basic tools. Then on your third gameplay, you come across a gold nugget. Lucky you, it's time to build a science machine. Then you start testing and making all sorts of funky stuff, thinking you're invincible until you cut way too many trees. Heh, no ruining surprises here, but just remember to keep a few acorns handy for planting. Nonetheless, you probably die out of inexperience.

If you love survival, you are not doing yourself any favors by avoiding this game. It throws you to the wolves and does not hold your hand.\n\nYes, the graphics are cartoony, but dont be fooled. This game will test your skills and you will die and die and die again. Grab the DLC's and you have a beast of a challenge to survive. Especially the new Shipwrecked DLC.\n\nI have owned this game for years and still keep coming back.\n\nThe mechanics are deceptively simple, pick up as much stuff as you can and start trying to figure out how to survive. Not starving is only one priority. You will want to set up a camp and start doing science to unlock the best stuff. You will also have weather and heat and cold to contend with on top of the fact that nearly everything will try and kill you in one way or another.\n\nCaves add another layer of challange to the game with multiple levels of darkness and monsters to explore. You cook, build, explore, fight, and science the ♥♥♥♥ out of things to try and survive.\n\nUse Wiki or Youtube to help get started.\n\nOverall this game is one of my favorite all time games.

You start with some basic knowledge of craftable items, but you need to build scientific buildings (and stand next to them) to unlock more advanced options.\n\nThe grotesque atmosphere is one of the winning points of this game: everything is weird and questionable, from totem-adoring pigs to crawling shadows. The overall feeling of Don't Starve is similar to when you read a fantasy book, curled up in your bed sheet as a thunder storm is raging from afar.\n\nIf you love survival games, dark settings and challenging stories, get this game!","November 16, 2015","true","9.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I'm 21 now and I can tell you that this is one of the best games I have played in my entire life.\n\nWith that said, I want to tell you why this game is so good.\n\n1st and most important of all is; this is a survival game. Meaning hard difficulty and permanent death. Even though, you can customize the world to your liking and survive with your conditions. The default version being the intended difficulty.\n\n2nd is the gameplay. You can move with clicking your mouse, just like in any Diablo-esque games. You can move with ASDW (which I prefer and recommend). It's simple to play and is very responsive. The game is simple in graphics and has really good animations (meaning anyone can play it!). The music and sounds are awesome but they might become repetitive at some point (at which you just turn them off :D). This may be one downside that bothered me a bit, but it is not a big problem at all.\n\n3rd is the game itself, you are placed inside a world where you are only told that you should look for something to eat. Don't starve is not nearly the only danger you should look out for. You have to stay warm in the Winter, stay cool in the Summer, protect your things, avoid monsters, kill monsters, survive giants, maintain sanity. But more importantly, you build structures, walls, farms, protective structures, traps, weapons, tools. Furthermore, you explore secrets, caves, biomes, animals, monsters, items! There are so many options in this game to explore. I have 40-ish hours on this game (for now) and I have only explored barely half of all the things that can be done. I haven't even customized the starting world yet! I've been playing default untill I got the hang of it. But the number of settings and customizations you can make to your world are nearly endless! You can also unlock other characters which all have different perks and abillities.\n\n4th and last are the community mods that can expand and improve your game greatly (I'm using 8 mods at the moment). Not to mention the upcoming multiplayer that will allow you and your friends to experience this survival game in a world that has your rules and settings.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone that likes: survival / fighting / building and crafting stuff.\n\nBest regards, Devon.","July 26, 2014","true","94.6"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","4"

What? You might ask. I will try to explain:\nThe UI/ menus are perfectly uncomplex. They are neat, responsive and incredibly easy to navigate as everything is very well organized.\nThe inventory spaces are placed neatly at the bottom of the screen and are always available to you. you have the option of organizing your materials into a few groups with slight spaces between lots of inventory slots. The clicking + dragging mechanism makes this process so much easier. I often organize all my edibles into one group, main building materials into another and tools/ armours/ weapons into another.\nThe crafting system is also very easy to grasp. You can click whatever it is you want to build in the menu to the left and see what kind of resources you need to craft that item, with pictures of the actual items which makes the whole identifying process a breeze.\nThe map is excellent. You can see (as far as you have travelled) key locations such as berry bushes, forests, different biomes e.t.c... You can also see where you've built stuff, if you have. This is very important if you don't want to get lost!\nThe actual physical game map that you travel on is amazing. Resources are easy to find, click and collect. Your main tools (hatchet, pick-axe and shovel) require the most basic resources so you will easily be able to replace them without much hassle. This is also probably the only game where people won't question your pathological excitement over poop.Trust me, you will have so much fun just collecting hordes of resources and then putting them to use and generally just trying to survive another day. The game does get difficult, especially if you have the expansion enabled, which offers a whole new and exciting experience, but even if you fail, you'll want to immediately start again and perhaps learn from your previous mistakes and do things differently. I simply cannot find one negative aspect in this game, it is, as I said before, perfection.\n","August 2, 2015","true","31.8"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","9","13","2","0"

You better find something to eat before night comes!" Those are words to live by. I haven’t actually finished the story myself, I’m still working on that, (I prefer to just explore and try to live as long as I can). I would recommend the trailer[s] to anyone who would like to know more about the story.\nSome things just aren’t able to be put into words, and the trailer with the conversation between Wilson and Maxwell is just summed up best by watching the trailer.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=396885705\n\nGame Play: The controls are quite straight forward, you can control how your character moves with ASDW, or by clicking on the ground/objects, or click and holding down the mouse button. Your inventory is very limited, but I can’t complain about that, it simply requires you to make backpacks/chests/etc.\nThere are three “resources” to juggle in don’t starve: Sanity, Hunger, Health. As the game itself implies, don’t let yourself be hungry for too long, once your hunger drops to zero, your health drains very fast until you die. Once your health is gone, you’re dead. Sanity is an interesting resource, but I’ll let you find out why for yourself if you get the game.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=398924705\n\nPrice: Don’t starve costs $14.99 (as of July 25, 2014) and the DLC “Reign of Giants “is $4.99. Apparently this summer there’s supposed to be an expansion to allow the game to become multiplayer, I’m looking forward to playing with friends on this great survival game.\nThankfully for those who already own the game and the DLC, you don’t need to worry about buying anything else, but for those that don’t own the game; the price will be increased to $19.99. I’ve put 52 hours into the game so far, I have no doubt I will go back to playing more of this game, so regardless of when you get the game I feel the price is very fair.\n\nConclusion: I used to say that if I had to own only one game, It would come down to a three way tie between "Minecraft", "Terraria", and "Don't Starve". All three are excellent games, and all three have different play styles, Don't Starve is probably the most unique.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=395630283\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update January 13, 2015:\nHere's the URL to see my review for Don't Starve Together\n\nEdit/Update September 18, 2015:\nAdded screenshots to the review.\nHere's the URL to see my review for  Don't Starve Reign of Giants DLC\nEdit/Update February 29, 2016:\nAdded YouTube Video Review Link!","July 25, 2014","true","136.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Your character is thrown into a world of vast wilderness and left to fend for himself/herself. Each world is randomly arranged and have random spawnings, keeping the game pretty fresh and new. You gather natural materials like sticks and rocks, make tools like axes and shovels, make traps or weapons to catch animals for food, set up campfires for survival, etc.\nIn the game you have three things you want to keep in check when surviving: Health, Hunger, and Sanity. If you lose your health, well, you can die. If you lose your hunger, you lose your health and die. If you lose your sanity, you start seeing things. Eventually your hallucinations become violent when you're insane and can hurt you. You can also unlock different and unique characters depending on in-game events or accomplishments.\n\nThe art style of this game in my opinion, is very unique and eye-catching. The game is very smooth and doesn't lag alot in general. (depending on how your computer is running though.) It does crash sometimes though. (I've had it crash twice on me.) I have also found a few glitches in the game (before Reign of Giants.)\n\nThis game gives you alot of chores for survival to keep you occupied, though sometimes it does get repeative. The worlds in Maxwell's Gate are the true challenges, whether its going through endless winters or rain. Or even hunted by hounds. Every world is filled with multiple monsters and critters to kill or survive from. There are also tons of material to collect for tons of creations you can unlock and survive with, giving this game some variety if you get that far. I really love the different characters in this game too, each one having their own charms and personalities. (My favorite character is Webber.) At times I get alot of creepy vibes from this game, especially at night when my sanity is getting low. And accomplished vibes whenever I survive from stuff.\n\nThis game does have its charms, but it also has its fair share of flaws. Some of the flaws with this game is the repetiveness when trying to survive multiple times. Dying is definitely a big disappointment, especially when you get pretty far. This was not meant to be a very easy game though. The farther you get, the harder it gets. I would also say that some of the music (mostly in reign of giants) is a little too...cheesy, in a way? (I suppose its meant to be like that but still,) And some of the character's voices (which are instrument sounds) get a little annoying at times. Like Wilson's, for example, and when he gets hurt. The things they say give them alot of personality though. Especially Wendy. One more thing, sometimes (especially when you're a newbie) you encounter things that you have no idea how to deal with unless you look it up. (Which I suggest doing research before eating any of those colorful mushrooms unless you want to do it yourself.)\n\nOne last thing I have to say about this game is this: It's not for everyone. Some people (like me) will really like this game, and others might think its as boring as heck, everyone has their own tastes. So, if you're interested in it, I suggest checking this game out and maybe watch other people play it. Its a very fun game and can get time-consuming, I'd say its worth a buy. 8/10.\n\nAnother thing: Multiplayer is comming soon! :D","May 8, 2014","true","134.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

But have you ever tried going outside (bear with me, we're all gamers here) and trying to make a simple tool with only rocks and sticks? Given the fact that they were born into a world where it was kill or be killed and every day was a fight for survival, it's incredible what the cavemen managed to accomplish.\n\nIn Don't Starve, you take control of a scientist named Wilson*, who has just been thrown into a world as deadly as those the cavemen lived in. However, you have the advantage of knowledge. You know what fire is and how to make it. But you better make it quickly, because the night is fast approaching, and unlike the cavemen, your stars and moon do not provide light. At least, not enough to keep the shadows away.\n\nWelcome to a world of survival, where terrors lurk around every corner, where hunger and madness can prove more dangerous than wild beasts, where death is always a few steps behind. Can you gather the resources you need to defy your own doom? Can you build, research, and advance, all while keeping hunger and madness at bay? Can you build a civilization to stand the test of time? Oh wait, wrong game. Anyway, the world of Don't Starve is filled with horrors and dangers. And that's not even including the winter.\n\nOh, yes. Winter. The most dangerous time of year. Perhaps you thought you were safe from starvation with your bountiful crops of fruit and vegetables. But when the ground freezes over, the plants become stagnate. Now, right when you thought you were safe and secure, you find yourself on the brink of disaster again. For winter is the season of the hunt. But what are you? The hunter? Or the prey? Brace yourself. Winter is coming.\n\nWait, wrong thing again. In any case, this game is a must-have for those who love surviving by the skin of their teeth. The art style is reminiscent of Tim Burton animated movies, making the game truly unique in its field. The gameplay is great, either with keyboard and mouse or with the steam controller. At the time of writing this review, I've played 70 hours of Don't Starve, and I've only scratched the surface. Maybe that's just because I suck at it, but even so I enjoy it immensely.

Let it be known that I have not played the original game to any extent and my impressions are based on the expansion and its content.\n\nNarrative  The narrative is entirely freeform and allows the player to create their own story according to personal playstyle. Your enjoyment in this regard is mostly limited to your own imagination. However, each playable character has his or her own personality quirks, quips and unique gameplay interactions. For example, my favorite character is a snotty librarian who is able to bypass certain tech restrictions due to her vast intelligence and in exchange is unwilling to eat spoiled food.\n\nGameplay  Due to the nature of permadeath games, the player's response to death is paramount to whether or not the game succeeds. When the player inevitably sees the "You died" screen, frustration will be a natural response. However, does the player feel enticed to try again? Has the player learned valuable information that will serve to prevent the same death from occurring?  Don't Starve: Shipwrecked  succeeds for the most part in this regard. For example, at a predetermined time a certain mob will spawn and attack the player. This acts as a test to see if the player has adequately prepared. The first time I had to fight this mob, I instantly died - I was  not  prepared. How could I be? I did not know that the pounding footsteps and the shaking ground were signs of my coming death. However, during my second attempt, I realized that this certain mobs' movements were incredibly predictable and burdened with a long attack animation. I kited them and dispatched them with ease. Five minutes later, while congratulating myself with a hearty vegetable stew, I was punched to mincemeat by a enraged ent revenging his fallen children who I had unwittingly used as my kindling for said stew. And so the ouroboric cycle of punishment/information/success/punishment continued. During the downtime when you are not being chased by rabid sharks or angry buffalo, you will spend your time traveling from island to island in search of new materials, new technologies and establishing bases of operation. There is also a beautiful settings menu with ample customization options for certain mobs/events/seasons/resources to be tweaked, increased or even removed. Do you really love picking berries? Increase the berry bush seed. Do you HATE @#(%@^( KLEPTOMANIC MONKEYS? Remove the monkeys... Or just feed them a banana next time, recruit them permamently, and start a primate civil war. Watch their monkey huts burn down; watch the baby monkeys scream for mercy while you lounge by the shore sipping some iced tea and listening to Rage Against the Machine.\n\nSensory  The art style looks like the baby of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker and American McGee's Alice: sharp lines and bright, contrasting colors all wrapped up in a twisted design. You will never look so good being mutilated over and over again. The sounds are interesting, unique, and did not devolve into repetition. However, the musical soundtrack needed more variance - I eventually listened to my own music and was perfectly content.\n\nConclusion  Do you enjoy being slapped in the face repeatedly by someone other than your wife? Do you relish the idea of convincing monkeys to murder each other with their own feces? Are you titillated by the notion of spending five hours building an empire only to die from a coconut falling on your head?  Do you enjoy complex games with a myriad of gameplay elements which allow you to play your own game against the game? If you said yes to the above then  Don't Starve: Shipwrecked  is a game definitely worth dying.","May 24","true","32.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Granted, monsters are out there to get you as well.\n\nThe game is rather open ended, no clear goals other than survival, although there's an adventure mode to find, which is a more focused challenge.\n\nYou're definitely meant to discover things yourself on the go, through many deaths of you, forging mad in-game survival skills in fires of hell. If you're looking through guides, wikias, videos... you are somewhat missing the point and missing out great deal on the intended "fun".\n\nAnd good riddance, as far as I am concerned, and wikia contributors be praised. Otherwise game is very unfair, puts constant pressure on you, demands great deal from you yet explains nothing, all the while throwing curve balls at you from all possible directions simultaneously and just waiting for any suitable moment to sucker punch you with extreme prejudice. And on top of that this is perma death. You screw up royally, you're out of luck, and have to start from zero on a new random world (but hopefully with more experience now to do better; also I should say there's a way to secure resurrection, but not like it's fool proof, so the royal screw up is always an option).\n\nSeriously, eff that noise. I'm pretty sure die hard fans who went through this without any external help are suffering from Stockholm syndrome.\n\nAs you may see I'm not entirely a fan of the frantic gameplay and main design decisions in general, but I cannot claim the game is bad. What it wants to do, it does very well, and it's an interesting experience to get out of your comfort zone, change the pace a little. Although I did get me some external help on how to survive in this hell, missing a lot of the intended "fun", I had some quality time nonetheless to appreciate this title and I don't regret it.\n\nIt's not really that hard to set up some nice sustainable camp and a variety of defenses from weekly wake up call, you can even set up reasonable supplies despite your main focus here - food - being perishable... It's just that at some point this becomes a chore that prevents you from doing the real good parts. At least IMHO\n\nI had way more actual fun with, say, Terraria, which has quite a different focus - on combat and exploration, with ample addition of creative projects you can undertake, where gathering up resources is a means to an end not your primary worry. I guess I like to mess around in games, especially such that promise sandbox experience, at my own pace, rather than being constantly rushed and pushed and with perma death looming on the horizon to make me lose my entire progress. For the latter, I'd rather play some rogue-lites with well balanced pacing.\n\nYou may probably get bit philosophical about this and claim this game gets it real... Too real for my taste, I guess. Where's my goddarned escapism, eh?\n\nOh, a final thought, though - the above mostly concerns default settings, but actually the game is extremely configurable so once you do get the taste of the intended default experience, you can tweak practically every aspect of the game a lot to match your tastes and perhaps make it easier or even more difficult. Workshop support also something to consider, and official DLC that adds two more seasons, overheating on top of freezing and some other elements, is also something to mix things up. So despite my whining above you can really get a lot from this title, so give it a shot if you have a chance.\n\n:dsham:","July 26, 2014","true","81.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/suotana/recommended/219740/","suotana","Suotana","http://steamcommunity.com/id/suotana/","173 products in account","Let me start this review by telling you how I absolutely LOVE this game. Do note that this review contains spoilers and stuff that might ruin parts of discovery and fun in the game\nI cannot put my love for this game in words but I will try to explain some points of why I believe this is the revolutionary game that help video games progress as form of art.\n--------------------------------------\nFirst of all let me start by telling about the social commentaty this game makes.\nI know it's hard to see the social commentary in a game where you're all alone in the wilderness but it's there to be found. The social commentary is subtle and told in a very dark soul-ish way which is leaving hints and bits of information that the player figures out.\nThere are multiple parts implying that the silent protagonist is a female-to-male transgender. For example the protagonist has very feminine jaw and chin. He also has feminine hair with lots of volume.\nAnother not so noticed part is the depression in his eyes. Many think the depression is from being alone in the wilderness and darkness of the world. Well they're wrong. It is from the depression caused by being transgender and being oppressed by white cis men and women.\n---------------------------------\nNow to the story of the game. I know this is hard to believe for most people, even the most diehard fans of the game, but the game doesnt actually happen in wilderness but inside the person's dreams. The story is very metaphorical about everything. The safety of fire means support of loved ones when transitioning to opposite gender. The angry animals of the wilderness represent the people who are against his transitioning into a man. The neutral animals/critters are considered bypassers. Those are the people he is able to interact without the people being rude/different towards him just for being transgender.\nThe day and night cycle represent the mood swing caused by hormones in transition. While this is not social commentary, it tells about how reality reflects to his dream which the game is. This mechanism is one of the subtle things that make this game a masterpiece.\n------------------------------\nWe're done with the story now, lets progress to the gameplay.\nThe gameplay is something completely fresh. You start of in a hostile world of no comfort, like transgender person is before getting his/her support for transitioning. Slowly you start gathering materials to get fire. The materials represent bits of trust you build up with other people. Fire represents, like I earlier explained, the support. This is a big gameplay aspect that makes this game extremely good.\nAnother excellent game mechanic is the hunger mechanic. Hunger reflects upon the character's need for love. If he is let without love, he will most likely die. In the dream he isnt just likely to die if the hunger for love isnt fed, he will die.\n-------------------------------\nI know this might be shocking to even most diehard fans but everything in this review was researched for a very long time. I spent countless hours finding out all of this and much more. I didnt include everything I found out in this review because I wanted to keep this as a Steam review and not a full review for a bigger site. If you're hungry for more information and stuff I've found out, just ask me.\nThis concludes my review and I strongly recommend everyone to play this.\nIf you're big fan of art games, this is a must have.","May 17, 2014","true","1.0"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","15","26","0","17"

Or getting killed by spiders. Or werepigs. Or stupid, randomly spawning dogs...or, well, there's a lot of ways to die in this game besides just starving, and I'll leave it at that. Overall, it's a rewarding, if not incredibly challenging, experience.\n\nUsually, indie games are highlighted by either their story, design or gameplay, which may prove significantly more innovative or intriguing than your average AAA game. That's why we buy them. Don't Starve is...a little bit different, to say the least, in that it's not all that inspiring in terms of story or gameplay. Here's the story: you don't want to starve, and also there's this dapper looking gentleman who appears to be channeling the ghost of a douchy harmonium. In terms of gameplay, point-and-click or use WASD to move around and interact with your environment, etc, etc. It's nothing that special.\n\nBUT! The design and presentation of the game make up for this apparent lack and reveal that the game itself is not nearly as lacking as it may seem to the wandering eyes of you potential buyers. In terms of design, its quirky, dark, funny and heavily Tim Burton-ized. The art style is simple enough that it doesn't overstep the abilities of its indie designers but still appears fresh, pretty and new, and each character you unlock through surviving longer and longer is unique, with his or her own set of perks and weaknesses that can be amusing, annoying or just plain scary. There's a girl who's dead twin literally follows her around, or a lumberjack with a possessed axe and a dark, beaver-based secret. Personally, I hope for more characters to be added to the vanilla game or perhaps as DLC because the current roster gets unlocked pretty quickly on an good three or four runs through the game. Still, these characters are more interesting than what you'll pick up from most games at this price.\n\nAnd when you do delve deep into this game after many, many, many trial runs, you'll discover that there's actually a lot of lore and story to this world. This mostly begins after entering Adventure Mode (and if you die in this mode, it doesn't affect your progress in the sandbox world), which can be done by opening a door randomly generated in any of your played worlds. You progress through five unique and challenging worlds, and along the way, you get a chance to see some of this lore and will probably hunger for more. Don't Starve leaves a lot more questions unanswered than I would like, but it's all to the cruelly addicting benefit of the game itself.\n\nFinally, I should address the difficulty of this game. You probably won't make it past the first five or so days on your first try without customizing the world. It's not an easy game, lacks any form of tutorial at all and all enemies, from bosses to weak spiders, can be found in the overworld on Day 1. Yes, there are one-time respawn points if you find them, but if you die, then it's over. Sometimes those respawn points don't even spawn. Your forty days of surviving through the turmoil of winter? Screw it! Never happened! And that does kind of suck, but it all adds to the tension and atmosphere of the game itself. You don't get a tutorial in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ woods! No one saves you when you decide to attack a herd of water buffalo with a stick of meat! And that mushroom over there? What does it do? Oh wait, it drains all of your sanity and makes shadow creatures in your head eat off your face. That'll learn ya.\n\nSo yes, Don't Starve is difficult, especially during the winter months. But this is a survival game about surviving in a magical survival forest full of pop culture references and musical instruments. It's not supposed to be easy. And I'll tell you, there's nothing more rewarding than making it past your longest survival time. And if it's too hard, then you can tweak the spawning in a customized world so that only friendly bunnies and happy flowers populate your world. And occasionally, Satanic trees possessed with the vengeance of a thousand sundered splinters will pop up and absolutely wreck everything you hold dear and precious, as was intended by the Founding Fathers.","June 16, 2014","true","32.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Besides having a very interesting art style and a great sense of humor, there is a large amount of things to craft and the resource gathering sates the kleptomaniac in me. All those grass and twigs you spent the past 30 min picking up? Yea you're going to need them. Unlike games such as Fallout where you can kind of just pick up things you want and avoid small drops, you're going to want to get everything you can. Nothing you find in the game is worthless, every drop and resource has a purpose which is a nice touch. There is an extensive wiki on this game, so if you need to know the use of a certain item or a crock pot recipe it's all available to you.\n\nI have to say a few things. One is that if you're dumb like me and didn't know that charcoal is burnt wood, let that be an indication of how to get it (Crock Pot is one of the most important items to survive well past winter). Two is that you might want to get the mod that shows your status (in numerical value) and shows the value for food. It may make the game less frustrating while not taking away from it. Third is that this is a game with perma-death (although there are multiple ways to revive yourself) and dying is the only way to earn experience to unlock most of the characters.\n\nEither way as you can tell I've sunk a large chunk of my time into this game and I highly recommend it.","June 24, 2014","true","191.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's a top-down survival with a sense of despair. I love the simplicity of the art direction it's dark but charming.It's got nice mod support, but I'm gonna say 2/3rd of the workshop is just totally OP OCs or furry charaters with such little changes that It's basically Wilson( stock charater, he's not a bad option, he grows a beard that helps him with the cold and it can be shaven to make an item that could save your life) but without the beard.It doesn't have multiplayer which some people have a major proplrem with, but I sorta like it because I don't have the patience to keep my friends on par with what I do and it allows your friends to learn the game, which makes a dark and scary world not as scary.Definetly recommend it, but it can be annoying having to go through the begging of the game and get your base camp set up. Don't (starve) be overwhelmed by the cast of charaters, you die enough get to give them all a chance.","February 15, 2014","true","113.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Lots of brilliant mods to make the game either harder or easyer. Really depends on how you like playing.\n\nThe new DLC "Reign of Giants" Adds a lot to the game as well. Lots of new things to find, explore and figure out what they do. It's enough to confuse you again and make the game seem fairly fresh.\n\nAs per normal with my higer rated games...

What it lacks in immersion it makes up for in truckloads of creativity and art originality.\nSome of the mechanics feel a little "left by the wayside" such as combat, which to me has always seemed to work a little haphazzardly. But the exploration and curiosity factor are so over the top its very easy to forget such things might get in your way.\nThe music and sound fit perfectly with the art style in a melancholy yet purposeful romp through a dark and twisted wonderland of putrid or warped settings.\nI've had a blast playing Don't Starve, on and off Steam.

Not this one. Literally every playthrough is a new experience. Randomized land and creature spawn means one play may be much easier or much harder than the next, depending on what you get. Will you have enough lumber? Will there be enough prey? Too many spiders? Will you camp and be attacked by hounds your first night? Will you even find enough stuff to make a fire your second night?! And of course, if you're having too much trouble with something, you can customize the world and turn that creature off for a playthrough, OR you can up the chances of encounter to test your skills if it's getting boring. This combined with the colorful character options (every one has a personality that determines what they think of everything, and some are downright hillarious), means this game neve rgets dull or tiresome. I always find my way back to try my hand at lasting a bit longer. So far I'm up to 9 nights. My hint? Never camp near a pig village. No matter how tempting.

This is a survival game in every essense of the word. In a world where you can die at one simple mistake, it really embodies a true survival experience. The amount of sheer content is enough to pick up this game alone. With randomly generated worlds, many characters that change the way you play, a wide assortment of resources that i'm sure i haven't found all of yet, a great art design, a living, breathing world everytime you boot up a map, caves, ruins, a huge and complex crafting assortment, a story mode, multiplayer being put in after early access of DST, customizable worlds, and one of the best modding communities, this game has an imense amount of lastability and will age extremely well.\n\nThe soundtrack is interesting but grows old. After a few hours I started listening to my own music. This is what I call a "wiki game" meaning you will have to live on the wiki if you want to have a clue on what to do. The biggest downfall of this game is the fact that to utilize most of the content, you have to be good, which goes back to the wiki.\n\nOnce you've become a grade A survivor, you will find yourself losing countless afternoons on building up your camp, testing new mods and so on. It is an amazing survival games and one of the best indie titles to come out of the past few years.

This is a survival game in every essense of the word. In a world where you can die at one simple mistake, it really embodies a true survival experience. The amount of sheer content is enough to pick up this game alone. With randomly generated worlds, many characters that change the way you play, a wide assortment of resources that i'm sure i haven't found all of yet, a great art design, a living, breathing world everytime you boot up a map, caves, ruins, a huge and complex crafting assortment, a story mode, multiplayer being put in after early access of DST, customizable worlds, and one of the best modding communities, this game has an imense amount of lastability and will age extremely well.\n\nThe soundtrack is interesting but grows old. After a few hours I started listening to my own music. This is what I call a "wiki game" meaning you will have to live on the wiki if you want to have a clue on what to do. The biggest downfall of this game is the fact that to utilize most of the content, you have to be good, which goes back to the wiki.\n\nOnce you've become a grade A survivor, you will find yourself losing countless afternoons on building up your camp, testing new mods and so on. It is an amazing survival games and one of the best indie titles to come out of the past few years.

Or getting killed by spiders. Or werepigs. Or stupid, randomly spawning dogs...or, well, there's a lot of ways to die in this game besides just starving, and I'll leave it at that. Overall, it's a rewarding, if not incredibly challenging, experience.\n\nUsually, indie games are highlighted by either their story, design or gameplay, which may prove significantly more innovative or intriguing than your average AAA game. That's why we buy them. Don't Starve is...a little bit different, to say the least, in that it's not all that inspiring in terms of story or gameplay. Here's the story: you don't want to starve, and also there's this dapper looking gentleman who appears to be channeling the ghost of a douchy harmonium. In terms of gameplay, point-and-click or use WASD to move around and interact with your environment, etc, etc. It's nothing that special.\n\nBUT! The design and presentation of the game make up for this apparent lack and reveal that the game itself is not nearly as lacking as it may seem to the wandering eyes of you potential buyers. In terms of design, its quirky, dark, funny and heavily Tim Burton-ized. The art style is simple enough that it doesn't overstep the abilities of its indie designers but still appears fresh, pretty and new, and each character you unlock through surviving longer and longer is unique, with his or her own set of perks and weaknesses that can be amusing, annoying or just plain scary. There's a girl who's dead twin literally follows her around, or a lumberjack with a possessed axe and a dark, beaver-based secret. Personally, I hope for more characters to be added to the vanilla game or perhaps as DLC because the current roster gets unlocked pretty quickly on an good three or four runs through the game. Still, these characters are more interesting than what you'll pick up from most games at this price.\n\nAnd when you do delve deep into this game after many, many, many trial runs, you'll discover that there's actually a lot of lore and story to this world. This mostly begins after entering Adventure Mode (and if you die in this mode, it doesn't affect your progress in the sandbox world), which can be done by opening a door randomly generated in any of your played worlds. You progress through five unique and challenging worlds, and along the way, you get a chance to see some of this lore and will probably hunger for more. Don't Starve leaves a lot more questions unanswered than I would like, but it's all to the cruelly addicting benefit of the game itself.\n\nFinally, I should address the difficulty of this game. You probably won't make it past the first five or so days on your first try without customizing the world. It's not an easy game, lacks any form of tutorial at all and all enemies, from bosses to weak spiders, can be found in the overworld on Day 1. Yes, there are one-time respawn points if you find them, but if you die, then it's over. Sometimes those respawn points don't even spawn. Your forty days of surviving through the turmoil of winter? Screw it! Never happened! And that does kind of suck, but it all adds to the tension and atmosphere of the game itself. You don't get a tutorial in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ woods! No one saves you when you decide to attack a herd of water buffalo with a stick of meat! And that mushroom over there? What does it do? Oh wait, it drains all of your sanity and makes shadow creatures in your head eat off your face. That'll learn ya.\n\nSo yes, Don't Starve is difficult, especially during the winter months. But this is a survival game about surviving in a magical survival forest full of pop culture references and musical instruments. It's not supposed to be easy. And I'll tell you, there's nothing more rewarding than making it past your longest survival time. And if it's too hard, then you can tweak the spawning in a customized world so that only friendly bunnies and happy flowers populate your world. And occasionally, Satanic trees possessed with the vengeance of a thousand sundered splinters will pop up and absolutely wreck everything you hold dear and precious, as was intended by the Founding Fathers.","June 16, 2014","true","32.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game doesn't rely on building a mansion out of diamonds, as it does making a small stronghold to survive. As the name implies, the #1 reason for death will definately be starvation. There is little food around, and all in all, it's made so you WILL eventually die, that's a given. And a good 75% chance it will be from starvation.\n\nCreatures will kill you, yes, but you can pretty much run away. If you're not next to a fire at night, you will be anally suprised by invisible monsters in the darkness. It's not minecraft's ♥♥♥♥♥ vision, it's pitch-the-♥♥♥♥-black out at night, no nightvision ♥♥♥♥. Crafting is pretty much the same as minecraft, you also don't get that ♥♥♥♥♥-♥♥♥ inventory of 600 spaces, you get a tiny inventory, and you can carry a (8 slot?) backpack, and your chests that you make hold 9 items. You can't ♥♥♥♥♥ on food, which was my origional intention, because it rots in your inventory. Also, there's that damn turkey that steals berries. ♥♥♥♥ him.\n\nYou can also set up a custom game, turn food to super-orgy-of-carrots mode, or you can just turn off food (if you're a dumbass) you can turn up resources, all that fun jazz. Try and make a map minimum size, with everything (enemies, resources) turned up to max. You'll die in like 12 minutes XD.\n\nAll in all, this game is amazing as hell, and you should totally buy it for it's cheap price, plus with regular updates, it's keeping me in high hopes that this will be my favorite survival game. I'm awaiting the next update in 3 days with bated breath.\n\nAnd them pigs...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Omegacorp/recommended/219740/","Omegacorp","EldritchΣigma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Omegacorp/","38 products in account","Review written after purchasing the DLC\n\nAbout the Basic Game:\n\nAlright lets get it straight and simple: the basic game is an extremly hard, easily modable and overall fun survival game. Interesting mechanics, good combat mechanics, and in general no items are completly useless. Even if you allow your food to rot because you do not have a fridge yet to slow spoilage down it will still have a use as fertilizer. Every damn item has a use in this game and that happens not that often. No item is outperformed by another one. Each of them have flaws. Even "inferior" stone/flint which break more easily have a nice advantage over gold tools: They are alot cheaper to craft. Though the concept of gold tools is kinda stereotypic because gold is a really soft material... oh well. Oh and btw, you dont want to be in the darkness without a light.\n\nCreative and unique enemies with relativly decent movement patterns which will hit hard if you do not respect them as a propper enemy (though the regular spiders are a bit weak), fairly expensiv but powerfull ranged weapons, a good, well balanced armor system and very lovely characters to play with. You can even play as the main antagonist "Maxwell" if you finish the game. Each character has its own unique abilities giving him perks to support his survival in some way and having disadvantages making certain things harder. For instance Wilson: That character is unlocked from the beginning. He has very well balanced stats and as a special perk he grows a beard. Doesnt sound that special right? But the beard can be shaved and used as an effigy of himself in order to give him another try in case he dies. And extra lifes are EXTREMLY HARD to obtain in the game. Other characters like Woodie, a canadian lumberjack, has a fear of birds and therefor looses sanity near them, but brings his own unbreakable axe, a HUGE advantage over other characters. Also he is "cursed" which affects him at certain days (not spoiling too much).\n\nSo after hinting on sanitiy theres also a very inspiring sanity/insanity system. Surviving in a lone, strange world with different laws of physics can be harsh. Where everything you encounter might kill you you might turn insane. Well thats the case in the game: You slowly loose your sanity if certain events are happening. For instance if you are in the dusk, exposed to certain terrifying hostiles or if you are close to some "evil flowers" which are poisoning the air arround them letting you go insane slowly. As sanity drops the character begins to hear weird noises, voices and starts hallucinating draining his sanity further. Once he is over a certain threshhold those "hallucinations" manifest and you have to fight extremly powerfull, otherworldly monsters who could have come from Lovecraft himself. Those "shadows" are able to teleport and as already said hard to kill. You have to gain sanity by doing "sane" things, like picking a few dozens of flowers, then throwing them away (well however that should keep you sane), wearing civilized clothes or killing said shadows. You need to be insane once in a while in order to survive alot better because said shadows drop a very usefull material.\n\nLastly I like to point out the weather/season system: In the standard game without the DLC there are 2 seasons: Summer and Winter. Summer is relativly easy, you basicly setup your camp, gain materials, fight monsters, survive. Winter turns the game alot harder. You will start freezing without a fire or propper clothing, have trouble finding food (good luck farming in winter) and a giant mob called deerclops will spawn at some point who has to be killed in order to protect your camp and your hard work. Winter plays completly different then the regular seasons.\n\nAnd theres alot more content to explore then those highlights I listed up + the community really produces high quality mods for the game.\n\n\nSo now to the DLC:\n\nI hate DLCs... usually. But if its that well done and for a price of 4.99$ then I can just say "Go ahead buy it now".\nIt adds the remaining 2 seasons and turns summer into a drought. In spring you have to fight with dampness of your character because of frequent rain. Summer is a drought which means plants will wither and dont yield food, heat will affect you badly similar to winters cold, trees, plants, mobs, items on the ground, you etc will combust once in a while if its burnable and faster food spoilage will occur. Autumn is by far the most peacefull season... untill you encounter the Giant in autumn which is extremly hard to fight. He is basicly a far stronger version then winters deerclops and has a "beserk attack" where he (or it) will rush towards you destroying any contraptions you build and derooting trees. He will eat any food he can find if left alone and only turns hostile if you hinder him from eating. Thats just 1 giant. There is 1 giant for each season now, and the deerclops for winter got rebalanced and got a powerfull "icicle erruption" as a stomp attack causing icy spears to appear infront of him out of the ground.\n\nWith all the new seasons, new giants/bosses and new survival mechanics... basicly all the content comes a heck of more items. Again all of them have uses and none of them are completly useless. And all of them are very balanced. Overall a very good "DLC" which I would rather call an addon because of the sheer mass of content it dumbs on you. Oh and you get to play 2 new unique, high quality, characters with unique abilities. No reskins or anything like the stuff you get from bigger "AAA" companies or corrupted pieces of... (EA). This DLC worths the money and is a great addition to the main game.\n\nI highly recomment getting both, Main game and DLC, its an awesome, joyfull yet extremly hard game. If you fail and die you lost everything if you dont have any kinds of resurrection methods. Its the thrill of loosing anything which makes the game really fun. And there are alot of mods out there, some just adding new items, some which add completly new "levels" to play as. Or just unique characters like a Weavile, The red Soldier (Jane Doe) from TF2, The Heavy from TF2 or completly original characters with unique abilities (William J. Dannigar (hopefully I wrote that name right).\n\nSo go get the game if you want a challenge. Its fun and really enjoyable.\n\n-Sigma\n\nBefore I forgot: For those guys (and girls) who are into tentacles. Guess whats in the game. Yes Tentacles. In damp swamps. Which will try to impale you with their damp, wet, hot spike on their tip. The tentacles are purple.\n\nAnd in the underground/caves are even BIGGER tentacles. If you touch them they will summon a good ammount of smaller tentacles out of the ground which will then impale you with their sharp spikes aswell. Where impaling means hurting you with some kind of blade on the tentacles tip. Not the other way more nasty thing...","May 22, 2014","true","205.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

All for some gold.\n\nPros:\nReplayability: This game almost makes you want to hit retry, and if you find yourself bored, download some mods.\nDLC: Reign of giants is a DLC that changes how you play your game, adding 2 seasons, and a handful of new mobs to farm, kill, or be killed by.\nRoguelike: This makes the game exciting, if you were to respawn constantly It would detract from the difficulty of the game(IMO)\n\n\nCons:\nMinor bugs that screw with my control settings\n\nOverall I give this game no rating because ratings suck.

You got 1 life, and thats it! Don't starve is a very fitting name for this game, hunger will be one of your greatest opponents, but sanity comes in great as a second! At night, when the creepy monsters come.. When you're nearly dying of hungry and slowly start to go insane. That is when things start to get creepy! Where did that music come from!? Stay off my campfire! Oh no, My torch just ran out.....\n\nThe art is simple but appealing, reminds me of Tim Burton a bit. The characters speak an amusing jibberish, and all of them have great up- and downsides depending on your playstyle.\n\nThis game may cause some rage-quits, but it is very rewarding to stay alive! .. My Rage quit: . After i set my own farm on fire by accident with a very nervous Willow (character, who loves fire a tad too much) my hp started to drop because i was starving without my crops. A few minutes later 3 hounds came and ate me. Damnit! Mother of all ragequits.. And yet i started to play again within a day. It's just so appealing. The Reign of Giants DLC is fun, but not my cup-o-tea. I prefer the normal version. But it is fun to mix and match up at times, i would still recommend atleast trying it.","July 27, 2014","true","34.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I did not expect the mechanics and setting to be so immersive but they stand up strong next to any "3D" games that can be found in this genre. When night falls I feel a genuine sense of peril and urgency to get back to my camp or risk death by any one of a variety of night-time creepies. Thats hard to pull of in a cartoony 2D game. Im not a huge horror fan, but this game has juuuuuuuust the right amount of suspense to make it exciting but not nerve-wrackingly scary. On that point - the graphics are fantastic for what they are meant to be, a dark comedic romp through a 2D survival sim that seems to be something out of a Tim Burton movie. My only small issue is the controller option is a tiny bit hard to use for construction on your site. Its hard to get things in the right spot to place, making it frustrating when building your shelter.

I hate not having had enough time with it...  :)  But I guess it was the whole deal with a full week-end (if ever I would had stayed home longer ;) ).\n\nUsually I flee demon related games within the exception of Diablo.  But this one so far in my full hour deserved all the attention I could put in it.  No tutorial but all too intuitive you end-up well immersed too.\n\nEDIT 24th May 2015\nI finally have the game and found the portal to stage 2 a couples of time.  No matter how long my game last (Normally now between 15 to 27 days in-game), I still marvel at discovering new things and tricks and I don't want to apply yet mods to fully discover this world and new strategies and how to pass winter.\n\nI don't think I can ever being bored with it.  Just having some things more urgent to do IRL than quench my need to survival or quench my need to prove my ingenuity.  But yet I never yet seen the like!  It is fun, yet intuitive and just enough realism to see all seasons for a crafty enough player.  ;)","October 19, 2014","true","568.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","4"

Can't say I've seen anything like it in all my gaming years (over 20  years now).\nIn a class of its own, despite being a survival game.\nWhen I saw the game in the Steam store, I watched the videos, read some reviews, then checked out the community and workshop.  The art direction of this series has always intrigued me, I just wasn't sure if it was something I could get in to.\nThe game went on Sale this week, so I picked it up.  It's safe to say, 'the rest is history'.\n\nWhat an amazing little survival game!  I literally have to watch myself with this one, because what seems like 15-20min ends up being an hour or two, without even batting an eye about it.  The sounds, music, mechanics, map design, 'critter' art and designs, all of it are just superb, and unique.\n\nThe game runs flawlessly, without any hiccups, so far.  The modding community for this game is alive and well, ensuring that this series won't be going away anytime soon.\n\nI highly recommend this game to ANY kind of gamer, it will surprise you!  I haven't really played the "Together" version yet, but I'm quite certain it will only add even more fun to the game, and without a doubt, some hillarious moments!\n\n5/5 Stars for this one.  Buy it.  Play it.  I'm not responsible for any addiction that occurs there-after.  ;)","April 28","true","2.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's got an amazing Tim Burton-eque art style with plenty of survival aspects. The world is randomly generated so you'll not get the same map multiple times unless you wish to (there's an option to retry if you die on current map).\n\nMany people ask, "How do you get further than 10 - 20 days"? Practice, play the game, it's a survival game. Explore, craft stuff and mainly look at your surroundings for what's most helpful (beefao).\n\nOverall I'd recommend this game to anyone who loves Survival games, give it a try and if you get stuck there's an always growing wiki page for the game.

Developed & published by Klei Entertainment. The gameplay is simple which is pretty common for Klei, the controls are nothing special which isn’t bad, the gameplay itself is mostly fun although I have some personal gripes with combat.\n\nBut, first, let’s talk about the graphics, the game is an isometric 2.5D game, with this really intriguing dark pencil drawn art style, the fact that the world of Don’t Starve itself is this mysterious & weird world also lends itself to this type of art style. The music also reminds me of this sort of twisted carnival feel, with lots of weird strings & brass instruments used to set the tone, characters also speak with mashed up music tones from different instruments, sounding mostly unpleasant.\n\nSo as it’s about survival, you’ll brave all the elements of the seasons, the ever present drain on your sanity & your belly grumbling. Don’t Starve also features plenty of dangerous creatures as well as some neutral ones ranging from the Pigmen to the aggressive fish like Merms & of course with the Reign of Giants DLC, Giant boss monsters like the Deerclops. It’s a pretty challenging game, don’t expect to survive very long with your first forays into Don’t Starve, you’ll die plenty of times but, never unfairly so, as you learn the game you will become a better survivor & the game rewards you for how long you survive by unlock more characters to play with a total of eleven to choose from all with their own strengths & weaknesses. The story of Don’t Starve is only accessible through the sandbox mode which you start in, if you wish to know how to get there, you’ll have to experiment to find out.\n\nMy only real gripe is with the games ‘combat’, you interact with the world mainly with the mouse, you can hold the spacebar to pick up nearby objects which is really handy, you can use the mouse or keyboard to move around, but, when in combat, I only ever was able to use the mouse, this is a problem, since the world is flat it is very easy & common for things to get in the way. This is only exasperated when things are hectic, it’s very annoying when there is multiple enemies. There are several ways to avoid combat, but, when you must it’s a pain dealing with multiple enemies at once. Other than that gripe the game is just pure fun, the multiplayer part was so simple to setup I can’t find anything to complain about, it’s the whole single player game with friends up to six & it’s easy to use plus you get two copies for the one price so it’s pretty cheap.\n\nI personally love Don’t Starve, it was a bit to get into at first, mostly because I was failing a lot at the beginning, but, once I gave it a serious shot I began to get better & better & could survive a very long time before dying, if you like survival type games in general definitely check this out, if you don’t like a challenge, or don’t like indies (for some reason) or just don’t like things that aren’t 3D ultra-graphics & “realistic” then steer clear of the quirky world of Don’t Starve, for the rest, we’ll be trying to survive despite the odds. Its $14.99 USD which is a pretty good deal, I’d recommend getting the bundle with the Reign of Giants for $18.99 USD which will give you a ton of stuff, or get the bundle that comes with a copy of Don’t Starve Together which includes the Reign of Giants DLC & bring a friend along for the ride! Thank you Klei Entertainment for awesome deals on awesome games!\n\nTL/DR; Don’t Starve is a wonderful survival game that doesn’t take itself too seriously but does offer a serious challenge for new comers. It’s got a very unique art style. The game is simple to play & simple to run with the sandbox goal of ‘survive’, it holds no hands & still expects you to succeed, it’s a fun game, & its multiplayer component Don’t Starve Together makes the experience even better with the ability to bring friends along for the suffering. I highly recommend check out both titles, they offer good deals for the single & multiplayer experience, unless you can’t stand the look of the game, or need that “realistic” approach to survival then check out Don’t Starve & Don’t Starve Together!\n\n-Double Thumbs Up from Royial","June 25, 2015","true","6.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

If it was multiplayer, I would say go full price, but you should catch this when it is on sale.  It also includes a second game mode that is worth checking out that plays kind of like the "Slenderman" horror minigame.  It is challenging, at least in the beginning while you are trying to figure out how not to starve to death or get murdered by darkness.  The second character you unlock basically allows you to play endlessly, so if you want a good challenge, try skipping her.  Also, the game seems to ramp up difficulty the more days you survive, which I know sounds typical, but the game lends itself to a feeling of opening new areas for higher difficulty instead of time-based difficulty progression.\n-It plays like a point and click hack n slash in an open world, but no traditional rpg elements.\n-The art is cute and works well with the play-style.\n-Craft to survive.  Bang on a tree to get wood for a fire, build an axe or pick, even a snare to catch dinner.\n-If you have played DayZ, Rust or one of the other Survival Horror games, then that is what you can expect, but in an isometric, 2D environment which is a refreshing pov shift for a genre I enjoy.","January 18, 2014","true","7.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Overall, the game is very well executed. The world the game is set in is at first very brutal, very unforgiving, and there is little-to-none tutorialization. When you eventually start to gain a foothold, the experience can be extremely rewarding. Character perk sets and the ability to customize the world generation and cycles add lots of replay value.","June 29, 2014","true","52.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JustSimplyGaming/recommended/219740/","JustSimplyGaming","The Humble Gamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JustSimplyGaming/","247 products in account","Second Edit: 26 January 2015\n(NOTE: This review is aimed at new players)\n\nSo I thought I'd elaborate a little on the context of this game to make this a more useful review like others have made.\n\nFirst of all, this game is HARD.\nLike. REALLY ♥♥♥♥ING HARD.\nIf you're a newbie at this game, you are going to die ALOT.\nBut that's not a bad thing.\n\nIf there is one thing this game does right its create an atmosphere thats both immersive & chilling.\nIt is not only a wonderful survival game but an absolutely brilliant adventure game aswell (Once you manage to get to grips with how hard the game can be that is. And you stop dieing as much)\nBy the way, do you think i'm exaggerating with that "You're going to die ALOT" remark?\nTrust me, I'm not. Though I really wish I was.\n\nI'll start you off properly by describing the basic mechanics of the game at the start.\nFirst of all, this game is survival based-so you are gonna have a few things to watch out for when you start up a new game. Health, Hunger & Sanity.\nThese are you three basic survival bars which you have to maintain.\nHunger being quenched with food items (raw or cooked), and health being quenched also by food, but only certain foods. This means that some foods will give you much less health than others (That is that a majority of the food you come across like carrots, berries and meat will not heal much)\nHealth will  regen slowly over time if you cannot afford to waste limited food resources on it though.\nAnd then there's sanity...oh boy.\nSanity is the bar that will quite literally wreck your own sanity in real life if you fail to maintain it.\nIt can be regained when lost by picking flowers and you can make a hat from the petals you recieve from those flowers which will majorly slow down the rate at which you loose sanity for a few in-game days. If your sanity get's too low though, shadow mosters will start to physically hurt you.\nI will describe enemies a little later in this review. But first, crafting!\n\n(NOTE: I may re-edit this review another day to describe the crafting in full detail)\nCrafting is the most important mechanic in this game and can be a littl complicated for begginers to understand in the beggining.\nFor most newbies I would suggest the dont starve wiki to get to grips with the different section of the crafting menu, as describing it here would take me all day.\nSo onto that description of the enemies!\n\nEnemies come in all shapes and sizes in Don't starve, and they all spawn in the moment you start.\nIt is your job to avoid them until you are ready to take them down...which takes a while.\nMy suggestion is the same as most would suggest, if you're going to attack anything in the first 10 or so days...make it spiders or singled out pigmen.\nIf your sanity gets to low you will not an immense increase in the amount of shadowy creatures lurking about. These creatures will actually be able to hurt you if your sanity gets low enough.\nI won't go into too much more detail about the enemies as you probably get the point, most are harder to defeat than some.\n\nNow we get to seasons...\nWhen you start a new world you can pick to either start in winter or summer. (FYI. Winter sucks)\nAfter you get through summer you get to autumn, then winter & then it goes back around to spring and then the cycle repears itself, like real life (not that this game mimics real life cause jesus that would be terrifying)\n\nAll in all this game is a terrifying but interesting dark survival experience that never fails to get my blood pumping and my brain on overdrive.\n\nIf you are looking for a survival game that isnt a zombie filled gorefest and actually has some genuinly spooky chill-inducing atmosphere and tight survival gameplay, then this may just be the game for you.\n\nAn absolute 10/10\n\n..............................................................................................................................................\n\nFirst Edit: 29 June 2014\n\nI absolutely love this game.\nSurvival mixed with dark/horror themes, your sanity will drain slowly overtime as you encounter strange beasts and dark pits.\nNot to mention the countless amount of nights spent in fear of literally EVERYTHING.\n\n10/10","June 29, 2014","true","4.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There is truly no game that I have played that is quite like it. True, it's similar to survial games such as Rust but it is... so much more. The game itself is ridiculously challenging, so you'll always be interested in playing it. You can pick from a vaerity of characters (which you have to earn through surviving a certain amount of days with the previous character etc.) which means each playthrough is unique because you need to play to that particular charachters strengths. There are plenty of achievements to keep you entertained too, and the  graphics are clear. However, although I'm sure they will do this in later updates, I personally think there needs to be more crafting options in the crafting menu.\nIn conclusion, it's an excellent, unique game that is well worth buying.\n4.5/5","March 9, 2015","true","7.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I love games that force you to make hard decisions about what your doing next in it. Don't starve is the perfect example of how games should make you consider almost every action you take. Theres almost no story, no tutorial, and no hand holding. You make the story as you go along. You make life and death decisions every step of the way, and if you mess up? BOOM your dead, game over, please insert two quarters to continue. This is how games should be made. I've faced more indecision and planned farther ahead in this game then Banner Saga, Mass Effect, Dragon Age or any other game that touts its "branching storyline". Theres ALMOST no check points, no reloads, and no do overs. And If you do manage to figure out how to respawn, theres penalties for doing so. Everytime you come back to life, your overall health, sanity, and hunger decrease. This game is amazing, and true to the Golden Era of gaming. Play it.","February 14, 2014","true","22.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Until one of my friends modded it a few months ago. Now at that time I had no clue on how to mod videogames, and was too lazy to do so. Until a couple of months ago I had tons of free time, and decided to give modding a try. After yet another friend brought this game I was reminded of this game. So since I've been modding 3D games such as Left4Dead2, I decided what the heck, I'll buy this game and give the modding at try.\n\nAfter playing a none-custom game, I died the first day from not getting up a fire up in time. This made me want to try again, this time I survivaled 3 days, dying by going insane from not knowing how to keep sane. But with each new game I learned how things worked and what creatures are friendly and need to be avioded. After playing it a few hours I have found that this game is INCREDIBLY addicting.\n\nThe world randomly generates so every play through is a new experience, keeping each game feeling fresh. You never know when you'll spawn in the middle of nowhere, in a rich in resources pig village, or right next to a spider nest or pack of blood thirsty hounds. Not only that, since I do own Reign of Giants dlc you must watch out for the seasons, if you customize your world settings to be more advanced you may be a unlucky person to spawn in summer or winter, where you can easily overheat or freeze to death. The game is unforgiving, it tries it's hardest to kill you but with each gameplay you learn to survive longer.\n\nThe game has a very unique-looking style. It reminds me a little of a Tim Buton-like style, and it's very nice to look at. The creatures are creative too, along with each character you can unlock with their different abilities.\n\nI then tried my hand at modding the game and found that it is VERY easy to mod. Now I do have more experience modding harder games so those without modding experience might take a little longer to learn than someone will some experience, but since the games community and the games staff is generous and very willing to help you with modding it. You'll defiantly get the hang of it eventually. There are also plenty of videos to help you out with it.\n\nI defiantly reccommend buying this game, it is worth every penny. With multiplayer coming out soon you'll be able to enjoy the game with your friends.","June 19, 2014","true","95.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","4"

Silly question, of course! Inclusing the DLC too, this game is a bundle of amazingness. Don't starve is , if not, on it's way to becoming the best gaming experience around. The fact you get dropped into a completely random world full of so many things that can kill you is so much fun. Of course the main objective is to not starve, but there are so many other obstacles to overcome, and so many ways to do just that. Don't starve is an amazing game that has taken up around 100 hours of my time, and soon to be much, much more. It will soon be multiplayer, so being able to experience all the dangers, problems and sucesses but with some company is something to look forward to.\nIf you do not have patience, then this game probably isn't the best idea. You start off with mainly grass and wood, but as the game flows on, you can be speeding around with a cane, a top hat and some turkey dinner! What could be better?\nThis game just offers such a thrill. The fact it also has great replayability, with other characters and that you can edit your worlds however you like, making it more difficult or easy, or even install some mods made by the fabulous people in the Steam Don't Starve workshop!\nOverall, if you have some spare time, a bit of money and are looking for a good, fun game, then I definately recommend this one.","June 13, 2014","true","126.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You can go insane to get killed by creatures of your mind, seemingly harmless animals can kill you in 5 seconds when grouped together, packs of hounds can come out of nowhere, walrus hunting parties will actively seek you out in the winter, you can freeze to death if you don't have warm clothes or fire, the night will kill you, you can starve, trees will come to life randomly, and there is no escape from the dreaded Deerclops.\n\nLovely music, great art style (demented Dr. Seuss), large emphasis on survival, and a great developer that actively adds new content every month (see: Mojang's dumbassery).\n\nOne thing I don't like is that you'll reach a certain point where you'll feel like you've seen and done everything, but this point comes after 80 hours in a single world.\n\n8/10","September 10, 2013","true","101.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You have a variety of different characters to unlock that each have their own pros and cons and its that diversity which makes playing Don't Starve different everytime you play.. well that and the world is randomly generated everytime you start a new game! so who knows what you will bump into I am still finding new enemies and items to craft and this is coming from a guy who is 20+ hours into the game. Essentially the gameplay consists of gathering wood, flint, stone and food (which is pretty obvious.. I mean the game is called Don't Starve). There are so many items to craft to improve your camp or camps in the massive world you are dropped into and you get a lot of joy from planning out exactly what you are going to collect and make each time you play but that said the game can be a bit overwhelming for new players as you have to think for yourself rather than the game holding your hand which in my opinion works to the games advantage as it adds a sense of accomplishment when you make something to help you survive and if the game told you how to do most things that feeling would not exist and the game wouldn't be anyway near as entertaining. The gameplay is fun and addicting and also stressful at times but not in a bad way as its not the games fault its your fault for forgetting to make a valid step to survive in this beautiful but dangerous world.\n\nStory: The story doesn't seem to be the main focus of this game but there is a story hidden in there behind each character you unlock as they are all wacky and have a dark sort of wit to them which I love. The basic premise of this game is that you are dropped into a world by the main villian Maxwell and you have to survive and escape (Or just survive for as long as you can for the lols). There are subtle hints dropped by the characters at points in the game about each characters back story which is very nice.\n\nGraphics: This is a beautiful game... its no Skyrim graphical wise but thats not the point this game focuses on art style rather than realism and it works to its advantage as all the characters look like they were taken from concept art by Tim Burton and they are all unique and just as visually interesting as the world of Don't Starve. This is Art.\n\nOverall Verdict: Don't Starve is a great game and I look forward to playing it for years to come and I am also looking very forward to the new game mode "Don't Starve Together" which is introducing co-op to the game and I am very interesting in that.\n\nNote: People that hate survival games should at least give this one a chance as this is what got me into the survival genre.\n\n","August 31, 2014","true","24.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It doesn't patronise, the communities around it are wonderful, and its Devs keep good ties to their community enabling good communication and support. You can spend hours playing, or just a quick 20 minutes, it's easy to jump in and out. This makes it a versatile game I would highly reccommend.","March 20, 2014","true","473.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'd like to point out here I was expecting something like old Horde game - you stay in a camp, build your defences during the day, defend at night and reap your rewards.\n\nIt was not the case as instead the developers gave me a game about survival and exploration. I have to say that second "X" part is really crucial for the game, as in early stages you will starve or freak out if you don't collect a lot of food, branches, some little stones that help you start a campfire. This game makes you watch out not only for your hit points but hunger level and serenity as well. Strange things happen if you become insane.\n\nGameplay also brings you back to point'n'click adventure games where you had to find out what can be combined with what. Here it's similiar, it's trial and error with a bit of punishment, but keep in mind: this game is not an extreme hardcore self-destructive masterpiece. The learning curve isn't any steep. It's just a pleasure.\n\nAs the days go by you learn new things, which gives you a lot of satisfaction. Surviving more and more days also gives you that feeling of progress, because there are new characters to unlock (with different abilities and stats).\n\nThe downside to this game is that it's kinda cryptic at times and thanks to random generators you can either be in a very good starting position or a very bad one, but usually it doesn't go as far as spawning you next to a lvl 9001 mob which one-hits you.\n\nI can recommend this game. I'm not exactly a fan of survive, craft and explore games, but it still gave me some nice memories and I will certainly play it again.","February 27, 2014","true","2.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You have a variety of different characters to unlock that each have their own pros and cons and its that diversity which makes playing Don't Starve different everytime you play.. well that and the world is randomly generated everytime you start a new game! so who knows what you will bump into I am still finding new enemies and items to craft and this is coming from a guy who is 20+ hours into the game. Essentially the gameplay consists of gathering wood, flint, stone and food (which is pretty obvious.. I mean the game is called Don't Starve). There are so many items to craft to improve your camp or camps in the massive world you are dropped into and you get a lot of joy from planning out exactly what you are going to collect and make each time you play but that said the game can be a bit overwhelming for new players as you have to think for yourself rather than the game holding your hand which in my opinion works to the games advantage as it adds a sense of accomplishment when you make something to help you survive and if the game told you how to do most things that feeling would not exist and the game wouldn't be anyway near as entertaining. The gameplay is fun and addicting and also stressful at times but not in a bad way as its not the games fault its your fault for forgetting to make a valid step to survive in this beautiful but dangerous world.\n\nStory: The story doesn't seem to be the main focus of this game but there is a story hidden in there behind each character you unlock as they are all wacky and have a dark sort of wit to them which I love. The basic premise of this game is that you are dropped into a world by the main villian Maxwell and you have to survive and escape (Or just survive for as long as you can for the lols). There are subtle hints dropped by the characters at points in the game about each characters back story which is very nice.\n\nGraphics: This is a beautiful game... its no Skyrim graphical wise but thats not the point this game focuses on art style rather than realism and it works to its advantage as all the characters look like they were taken from concept art by Tim Burton and they are all unique and just as visually interesting as the world of Don't Starve. This is Art.\n\nOverall Verdict: Don't Starve is a great game and I look forward to playing it for years to come and I am also looking very forward to the new game mode "Don't Starve Together" which is introducing co-op to the game and I am very interesting in that.\n\nNote: People that hate survival games should at least give this one a chance as this is what got me into the survival genre.\n\n","August 31, 2014","true","24.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A game in which you think you are on top of the world, a game in which you think your powerful becasue you can burn things, because all of nature is at your disposal. You can make crock pots, drying racks, and refrigerators to brave the elements, you can dodge tentacles, fight monsters and burn tree monsters. You can destroy beehives, slaughter bees, bunnies, and pigs. You can fight giant deer like monsters which with a fatal swing, you can munch on their eyeball. Only to be taken down by your own inability to digest cooked mushrooms. At it's roots, a beautiful game about survival. But be warned will make you rage harder than that one time you let that one D-bag cheat off your test and he got a better grade than you.\n\nThe game also features a variety of charachters such as a man who doesnt immediately seem to have any buffs but later in the game can be the greatest of all for his neutrality and the fact that beard hair can be more important for a prolonged game than weaponry. His name is Wilson.\n\nA young lady who again doesnt seem to have too many buffs aside from the fact that she carries a lighter. However, this lighter is not only convienient but raises this girls sanity tremendously when lit. Her name? Willow.\n\nA strongman likely hailing from the circus. When on a full belly crushes monsters with few hits. When hungry becomes a lanky being incapable of throwing a punch. A strongman named Wolfgang.\n\nA lady who doesn't seem to be anything worth taking a second look at, but when her flower blooms, she is accompanied by her ghostly sibling named Abigail who kills anything and everything. I present, Wendy.\n\nA robot that is weakened by the rain and superpowerd by lightning. A robot who upgrades all of his stats by swallowing gears and a robot whom doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about the state of his meal. WX-78\n\nAn old hag librarian who seems to have insomnia and an inability to digest food that is stale or beginning to go bad. At first she may seem like the worst charachter of all, but she has a secret... she can self publish books of power which give extremely strong buffs to the player. She is Wickerbottom.\n\nAnd finally (or is he?) a Canadian lumberjack who seems to be a pretty nice guy and arguably some of the best stats in the game. But he has a terrible secret linked to his origin and his beloved Axe.\n\nAll those charachters with their wide ranges of personality, chat, buffs, and nerfs. But there are still two more that you, as the player need to unlock.

Choose a character, each with their own little quirks and dialogue.  Explore the world, harvest food and supplies, build camps, survive attacks, discover and create crazy new things, survive the night and the hardships that come with each season, rinse and repeat.  There's good enemy variety and lots of things to discover, and you have a good amount of customization for the world before you spawn in it.  Everything from frequency of the various enemy/food spawns, to how the seasons work.\n\nThe game also comes with a Caves update (probably big enough to be a DLC) that adds an entire new biome, enemies and more, and also a mod that adds an entire other little game called The Screecher.  The DLC Reign of Giants is also worth getting, it adds quite a bit of content for it's price.

Check this game out and get the Reign Of Giants DLC, its really cool! So, overall, this game is a fantasy-based game that feels like Minecraft and Terraria but in a 3-D world with more things to craft, much more things to do, and many other fantasy creatures out to get you like Hounds, Tallbirds, Spiders, etc. So, check this game out!

I'd like to point out here I was expecting something like old Horde game - you stay in a camp, build your defences during the day, defend at night and reap your rewards.\n\nIt was not the case as instead the developers gave me a game about survival and exploration. I have to say that second "X" part is really crucial for the game, as in early stages you will starve or freak out if you don't collect a lot of food, branches, some little stones that help you start a campfire. This game makes you watch out not only for your hit points but hunger level and serenity as well. Strange things happen if you become insane.\n\nGameplay also brings you back to point'n'click adventure games where you had to find out what can be combined with what. Here it's similiar, it's trial and error with a bit of punishment, but keep in mind: this game is not an extreme hardcore self-destructive masterpiece. The learning curve isn't any steep. It's just a pleasure.\n\nAs the days go by you learn new things, which gives you a lot of satisfaction. Surviving more and more days also gives you that feeling of progress, because there are new characters to unlock (with different abilities and stats).\n\nThe downside to this game is that it's kinda cryptic at times and thanks to random generators you can either be in a very good starting position or a very bad one, but usually it doesn't go as far as spawning you next to a lvl 9001 mob which one-hits you.\n\nI can recommend this game. I'm not exactly a fan of survive, craft and explore games, but it still gave me some nice memories and I will certainly play it again.","February 27, 2014","true","2.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You get thrown into the world with absolutely no real tutorials, just the challenge to try to not starve to death, or die from insanity. A tutorial is honeslty not needed though.

The ui layout is simple, you have various characters to choose from and even a short minimod available if you choose, which is awesome even for how short it is.

There is a sandbox mode, where you try to survive as long as you can, as well as an adventure mode with a minimal story. There is also a wide variety of crafting (as well as cooking) which is neatly organized into different tiers.\n\nWhile the game's purpose is quite simple -not to starve- you get no handholding whatsoever. Your character is stranded in an unknown world, where you need to figure out what to do in order to survive. This can result in several deaths initially, as well as loads of hilarious situations which inevitably occur when you run around poking things. Don't starve is mostly unforgiving to your mistakes -which can end in permanent death- but rewards you with unlocking several characters with unique abilities, in order to spice up your gameplay. There is an option to tweak several world aspects as well, if you are looking for a more casual sandbox experience.

The fact you get dropped into a completely random world full of so many things that can kill you is so much fun. Of course the main objective is to not starve, but there are so many other obstacles to overcome, and so many ways to do just that. Don't starve is an amazing game that has taken up around 100 hours of my time, and soon to be much, much more. It will soon be multiplayer, so being able to experience all the dangers, problems and sucesses but with some company is something to look forward to.\nIf you do not have patience, then this game probably isn't the best idea. You start off with mainly grass and wood, but as the game flows on, you can be speeding around with a cane, a top hat and some turkey dinner! What could be better?\nThis game just offers such a thrill. The fact it also has great replayability, with other characters and that you can edit your worlds however you like, making it more difficult or easy, or even install some mods made by the fabulous people in the Steam Don't Starve workshop!\nOverall, if you have some spare time, a bit of money and are looking for a good, fun game, then I definately recommend this one.","June 13, 2014","true","126.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I've had many fun and exciting moments when playing, and in the beginning, as a noob, it's even more fun and at the same time 'scary' to explore the world and all the interesting stuff that happens (?!).\n\nThe point is to not Starve (obviously) on an island where an evil man called Maxwell puts you. The island is full of things that want to kill you, as well as resources, food and so on. Time counts in days, thus, you can see how long you've survived and try to beat your records. There's no achievements or such. Just follow the one and only rule, "Don't Starve", and you'll loose many hours in this amazingly, fantastic game.\n\n","November 28, 2013","true","162.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I honestly was not expecting that. That bad experience was not in vain, though. Now I know in my future lives not to chop trees at dawn (seriously, don't). This is a good example of how you must learn from your experiences in order to do well in this game. The only way to succeed is by trial and error, and although it can be extremely frustrating when you lose everything, that is kind of what makes the game fun; knowing such a fate is possible puts you on edge. Also, the mod support is amazing. Getting new mods is literally 3 clicks away, and you can then easily enable/disable them from a convenient menu at the main screen. This is truely a great survival game so buy it if you're in to that kind of stuff, and good luck.","May 5, 2014","true","16.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Reminds me of Minecraft's first few minutes/hours where you're scraping to stay alive, but this is harder, and more rewarding, minus the building for the most part.  The art style is great, very atmospheric and fun to watch.  Though no in-game instruction is given, the difficulty of picking up on how things work isn't bad, after a couple deaths, you'll know how to progress through the first few days.\n\nThat's my one gripe, dying starts you over, with no save game, it automatically deletes it for you.  This lends urgency to your quest to survive, which I like, but the first 3 days or so take half an hour, and there's not much variation in during that time, so it starts to feel a little repetitive.  But after that, there's tons of cool stuff, so it's a minor annoyance.  Also, to be fair, I wouldn't have to play those first three days so many times if I'd just follow the direction, "Don't Starve"","January 1, 2014","true","208.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If it was multiplayer, I would say go full price, but you should catch this when it is on sale.  It also includes a second game mode that is worth checking out that plays kind of like the "Slenderman" horror minigame.  It is challenging, at least in the beginning while you are trying to figure out how not to starve to death or get murdered by darkness.  The second character you unlock basically allows you to play endlessly, so if you want a good challenge, try skipping her.  Also, the game seems to ramp up difficulty the more days you survive, which I know sounds typical, but the game lends itself to a feeling of opening new areas for higher difficulty instead of time-based difficulty progression.\n-It plays like a point and click hack n slash in an open world, but no traditional rpg elements.\n-The art is cute and works well with the play-style.\n-Craft to survive.  Bang on a tree to get wood for a fire, build an axe or pick, even a snare to catch dinner.\n-If you have played DayZ, Rust or one of the other Survival Horror games, then that is what you can expect, but in an isometric, 2D environment which is a refreshing pov shift for a genre I enjoy.","January 18, 2014","true","7.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As the player you are dropped into the middle of a wilderness as Wilson (you unlock more characters as you play and survive for longer) and must survive by gathering resources, crafting and fighting monsters as well as your sanity.\n\nThe art style is incredibly unique and I'm very fond of the gothic look and feel it has. The gameplay is very easy to gain an understanding of, you simply point and click to pick up resources and click to interact with the world. But the difficulty comes when as the days progress and you come face to face with more challenging environments and creatures that don't like what you do.\n\nThing is, in Don't Starve, when you manage to kill certain creatures or you manage to survive past a certain amount of time, you feel like you've really accomplished something. For example, by killing Beefalo, which are incredibly tough very early on you will get great resources for future use which can help you go on for much much longer!\n\nThis game will constantly frustrate you at the beginning, but learning the game is massively rewarding!","December 29, 2014","true","34.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'd say this is pretty accurate. I dont think it was quite mentioned in the game description but if you die, then the game stops - you have some methods of resurrection but you have to be really careful in this game! :D\n\nYou will die many times before you start to get the hang of things. I've played 50 hours before I even decided to start Adventure mode..... so I thought I was going to find it quite easy to begin with. How wrong I was....\n\nI like this game for its difficulty and the random quotes you get when examining stuff! I wasn't expecting much, but it really is fun.\n\nUpdate @111hrs\n\nI can still easily spend all day playing this game and I still haven't mastered it! Half the time Im just fighting for survival that I can't get to explore the caves and stuff. Haha I guess I'm just bad at the game although I have managed to survive a few 100+ day games..\n\nI don't think my review does the game justice.

The graphics are very cool and dark and the sound effects are simply amazing. If you like games where you need to craft things in order to survive you will love Don't Starve. And for those who think don't starving is pretty easy, well think again, there are a lot of things that will try to kill you besides your hunger.\n\nPros:\n\n-Very Challenging\n-Adventure Mode is fun\n-Lots of craftables\n-Cool "bosses"\n-Sandbox mode is infinite\n\nCons:\n\n-Map is kinda confusing\n-You cannot write your signs, just put them on the ground\n-The 2Dish graphics along with the 3D camera shift may give you a hard time placing things where you actually want them to be\n-Some resources do not respawn and therefore will no longer be avaliable when you harvest them all\n\nWhat could they do to make it better?\n\n-Provide better ways to locate yourself and your items\n-The map should have the option to show a specific item or material according to filters\n-Make rocks respawn (the underground provides rocks but it's far too dangerous)\n-Develop a better way to turn the camera around","March 9, 2015","true","46.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Simply click on things, find out what they do, combine them with other things, and LEARN.  This game is brilliant in its simplicity and depth.  With each death, you learn a little bit more about how to survive for longer.  My only complaint is that once you figure out how to survive, the game can stagnate and become rather dull.  Sure, you can make up your own endgame goals, but I wish there was better endgame content.","July 4, 2014","true","23.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
