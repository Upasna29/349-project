This was the proper conglomerate simulator - you start off with a pile of cash and start setting up firms. You could choose to simply be an import shop that sold port goods to local cities, you could start vertically integrating up the manufacturing chain to source raw materials and build factories to get your product to market, you could start horizontally integrating to buy out your opponents and achieve 100% market share in various goods. If you don't know much about business this is a solid game for you - I believe some of the marketing spiel for this game talked about how it was used at Harvard Business to illustrate basic business concepts. At its time it was one of the most complex and enjoyable simulators on the market\n\nThere are lots of silly little simplifications for the model - all labor is paid the same whether or not they're cashiers at the department store or researchers in a R&D lab, for example. Your 'department stores' can only sell 4 things maximum. But hey, 20 year old DOS game.\n\nHere's hoping CapII makes it onto steam (much better UI), or better yet the guy who made the games makes a CapIII.\n\nEDIT: One sad thing about this game being on Steam and not on a box on a shelf is that the boxed shelf version came with a gigantic manual hundreds of pages long explaining how the business model in the game worked and how each firm and logical block in each firm interacted, as well as an enormous index of every product in the game and its supply chain and logistical requirements. It's all info you can get in game, of course, but that manual was something to behold way back when.","March 23","true","0.1"," 52 of 56 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","52","56","3","3"

In this detailed and realistic business simulation you can run a business however you want to make or lose as much money as you can.\n\nI played this when I was a young teenager when it first came out. Ended up going to business school and becoming an investor.  This game was relevant decades ago, and is still relevant today.  It should be mandatory for all kids to play this game, and indeed the game has been used in top business universities.  Some original reviews said it should come with an ‘MBA in the box’ as it covers management decisions for a wide range of business studies topics.\n\nWhereas Railroad Tycoon and A Train covered the railroad industry in excellent detail from a business aspect, this game covers instead raw material production (farming, chemicals, forestry, oil, gold mining, etc. are all included), manufacturing (do you want to make a car? nappy? coke? shampoo? Jewellery?, or, showing its game age – a VCR? – it’s all in the game, and much more), importing and retailing.  The game is very dynamic in that you are in the World with many competitors, each of them have their own aims and ambitions on the direction to take their company.  There are limited resources to compete for and a limited number of cities to compete in.\n\nThe game has very realistic business functions.  For each company you own you need to choose an organisational structure (you are limited to 9 departments and need to choose is the department a buying team? manufacturing team? sales team? inventory (warehouse)? labelling (for your brand)? advertising team? etc). You’ll need to choose which firm to advertise with in the city (TV or newspaper?) and how to price goods. Goods have a very dynamic supply and demand based on your pricing policy, competitors prices (both the large players and the local corner shops), your brand value v competitors, how much of a necessity a good is, etc.  So economic theory plays out in quite a detailed fashion here.  You need to make decisions about research and design to increase the quality of your goods and staff training too.\n\nDetailed and realistic finance mechanisms are included.  You get regularly updated profit and loss accounts and balance sheets for your company and all others.  All major competitors’ trade on the stock market and you can buy or sell their shares and even attempt to take them over and make tender offers for shares.  To help with this you get all the key ratios such as their company share price, equity per share, earnings per share, price/earnings ratio, dividend yield, etc.  And, yes, you have to set your own dividend yearly.\n\nWhat’s nice in this game is you have to manage both the company money, and your own personal money.  If you personally become rich enough (i.e. via share purchases and company ownership), you may even feature in the top 100 richest in the World list – but this is tough to achieve and not a cake walk - $2bn minimum entry.  So can you make it to be as rich as royalty, Warren Buffett or Bill Gates?  The names included on the list are realistic for the time the game was made.\n\nThere might be some negatives for some players – the game is a dos box game, so hopefully will work on your machine, the graphics are extremely dated (but you’ll be fully immersed in the gameplay to notice), and as the game is a few decades old you’ll need to put up with a few ancient products and images and understand that Gates and Buffett only had around a quarter of today’s wealth, back in the day.\n\nIf you love detailed business simulation games, simply, this is a ‘must buy classic’.  Afterwards, you’ll think it might just be possible to replicate the game in real life (if only you had $10m starting funds, after doing a MBA at 25, as per the opening scenario)!  Buy, buy, buy this investment!","March 26","true","17.6"," 22 of 22 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","22","22","2","5"

This was my go-to game for a couple of years.\n\nHere's what I like most about this game..using bullet statements for clarity.\n\n--This is a deep, complex economic simulation, that remains accessible and playable.\n--With more than 60 product types, there is room to try a number of different strategies..a virtual unlimited combination of products to develop and sell\n--The research for each product adds a new dimension to the game. Building crappy sweaters? Research the production technology for sweaters, and increase the overall value.\n-- ... or increase the spending on brand awareness, and increase the overall value of the sweaters.\n-- ... or research better farming technology, and develop higher quality wool\n-- ... or increase the training in your sweater factory, and lower the price of the sweater, and still make the same profit by increasing the number sold\n-- ... or increase the training of the department stores that sell it, or better still build an apparel store downtown, and be more efficient in selling the sweater\n-- ... or simply purchase lower quality sweaters from the seaports, slap your new label on them, restrict the brand for your crap sweaters so as to not eff up your other brands, and make a TON of money\n\nThis is just a small sampling of the actions YOU can take in capitalism plus.\n\nHere's another example..one I highly recommend you use, to start your new empire. Look for a timber stand, under 5 million dollars. Buy it, and set up a logging operation. Set up a factory immediately next door to the timber stand, and build beds. All it takes is wood, and this will decrease the transportation costs.  once you are making beds, build a store in the city nearest to the factory, and start selling them. Adjust the selling price to maintain a competitive edge over the local competition, and you're set. Over time, as you gain additional monies, increase your production of beds, and sell them to all of the cities in the game. This will take a year or two.\n\nThen, you can branch out, by setting up leather as the next resource, using farms. Leather and wood? Furniture...and this would strongly complement your other industries. You will even be able to make them in the same factory.\n\nI could go on at a great length on how absorbing and immersive this outstanding game is. I can recall games where every tick to the next day gave me MILLIONS of dollars, where I had 10 enormous research facilities researching all KINDS of products, and were the decision to attempt to break into a mature market for a new product took YEARS of game time to set up.\n\nGREAT game...this is a must-buy, one that I just cannot recommend highly enough.","April 20","true","0.3"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

The tutorials are great and easy to follow, which helps combat the enourmous learning curve of the game. You are a buisness mogul who has to start firms either importing, manufacturing or exporting goods to make a profit. At the same time, you must face stiff competition and always strive to improve the quality of your products to make it easier to compete(or just lower the price xd)\n","April 4","true","5.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I loved Capitalism 2 and jumped at the chance to own it on steam.\n\nBad choice.  the layout is totally different from Cap 2.. it's more difficult to navigate and information that should be at your fingertips are scattered all over the place.\n\ndon't even try to alt-tab out of the game for a second.. when you switch back it will turn into a small box in the corner of your monitor with no way to maximize it.  you can go to display settings and you will have the option to change your corp. logo and color and character photo but nothing at all to do with actual display settings.\n\nAll in all seems slapped together and really poorly planned.   I would not recommned buying Capitalism plus, try to find an old copy of Capitalism 2.","May 22","false","7.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"
