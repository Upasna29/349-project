Do note: it is certainly more reminiscent of other trajectory-based games, like Angry Birds, rather than any other actual golf games.  If you like silly, simple, trajectory-based puzzle games then you will probably find this enjoyable.\n\nTo keep things fresh and crazy as you play, different in-level obstacles and utilities (explosive sheep, cannons, teleporters, and such) make appearances in the various levels.  There are also unlockable power-ups which you can equip and use to manipulate the movement of the golf ball.  Using these things, you will find there are various ways to solve each level.\n\nBesides just beating the par (in strokes), there are also 20 coins and 1 crate to be collected in each level.  You collect the items by causing the golf ball to move through them.  Everything is cumulative, and you can take as many strokes as you need to collect everything.  So with time and patience you can easily collect everything without having to worry about hitting a wall due to skill level.  There is also a score threshold to beat on each level, which can be reached by taking crazy shots with a lot of airtime and that cause many explosions and such.  There is an achievement for completing all objectives on every course (minus the DLC course).\n\nOf course, there are some minor annoyances inherent in the gameplay.  For example, I found it mildly obnoxious that some of the animations couldn’t be skipped; most of them only last a few seconds, but over the course of playing it starts to get old having to wait after every shot before you can take the next one.\n\nWorms Crazy Golf is a very casual game.  Once you have access to the power-ups, it’s pretty easy to ace every level with a “hole-in-one.”  The pleasure of the game comes from its silly, easy nature, so don’t expect mind-bending puzzles.  Anticipate approximately 5 hours of gameplay to “beat” each course; if you want to complete all objectives on each course, then that number will probably rise exponentially.  If it sounds like something you would enjoy, get it for a price you are comfortable with and give it a shot.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","July 30, 2015","true","4.6"," 47 of 54 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","47","54","0","0"

I've played golf maybe 10 times or so in real life.  I picked up the game on a humble bundle.\n\nThis is one sweet game.  You have 4 18 hole courses to play in a 2d platform style.  You choose your club from a driver, iron, wedge or putter, each behave differently and choose your angle and how much power to swing it.\n\nYou have a few different objectives, you need at least a Par to progress, although later with powerups its common to get hole in ones.  You will need a great mix of strategy, powerups, planning, and luck to get it right.\n\nThere are 20 coins per level you can collect, these help you to buy other clubs, hats, balls, voices etc.  There is one crate on each level which is needed to help unlock items.  There is also a requirement to get a certain number of points, however this becomes the easiest/lamest to achieve.  If you get a hole in one, you get this straight away.  However in earlier levels I just aimed straight up and hit the ball out of the map repeatedly/or into the sea and got my skill score.\n\nGetting all of these challenges on the normal levels will take some planning, but nothing is impossible.  Sometimes you need to wait till you unlock an ability later.\n\nThere are some seperate challenge maps, eg the "chip in" challenge.  If you get the ball on the green you get extra time in your countdown.  If you get it in the hole you get more time.  The "keep up" challenges are quite fun, you get only one shot and have to use land mines and other objects on the map to keep the ball moving as many times as possible, you can only choose one powerup to use until it runs out.\n\nMost of the achievements in this game will pop normally just playing the game.\n\nThe best thing about this game, it was always fun, even when I was just smashing the ball straight up in the air.   A great casual game if you have 5 minutes or 2 hours.","November 11, 2013","true","45.3"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

Trying to blow each other up like they normally spend their time doing.. It is an odd change of pace, but that doesn't make it bad.. I found this game rather charming, really.\n\nWorms Crazy Golf is a game that takes the classic Worms system and combines it with golf to make a rather strange, if interesting, hybrid of 2D golf sim, where players try their best to smack a ball all the way to the hole in as few hits as possible, while trying to avoid more Wormish hazards such as mines, sheep, and even grumpy grannies, in time earning items that help make getting that tricky hole-in-one easier.\n\nA game about 2D golf might not seem all that interesting at first, but once you give it a wack you find a humble pleasure playing this simple little game. Sadly, as fun as it can be at times, it does suffer from a flaw or two that holds it back from being a rather enjoyable game in the long run.\n\nFor 10 dollars, the content the game packs is rather meh, a decent player able to beat the game in a few hours. It might have some form of replay value, but it is rather humble in that area.\n\nTo make matters worst, the game suffers from an awkward balancing issue, being that one of the powers (Reverse Gravity) is by far the most broken item in the game. Upon earning it for the first time, it doesn't take a player long to realise that he can abuse it to get easy holes in one for EVERY course in the game.. I am serious about that, it takes all challege out of a nice little golf game, so if you are the kind of person who seeks a challenge, I suggest you avoid using it if you don't want to spoil your fun. For the egotist, however, it certainly does satisfy the desire for easy glory.\n\nI suggest you wait for the game to go on sale for 5 bucks or so before getting the game. It is fun and all, but clearly not worth the current price offered.","October 31, 2014","true","6.7"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Never expected to see a 'Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour' -type of game on PC.  In fact i expected this game to either be a turd or something you need a hefty amount of nostalgia to play.  Turns out nostalgia is not required and game stands on it's own and is done with high production values.  And it's a good but whacky PC equivalent of the before mentioned legendary Mario game that is valid and fun even today 11 years after it's release.\n\nSo what's it like? Well it has got to do with 'real' golf as much as Elin Nordegren has got to do with Professional  Golfing in the real world and that ain't much - except for collecting lots of gold coins, stuff from crates and generally being an ♥♥♥ on the golf field and hitting on everyone.\n\nAll levels go approx. the same: first get a score under par to unlock next level. after that you can just go nuts and try to collect and break everything on the level until you get them all.  Doing objectives unlocks stuff you can buy from the shop to 'accessorize' your worm player.  As you progress element hazards such as wind is introduced but you get special items such as rocket boost.  Very realistic yes?","August 19, 2014","true","2.7"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

With simple but customisable golf playing mechanics, you putt your balls through some endearing 2d cartoony worlds and imagery.\n\nWorms Crazy Golf isn't going to set the world on fire. It's the game you play after spending all day playing those AAA amazements and that indie darling you love so much. So whilst it's a nice casual game, it's still a freakin' casual game.","January 10, 2015","true","30.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The soundtrack is just so soothing it's impossible for me not to have fun. Also worms playing golf is an interesting concept, I like it. It's nice with something different from timing grenades and firing  bazookas against the wind :) The golf courses has multiple ways to be completed, there's also many different ways to play. You can either try to collect everything, get the ball in with lowest hits or both at the same time. I also love how the courses are themed and that there's objects which interact with the ball. There's also power ups.\n\nOverall I like this game and would give it a solid 10/10.

After progressing through the levels the golf ball gets upgrades, which the player can choose from.

At all. If you think this is golf then your gonna be very disapointed. This is a puzzle game. I suppose Puzzle Golf or Puzzle Putter would have been off putting so they put crazy golf. The only thing crazy is people paying $10 dollar for this game.\n\nIts annoying. Let me count the ways. Golf is a game played for a score and each hole is added up at the end and then you have a total score. That is normal golf. Normal golf. This game is not normal golf so  you play the hole, so if you dont get par you must replay the hole again. So thats a negative. The other issue is where the ball is gonna end up at. I have no idea because the game doesnt bother telling you where the ball will end up. So thats annoying. The game explains power ups but doesn give you any!! Thats very annoying. The game could be fun however it ends up feeling like a chore your made to do. Colorful graphics and great sound. The game is ruined by poor mechanics.  Its sad because I was so looking forward to playing this and the more I play the less I want to play.

Now, I know absolutely nothing about golf, and I'm sure I never will, but it looked fun. And it certainly is. It has the turn based gameplay of previous Worms games. Of course, there are no weapons, but there are ways to kill stuff. There's a lot of replay value and there's more than enough challenge. After the first 'world' it can get pretty difficult even. Still, it never frustrates and rounds only last a couple of minutes.

You're looking at the future game of the year, 15 years from now (maybe)! Let me give you a little background. This game, Worms Crazy Golf, is the spiritual successor to Winnie the Pooh's Home Run Derby (See here : http://www.gamesloon.com/free-sports-12/baseball-games-16/winnie-the-pooh-home-run-derby-54790.html ) and let me just say, it revamps everything. First of all, it features little butterfly characters who just want to learn how to walk. Secondly, the game shifted from Home Run Derby (Baseball) to this, Worms Crazy Golf, which is Hockey based. If you like sports, watching sports, washing sports, swatting sports, etc, you should probably go be active and play Solitaire.

The players has a task to hit the ball into the hole - like in any golf games. During the flight of the ball player can control it by using spin control or one of six abilities - we can Slow the game, explode the ball to get higher, Parachute it, Reverse the Gravity, make the ball heavy as Cannon Ball or bouncy like a beach ball.\n\nEvery time you start a hole, you must first take at how many pars you need to move to the next hole (eg. In hole with 5 pars you need to perform at least 5 shoots, otherwise you can get a Bogey). All in all there are 72 normal holes. There's also a challenges which engage on such tasks as destroying the targets or keeping the ball in motion as long as possible.\n\nCrazy Golf looks beautiful. Fact that is a graphics from Reloaded, but nothing makes me not enjoy to this 2D World. A lots of humor - that I like in any games.\n\nIn addition of lack of online multiplayer the only thing I would accuse is the optimization during the spinning the ball. Without using this skill the game runs smoothly, but when I want to direct the ball using spinning, game go down to 14 FPS. Let me add also that some content - such as hats, voices or balls - are unlocked only by collecting crates sometimes hidden in places where is hard to get in first shot.\n\nOverall, a game almost pleasant (if a player is upset for penalties). Better it's not to give to Worms Fan who loves playing this series online because it's absence, but for me it is a nice "relaxing" game. If you have enough an old turn-based Worms games, but you want to play an another game that isn't a strategy, go buying it.","February 11, 2014","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Golf with a Worms twist. Not sure if it's worth the asking price, but I got it on sale, so it was definitely worth the price I paid. My only real complaint is that you have to unlock each consecutive hole by shooting a par or better before they let you move on.\n\nI can understand having to unlock the extra courses but unlocking the holes kind of takes the fun out of the game. Part of the challenge of golf is trying to make up for a poor showing on one hole by doing better on the next. They rob you of that opportunity by forcing you to repeat each hole until you "pass" it. Kind of lame, in my opinion.\n\nOverall, it's a worthy title, though.","July 19, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fun, addicting game, where we fight with each... oh, sorry, wait, that's a wrong Worms game. Worms game where you don't try out your skills against your friends or online? Is that a joke?\n\nI had mixed feelings about this kind of Worms game. I mean, there is a pinball game, there is a puzzle one and... golf. To be honest I don't remember how two first were like but even so I tried to have fun with Worms playing golf. How was it? It was not so bad, better than I expected. Beating each of levels is fun, every next hole gets harder and harder until you get this gravity bonus. Honestly, it destroyed kind of fun for me - using this "overpowered" skill you can beat most of holes in one shoot. It would be better to get it after beating all of levels. It's nice to have a local multiplayer option, it's a great game if you want to play together with your younger siblings or some more distant family on family gatherings. It's also full of Worms humour, so if you love it you won't be disappointed.\n\nIt could have a few more levels, and be a little bit harder, but maybe it's not that kind of game where difficulty matter but simply fun from playing golf... as Worms. I still prefer good old Worms games but sometimes having a different genre game in whole franchise can be a good thing. And Worms Crazy Golf count as this good thing.","July 13, 2015","true","24.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For what it is, it’s highly polished, with great optimisation, visuals achieving a fantastic level of detail, music complimenting the theme of each course, and solid gameplay mechanics that deliver consistency as well as playability. Course design is mostly a success, and encourages risky play - hitting a ball at top speed against a solid wall high above you, for it to bounce back off towards the platform opposite and come to a stop inches away from the flagpost, is a satisfying experience, albeit one that grows old quickly. The game features achievements, which is a great incentive to play, but collecting all 29 of them will probably prove too tedious for all but the most dedicated gamers.\n\nThink of it as the Worms variant of Windows Solitaire - fun to play idly for a few minutes, then you’ll want to shut it down and do something else.","December 2, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Either you enjoy the Worms series and/or enjoy mini-golf games. It features 4 full courses with a good variety in level design and difficulty. I won’t go into this point much, as like other mini-golf games, there will be traps, obstacles and power ups along your way to creatively finish the hole and gather all the collectibles.\n\nCollectibles! Each hole has 4 objectives. Collect all the coins, get par or better (required to unlock the next hole), collect the crate and get a high score (usually more than 100k). Figure that in to 72 holes and that’s a lot of collectibles. It does provide a good challenge and gives the game some replay value as far as single player is concerned.\n\nYou can either play by yourself or up to 4 people in local co-op (sitting at the same computer). There is no LAN option for multiplayer.\n\nI think it’s worth saying they put out an entire course as free DLC. Always nice to see that.\n\nI had two minor complaints that I’ll expand on.\n\nFirst was the constant zoom in on the player at the start of each hole and also during different strokes. The default camera is too close so I had to constantly zoom out so I could see where I was going on any particular hole. I wish it either saved your zoom level or had a slider option for “default zoom level”.\n\nSecond were the animations between shots. Where your worm would either scoot over to the ball or be transported. These became fairly annoying to sit through constantly. I would have loved an option to either speed these up or disable them. It would have made gameplay much faster. This is especially noticeable when playing a multiplayer game.\n\n\nOn to the pros/cons\n\nPros\n+Graphics are nice, sharp and vibrant. Scales well to 1440p\n+Smooth 60fps throughout\n+Fun courses, well designed\n+Good multiplayer (local co-op only)\n+Replay value\n+Collectibles to extend game length\n+Free DLC\n\nCons\n+Music & sound effects repetitive\n+Zoom reset after each hole and after some strokes\n+Animations between shots are slow\n\nThis is a great, casual game you can pick up if you or your friends are bored. The $10 asking price isn’t too bad considering the replay value is there with multiplayer support and if you want to complete all the holes 100% it will take a good amount of time.\n\n8/10\n","January 6","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Golf with a Worms twist. Not sure if it's worth the asking price, but I got it on sale, so it was definitely worth the price I paid. My only real complaint is that you have to unlock each consecutive hole by shooting a par or better before they let you move on.\n\nI can understand having to unlock the extra courses but unlocking the holes kind of takes the fun out of the game. Part of the challenge of golf is trying to make up for a poor showing on one hole by doing better on the next. They rob you of that opportunity by forcing you to repeat each hole until you "pass" it. Kind of lame, in my opinion.\n\nOverall, it's a worthy title, though.","July 19, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fun, addicting game, where we fight with each... oh, sorry, wait, that's a wrong Worms game. Worms game where you don't try out your skills against your friends or online? Is that a joke?\n\nI had mixed feelings about this kind of Worms game. I mean, there is a pinball game, there is a puzzle one and... golf. To be honest I don't remember how two first were like but even so I tried to have fun with Worms playing golf. How was it? It was not so bad, better than I expected. Beating each of levels is fun, every next hole gets harder and harder until you get this gravity bonus. Honestly, it destroyed kind of fun for me - using this "overpowered" skill you can beat most of holes in one shoot. It would be better to get it after beating all of levels. It's nice to have a local multiplayer option, it's a great game if you want to play together with your younger siblings or some more distant family on family gatherings. It's also full of Worms humour, so if you love it you won't be disappointed.\n\nIt could have a few more levels, and be a little bit harder, but maybe it's not that kind of game where difficulty matter but simply fun from playing golf... as Worms. I still prefer good old Worms games but sometimes having a different genre game in whole franchise can be a good thing. And Worms Crazy Golf count as this good thing.","July 13, 2015","true","24.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
