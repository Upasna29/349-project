As a Kickstarter of this application, I have stood aghast at the bungling and terrible decisions made one after another with the rollout of every version and bug-filled update.  This PC version runs WORSE than my earliest Android beta, everything chunking along at 5 or so FPS, glitchy menus, etc...  stay away for now.  The core gameplay is good.  The card game it's based on is excellent.  This piece of software, however, is an unfortunate pile of garbage.","December 17, 2014","false","1.4"," 108 of 131 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","108","131","2","4"

Man was it a disappointment.\n\nIn a nutshell - this is a straight up port of the iPad/Andriod version of the game with little to no thought around compatibility or running state (visual/audio options).\nIt has been a waste of money, if you have to have it i highly suggest waiting for the steam sales to see if it appears.","December 17, 2014","false","2.9"," 76 of 98 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","76","98","0","1"

The handful of mediocre reviews plus the idea of playing without dealing with the card layout pushed me into buying. I was very surprised by how well it played after reading the reviews. I've played the physical game, but not the mobile versions. All in all, I've had no crashes and no difficulties with the interface after a few experimentations.\n\nThe tutorial teaches the game, but it does not do the greatest in illustrating how to interact with the game. One example is when choosing which construct to banish, it's unclear if the chosen card kept or banished. Some times the card can be dragged to the discard pile (or draw pile if that mechanic is appropriate). For the complaints about card readability, right-clicking on the card will present it front and center. Left-clicking will return to normal play. For the issue of menus not retracting (ie. opponent menu and "discard from hand" menu), left-clicking on an open space on the menu or the discard pile, respectively, will return to normal play. Worst case, ESCape to the menu and select the "return arrow" at the bottom left.\n\nThe game does not go full screen, but it does play at a decent resolution. For me, it's far from a deal breaker. The main improvement I could recommend is adding a more robust tutorial to cover the interface. The best part is, it's a minor technical limitation that can be overcome after a few matches.","April 20, 2015","true","10.5"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","0"

It's one of best deckbuilding games out there!  Which is why it pains me to give a negative review about the PC version.  Unfortunately, this is a port that just shouldn't have been made.  I have had a long negative history with stoneblade, so I winced when I saw they were behind this atrocity of a port.\n\nJust be warned if you are considering a purchase: The game crashes A LOT! Mine does so 1/3 games.  To the point where I questioned my PC, but after reading that everyone is having the same issue, it was pretty clear.  Stoneblade is notorious for ignoring their customer base, so it is highly unlikely we will ever see a hotfix or update to the game to correct the issues.  The game does save where you are in a game if it does match, but unfortunately, every time you log back in and pick up where you leave off, it crashes again.  The port is just, unfortunately, BROKEN.\n\nThe port COULD HAVE been great, but sadly, it is very far from.  I strongly recommend to fans of the game to save your money until a fix or update is released.  It will save you a LOT of frustration.","January 7, 2015","false","46.3"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

I know friends who have the app, and I've been waiting for the PC version for a while now. I have to say, I don't understand the amount of negative comments. The game works just like the card game, and I never experienced any lag or shutdowns, or a lot of anything that puts me off of this game. I will say that the clicking needs to be more precise in the play area, for cards like "Copy a hero's effect that you played this turn." Long combo turns and energy shards tend to build up, and I've selected a card I didn't want to a few times now. Right-clicking first is really the only way to combat this, to make sure the card selected is the one you want. Other than that, I haven't found any other issues with this game.\n\nEdit: I forgot about one more thing, but it's not a huge deal for me. I would like volume controls for the BGM and sound effects. They're fairly loud, so I tend to play with both off.","May 9, 2015","true","35.4"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

How could a company like Playdek that has made quality game after quality game on iOS actually release this steaming pile? I am appalled. The game runs at about 5FPS and is low rez and ugly. Sad.

It's a fun strategic drafting/deck-building game that rewards well-thought out strategies which change from game to game.\n\nThis game is terrible.  It is a buggy hot mess.  Other reviews have stated that this is a warmed over version of the buggy app and that would explain a lot... but not why Playdek has decided to drop this pile on us just in time for the holidays!\n\nHere's some constructive criticism:\n\nResolution.  The game won't expand to fit my screen and I find myself straining to see different cards.  Come on guys.  This is just terrible.  What PC game doesn't have a full screen mode?  And one where I might be able to actually read the cards without having to zoom them.  This convinces me that I spent $10 on a half-finished mobile phone app instead of an actual game.\n\nControls.  Counter-intuitive and and mostly terrible.   I find myself clicking on and buying cards I really didn't want to buy and banishing stuff I would have liked to keep.\n\nLots of random bugs.  First time I've had to pay for an open alpha test of a game.  Any chance playdek actually tried fixing these before dropping this directly onto our faces?  For their sakes, I hope they didn't because its just terrible.\n\nOnline games.  Wow.  Ok... where to begin.  You can't talk to people, it's hard to get games together and everyone seems intent on watching cat videos instead of playing the game.  How hard is it to make a customizable timer?  10 minutes is too few, 30 minutes is perhaps too long for people afking... 15-20 minute timers sound ideal, unless you're Playdek.  I guess the care-o-meter just ran too low at the end of development time and we get stuck alpha testing a mobile app on our PCs.\n\nIt's a deeply frustrating experience, which is sad because the underlying game is really fun and has so much potential.\n\nTLDR: Avoid this unless you really like squinting at your computer and testing for glitches.","December 22, 2014","false","70.3"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","1"

How does the Steam port compare? Well, when I initially started playing, the bugs/glitches were pretty rough. Those seem to be being ironed out as it goes; I've noticed several things that have been fixed since I started playing  in December 2014. As far as the game itself goes, I find it extremely appealing: it's much easier to play on Steam than on our table (and much less to clean up!) and also is a great way to play with friends and family long distance. All the expansions prior to Realms Unravelled are available without additional cost, including four promotion packs. You can mix or match as you choose. My only current complaint is the lack of chat in the online multiplayer, though to be honest this is not entirely a bad thing.

The PC version includes most of the IAP/expansions from the iOS version.\n\niOS version is better. Buy that first, but if you don't have iOS device, this is pretty good.\n\n-----\n\nEveryone else - so what's a deckbuilder game? It's a card game kind of like that "Magic: the Gathering" collectible card game if you remember that, except it's not as complicated and there's no need to buy packs of cards and collect them all or whatever. I've never played a game like this, and after the tutorial and a game or two I understood it. To this day, I have not the foggiest what my friend who used to go to Magic tournaments or my cousin with the Yu-gi-oh was doing.\n\nAll the cards come in the same game package, so both players (or up to 4 if you're using some of the expansions) have an equal chance to make a good deck and play each other. Each game is about 15 minutes. Lots of fun solo or with other players!\n\nCons: As some reviews have noted, the resolution is fixed. This is pretty common on iOS ports. It doesn't particularly bother me, because I usually play these kind of games windowed while checking my e-mail and browsing reddit and such, but it does bother some people, so FYI. The stability is not as good as the iOS version, but it's still pretty good. Netcode is nowhere near as good as iOS version.\n\n*Buy now* (esp while on-sale).\n\n-----\n\nFYI, each game "expansion" (all of the ones released as IAP on iOS are included on steam) is released in "blocks" composed of 2 sets a piece (one large set and its expansion set), so this is really multiple games or game variants, not just one. It's more fun playing that way than with "all cards" on, though some people do that.\n\nFor reference the blocks are as follows:\n\nBlock 1 - Godslayer (the main game) + Return of the Fallen\nBlock 2 - Storm of Souls + Immortal Heroes\nBlock 3 - Rise of Vigil + Darkness Unleashed\n----\nBlock 4 - Realms Unraveled + Dawn of Champions\n\nBlock 4 is a little different because the "expansion" has as many cards as the main game now\n\nP.S.

If you end up getting this game, you'll get it.\n\nHOLD ON TO YOUR BUTTS, THERE'S MORE:\n\nI still think the best way to play this game is with friends, giving eachother the glare of death for taking that Lifebound Hero you needed for the Unite trigger (sick ♥♥♥ card synergy) ending the bittersweet night of misfortunate draws, but beginning your month-long plot that ends with introducing his/her mother's birth canal to pleasure it has long since forgotten, then never returning her calls.\n\nThis rendetion of Ascension, however, isn't worth it. For a few less dollars on the Android or iOS market you can have a smoother experience. It's even free for just the base game. I had hoped that when they brought this gem to Steam we'd see something new, something kickass. Instead, we're getting a port of a great mobile game on to the PC (only). I don't want to spill r/pcmasterrace ink all over this review, but this game just doesn't cut it for $10. Praise Gaben.\n\nTL;DR - Wait for the Steam sale on this one.","December 16, 2014","false","0.2"," 51 of 96 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","51","96","0","2"

The only problem is that the "Realms Unraveled" expansion isn't available, but I figured that's not an issue. And it isn't, the game is pretty nice. Overall, I am happy with it. I just hope that Playdeck, who makes the game, consitnues to support and expand it on the PC.\n\nHere are my pros and cons:\n\nPROSGameplay is quick and faithful to the board game\nAll expansions and promos except for the latest (Realms Unraveled) are included\nOnce registered with Playdeck for online play you can play cross-platform (I played my son from my PC to his Android tablet earlier, worked great).\nGreat for helping you learn the overall game mechanics\nGreat way to learn the specific cards and nuances of the different expansions so you don't embarass yourself in front of your friends\nOnline matchmaking is pretty good, though it doesn't use Steam.\nCONSPorted from mobile devices and it shows:\nNo sliders controls for volume\nNo resolution options, only a window or full screen\nFull screen is 4:3 (not widescreen)\nGraphics do not scale well to PC monitorsBuggy at times. Example is when you have a card you purchase from center row that you can put in hand/desk it freezes.\nWhen something triggers an event, it is not always clear what you are supposed to do. Example, if you have to destroy all constructs but one, do you select the one you keep or destroy? This is not consistent throughout the game.\nI am also concerned that Playdeck is very focused on mobile and might not keep the PC version up-to-date, but only time will tell if that is true. Despite those cons, I really do enjoy the game and hope that they release the new expansion for it and keep updating and improving the game.\n\ntl;dr\nGood game if you like Ascension and want to play some more or learn the game, but it does have some issues.\n\n","January 3, 2015","true","20.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I have been playing the board game (physical copy) for about 4 years and I am pretty obsessed with it. I own every physical standalone and expansion and and I also have them all on android as well.\n\nI usually ALWAYS read reviews for PC games but seeing what the makers of Ascension have done with the physical games and playdek with the mobile platform I did not hesitate...the moment I heard that it came out I went to steam and purchased it no questions asked. That being said, what Playdek has released for PC is complete garbage. There is literally no other way to describe it.\n\nWhat I expected: Full screen resolution, crisp graphics, high resolution card art, smooth animation transitions. I was so excited to fire up the game and play it on my 27" monitor with my friends...\n\nWhat I got: Garbage. The game was obviously ported from mobile app to PC which is like porting an original NES game to  PS4 retaining its 16bit gfx. Its literally a square box that takes up 1/8th of my screen, if you toggle "full screen" you just laugh because it "stretches" the resolution into a bigger square and makes it look like the game was designed in Microsoft Paint. You can barely read the cards...and the animation of the cards moving around, going into play, discarding etc. is horrendous. Its sooooo choppy and laggy it is obnoxious. Explain to me how a game runs this choppy on an Intel i7 with 16gb of ram, and a top notch Nvidia card...Oh...and its installed on an SSD...YOU CANT EXPLAIN IT...it just points purely to HORRIBLE design.\n\nLet's talk about the kickstarter for a moment. My best friend pledged a stupid amount of money for Ascension Online...to the point of him *someday* receiving the entire physical edition in a carved wooden box and every card a foil edition. Well since then they tried to cheapen up the carved wooden box and oh...its been like 2+ years and he still has nothing...then THIS IS WHAT THEY RELEASE?? They made it sound like Playdek was out and they were working with a newer company to release this amazing online version of the platform that was going to blow everyone away...NOT A MOBILE TO PC PORT!\n\nHow can they make a game like Solforge and then put this crap out. Playdek if you are going to continue to make crap like this then just say so. Take a look at HEX, take a look at Hearthstone...this is what people EXPECT out of an online card game and honestly in the Kickstarter Stoneblade made it sound like it was going to be comparable to the aformentioned games.\n\nThis is a joke. This is not a PC game, this is an insult. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME until IF and WHEN they actually put out a respectable product.","December 24, 2014","false","0.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

The PC version (dec 2014) doesn't offer features like custom cubes (modifying the available cards in the central deck, atm only allows you to pick the set, not the individual cards and qty of them). This is a low tech game. There are some bugs but overall it performs well enough.

The friends mechanic is a little clunky. There are a few bugs (notably nook-hound which, if you click the wrong place will be unable to complete the discard effect untill you go to the lobby and back to the game.)\n\nThat said, the ability to play multiple games at once, somewhat like playing facebook chess with a timer keeps the action flowing.

It was an utter lack in motivation to read any type of review or, nay, do any research at all about the game based on pure blind faith that if an electronic version of this game is $10, it HAS to be good.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DoctorTeo/recommended/320430/","DoctorTeo","Doctor Teo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DoctorTeo/","613 products in account","A game reminiscent of deck-building games such as Dominion with a little bit of Magic.\n\nThe premisce is pretty simple: you have a deck with money and heroes. Using money, you buy more money or heroes and shuffle them back into your deck; when your deck runs out, you reshuffle it and draw from your new deck, hoping to utilize the new cards you've added in to earn victory points. Hero cards are the 'action' cards with special effects, with a good slew of heroes adding attack power which lets you defeat monster cards with their own slew of special effects as well as adding victory points of their own. The goal is to strike the right balance of money and heroes (and constructs) so that you can score victory points as fast as possible.\n\nThough the idea is simple enough, the execution is a bit tougher. There are hundreds of cards across about a dozen 'expansions' and trying to learn them all requires quite the learning curve. You do not have to play with all the expansions at once, and you are able to limit how many are in play at once - some would argue this makes the game better, as expansions have cards that work with each other within expansions, but not always out of expansions. Fortunately, you can zoom in on cards to read their effects as well as being able to use offline practice to warm up.\n\nThis is actually a pretty in-depth and strong game, so readers may be wondering why the overall review is so mixed, and it isn't hard to see why. The game is plagued by a few bugs, including one that occurs whenever a card gives you one of two options; the card will instead freeze, and leave you unable to select it until you quit and come back.\n\nThe interface is also a bit questionable. A card will sometimes request an action from you, but it will be unclear what that action is (unless you know the card). Card text is very small, making things hard to check without zooming in. There are a lot of functions, including checking through discard piles and opponent's face-up constructs, but you'd never guess the options were there by the way the game is laid out.\n\nLastly, there is no fullscreen button. This is a detriment, as it would solve the problem of text being too small, and overall make the game easier to focus on.\n\nHowever, while the game makes faults in terms of its UI and has a few bugs, the game itself is interesting and stands strong. It's not as personal as playing in real life where you can check what cards an opponent has or ask questions (no chat system), but having auto-shuffles and quick play are good advantages of playing an E-card game. In fact, for all the UI's faults, there are virtually no loading times of ANY kind, allowing one to jump from game to game with incredible ease.\n\nLesser games have gotten paned for sloppy presentation, but the gameplay of Ascension is strong enough that I can recommend this game. However, it is best to play with a friend: card games, even online, are hardly fun alone.","January 5, 2015","true","22.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is based off the popular (real) card game and translates well into the digital world.  The object of the game is basically to acquire powerful cards to help you gather points(called honor in this game) and get rid of your weak starting cards at the same time.\n\nI can at the present time recommend this game for anyone interested in these types of games as the developer has slowely delivered extra free content and fixed bugs and other issues.  I wish there was more support and contact between the developer and fanbase but it can't all be perfect.\n\nPros:\n- Based on a great board game and some matches can be fun to play\n- Decent multiplayer system that allowslets you play a game against other people at your leisure (you can set timer for quick games that last minutes or others that last days) and it also allows you to play multiple games at once.\n- Developer has delivered expansions for the game 6 months after release as well as fixed some very game breaking bugs.\n\nCons:\n- AI is not very good at all.  AI can be very one dimensional at times and is not very good at building a good deck\n- No options to set resolutions and other things.  The options menu is very basic\n- No volume options.  You either have music or sounds effects off or on.  I like to play with Sound Effects on but since there is no volume slider I can't play music over the game.\n- I mentioned the multiplayer system is very nice, but the layout is very clunky.  Wish it was easier to switch between games and play other games.  Maybe some sort of sound bit, or notification on bottom of screen when opponent in other only game has taken a turn.  Currently that is all guesswork.\n- Lack of updates.  Although I praised their ability to roll out free new content and fix the worst of the bugs there are still many other bugs that have not been addressed.  A few of the achievements have been broken since Day 1.\n- LAG during AI turns.  Sometimes when the AI has its turn it slows down for no discernable reason and it can take the AI very long to complete its turn.  This problem has been ongoing since release and there has been nothing done to address the issue.\n\nEDITED Feb 25th 2015: The game has now been out for 2+ months and there has been very little communication with the developers about the future of this game.  There are posts asking on the forum whether the title has been abandoned.  There was an update released in January about 1 month after release that fixed a few issues, but also created just as many new ones.  The developers are only now asking for feedback after 1 month of this update to fix issues.  I do believe all these issues will eventually be ironed out but it will probably take another 4-6 months.\n\nEDITED Jun 25th 2015:  The game has now been out for 6+ months.  There have been a few updates to the game since my last update as well as the addition of a free new expansion.  I've changed my review from negative to positive even though there are still issues that have not been addressed since release.","December 24, 2014","true","277.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

It's a port from mobile platforms, and thus does not have the options that a real PC version needs (such as being able to set your screen resoultion).  But, barring a few unusual circumstances, the game does function well.  You can play it online with friends in a turn-based version, even if your friends use iOS or Android.  You can play it alone vs computer players with a couple difficulty settings.  You can play local multi-player, with a pause between players for hot seat action.  It comes with three large sets, three smaller expansions, and four promo sets.\n\nReally, a majority of the complaints stem from the fact that it's a port and not designed for PC users well.  But the fact that it's a port means it does actually run pretty well.  For most of the game play circumstances, you won't really notice any problems.  The problems that DO exist, they are trying to correct, but it's not in the most timely of fashions.\n\nI do still recommend this game though, if you like deckbuilding games.  It's very fun, very flexible, and great to play with friends - even if it can take weeks to finish one game.","March 7, 2015","true","130.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You get 6 full expansions and the promo cards so you are saving well over $100 vs the physical copies of the game.  Gameplay is interesting you are competing for valor which you can gain by building your army and defeating enemy monsters.   Strategically this means that some cards can have limited functionality but be worth many victory points while others may be worth few victory points to begin with but the abilities can help you buy cards or defeat monsters earning victory over time.\n\nMany of the sets are playable on their own letting you switch up if you get bored playing the base set.  You may also mix and match sets including ones that have your favorite elements.\n\nThere are some questionable interface descisions resulting in more clicks then there needs to be, and some of the backgrounds are just ugly, but niether of these are serious enough flaws to prevent enjoyment of the game.","November 29, 2015","true","38.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fullscreen doesn't work for me and it seems to be a common problem.  In general, playing cards and accessing constructs in play can be difficult at times, though since I discovered you can drag constructs from the bottom of the screen into the play area directly to activate their effects, this has become less annoying.\n\nThat said, I enjoy the game and find it fun to play against an AI in a heads up match.  I turn to this game when I have some time to kill before bed and/or want to play something mindless (at 162 hours on record at time of writing and being an owner of the physical games - Ascension isn't exactly a brain burner).  All but the most recent expansion/version is available at any given time (though they are generally slow to release the next box), so you're sure to find some combinations you enjoy with 6+ box versions and some promos to choose from.\n\nIf you've enjoyed the card game and are willing to look past a mediocre interface, you'll likely find the game worth your time.","May 21","true","167.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
