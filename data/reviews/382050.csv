However seeing the low price tag on it and really liking the concept behind the game I decided to try it and I am very glad that I did.\n\nLets start with what Eon Altar is. It is at its core a well thought out way for people to play a game co-operatively in a relaxed setting. The game can be as fast paced or as slow as you need it to be and it is very easy to learn. I sat down with my wife after purchasing the game and we both loaded up a character and dove right in. Now I have been a gamer since I was old enough to hold a controler and tall enough to reach a joystick in an arcade, but my wife not so much. Her gaming resume consists of a little Halo 3 and a little bit of racing. She did have a problem getting the hang of moving her character around but I found it to be no issue at all. The controls were responsive and apart from the occasional phone lock-up (due to low battery) it all felt very smooth and a bit nostalgic.\n\nThe game is quite fun as well. They do a decent job of teaching you how to play, and you get little mini "walkthroughs" on your phone as you progress. The flow of the game reminds me very much of the classic Gauntlet style games. You move through maps as a group, there are things to loot, items to find, money to spend on upgrades and skills, and fun conversations to be had.\n\nPros:\n-Easy to jump in and play\n-Lovely environemnts\n-Turn based combat (this allows you and your friends time to plan and fight)\n-Spoken voice conversations!!! (You are fed lines to read out load as your character for conversation purposes, the NPCs will talk to you via the game and then you pick options and you can then read a few lines outloud for your friends to hear. This includes your characters knowledge of of lore in the game.)\n-Easy to learn\n-Personal and group goals (you can keep the personal ones secret from your buddies)\n-D&D style skills and upgrades\n\nCons:\n-Phone program can lock up (fixed by force closing it and reopening it, then rejoining the game)\n-Personal goals are marked by a colored circle that corrosponds to your character. It was hard for my wife (and me) to see some of her markers unless we got really close to them. The dark purple was hard to see in the environment.\n-Playing a new character can slow the game down as you may need to read through abilities and upgrades available while your friends wait for you.\n-very addicting (we did not want to stop playing despite needing to sleep for work tomorrow)\n-Lack of early healing items. They are there, but they seem to be just enough to squeek by, however death and respawns in the game are prepared for with "respawn" as you progress.\n-It is a bit easy to charge ahead of the group too and aggro enemies while your buddies get stuck a bit off screen.\n\nOverall I would give this an 8/10 as it stands now and for an early access game that is pretty awesome. The price can't be beat either and as more of the game becomes available it will just get better. Can't wait to play it some more.","February 4","true","4.6"," 38 of 39 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","38","39","2","0"

As the game continued I realized that this is a game that would be better played with friends and that I'm going to spoil it for myself if I keep playing so I shut it off.\n\nI then proceeded to tell a friend about the game, which she then purchased, and then bought the game as a gift for another friend with a big screen tv!\n\nAt first it may take a little getting used to looking at your phone/tablet and the tv/monitor but this "inconvenience" is easily forgiveable after you see just why it is so important to have your own screen that no one else can see. Making moral decisions and then actually being your character and reading out your lines for your friends to hear feels like it's only bringing you closer to the game and no long a voyeur just looking in. I hope this game is able to make enough for sequels or DLC cause this seems like the evolution to tabletop, and I'd hate to see it stop here.","January 4","true","0.6"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","28","29","2","0"

This is an AWESOME idea. Booted it up with my wife, and we both immediately loved the gameplay. Great use of smart phone controllers. The classes are fun and unique, and the simultaneous turn-based gameplay is perfect for quick, fun co-op multiplayer battles. I am super excited about this project, and really hope the devs take off with it and realize its potential. Also, other devs should take note. Everybody has a smart phone, but we don't all want free-to-play mobile games. This is how you take advantage of that market with real innovation.

A few bugs to report as of new patch Nov 20 in episode 3 are the three levers near the cages can cause the party to go into battle mode for the entire episode. Only way to reset is to have to entire party die and respawn. Hitting the levers while in combat was the tigger while a lizard dug under the ground and attacked us thru the closed gate.  Slaughtering all moving things including all rats did not reset it.\n\nThe chests inside the 3 lever area are a tricky trap as to get to them one must stay on the side of the levers. Moving the rest of the party to the chests causes the waiting party member to get pulled thru the closed gate and trap them forever. Forcing the party to restart the episode.\n\nIn the end of a great 3 day binge. Sighs could be heard thru out the house as the end of episode 3 closed and we were told we would have to wait for more. The laughter, giggling, and fun of throwing popcorn at the "Thief of chests" while in battle would be gone...\n\nThe App as a controler is spot on. Movement easy for anyone that uses phone games. Tons of info just for you on your own little part of the game was a perfect. The large skill and armor/weapon upgrades forces you to pick wisely and every box and chest you see means alot. Battle easy to pick up for all members of party.\n\nThe story has its moments but the real fun is in the party interaction with each other. Speaking your lines and keeping some info to yourself was a great addon. The char playing the Rogue was being as vile as they could had the room heckling and laughing. Finding out that one char had far more "Common item" then the other players combined made for some real fun popcorn throwing followed by all party members geting a few hundred of the needed item. So much info on your phone app was causing alot of idle game time on the TV but was not even noticed as the entire party was focused on unlocking and reading the next skills and upgrades of the next level.\n\nOnly the tank and rogue had a problem with a few of there skills. Both skills needed the items crafted before use and needed far to many materials to make them usable causing them to be a wasted skill without ever being able to see it used in combat. Precious was far more abundent then its usefulness. If only there was a shop to spend it lol... All other materials are needed so bad for your skills and crafted items the party will fight over what they think has "Common or Relvent" material. Cleric was a very fun class that at times could cause the entire party to beg for a heal.. Yes on there knees hehe\n\nThanks for a fun weekend Eon Altar. Our party is eagerly waiting for you to release more!!","November 30, 2015","true","21.7"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

We have everything except main action, on our devices. There are dialogues too. It's easy to learn and use.\n+4 characters with more "Comming soon" - 4 quite typical classes, yet every can be played as solo.\n+Every character has own story - each character has his/her own story mixed with main plot of the game. That means we should complete whole game at least that many times as we have charaters. Now it's 4 but I hope there will be more.\n+Dialogues on devices as one of possible ways to keep informations just for one player. - Here I mean that if we run into dialogue which has something to do with our character's story, we can keep it for ourselves without revealving it to other players.\n+Gives a feeling of playing classic RPG game with friends and Dungeon Master. - It's first game that gave me that feeling, even if I've played it just that little and it was solo. It's due to idea of dialogues kept on devices.\n+Quite hard - sometimes it's hard to go through some point without friends, but it's still possible. We just need to think about strategy.\n+Price - just 5 euro for so good game? It's like buy or buy.\n+Quite stable as of Early Access\n\nCons:\n-You need smartphone to play. But what if someone doesn't have it? Or just hates it? That player just can't play.\n-Needs a little of optimalization, cause pad on screen is not so smooth.\n-Some funny bugs(like attack through wall)\n-No save option. I asume it's due to size of game, so it's not that long story. Probably take maximum few hours to complete the game.\n-No camera control. Please give us an option to control camera somehow. It would be usefull, but it's not that requaired.\n-Outside fight it's still limited range of moving in one action.\n\nSummary:\nGreat idea for controling, with nice plot and possibility of playing with friends. Side stories for characters, that makes you want to play more times to learn their history. Not so high price.\n\nI'll probably change my review and add more informations after playing it few times more. But for now just try it for yourself. If you can't afford it, ask some friends and buy together one game to play in group. ;)","March 25","true","1.1"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","2"

If only two days ago you had told me that i'd be saying this about a phone-based game, i'd have thought you were crazy. Buy this game even if you don't have anyone to play with immediately, because sooner or later the devs will come to their senses and charge more for it.\n\n-- story time --\nSome buddies and I were looking for some living room co-op games to play and kick-back last night and amongst a few other games we bought this like "hell, it's $5.00". After playing the other games and being less than impressed, we finally came to this, installed the app, and started it up.\n\nNow as a little backstory to our group that might reveal a little bias: we play D&D on sundays, enjoy all rpg elements (gear, skills, depth, dialogue, etc.), and mostly play games together just to share a few beers and hang out. This game caters to our play-style perfectly, which i'm assuming is something that most gamers share to some extent.\n\nAs soon as it started up and we joined the room (which was a breeze btw), we fell into our typical character roles. We all know a guy who is the paladin type, mage type, assassin type, and so on. This was familiar, but not ground breaking. The game reveals to you immediately that your phone is not just the way you interact with the world and do combat, but it provides your innermost thoughts, secret goals, and your dialogue. Yeah, your dialogue. You have to SPEAK YOUR LINES to your friends! This is hilarious when you're all going for it, because it forces you to play your character and make choices based on how your character relates to the world.\n\nWe all got a kick out of playing our character, exploring our skill trees, being snarky in dialogue and showing off in combat. The idea behind combat in this game is perfect, but still has some bugs (which is to be expected as early access). All players share a turn, which means you're not waiting on that one guy who always waits til the last second to read his abilities. You get the strategy of turn based combat, while being able to move, aid, or fight the enemies all on the same turn. This time saving approach gives it a real feel of fluidity that impressed me and it made up for all of the time you spent reading your character abilities and skill trees.\n\nWe are currently only four hours in, but have already planned our next night to re-gather and play more. It's a blast and I sincerely recommend this game to anyone who likes a good social rpg and is familiar with it's fundamentals.\n\n-- Pros/Cons --\nPros:\n- dialogue is fun and social, never a chore.\n- every player feels like it's their story.\n- combat is well-oiled.\n- depth is enough to satisfy rpg die-hards.\n- phone interaction not gimmicky, but perfect in this context.\n- loot is competitive, but trading is implemented for easy sharing.\n- IT'S ONLY $5, what the hell. buy this on principle.\n\nCons:\n- a bit buggy at the time of writing this.\n- could be a lot to take in at first for rpg new-comers\n- need 3-4 players\n- might need phone charger","May 11","true","6.3"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Bam! Sold! Well, almost...\n\nAt it's heart, Eon Altar is an innovative concept and I really hope the devs can push it farther than just being an interesting control design. It's first shot in the arm is that the game is very linear due to 4 players on a single screen. This hurts the overall concept they were striving for. There will have to be some clever writing and mapping to really justify the design choices they have implemented and this first chapter currently fails to do so.\n\nNPCs in-game will sometimes tell your character something through the app, usually surrounding loot. You occasionally get a key to open something that others won't have access to but just being told about an item has no value. Loot is first come, first served so knowing an items location is worthless because you can't sneak away from the party - everyone is restricted to a single screen. Hidden doors or rooms could alleviate that, so long as only the character told could open it. Otherwise the whole idea is just superfluous, there simply to push the role-playing concept.\n\nThe onscreen players are also silent with the app showing your dialog. This requires you to speak your lines so everyone in the party knows what your character is saying. The app also contains your characters thoughts in various matters. This is all fantastic for role-playing but can end up just making you feel like a larping dork. You'll want to be sure you're playing with good friends or have plenty of alcohol.\n\nThe control through the app is surprisingly good, but not great. Running around using touchscreen feels equally as bad as when you play games on them. The layout is good though, with you being able to directly move your character via virtual thumb stick or select where to move him via an in-game cursor, Baldur's Gate style. The app itself is a little busy and sparse with direct help. Other than a single informational screen for each category during specific sequences in the opening, it will be trial an error. You will definitely want to play around with the interface for a bit before you jump into a game with friends.\n\nThe graphics could use some detail, it looks very mobile-quality currently. This may be left over from previous design ideas involving the phone itself or perhaps due to future mobile plans. Either way, the PC version needs some graphical TLC.\n\nTheir failed kickstarter video showed a lot more pen and paper elements such as dice rolling which looked great. It also showed gameplay footage that was far more cinematic, almost a multiplayer Telltale/Dragon's Lair hybrid. None of these elements are in the game right now though. Hopefully they plan on more than just a little spit and polish before they start selling new episodes. For one, I want to see some more RPG ideas for the phone app than just loot drops. For another, the game just feels lifeless right now, the cinematic gameplay on display in the kickstarter video was fantastic – lets go that direction.\n\nWhile the game is in early access, it plays better than some “finished” products I have payed for. This is great for perspective buyers but the design ideas alone make this game worth supporting. I purchased it without even owning a phone to show my support, begging and borrowing one from friends to play with. It currently has a lot of promise but needs to make some serious changes and bring the gameplay up to par with the technological ideas it's based on. If what we get at the end of EA is just a shinier version of what's already here then Eon Altar will go down as being a mediocre RPG with some interesting tech attached.\n\nThumbs up for Hope.","August 29, 2015","true","1.4"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","15","20","0","0"

Everything was incredibly smooth and easy to setup. We just had to be in the same wifi as the host pc and run the control app on our smartphones and we were ready to go. The controls are easy to learn and we had no problems moving our characters. Combat in this game is round based. So you can plan out your action with your smartphone and don't need to hurry.\n\nThe smartphone control made us expect that Eon Altar is some gimmicky minigame. We thought we would play it for like an hour or so and then be done with it til our next meeting. We were very surprised when we found out that the game is actually anything but a gimmicky minigame. I was especially impressed with the big skill tree and the upgrade tree which allow for specializing your character further.\n\nThe best thing about this game though is the roleplaying aspect. NPCs speak on their own but if a player character says anything the dialog appears only on their control app and they have to act and speak it out loud. This is so much fun and quite often hilarious. An example: At one point you initiate a big fight and the game gives you the opportunity to scream a battleshout. My friend played Shasek the sellsword and he selected "For Fun!". I played Barryson the Paladin and of course I selected "For Truth! For Justice! For Honor!". We were laughing our asses off after that.\nQuite often in the game you get to make decisions. Every Character is following a personal agenda in addition to the group objectives. At several points you may make your intentions open to the group or keep them to yourself. Also at times NPCs whisper something in the ear of only one member of the group. And you can then decide what to do with that information.\n\nAll in all we had great fun with this game and I can fully recommend it. Props to the developers for trying something new and doing it right.","May 17","true","4.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","3"

I am not suggesting, that it is a good idea in the first place, to hold the game to high standards like that and I recognize that it wasn't even designed to offer D&D-like experiences, but since a number of people have remarked on this positively, I feel compelled to say, that even though the game offers some light pastime for a short while, many of its aspects are very disappointing:\n\nThe aesthetics are infantile,\nthe story and the characters are uninspired and simply boring,\nthe dialogues and descriptions are written in a preposterously horrible fashion,\nthe game mechanics are far too simple for an enjoyable role-playing game experience, yet the game itself is too long to offer just a light and amusing game night pastime for one evening or so.\n\n\nIn the end, the game suffers from the fundamental problem of wanting to be both: An actual roleplaying-game and an easily approachable social game. My hope is, however, that the idea of local-coop rpgs stressing a social dynamic as attempted in Eon Altar, doesn't die with this game, but will be developed in a more sophisticated way in the future.","January 6","false","5.0"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","16","25","0","0"

The app it requres is a little big but once you start using it you will understand why. It has a very clean look and even some dialog that is for your eyes only. So your team mates are not able to see the things that are just meant for you.  You are also able to take care of a few inventory things along with skills while everyone else is still doing their thing.\n\nIt's turn based combat and that really works for how the game controls. I can't really see them having it any other way. However movement outside of combat is not. Skills are a bit limited at the moment but it's enough to get by. It's early access so they will be adding quite a bit more to the game and as it is you will still have fun with it.\n\nAs for the story it's what you would expect from an RPG like this. It teaches you at a fair pace while the story starts to unfold.\n\nBe sure to charge your phone beforehand or have a charger ready to go.\n\nAt 5 bucks it feels like they are undercharging.

The app was very buggy (at least for me), once it bugged it stayed bugged and became unusable to play the game. I used both my Samsung Galaxy S5 and Samsung Galaxy tab, both bugged so i could no longer the skill up function. When I was able to play I never got out of tutorial area, I got to a second friendly NPC that I was suppose to talk to and it bugged so I  couldn't talk to him. I don't mind bugs I play many early access, but this game is currently unplayable if your phone app controller bugs out.\n\nTruthfully if they fixed the app so it wasn't buggy I would totally pick this game back up, but as it is I asked for a refund. I would not suggest buying this game untill they fix the app. I hope they do fix it cause it seems like it would be a fun game to play with friends, it currently is only local co-op as far as I can tell, and from the way the game is set up it doesn't seem like it will ever have online co-op.","August 29, 2015","false","1.1"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","16","28","0","1"

The IOS app refuses to work. Period. Connections only last a second or so, and we've spent a couple of hours messing with different Iphones, Ipads, and two windows machines as well as different Wifi options.\n\nNothing works. Currently, the developer's support forums is offline with a SQL error. So yeah, screw this game.\n\nOriginal review below........................................................\n\nThis is a little like a lightweight Neverwinter/Baldurs Gate with a designed exclusively tailored for local co op play.\n\nBasically, you are all using your smart phones as combination mice and inventory management screens. We saw a fair number of UI glitches in the IOS app,  but nothing more than minor annoyances. Sound and graphics are ok, but the iOS mouse interface is amazingly responsive.\n\nThe game itself is about two hours for the first quest. Combat is very Baldurs gate, except that all characters can move an attack simultaneously. Combat goes FAST and doesn't slog.\n\nThe shining point here is how much the game feels like a computer aided D&d session. The second screens also pop up with secret quests, individual responses and reactions just for that character. Just like a GM passed you a private note. Player dialogue is not voiced, but pops up ONLY on your screen and you are expected to say it in your best full-on Renn Fair voice. This is totally stupid and totally awesome, especially when the dialogue goes all high fantasy cliche.\n\nloot is also handled by whoever opens the chest getting stuff.  There is a trade option, or you can just keep it. No fair sharing.  Except that the other players can easily reach over and dump a beer on your head if you are too annoying.\n\nCharacter options are also pretty deep and a little baffling. There are 6 trees for each character, split between skills and equipment upgrades. I cannot see where any of this is documented anywhere.  This also contains a bit of a UI sin in that you really have to scroll around to see all of your upgrade options.  These aren't well described in the game at all, mostly a short blurb and some symbols and numbers. Could really use a manual.","August 28, 2015","false","4.9"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

That being said, if you’re the type of player (like me) that likes to read every line of text, absorb every ounce of lore, and truly get immersed into the role you’re playing (see what I did there) – this game is worth a pickup. The controls are pretty smooth once you get into the smartphone interface, but I kinda wish the inventory options were available (like a virtual rotating dial) on the screen so that you don't have to look away from the action every turn.","May 4","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Plugged my Laptop to my TV, installed the App on our Smartphones, started it all up, and it worked fine. So far played it with to characters.\nCon points would be, no help window or manual.\nOnly playable with the same WiFi for all players (and the PC).\nSometimes the overlay on the smartphone wasnt changing back. But reopen the last menu and closing it, solved it.\nThere is no "manual", only the Hints of the game, as you venture further, so it is a bit overwhelming.\nFor the upgrade section, it was not clear to me, you had to unlock the status first, then the abilities/upgrades, but clicking around helped.\nAlso sometimes, the targeting with the Smartphones was inaccurate, but thats not a problem, you have almost always enough time in a fighting round to target an enemy again.\n\nNeutral Point: You have to read almost everything aloud, what your character is saying, even to NPC or in a private talk between characters. But you are getting instructions, like "say aloud" or "whisper quietly", which is pretty fun, if you are into it.\nBig plus, for me, is, that you have group goals, and also personal goals. Personal goals you can share, or you dont.\nAlso the easy set up, good graphics, good fighting mechanics. As I said, very promising.\n\ntl;dr\nAll and all a good, promising game, Smartphone as a controller is a pretty neat idea.

At first they can be troublesome but once you get the hang of them it's a pretty awesome game.  Definitely made for multiplayer adventures.  Best comparison I have to it is that it's a table top game without the dice.  Every character has it's own driving nature and each person gets to choose how they will react if that back story is going to be public knowledge among the group or if they will keep silent about it.  As a storyteller, DM, and avid gamer myself, this is amazing.  It manages to bring about the parts of LARPing that I love while getting rid of the aspects of tabletoping that I hate, AND brings it into a nice turn-style battle guided RPG.  Definitely, definitely, definitely get this game if you have the chance it is well worth the money.  However, this game will also take a while to complete.  I spent an hour on it and I'm not even finished with the first chapter.  While the class list is small it makes up for it in a tiered-buying upgrade style while this makes classes one dimensional buy not being able to multiclass I'm sure future releases may consider opening this up.  The graphics aren't as great as they could be, that said, it's far from being 8-bit.  Storyline is interesting all and all which makes up for many of it's shortcomings.  However, do not be mistaken, this game is still well worth the $5 you would throw at it.\n\nCons-  Controls, length, uncustomizable character names and looks, small class pool, low quality graphics, inability to multiclass\n\nPros-  Storyline, replayability, cost, tiered leveling system, turn style battle system, great work on the tutorials...\n\nThe pros still far surpass the cons in this game, however, I can see Eon Altar being a game that many gamers will remember for years to come as one of those amazing games that opened up the world to a new gaming experience.\n\nDefinitely a 9 out of 10.

However, it is still nearly unplayably buggy. I've had the Android client lock up multiple times and render the rest of the session unplayable, on multiple different phones. Kicking and rejoining isn't an option as either the session still registers as full or just plain non-existant. This happened so many times during the first session we gave up and let the player that was still in play to the end by themselves in order to just unlock the next session. Also it seems that dying has neglible impact, as you are resurrected at the last checkpoint while all the enemies you can have killled are not. This allows you to just grind down large waves or dangerous situations with multiple death/respawn cycles.\n\nThe game itself is a fun rpg-lite that basically uses your smartphones to deliver guided pen-and-paper style RP experience. The concept is neat, and it looks like it could be a fun pick up game, but at this point in time I cannot recommend it as it is so buggy it is barely playable (at least in multiplayer). This price however, is right to take a chance on it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PurpleFanta/recommended/382050/","PurpleFanta","( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)Mr Bones","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PurpleFanta/","237 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is fantastic. True tabletop RPG feeling.\n\n*NOTE: I played this game on another steam account due to their computer being plugged up to a very large TV, so I dont have the hours logged to my account*\n\nSo I have a group of friend that I play pathfinder with, when I saw the devs of this game were trying to re-create the tabletop RPG feeling I was instantly sold on this game and we planned a day where we coudl all get together and play it. This game does not have online multiplayer, and the devs said they arent planning on adding it either currently. Local co-op is the only way to play the game (or singleplayer if you're brave) so let me start this off by saying this. Playing this kind of game in person with other people is VERY important. It adds a lot of enjoyment to the game. Seeing peoples faces when they're trying to hide some thing or make a decision changes the feeling. Plus you'll most likely have alot of laughs together.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, lets get to the gameplay. Combat is turn based, obviously. Everything is based on dice rolls depending on your stats. But one of the interesting parts is each turn is simultaneous. Enemies move in a group, players move in a group. You can step on each others toes. Enemies can block each others movement. Some communication is required if things get hairy. I cleaved into my friends multiple times. I've been rained arrows on. I've been shield bashed on accident. I've also missed my massive energy cost healing strike multiple times because it has a slow animation and I didnt tell anyone I was using it before my target died. So far the game is pretty unforgiving and can be difficult at times. Which is honestly great. The panic or teamwork that comes together when its going downhillis really exciting.\n\nOutside of the combat, you have some interactions between characters depending on their alignment, actions and your personal missions. We didnt get too deep into this ourselves, but during our game we called each other out, chose party actions against someone elses moral alignment and practically stole out loot from each others noses. It might sound like a backstab party, but it's not that sinister. It's all mostly fun and games or hard decisions you have to make to come out of the story alive. Though if somone was really a jerk, you could make someone fall really behind if you never let them get any resources to upgrade their gear. I guess thats up to the players.\n\nNow on another note, the game has a few bugs that hurt it, but I mean this is EA. Its pretty much to be expected of a game that's been out less than a year in EA. A few bugs happened last night and actually even caused us to have to restart the game (luckily only about 10 minutes into the game). Here's a list of all the bugs we came across.\n-When trying to trade resources, the mobile app got stuck with an ! on the screen like it was trying to wait for someone to say something, but no one could say anything and we couldnt progress (the bug that made us restart)\n- Enemies randomly ran past us and started spazing out once\n- I once ran past an enemy I tried to attack and swung at the air, attack didnt even attempt (Didnt say I hit or missed)\n-  Ghost on E1S2 got stuck while we were following her, leaving the area and coming back fixed it\n- Skill menu seems to not cycle through skill trees in order (Paladin skill tree comes up 1/3\n- Opening chests and containers sometimes takes multiple tries\n- If you accidentally close the app, you wont be able to join back.\n\nDespite all the bugs, the game was loads of fun. Even with an ability/gear update coming, there was plenty we could do. Character customization is pretty good, you wont be able to unlock everything but rather focus your character on what you want to be. There are 3 skill trees for each character that focuses on a specific gameplay style or theme for them (Crusader: Melee physical damage, Paladin: A mixture of physical and magic damage with some healing and debuffs. and Cleric: bufffs and healing). One of my complaints is that I would argue that having a +2 skill check bonus to dungeoneering isnt worth 30 skillpoints, when I could also spend 30 skill points on upgrading my defence buff spell. Dungeoneering is an important skill to have, but it feels a little wasteful to spend it on that when I'm the party's cleric and need to keep people alive. I'm all for passives and skill bonuses but it feels like it should cost less. Like in pathfinder for example, you get skillpoints when you level up on top of other class related upgrades and abilities. Using a whopping 30 skillpoints to be able to open chests and break down barricades feels a little wastefull. Hopefully they address that in the future.\n\nUnless I'm remembering wrong, the game is going to be 9 Episodes. So far Episode 1 is out and it has 3 parts to it. We played from 10 pm to 3 am. That's about as much as a normal Tabletop session went for us.\n\nI would 100% reccomend this game. It's loads of fun to get together and play this with some friends. I'll update this review as episodes come out and I play through it with my friends.\n","January 7","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The single player is as of this moment lack luster, though shines when even one more person is introduced. connecting your phone can be a bit of a challenge as lag happens differently on different phones, however this is not a problem necessacarily of the platform. while other games have attempted dungeons and dragons, it's either been unintuitive and overly complex, or just a skin, this however feels like a simpler yet truer spinoff. ther is however no character customization as the game heavily relies on narrative, so only premade characters are available.\n\nPro's:\nsimplified D&D style gameplay\nintuitive turn based combat\nworks well for both long term gamers as well as newcomers to gaming\ninteresting narrative\nwell made UI\n(if applicable) great for couples or groups of friends\nfor local co-op, only one person needs to have the game (and app is free though that's expected)\nfully voice acted\n\nCon's:\nlackluster graphics (not bad, just unrefined)\nsingle player is punishing rather than difficult\nvirtually no character customization\nphone required rather than a option\nlocal co-op only\ngame time limited to phone battery life, though this can be fine if there are enough outlets to charge near by\n","February 10","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But, even with me liking it, there are a few things I would enjoy seeing implimented. For one, character customization. I'm not talking like huge Black Desert Online customization, but just things like being able to change your character's name or gender and possibly even skill sets. It takes some notes from D&D in regards to skills and spells, I think it would be pretty awesome to - in a way - create your characters almost like in D&D. That way you connect a little more with the character. Now, I know this could probably cause some issues with the hidden thoughts process, but probably not that much if you have a personality setting that would set the default personality while creating the character. But these are all really just suggestions. The game is pretty awesome as is.\n\nOne slight flaw I've seen, though is that even when playing solo the npcs still act as though there's a group, or when there's only two the npcs act as though there's a larger group.\n\nAll in all, though, this game is pretty fun. I love the concept and the fact that you have to read your lines aloud. It actually gets you involved in the storyline of the game rather than just going through the motions.\n\nI'm silently hoping for alternate storylines or online co-op where your friends can play even if they aren't in the room.","March 13","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(We could possibly see an extra character)\n-Turn based combat\n-Phone interface without having to hassle yourself and your friends with items, stats, and etc. (Because your controller also works as your menu)\n-Roleplay aspect where you say what your character's dialogue says.\nCons:\n-Must have a Smartphone and must be updated to fit the minimum requirements of the App it comes with.\n-Controller feels a bit weird and could use a bit of work. Moving around is a bit hard to get used to, though I've gotten a bit used to it. It could to be eased for the user.\n-The Roleplay aspect I mentioned could also be a con without voiced dialogue for the character being used. (As neat as it is to actually say the lines, it could get tiresome and some people may have trouble speaking)\n\nI will continue to play and update this review but, for now I could recommend this game for people who want to see a intuitive idea something develope into something great. I haven't had too much trouble with the game and if you want to try something new and are a fan of the turn based RPG genre this would be a great buy.\nI would not recommend this to somebody who doesn't have the patience to read a bit to learn how the game works and to somebody who doesn't own a smartphone.

I was hyped for it since I first heard it's announcement, but in it's current form--well--let's say it needs more work. Obviously, it's an Early Access game so I do not expect polish, but the bugs and poor optimization are just killing me. Running on a system with a 980ti the highest three quality settings will plumment my framerate to between 20-40 FPS. It's only while getting to the lowest settings that the game runs at above 60.\n\nNow to the controls. The smartphone & tablet controller is the selling point that truly differentiates "Eon Altar" from anything else out there. As it stands, however, it seems to be more of a detriment than a plus. The App is constantly disconnecting, controls are difficult and at times frustrating enough to throw your phone through a window when you miss a chest or selecting an enemy for the tenth time in a row. Fortunately, the turn-based system saves this aspect from being a total failure. However, the integrated UI and individual conversation that each character sees is a wonderful concept and with a little bit more polish would be completely phenomenal.\n\nSo currently, as the game stands, makes it very difficult to give an enthusiastic recommendation to. It's not exactly the prison cell garbage fire most indie games on steam are, but it's certainly not "Pillars of Eternity" either.  I really, really, truly hope the game can pull itself together by the time for full release as there is so much potential trying to claw it's way out from under the rubbish. All told--it can still make a good party game.","April 4","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Latency was also very minimal.\n+The akward controls do work very well and I got used to them after only about 5 minutes.\n+Price\n+Stategic\n+Unique stories for each character (however this leads to some cons)\n+Good checkpoint and save system (however I would like a way to turn off checkpoints for more difficult gameplay)\n+Art style fits the gameplay and the combat animations are good\n\nCons:\n-Secret objectives for heroes aren't randomized at the start. The heroes always have the same secret objective which means that if you've already played through once you already know your friend's secret objectives.\n-Because of the above con I believe that this game offers zero replayability (even though I haven't finished it yet).\n-Misleading title. Game is titled Eon Altar, not Eon Altar Episode 1. I didn't read into the early access information before buying so I thought I was getting a full game and instead I ended up buying into an episodic series.\n-Linear as linear gets. No branching paths at all. No fighting your friends over which way to go.\n-Lack of interesting loot.\n-App drained my battery faster than my phone could charge. I started playing with about 50% battery life and my phone plugged in. When I was done with my 1hr session I had only 10% battery life. I was using an old phone though (Galaxy SII).\n-App unavailble on Windows 10 or Windows 10 mobile.\n-While you can play alone, it isn't much fun.\n-Game options are lacking\n-During combat you will find yourself looking between screens a lot. This could be avoided if the app had a small PiP type window or a background that showed what was going on up on the main screen so the player can see what's going on when they are looking down at their phone.\n\nVerdict: 6/10\n\nEven with all of the flaws I reccomend this game, but only to people who are going to be playing with some friends and only if those friends happen to enjoy turn based video games or RPG's like D&D. If you have no friends then DO NOT buy this game.\n\nThe future:\nThis is the first time to my knowledge that a developer has attempted something unique like this. I see this as a starting point for a whole new genre of game. Maybe in the future we will be able to play something like this, but instead of the controller being the phone maybe It'll just use the phone to relay secret info and manage the inventory while using a physical controller to play, hell, maybe even attach the phone to a physical controller with some accessory. That would open up this type of system to more genres of games other than turn based ones. In the future I want to see a game with this type of innovation but with the gameplay of Diablo.
