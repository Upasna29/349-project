It is possible to play the game on a hard difficulty, but it felt like what normal should have been. The game will last you around 5 hours, with not much replayability once you finish the game.\n\nThere is a variety of robots, but they really only differ in how fast they move and how much health they have.\n\nThe DNA fusing of aliens and shop DNAs sounds like it has a lot of depth and it kind of does, but by the end of the game you just have two groups of meatbags with you, ones that make your towers really strong and ones that can mine really well.\n\nIf I gave the game an update, I would look into trying to make the game harder, or at least toning down the overly powerful boosting of towers that you can do.\n\n\nA video showing gameplay during a later level:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAx_SpHPzOs\n\nFollow my curator list for future early access game recommendations:\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/6856568-Should-You-Play-This-Game/","February 4, 2015","true","13.3"," 35 of 38 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","35","38","0","0"

When I first decided to write a review I had every intention of criticizing the devs for releasing the game Early Access instead of just waiting until they had enough content. This was due to my own prejudice against companies that have been putting tech demos up on the store and charging full price. The truth is that Freaking Meatbags already has a good amount of content and many of the game's features. At $10 it's priced perfectly right now.\n\nAbout the game itself;\nThe first thing you will notice is the humor. This is Douglas Adams meets Paranoia in the most flattering manner possible. The art is loveably cute and the writing is snappy and clever. It sets a different tone for what is essentially a RTS/Tower Defense game with a mutation mechanic thrown in for extra fun. From the start it all just works.\n\nThe graphics are fitting for the current trend towards retro-glaucoma bitart. Everything is well crafted to be easily identifiable and often charming. This is a talented artist/art director. I have not seen any artifacts or glitches. I can't wait to see more from them in the near future as more content is added.\n\nAudio: Forgive me I had to play with the sound off since I couldn't stop playing through the night. From the looks of things I probably missed out on something great. I hope to update later today after I get some sleep.\n\nGameplay: As I said, it's basically an RTS- resource collection, build buildings, create units, set defenses but then it adds a tower defense element by throwing invasion waves at you. Each planet you land on gives you an increasing number of waves of attacking enemies. Sometimes a planet will be a special level instead(no spoilers!). The waves come from different directions and are made up of increasingly hard enemies and larger numbers. Finally, there is a DNA splicing element to the game. It's in the latest build but it's not completely "fleshed out"(sorry) yet since you don't have a ton of options for splicing but it looks like it will be really great addition once done.\n\nOverall, the game is currently worth supporting. The direction of development seems consistent and the devs seem friendly. I am eager to try out the rest of the game as I have had several hours of addiction fueled bliss already. I am sleep deprived but I had to get a review up ASAP so that these guys will hopefully get the sales they deserve. There has been a flood of garbage on Steam recently but this isn't like all of that. Buy this and enjoy!\n","May 21, 2014","true","3.0"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","31","34","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whislter/recommended/297060/","whislter","Whistler","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whislter/","458 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOddly enough, out of all the sub genres of gaming, tower defences have never really evolved past a certain point and usually required to be stretched into other genres like Coffee Stain studio’s Sanctum series or Robot Entertainment’s Orcs must Die.  Thankfully Freaking Meatbags developed by Wild Factor is a tower defence title that plays a very creative mix with base building RTS elements seen in titles like Starcraft 2 and the Command & Conquer series along with some bullet hell combat similar to The Binding of Isaac.\n\nIn Freaking Meatbags players assume the role of Chip, a lowly cleaning robot down on his luck and whose been assigned to a solar system about to go boom where you will go from planet to planet gathering rare resources, breeding and ordering your squishy populace around, building your defences during the daylight hours and then fighting off the rather flesh bag craving robots as the sun sets.\n\nVisuals for Freaking Meatbags are well, freaking sweet (see what I did there), conjuring up a menagerie of classic old school with gorgeous pixel art style. Everything is very nicely detailed but are easy on the eyes with towers/buildings being easily distinguishable from one another, granted the meat bags (humans) are a bit on the basic side but we are meant to be tiny feeble beings. I do love the FM’s graphical style though, visuals are very polished, smooth and just oozes Wild Factor’s own blend of personality.\n\nAs mentioned gameplay follows a mix between base building RTS and tower defence where first thing first you allocate bobby, joe, tim etc (I prefer to not get attached to the little guys) to each planets resources judging on your needs require sufficing first; ranging from metals used for basic walls and machine gun turrets, green ore (I can for the life of me find an official name) used for more biological structures such as the DNA Fusion device or Barracks, red ore allows you to build more powerful turrets and steel for advanced turrets along with the drones. While the building is relatively simple each planets objectives while not too greatly varied have you facing different challenges that both teach and force the player to learn new ways of either defending their base or themselves in fact boiling down to 3 objectives which are your standard survive x waves, locate each secret with the time allotted and destroy all robots which sees your base completely removed from play.\n\nWhile the game does somewhat reward the player for exploring past the borders of your base on each planet the rewards tend to not really feel all that worth it honestly only felt like going off the beaten track just to fill out the fog of war. When you’re not planet side you can spend your time visiting the traveling merchant for building upgrades & unlocks granted there isn’t too much available, upgrading your bots stats like speed or human pop cap, venturing to the next destination and reading your emails.\n\nWhile the story is paper thin, along with the in-game lore and text for things, you Chip will send emails back and forth between his loved ones, his boss and a giant trans-dimensional space squid so its good that the dialogue and in-game humour are genuinely good. I often found myself chuckling at the banter between Chip and email recipients or reading the background info on his human slaves that give the game a bit more life where you can generally enjoy the humour instead of just sighing every time a bit of text shows up on the screen like in certain other indie titles or just ploughing through the base building and turret defending mindlessly.\n\nAlong with breeding humanity you will also come across a bunch of varying alien races who blindly join you for helping them out which allows you to play DNA dress up where you can fuse say a human and alien together in order to breed humans with, (pause for dramatic effect), laser eyes!\nWhile at the moment it feels like there is little thought needed and the DNA fusing is very simple where really you just keep blending dna types together in order to carry along the rather f*cked up gene pool and spread it amongst your rather ‘special’ race of fleshians, its still a very enjoyable mechanic that be it needs a little more depth.\n\nWhile I am disheartened that I’m already one planet away from finishing the campaign after only 3 and a half hours (there are harder modes ofcourse) and don’t think there will be that much added level wise once it his fully released. Freaking Meatbags is a rather simplistic yet well-made game with little bugs considering its apparently in alpha state with a couple more structures, new meatbag types, enemies, a fully featured level editor (and a crazy pirate?) which tickles a rather pleased nerve ending for my RTS and tower defence needs and is certainly worth a look at for those who prefer tower defences that aren’t too unforgiving and enjoy a gorgeous pixel aesthetic.\n\n\nPros:\nBrilliant pixel art visuals,\nGenuinely funny dialogue and text,\nSimple yet enjoyable.\n\nCons:\nSomewhat lacking content,\nRather short levels,\nI really wish I could name the slaves.\n\nWritten by,\nWhistler\n\nInterested in my other reviews?\nHead over to http://morbidplay.com/ for the latest in old school and new gaming reviews.\n","May 31, 2014","true","4.2"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

Doing this allows the player to choose genial traits for the clone such as faster mining, improved tower fire rates, damage and so on.\n- Music is really nice although it does only have a few tracks.\n- Mixes gameplay up by having 'shooter' sections\elements. It's nice that it has this but I don't really see the need for it.\n\nCons- There is no in game options menu so if you want to change anything you'll be required to go back to the main menu.\n- The control scheme on the planet hub is just terrible. Instead of using the mouse to move the camera around until you find the desired planet you must use A\D or Left\Right arrow. This wouldn't be a problem if planets were in static positions, however they are not and are constantly moving so to find the planet you want to play becomes a search for a needle in the haystack. Why can't we use the middle mouse to pan the camera.\n- The difficulty is highly inconsistent and often fluctuates. One level you'll beat no sweat while the next you'll suffer through. What's up with that?\n- If you placed a tower down your robot can not pass over it. This is extremely annoying, this often unintentionally leads to you taking the long ♥♥♥ way around if possible unless you've locked yourself in which could happen until you decide to recycle whatever is impeding your path.\n- Camera control during gameplay is somewhat slow as it either follows the player or can be temporarily moved by pushing the mouse in the desired direction, it does however return to the center on the player. I wish you could pan the camera around with middle mouse button.\n- AI humans feel the need to wander all over the place after you've designated them to a given position which could result in their deaths.\n- I often get the feeling that I have to play this game the way the devs intended it to be played. If not you're most likely in for defeat.\n- The game drops frames when a ton of chips are collected or many explosions occur.\n- Lacking in enemy robot variety.\n- Can get repetitive early on.\n\nOversights- There is no encyclopaedia of towers, defences, robots or aliens. So if you missed what a certain tower does or robot statistic you may be required to replay the level that first introduced the mechanic or hover over every tower\defence\resource in your arsenal.\n- Power constraint is a nice restriction however I wish there a button to disconnect all towers at the same time because if you have towers away from your ship and enemies are attacking your ship you have to manually disconnect all the distant towers and this involves walking to them to turn them off. This will result in an instant defeat.\n- I wish you could fuse the DNA of aliens with aliens, I don't see why you're limited to only humans in this aspect as you con recruit other aliens to your team.\n- It needs a better worker selection implementation. As in being able to select one worker from a group when all workers are grouped together. Something like a worker list in which you could click on any worker.\n- It does have some typos or missing words.\n\nVerdictA game that tries to merge the aspects of RTS and Tower Defence genres and while it succeeds in some aspects, it does fail in others. The result is a fun but flawed experience which is marred by odd design decisions, infuriating usability issues, uneven difficulty and idiotic AI. While it's not terrible it is quite fun but the flaws really ruin the experience. I do feel that it needed more time in the oven to correct its issues.","June 17, 2015","false","11.2"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

Rather than traditional RTS games where you get money from the enemies you kill, here you have to mine them yourself. Or you would if you didn't have nearby humans to enslave! ask for assistance. You can even DNA splice the humans to make them better at things.\n\nWell done I say, I welcome novel ideas that are executed well. Interrupting your diligent human slaves employees are of course...Urm...Other robots? Since we go from planet to planet I personally would have prefferred aggressive aliens myself but something had to be the badguy and even though we play as a robot, who works in a robot company with other robots, our enemies are just randomly aggressive robots.\n\nIt tars the narrative a bit, they should have been robots from a rival company or something or as I said, aliens. Why am I making an issue out of this? Well aliens join you. No narrative is given as for why, they just...Do? Its great that they do because you can splice human DNA with them but I started a mission and there were 2 alien Machamps, with a bonus to mining due to having 4 arms and being best Pokemon, but they refused to mine. I suppose that is a bit beneath such a stud pokemon like Machamp.\nSo I sent them to man the turrets! Thats a champy thing for a Machamp to do and they make it hit 40%...Something? Game didn't tell me. Oh! makes them shoot 40% faster! Oh okay, wait, humans have 40% faster as their turret trait. Okay lets put a h...No, it doesnt shoot faster at all! Is it doing more damage then?\n\nIncase you didn't notice I was pointing out that some aspects of the game are obtuse!\nTo be fair the game does explain a fair bit and I did see the developer asking for help translating to English so I think that explains the hiccups here and there. Its kind of odd because the storyline is humourous and well written by what I presume were non english speakers. I have to tip my hat fedora to them in the writing aspect.\n\nGameplay wise, hmm. I'm not sure how to say this without it sounding like a negative but the gameplay is not engaging. To me at least. I am good at RTS games, despite what you might hear suggesting otherwise, I hit the RTS gym and learned to love the RTSWOLE like a real Machamp! So I found myself with 100 humans running around mining for me while my resource cup flowth over and turrets line my base as if this was Red Alert 1 and the AI was set to easy.\n\nIf you like tower defense games i can see this game turning you off. RTS games are very clicky and frantic which is kind of the opposite of tower defense games. As far as tower defense gameplay goes, its basically Sanctum but without the multiplayer, so its good. If you like RTS & TD games then this might be heaven? Or you may find that like me, its not very challenging even on its hardest setting because the game doesn't seem to be balanced around you having 100 humans and bleeding every planet dry before the first wave has even put its coat and hat on.\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","March 4","true","2.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

It has all the expected elements from the genre, but throw in the mixing of genes, creating whole new humanoid creatures with special traits like laser eyes, or an extra pair of arms, and you got some thing kind of special.\n\nIn Freaking Meatbags, you'll be spending plenty of time defending your base, but there is a character progression system as well. You'll be leveling up each of your worker, or "Meatbags",  you can even equip a variety of gear to improve them, whether it be jetpacks to move faster, or rocket launchers to help you defend and attack. You can also buy and upgrade new devices to produce during missions, and even upgrade the ship that house your crew. Freaking Meatbags offers a variety of game mechanics to keep the simple idea of defending a base interesting, and deep.\n\nEven with the number of things to min-max, and meta-game, Freaking Meatbags is pretty easy to understand and jump into. The tutorial levels are paced well, and speaking as a player who don't play a lot of games from this genre, I can say it didn't take too long for me to "get it". The game does a good job at balancing complex mechanics for the "hardcore" player, while keeping it simple that I think even "casuals" can get a lot of enjoyment out of.\n\nThough the game is a lot of fun, it could use a better options menu. It's practically devoid of any settings out side of the very bare bones basics. There's also no other features, play mode, or multiplayer. The single player campaign is all you'll be getting from my experience. Luckily, the main campaign so far seems satisfying enough for it's asking price, for what's there, is really enjoyable.\n\nPros:\n- Good pixel art style\n- Great sense of humor\n- Well balanced in accessibility and complexity\n- The DNA system in this game is fantastic\n\nCons:\n- Lacks options\n- Lacks Features\n- No multiplayer","February 16, 2015","true","3.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

There isn't too much replay value other than redoing levels on hard. There is a great variety of playstyle in the levels, some require you to build as many defences as you can, other require you to carefully ration out your resources, and others play like a top-down shooter. Personally I found this to be a huge plus as it kept the game from getting stale and repetative. Overall, I felt that this was a novel concept implemented quite well.","April 10","true","20.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

This is an RTS of sorts, though I use that term loosely.  As a robot trying to make its way from planet to planet, you’ll be using humans (meatbags) to gather resources and fend off other robots a la tower defense.  You can purchase new towers and upgrades in between levels with some of the resources you'll collect along the way.  While it’s not the prettiest game you’ll ever play, it has a certain charm about it.  Further, you can splice meatbags’ traits to make new and improved meatbags via the DNA machine.  This allows you to customize your workers a bit, though you can only bring so many with you to the next level.  All in all, it's unique enough to be worth the price of admission.\n\nPost-Release Video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBJ5wg_iwEw\n\nEarly Access Videos:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVbqCcY3Ir4\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GcpqYItlYU","February 8, 2015","true","4.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

If being a robot and controlling people as they do your bidding in a far off solar system is your idea of a bright future, you will love the RTS tower defence game Freaking Meatbags. Currently in Early Access on Steam, Freaking Meatbags places you in the role of a lowly cleaning robot, destined to roam the solar system clearing planets of their resources before the inevitable death of the galaxy. Your job is made that little bit easier by the fleshy group of human slaves who mine the resources for you in exchange for having a slug placed in their brain and sometimes being squished by angry wild aliens.

This is not just funny; by turning the creation of new units into a matter of splicing desired traits together into a new person, they've created a whole different range of choices for players to make. The game feels unique even though the core of RTS gaming -- resource management, base building, and unit production -- are all present and still the focus of the game.

It's definitely worth the buy.\n\nVideo Review:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xbhjcwtuSA\n\nWhat is it?\n\nFreaking Meatbags is a comination of a tower defense game and a real-time strategy. You will have to command humans to mine rescources or man your combat towers while evil robots come to attack you. The most interseting part of this game is the gene splicing. You ae not stuck with just run-of-the-mill humans. You can change them, taking traits from two different humans and combining them to make a more specialized human.\n\nPros:\n\n-The sense of humor in this game is whitty and spot on. Every time I get an email (which act as a way of furthering the plot) I always find something to chuckle over.\n\n-There is a massive amount of flexibility in how you design a human. I'm only half way through the game and I've found at least six genes and there are another seven in the shop. That leaves a lot of room for mixing and matching different genes.\n\n-The game is nicely paced. It is a fast paced game that somehow keeps up that pace between waves of enemies. I always find myself down to the wire as I put the finishing touches on my defenses.\n\n-The different enemies types are unique. Their not just the same enemy with different skins. This is a must have for a tower defense.\n\nCons:\n\n-Missions where you are by yourself. *slight spoiler* There are missions in the game where you do not build towers. Instead you roam around a planet using drone guns to kill enemies. I don't find them interesting or fun. Luckily, they are over quickly.\n\nOverall, this is a great game. It's whit is amazing and the gameplay backs it up. It is well worth a cheap $10 price tag.","February 28, 2015","true","10.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Love the tower defense / base breeding meatbags / resource gathering meatbags elements. That being said, the robot levels are good at mixing up the gameplay.\n\nMaybe the title and some more development time on making robot controls smoother and robot upgrades persistant between levels are the only things holding this innovative title back.\n\nOverall the game is worth the ten dollars but has even more value on sale.","July 7, 2015","true","0.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I can already imagine some people rolling their eyes saying how an Early Access Game is supposed to be broken, buggy, or possible a pain to bear with. That's because the developer haven't finish adding all the magic that's suppose to make the game fun. Even though this Early Access game does indeed it's fair share of bug and glitches. (such as not charging resources for upgrade on certain instances/level, or the final boss's attack animation not triggering properly, etc.) I know that those problems can be fixed in future update. No, the reason why I strongly recommend most sane person to STAY AWAY from this game is because this game is suffering a serious case of identity crisis.\n\nAs some of you might notice, the player controls a robot, which act as your avatar, which can holds several different type of drones that you can control to kill enemy with. And there is also a command center to build towers with, which will also help you kill your enemy. The problem is, the designer can't make up their mind whether they want to this to be a tower defence game or a shooter game, so the level frequently gives you very limited build space (which means a certain speed boost structure is unavailable for those level as well), or limited special resources (i.e: the kind you need to build drones). So for player who enjoys "tower defence" games, they'll feel really frustrated when the game takes away their building space for building towers. And for shooters, they'll feel really annoyed when the game gives no resources or drones for their avatar to shoot with.\n\nTo be honest, I'm not sure what this game is trying to achieve here, if they're hoping to attract players from both genre, the developers shouldn't exclude either playstyle on any level; I might over look if it's limited on certain level, i.e: instead of a full fleet of drones, you get one or two. And instead of miles of open land, you're limited to an eighth of the game map. Both of which feels like a poor design choice rather than a mistake. Poor coding, graphics, or sound is likely to be fixed in future update. But in general, poor design choices aren't likely to be fixed. Therefore, unless you're a fan of both genre, and have a high tolerance for unpredictable nature of Early Access Games, I would suggest you stay away from this game.\n\nscore: 7/10","August 16, 2014","false","12.9"," 20 of 46 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","20","46","0","4"

Surprisingly good take on the tower defence genre!\n\nAt the time of this writing, the game still has some obvious rough edges with either being way too easy or way too hard, with little room to right the ship if you don't know what a level brings, though those moments aren't jarring, nor do they shake the experience of a very cool take on tower defence.\n\nI didn't put a ton of time into this game yet, though I have faith that it'll stay pretty solid.\n\nMy one gripe, given that I got this in a bundle, is that I'm surprised the game is going for more than $5.  It's a pretty simple game, and (my typical statement for games of this calibre) you can get something similar or better for a lower price on a mobile device.\n\nIf you see this game on sale, pick it up.  If you love tower defence games and want to try something a little different and have some cash to throw away, also pick it up.","October 19, 2014","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
