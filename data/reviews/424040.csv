I love that it's intuitive (learnt how to play within a couple of minutes and felt totally familiar with everything at the 30 min mark).\n\nReally looking forward to getting a chance to play this with people again. Hoping there will be a solid bot-based single player mode in the final release, and I'll enjoy seeing the game develop :)","March 3","true","2.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Gameplay is smooth, graphics are nice. The only thing up for improvement might be control over the length of the game. I can't wait to see the online multi-player mode develop for this. Excellent early access game for couch gaming.","March 5","true","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm glad I finally just bought it. I knew seconds into the game it was exactly what I was hoping it would be.\n\nIt's like a Tron-inspired dual-stick shooter with a glitchy 80s/VHS look and feel to it.\n\nIt's multiplayer only at this point. I do hope they add bots eventually, but even if that never happens I'll be happy with the purchase. They could even do a "campaign" with single-player or coop fighting from level to level versus bots.\n\nGreat variety of weapons, interesting power-ups and level design. The controls are perfect. It gets a bit hectic when the arena is spinning, sections of the floor are moving, the walls are closing in, and random red balls of death are raining down on you from above. Rounds rarely last 20 seconds. Most are around 5 seconds or less.\n\nOne quick fix that should be made is the scoring needs to be tweaked IMHO, or at least let players set the number of points required to win a game. Maybe that's somewhere in the options already, I just didn't see it. But a game can go 50 rounds before a player gets enough points to win, since you only get points for kills (not for accidental enemy deaths) and you lose points when you die accidentally.\n\nVery fun game though.","March 14","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"
