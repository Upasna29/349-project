Good tower defence games make this process happen invisibly and provide an experience that is both addictive and challenging, games like the seminal Defence Grid, which is considered the benchmark upon which all other Tower Defence games must be looked upon.\n\nComparing Terrorhedron to a Tower Defence game isn't really possible, because if Tower Defence is a formula, then Terrorhedron is algebra. It is mathematical purity and brilliance, expressed in abstract form. In most Tower Defence games you have a fixed path upon which the creeps will run and try to get to your base, you may be able to mess with this path by placing towers down, or you may have fixed locations upon which to build your towers.\n\nWait, what, I have root? ... I have root... muwahahahhaha. I HAVE ROOT!\nIn this case you do have fixed starting locations from which to build upon, but where it departs from the norm in this case is that the tower build points are merely bases, and from there you add lego like snap connectors from which towers can grow, tree like from the root node. The game takes full advantage of this, with levels working on every single plane of a three dimensional maze, often weaving complicated, tangled paths over cubes or more complex surfaces, allowing you to maximise your opportunities if you're clever and are willing to be imaginative.\n\nThat's the key bit, because you can use the snap connectors freely, the only limitation is really funds and how crazy you can get with the tower layout, want to build mighty archways with laser turrets hanging off? Go nuts. I just did for a section of the first level, and it worked beautifully. Here, you -build- the towers, step by step.\n\nDepth of field? Check. Abstract polygons? Check. Chiptunes? Check.\nWith such an expansive canvas, the aesthetic comes as a relief, being clean and abstract, minimalist but without looking amateur, game looks slick, well rendered, and has a thumping soundtrack, and doesn't suffer any framerate issues, regardless of what mayhem is going on at the time, and the clean design of the level layout allows you to keep focussed on the action. Doing the tutorial is mandatory this time, because Terrorhedron requires you to adapt to the fact that this game will have you building corners, arches, bridges, and all kinds of things to create your own defensive setups.\n\nEnemies in this game are represented in a similarly abstract manner, simple three dimensional shapes with various colours representing their health, it keeps things simple and allows for absolutely ridiculous levels of enemies on the screen at once, when combined with the insane combinations of bases and towers, this can turn into an exceptionally busy game in a real hurry. It keeps scaling as you go, so when your carefully constructed strategy begins to falter, you may find that you have to re-engineer and expand to ever greater feats of lunacy to keep the enemies at bay.\n\nTerrorhedron University is open, enroll today.\nIn Terrorhedron you take pretty much every principle you've learned from other Tower Defence games and then extend and amplify those concepts, turning them from basics to pure, abstracted concepts. In effect, the game takes the genre, strips away all the things that aren't needed and then refines what there is and adds a few key elements that in turn fundamentally require the player to abandon the comfort zone of "just build a tower", because it's never just a tower, not when you're perpetually adding and extending it. Tower defence is maths, Terrorhedron is the degree course.\n\nVerdict : Essential, even moreso if you are a Tower Defence fan, or a Tower Defence player looking to improve their skills in the genre.\n\nWriter and columnist for Just Reviews, where you can get similar fine reading material.

This is a fun and interesting take on Tower Defense which can be very challenging.\n\nThere are a variety of towers which you might expect in TD, such as single-target lasers, splashing cannons, and slow towers to name a few.  Where it gets complicated is the limited numbers and orientations of mounting points along the map.  This is when you turn to your 4-sided tetrahedrons and 6-sided cube pieces in order to expand your defensible area, which also allows you to place towers in otherwise-blind spots for coverage.\n\nUpon the last enemy's death (or when it reaches the gate and you lose lives) the round pauses for building phase.  Use this time to experiment with angles to maximize coverage of your turrets.  Any pieces you place during this time can be sold for their full cost, but once the building phase ends, all of these pieces will only be worth ~50% from then on.\n\nIf you like TD and want a fresh, fun, and challenging new game to play, buy Terrorhedron.","November 30, 2014","true","2.0"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","21","25","0","0"

This makes looking at the map in all dimensions and then thinking of how you will build a 3d kill zone in an area quite rewarding.\n\nThere is not a huge amount of variety in the towers but the game does give 3-4 solid different play sets with towers you can choose from, it feels good when you enclose a complete section and then have towers that the bullets bounce back and forth to deal a crazy amount of damage.\n\nThere are also some great additions that should be in all TD games, a damage counter for each tower for each round and a total so that you can see tactics that work better or towers lagging behind. A huge choice in different target priorities for every single tower, this is something that should be standard in all TD games!\n\nThe game has multiplayer also and at a recent lAN 3 of us spent far longer than we would have thought trying to improve our game and win together. It is a nice addition to the game and adds a lot more hours of fun to it.\n\nThe game is definitely a small indie game that is what I hope the first edition, I got it on 95% sale and paid 19 pence for the game and so my following niggles not so much pan the game but are improvements I would love to see on the TH2 and I will pay more than 19 Pence for it!\n\nThe units that you try to destroy are multisided shapes and you take off sides until they have no sides left and they are destroyed. This makes it quite hard later on to identify how bad the threat is as one moving unit could end up costing you the game as it has more than 100 sides and thus all your lives. I would assume this was done for ease but even some that glow would be helpful.\n\nThe camera can get very disorientating and annoying to use, there are hotkeys to mark camera points and I recommend you use them. When you build an enclosed box it is hard to select towers to build.\n\nIn multiplayer even the fastest game setting is quite slow and makes it quite slow to play.\n\nThere are quite a few challenging difficulties and an impossible mode, this is not for the feint hearted and one map took me nearly 3 hours before I eventually lost, unfortunately most of the time in this was trying to spend the huge amount of money I got each round and it would take 10-15 minutes to spend it all. This is a small gripe as this mode is not to played that often but a quicker way to build would be nice. Also anyone who likes Minecraft would love this mode as it turns into a TD version of it.\n\nAll in all, this game is very interesting if feeling like it has a lot more to be unlocked at some point. I highly recommend getting it even if you just play some of the easier settings on a few maps, it makes you think and mixes up the tower defence area.\n\nOh and I loved the soundtrack, one of the few games I play with music on. Make Terrerhedron 2!!!\n","September 24, 2015","true","13.2"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","0"

To succeed in this game, you must have to the mental fortitude to plan in three dimensions, as well as an abundance of creativity to maximise and extend the reach of your turrets based on limited nodes to build upon.\n\nIn the first hour of play you’ll learn to construct vine like constructs to maximise your firepower, since you can only place turrets on specified nodes or extend upon them via connectors. Balancing between the reach of your foundations and your capacity to damage, you’ll glow new vines across a few strategic points, eventually connecting them all in one gigantic network. All between rounds of steadily increasing waves.\n\nThe game can be mercilessly hard at higher difficulties, but it is also a rewarding experience to players that can adapt new tactics in different elevations and angles.\n\nThat said, the multiplayer felt tagged on at the last minute and it suffers from sync issues when I tried it. The lack of a map editor is also a major oversight on the developer’s part, as this could have so much potential if it had workshop support; potential that was wasted simply because the devs wished to work on a newer title.\n\nIf you wanted a relatively new take on the tower defence genre, you ought to give this a try. The unique visuals and catchy tunes are just icing if you happened to like the retro theme.","May 5","true","19.5"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

It makes everything different and more logical.\n\n--> For example:\nLet's say you have two weapon which can hit 100hp and you have two more which can hit 20hp. And your enemies have 80hp.\n\nIn other tower defence game because they hit the nearest one;\nFirst hit make enemies hp 20 and the second enemy pass away because as everyone knows power means slowness in that kind of games. If the second powerful one hits one has 20 hp then the second enemy still has 100 hp and your 20hp weapons cannot kill it.\n\nHowever in this game;\nYou can give the priority. This one will hit slowest one, this one will hit strongest one etc. This makes your game more logical and if we back the example, powerful ones hits the most strongest one then it compares 20hp with 100hp then it hits 100hp so your weak weapons can kill them.\n\n(++) Second most attractive thing is; there is not lots of nodes to build turrents. In the other games you have a path and you can build weapons on side of path. In this game you can build nodes to build more nodes or turrents. Therefore, you have to find the optimum balance for it. You can manage your money more carefully.\n\n(+) The path is 3D and this is a bit more difficult the other tower defence games.\n(+) Price is really funny. Kind of there is no price :)\n\n(-) Control mechanism of 3D view is weird.

Can be played alone, but is also a multiplayer game.  I've played with a couple people, and it's a lot of fun to have people to talk to and figure out strategies with.\n\nThere is a fairly large variety of turrets you can earn, each with 3 levels you can upgrade to eventually.  There are also 4 and 6-faced blocks that you can build structures with to place turrets on, allowing you to branch out from the specified, sparse turret spaces and make some really awesome stuff.  There's also quite a few maps, all with multiple difficulty levels.\n\nDefinitely worth buying.  The only downside is the in game chat system.  You can use it, but it's not very smooth.  You'd be better off hopping on Teamspeak.","August 26, 2014","true","3.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

It took me a while to get used to the 3d profile and building the tower bases but the learning curve is part of the fun and challenge to most Tower D games. That is the case here as well.  A mouse is a must in my opinion.  If you are used to a track pad you could probably manage though.  You must grind a bit to unlock towers and upgrades for them,  however, they do a wonderful job of scaling it so you are grinding as you are learning and unlocking new tracks and such so It does not become a bore.  It has some kind of 3-d effect option but I have no idea how that works.  Someone more tech savvy will have to comment upon that.  The game looks great without it.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty much the same as most tower d in principle.  Different 3-d shapes move around a set 3-d track.  You set towers in set places on the track and blow 'shells' - think layers- off of different shapes until there is nothing left and the shape is obliterated.  You also have a couple choices of bases that allow you to build more than one tower in a spot.  Use slows and offensive towers to kill all the shapes without running out of lives and you will beat the track.      It also has trading cards and achieves for those that are interested.  I had bought it at the super cheap price of .24 cents but it is one of the few games that I would say is worth the full price.\n\nI have yet to play the multiplayer modes and will amend my review to reflect that later.  Until then Game On!","July 12, 2015","true","15.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Usually I prefer games where I can control the enemies path, although sometimes those kind of games get boring after a while when you know the strengths of your towers and it is simply a matter of how fast can you win instead of "can I win this at all".\n\nSince in this game the path is predefined and can't be altered by anything you do, and the path is 3-dimensional this game presents a challenge. First you have to get around in thinking in 3D when placing towers and finding your kill-zone and then you have to plan ahead of how long you can wait placing new towers in order to be able to buy the expensive but effective ones.\n\n\nLike most TD not all towers and upgrades are available at first, you have to do a bit of grinding to get to the good stuff. After almost 7 hours I haven't unlocked all possible upgrades yet, but it took me a while to get around this 3D thinking required, so maybe it is possible to get all the content faster.\n\nThis game definitely needs a mouse to be played, the camera and controls are a bit confusing at first, but you'll get used to it after a while.\n\nPROS:\n+ 3D presents a challenge\n+ fun an really addictive game-play\n+ towers are built within a second (no waiting time for the tower to be completed)\n+ upgrading a tower can be done mid-fight without loosing precious attack-seconds\n\nCONS:\n- controls/camera take time to get used to\n- no in-game description for upgrades you haven't unlocked yet\n- you start out with 100 lives and loose lives whenever you let shapes escape, the amount of lives you loose depends on the kind of shape that manages to get through (still haven't figured out how many lives a certain shape is worth)\n\n\nCompared to other TD games it doesn't offer quite as much content but still manages to be fun for a couple of rounds. Given that it has less content (maps and towers) than other games priced at 5 bucks. I bought it on sale and I'd recommend you get this when it's around 3 bucks or less, that's the price it's definitely worth.","December 31, 2015","true","14.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If they shoot the weaklings, then the strong enemies have a chance to slip past it. This game lets you make these towers target only the strongest enemies. This is the biggest pro in my opinion.\n\nBuild bigger platforms: There are special 4 way and 6 way blocks. These allow you to build more towers in one space. These blocks can be put together, "like legos," to create chains of towers. Also, towers can't shoot things below them, so sometimes you need a these blocks to tilt the towers.\n\nSimple: No fancy PC slowing effects or confusing menus.\n\nHard: I couldn't complete the first level on easy until I unlocked the best turrent.\n\nCons:\n\nExtreamly slow camera zoom: I litteraly seen turtles craw faster than this camera zooms. Furthermore, I have looked through the entire program files, and there appears to be no way to change it. (If someone found a way, then please let me know.)\n\nFlawed EMP behavior: The EMPs will NEVER shoot an enemy that has already been shot by one, even after the effet wears off.  This means only the first couple turrents will work.\n\nCan't rotate 4 sided platform: These have angled sides, and sometimes they don't work well simply because the angle is wrong. Rotating these would make them much more useful.\n\nMismatched Acheivements: There are achievements for unlocking things and completing levels, but you never get the right one. Example: completing the Fortress level on easy unlocks the acheivements for completing the Gateway level on easy.\n\nMultiplayer is LAN only.","March 8","true","13.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You can create massive arrays of platforms to mount turrets, lasers and the like, even placing platforms on each other to enable a turret to reach unimaginable areas that a "typical" tower defense game wouldn't allow. The game also has an added bonus of some catchy chiptune music.\n\nI'd highly recommend this to anyone that loves the tower defense genre or even people that just want a game to lay back and relax.","October 17, 2015","true","13.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bluezero4/recommended/299720/","bluezero4","BlueZero4","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bluezero4/","170 products in account","The game lacks polish.\n\nFor example, the game features an unlock system, where you have to play the game more before you unlock the different tower types.  On the one hand, I suppose this system is intended to ease players into the game.  I would have preferred having everything to toy around with at the beginning; right now I'm playing the game just to unlock the types before I really start playing around with it.\n\nHowever, the isn't implemented into the UI well.  Locked tower types are greyed out before you've unlocked them.  The problem is that all unlocked towers stay highlighted, even when you don't have enough money to buy them.  I frequently try to buy towers when I don't have enough money, assume that I bought them, and look back to see they're not there.  There's no "you can't buy this" error noise, no flashing X over the button... just nothing.\n\nIt would have been nice to have the prices of the towers shown above the icons rather than only display on hovering over the icon.  It would also be nice to have your total money shown on the bottom of the screen next to the "buy" icons so that you can see more easily how much money you have left.\n\nAlso, when placing the towers, hovering over a tower placement spot should ghost the tower in and show its range.  I keep placing towers and expecting them to have their range 10-15% bigger.  It keeps feeling like tower placement spots *should* just reach a little bit longer, but they fall short fairly often.\n\nAdditionally, towers can't shoot at anything below their placement plane.  I was expecting the towers to be able to shoot downward within a ~30 degree angle; most tower placement spots are absolutely useless because they can't shoot at ANYTHING below the horizontal plane they're placed in.\n\n...and there's no resolution options, or framerate options.  And there's no options to turn up the shadow quality.  And there's no button in the pause screen to restart the level.  There really also could have been a way to go back to the beginning of the last wave.\n\n...and there's no way to change the controls.  And the game should zoom in more for each click of the scroll wheel.  And the game should zoom in toward where the mouse is focused on the screen.  And I have a brother who only plays games with controller support.\n\nI was wondering if this game was actually released or not.  A bunch of these ought to have been fixed in an Early Access phase.  But the game has been out for a year, and it's apparently not getting any better than this.\n\nJust get Defense Grid instead.","July 21, 2015","false","0.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

That applies here. Just because you think you can make a three-dimensional tower defense with the mobs going on multiple sides of a structure, it doesn't mean you should. It's just confusing and irritating. Also, the game has an experience system where you can't upgrade your towers until you've leveled up enough times to do such, which is particularly frustrating at the game's onset when you flood the map with towers and don't really have anything to do because you can't build anything else of worth and can't upgrade your pre-existing towers. Pretty dull, lacks the draw that a lot of games have, and I just can't see this as a worthwhile expenditure of anyone's time to play.","May 24, 2015","false","0.4"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"

On these points you may construct either a defense tower or install a triple adaptor and/or extension in order to set up defenses for parts of the level which do not have these insert points. These adaptors can be stacked as much as you like...\n\nI have no quarrel with unlimited creativity but when it stems up, down, left and right with unlimited avenues it begins to lose its charm quite quickly as you have so much option but very little drive to do so. There is no game atmosphere to give you any reason to play...\n\nInfinite ways of stemming out from insert points creates a game based on extreme patience and testing; something I nor most of my friends have.\n\nAlso, the theme of this game is very dull with simplistic cube styled levels, mostly unimaginative towers and enemies that are just difference shapes and colours to represent how much damage they can take as they travel through the maze... No, you cannot plan out the maze, only the defenses.\n\nThis game just gets boring extremely quickly and doesn't allow you to do a simple restart even if you DO manage to maintain focus upon this game.\n\nIf the theme was changed and each tower felt like it provided a more unique and useful design then this concept could become an okay game. The problem really is that this game is just an unimaginative geometrical bore which will most likely find you quitting not because you failed, but because you failed to get to the point of failure.\n\nThis is boring and dull but could be made better with the existence of some imaginative graphics and more interesting concepts.\n\nThis game I would rate a 35/100 due to its boring gameplay, unimaginative style, Lack of polish and the biggest no no of tower defense games: Leaving out a RESTART LEVEL button.\n\nThere are better games out there which will provide more fun and charm, including veteran TD players.","October 26, 2015","false","0.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I can't recommend it in its current state, but it's fun to play. It's less polished than the original Cubemen at launch, if that gives you some idea. The co-op multiplayer is some janky type-in-IP ♥♥♥♥, the graphics are less stylistic choice and more babby's first 3D renders, the music is annoying and not very good, and there's no meat to the game besides a tacked-on level up system to pad the game out and restrict your building options.\n\nI mean this is not a good game by any stretch. It's pretty fun, the fundamental idea behind it is solid, but I feel like selling this as a finished product is really, really pushing it.

I find the camera the most annoying thing in the game. The graphics are plain and look very boring. Killing an enemy is not very rewarding because the money that you receive is based on shots, which could give you money issues. You are able to level up (character) and you will learn new towers and other things. The character level is saved forever, even if you left the game. I played on easy, which was nearly impossible already to complete the 2nd wave without losing a life. Mostly the money that you are receiving is just too low.\n\nThe music is bad and more of an annoyance.\nGraphics are not that interesting and very simple and plain.\nYou can sell and upgrade towers.\nYou are able to speed up waves.\nCamera could be annoying after awhile. Rotations and everything. The execution of the camera is really bad.\nThere are 5 difficulties.

The guys you shoot are different colored triangles and your towers are rather bland as well. No story or anything. Nobody is on multiplayer. 6 different maps to play for single player and thats it. Pretty bare features. The ideas of them moving around these strange shapes is kind of cool in concept, but its actually super annoying because the camera control is probably the worst I've ever seen in a game. One mouse you click and hold and can move side to side, the other rotates, then you use the the WASD to zoom, or the mouse wheel, but either way takes too long to be helpful. You constantly forget which mouse button does which, which isnt good when you have to follow the guys around this winding flipping track, you end up more annoyed than anything else. There are only a few preset areas you can build, and the targetable areas make no sense. In the first level I built a tower on top of a ledge, overlooking the path. But the tower couldnt hip them because I couldn't see from my view but they went up the wall and flipper under. So it was a waste and early so I lost. Why even have that preset area something if it cant shoot. You spend half the time flipping around navigating the map to try and find placeable spots but you never are sure if they will be effective or hit the path, because of some dumb rule they made where you can shoot sideways, and up, but no down (??). I place another turret in a preset spot because i wanted to kill them but it was next to a path where they go up and down and got instantly blocked by them going down. It just makes it frustrating rather than inventive. There are also no-rebindable controls in the game. The fact this type of strange path game on weird geometry shapes exists would be ok, but the terrible camera and controls make it 10x worse. I would lose because if anything got past I would get lost trying to maneuver the camera around to find them on their random ♥♥♥ path and by then it would be too late. I also couldn't ever tell if the placeable turret would work because of the angle they would be at compared to the path, so you can't really react and fix the problem of them getting past. There is this strange and confusing 4-6 way branching thing you can place that you can then place the tower on one of the branches, I think effectively switching its direction, but it costs money and you only see how it works once on a basic tutorial level. It would have been better if they didn't need that and make the turrets fire properly, like placing them upside down they can fire to the side and below. 4.5/10. Not impressed. Developers seem super cool and still respond to the community though, so props to them for that.","March 5, 2015","false","0.5"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","25","3","12","2","0"

The camera could have different control setup for one thing.  Maybe a button to swap mouse pointing and mouse camera control.

This is an interesting change to the tower defense formula and adds a new layer of strategy. The other main difference Terrorhedron adds is the ability to build connector blocks to tower locations, meaning you can turn a single tower slot into a defensive megastructure.\n\nThe music is great and really adds to the minimalist tech feel that the game provides. The enemies are all colored shapes which change depending on how many hits they can take. Towers are unlocked throughout play at a reasonable pace, I never really felt like I was grinding for a new tower or being given too many options too quickly. You can also upgrade your towers which generally provides them with a new ability rather than just a stat boost, which is great.\n\nI can't think of any real problems with this game. I have been having a ton of fun with Terrorhedron and if you are a fan of tower defense games I think you would too.","December 5, 2015","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The unique twists here are two: 1) though you have a limited number of spots upon which you can build towers, you can build structures that add more platforms for building. 2) The stage twists into three dimensions as does the platform building. This allows for some pretty cool and unique strategies.\n\nThe graphics are nothing special but are fitting. Same can be said for the music. The controls are a tiny bit wonky, but nothing that really hurts gameplay. Though I believe it offers no advanced features like multi-select or such.\n\nI'm personally not a huge TD fan, but I dug this one a bit.

The game truly comes alive as soon as you start using the trees to build off in dizzying directions. No place to put a unit? Cobble an insane hodgepodge of trees around to wherever you want it. Forget the ground, hang a dozen turrets right over the path and make them walk the gauntlet. With enough cleverness and cash you could win the game from a single build spot. I strongly prefer to use the 4-way trees instead of the 6-way for the surprising element of organic chaos they introduce.\n\nNo game will ever be "optimal" and no two games will ever feel the same, unless you consciously force it. Sell-back is cheap to encourage continuous urban renewal of your garden; in fact, the most basic turret sells-back for the same price at level 1, so you can stick 'em all over to figure out what has coverage and what needs more.\n\nThe main downsides are that the camera controls suck (left and right click are reversed to my intuition, zoom is too slow, and grabbing hold of things to rotate is incredibly random), and there's no endless mode. I also wish it'd show you the firing arc a unit will have BEFORE you buy it. Despite being "done" I hope they revisit it someday. You'll start getting used to the controls, but you'll stop cursing them when you get sucked into how insanely involved it gets.\n\nTerrorhedron is some of the most fun I've had with a defense game in years. Once it clicked, it really, really clicked.","October 15, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played for about 20 minutes and instantly fell in love. It vastly differs from other games of its kind. Whereas with typical tower defense games you have a grid or pretermined locations where you can place towers, and those towers sit there and do their thing, this game instead gives you base platforms on which you can build. You are able to construct almost tree-like structures covered in towers which you can use to obliterate your tiny foes as they attempt to progress along the little track to which they are bound. The simple graphics, chiptune music, and sheer uniqueness in the gameplay make this a great game in my opinion.\n\n10/10 would build laser trees again.","October 4, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well here's 418.\n\nTerrorhedron is absolutely worth the $4.99 for hours and hours of fun.\nMind you, I play with a couple friends, which makes any game all the sweeter.\n\nI can't believe I only have 10.4 hours in it right now, but I can tell you I am nowhere near done with it. Hopefully by the time you read this you see something like 40 hours on record for me. Seriously, this game is fun.\n\nTerrorhedron is a 3-dimensional tower defense game that runs pretty smoothly, takes a little know-how to get multiplayer up and running, and will test your strategic capabilites to the max. Just when you think you have everything in the bag, every turret you could possibly need, you need 10 more for some tough-guy smug-faced cube. Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ that cube. He will take you out on the final round at the very last second.\n\nThe upgrades feel balanced, and the late-game could have some more dynamics, but I have still found the game to be difficult enough to justify where it is right now. I can see an update hitting it in the future that adds a new turret or changes the damage values of higher-tier turrets, but as-is the game is fantastic. Go buy it, for you and your friend.","August 12, 2015","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The stacking ability for your turret mounts is a nice one, and you can get some fun builds going in all directions.\n\nI will probably tinker with this one, but some things make it not as fun as it could be.  The camera could have different control setup for one thing.  Maybe a button to swap mouse pointing and mouse camera control.  The way it is now is kind of sloppy and I find it difficult to get the camera looking at what I want and that doesnt work well if you need to build during an attack phase.\n\nIt has a few flaws, but I like the concept and I will at least play it now and again.\n\nThis is like a 3/5 or so.","November 9, 2015","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NinjaDaTaco/recommended/299720/","NinjaDaTaco","Sean Gold","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NinjaDaTaco/","32 products in account","Terrorhedron is a nice and simple tower defense game with a unique mechanic that really changes the way you play these types of games. This game is great if your like me and your internet isn't the fastest in the world and you have to wait for youtube video's to load. Creating a fun and unique experience with a suprisingly challenging gameplay when you get to the higher difficulties and levels.\n\nTerrorhedron dosen't offer anything special with graphics, with the area just being white and black blocks with very minimal decal. And the background being space themed, but in all honesty is suffices for what this game is trying to achieve, this game is really not about the graphics and more on gameplay.\n\nNow what makes Terrorhedron much more different and unique from the rest of the tower defense games is that they have included a 4-way platform and a 6-way platfrom. These add a way more immense gameplay than any other tower defense game. These platfroms can be placed and create almost an infinite amount of possibilites you could do to place your various turrets, allowing for amazing strageties. This makes it so you are not just stricted to a set amount of places you can place your turrets in and even create a wall of just turrets destroying all the shapes in your way! The turret selection is nice and standart, you got your normal laser turret and your aoe turret but nothing amazing or special like you see from games such as the balloons tower defense.\n\nAlso a very nice addition to the game is the ability to play multiplayer, which is a nice feature to have. Though after playing a couple of matches with friends, you find out that the money system being split into two is a little broken as if you sell one of your turrets, the money will instead go to your friends which can be annoying and also I feel like sometimes me and my friend don't earn enough money after a round which leaves us with 90-100 which is only half of what I have to pay for a single basic turret. Another thing is that it's not synchronized with the other person, for example, one person might have already finished a round but your still stuck on the last cube being destroyed. It can sometimes mess up the game and the stragety you are going for, atleast in my experience.\n\nTerrorhedron is a great game for waiting for something, a very challenging and fun game, but with the constant need for internet connection and the buggy multiplayer it isn't in my opinion worth the $5 your are paying for it, I got it on sale for 0.49 but really I reckon its worth around $2-3 dollars.\n\nOverall Score: 7/10- I would definitely reccomend this game to anyone trying pass the time.","November 11, 2015","true","22.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

This is an interesting change to the tower defense formula and adds a new layer of strategy. The other main difference Terrorhedron adds is the ability to build connector blocks to tower locations, meaning you can turn a single tower slot into a defensive megastructure.\n\nThe music is great and really adds to the minimalist tech feel that the game provides. The enemies are all colored shapes which change depending on how many hits they can take. Towers are unlocked throughout play at a reasonable pace, I never really felt like I was grinding for a new tower or being given too many options too quickly. You can also upgrade your towers which generally provides them with a new ability rather than just a stat boost, which is great.\n\nI can't think of any real problems with this game. I have been having a ton of fun with Terrorhedron and if you are a fan of tower defense games I think you would too.","December 5, 2015","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The 3D construction of turrets is refreshing, and the limited building spaces force you to get creative with your placement. The game is admittedly much harder than most TD games I've played, which adds quite a bit to the game's entertainment value. The controls can take a bit to get used to, especially moving the camera around and whatnot. The amount of different turrets that can be built along with the target priority settings and upgrade paths make it a lot more in-depth than your standard in-browser TD games. Great game to just zone out to with some music on in the background and play for a few minutes here and there. Would recommend.","June 24, 2015","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well now you don't have to look no further, this game took a original design and added 3D to it with some pretty cool level design's. Which I actually think it helps you keep focus, because with the 3D and the camera system helps you be able to focus and parts of the map instead of a whole.\n\nI would first like to say, if you want a cheap and great tower defense game then look no further. This game, which not only took a original design and added 3D. Made quite a bit of skills levels, and even went further into just the gems them self; example: they turn into a hexagon and a lot other shapes, but then if you watch the gems they have some abstract shapes to. But over all I think you should get this game I got for only $00.49 USD, reason I say get it is it has its own twist to it so you can add platforms to the main platform. Which make's for some cool builds and idea's, like connecting platforms to make a gun car wash over the gem walk way. ( Which I have found to be a good help. well when you have the money that is! )","July 25, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/t-minus/recommended/299720/","t-minus","all muted. pings ignored.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/t-minus/","201 products in account","WOW.  This game's awesome.  Concept's the same as all other TD games, the little creeps that you have to kill travel on a set path, and you have several fixed tower positions.  But the awesome thing is that you're able to build base blocks with MORE tower spots on them.  So let's say on a map, you've got just one tower spot to build on.  You could put a cube-shaped base block on that spot, giving you five more build spots on that block (top and the 4 sides).  On top of that cube, you could put ANOTHER cube-shaped base block, so now you've got 8 sides and 1 top build spot.  So far, I've seen the cube-shaped base block and a triangle-shaped base block, not sure if there are more to come, but with just these two, the possibilities are endless.\n\nThe turrets, I have yet to get the hang of.  Sometimes I'll place a turret in a spot and think it's gonna fire and be very effective, but it just won't function at all.  But, if you build to check out the turret's firing distance/directions, and then sell BEFORE you start the round, the tower/baseblock sells for full price.  You're always getting XP and unlocking stuff, too, so losing doesn't even feel terrible.  Feels almost like I'm MORE encouraged to play as I lose, making mistakes is rewarding me with more skill.  I dunno, I love it so far.\n\nThere's maybe a half hour learning curve.  The camera's tough to get the hang of at first, the UI's really barebones, and I'm not able to find a controls section (probably isn't one), but if it's possible to rotate the base blocks, I definitely want to know how.  Also turned the music off -immediately- because no sir.  Developers, if you're reading this, I can compose a far better soundtrack for you, or just let you use an instrumental album I've already written/recorded.\n\nI just can't stress enough how great the gameplay is.  Anything in this review that even sounds remotely like a drawback, it's a minor gripe that I honestly don't care about.  Bells and whistles can go to hell.  The strategy in this game is second to none.\n\n8.5/10.  Maybe a 9.  I'd give it a 10 if it came with flashier graphics (I'm picturing RUSH meets Defense Grid 2), the ability to rotate base blocks, an easier camera, and a pause button.  Took me 20 minutes to know I'll be playing this game for years to come.  Basic UI, basic graphics, and GENIUS, spectacular, limitless gameplay.","July 26, 2015","true","67.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Music is nice. But with a good game comes it's flaws and personally my issue is the camera. Not saying it's terrible but it's a little tough to control. with limited placement spots for your turrets your offered 4 sided stands which do as they say offer more room for turrets. you can even build more 4 sided or 6 sided stands on either of these for a branching amount of possible turret placement. as i mentioned before turret upgrades are unique and basically turns into a bada** Laser side show if you can get far enough. one last thing the game can be very difficult without strategy (easy mode can be difficult without strategic placement) that sums up my review 8/10\n\nP.s Developer, Please add a Level Creator would really appreciate it Thanx 4 the game","July 26, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
