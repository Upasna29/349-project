Plus it still looks good, you can adjust the graphics in the settings (car details etc). There are settings for a wheel set-up (force feedback etc), however you can play it with a Xbox 360 controller as well. You have four driving perspectives to choose from: cockpit, over the hood, bumper and third person. There are weather effects in the game.\nIt has all sorts of assists: AI difficulty, damage realism, automatic gear shifts, brake and steering help, tire and brake wear, as well as indicative arrows for corners and gears. So in theory anyone can play this game. You can adjust everything of importance: gears, tires, brakes, differential etc. The AI can be adjusted with impressive range: timid, clean, realistic, aggressive etc.\nTo sum it up: great driving physics, awesome sound, nice selection of tracks and cars. GTR gives you an immersive GT experience.","December 11, 2013","true","4.8"," 39 of 41 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","39","41","0","0"

The game doesnt offer much in terms of things to do though the racing is quite fun and intuitive so the is a minor learning curve but with practice anyone can be good. Anyways great game if you get it cheap.","July 19, 2014","true","0.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Really only a necessary purchase for competitionists as GTR2 has basically all the content found in this game plus a whole lot more.\nThe force feedback settings need to be tweaked, (search for feels real to me for GT legends and use those values.) but once you've done that there's still fun to be had here.","December 28, 2014","true","2.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

DAVENPORT","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198061031748/","11 products in account","Hi to all of my freinds on "Facebook", "Steam",  or any other  "games related to the "steam" related network. I have just purchased "GTR" via my "Steam" account, and I have to say to anybody who used to own this game, back in the days of "M/Soft" XP, that this game has now been upgraded to "WINDOWS 7" COMPATIBILITY. The graphics are a lot better and clearer than the games predessor on the XP version. If anybody still owns the XP version, it will not play on "WINDOWS 7". I have had the origional of this game on XP, which has been collecting dust for the last 2yrs due to non compatibility with "WINDOWS 7". The GTR car racing series is a pretty good range of games to buy. On the market at the moment, there is GTR 1, GTR 2, GTR EVOLUTION, GTR LEGENDS or RACE ON,  which I believe is now also part of the GTR series of games. I now have the complete range of this series apart from GTR LEGENDS.I can recommend all of these simulation games to the ultimate motor racing fan or anybody who fancies their chances of having a great adrenlin rush and testing their racing skills against the best drivers of these games.  Good luck to you all and enjoy yourselves. All the best everybody.  (COLIN.D.)

Even further games like Assetto corsa or Rfactor give this a run for its money.\n\nLastly it may say i have little time in this game but ive clocked in many hours into it and sadly its not aged well.","December 16, 2014","false","0.2"," 4 of 20 people (20%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","20","4","20","2","0"
