"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kritzien/recommended/317380/","Kritzien","Fluffy Destroyer Of Worlds","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kritzien/","74 products in account","Cliff Notes, Worth it but the start was weird.\n\nThis game was released in 2006 so the graphics are to be expected of an indie game from that time that is to say decent to good and fitting for the story but not going to win any awards. The combat as far as I could play was fairly simple. However it did seem that combat would become far more involved with higher tier units and larger total fighting forces.\n\nDifficulty, most of the difficulty for me came from the interface itself. In order to select or target a unit you have to click the actual unit model rather than the hex they are on. This is an important distinction. I also found difficulty in locating my units on each new level. Neither of these have put me off the game however.\n\nPlot, weird. Okay now to the actual review. I walk in thinking I'll be helping the Folvos army, then load up the tutorial and plot twist. Okay helping Vasgalan empire now. Read decsription another plot twist helping Folvos again. So if you like plots that aren't mandatory and will make you very confused pick this up.\n\nThere used to be a game destroying bug of doom however it appears to have been patched as part of the steam integration. Well done Lonely Troops. So even if the game may never get multiplayer it appears that at the very least bugs making it unplayable are going to be fixed.","August 9, 2014","true","1.4"," 40 of 42 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","40","42","0","3"

No; promotions, awards, keeping you best units. Its also confusing, there seems to be no rhyme or reason to when or where you can repair/heal and reload your ground units. While you are trying to figure this out, you run out of time. Still, if you like a tough challenge, give it a go.","August 30, 2014","false","10.8"," 24 of 34 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","24","34","2","0"

Decent visuals, good audio, solid although slow gameplay mechanics and interesting unit variety make this game easily worth Â£3 in my opinion.","January 30, 2015","true","0.5"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"

It is a very strategic game and little mistakes can cost you alot.\n\nStory    There isn't any thing Good or too emotional in the story. It's just a normal story which I would rate 6/10. You can play on two sides though which means two stories.\n\nGameplay    The gameplay is very good. I didn't find any glitches or bugs in the game so far. And it is very smooth, just like an indie game should be. Gameplay is  9/10  from me.\n\nGraphics    Graphics are pretty good. The animations and the models are very nicely made. It just makes the game look like a nice indie game. So Graphics  9/10 .\n\nOverall, I would give it  8/10  . A very cool game that you should play if you like strategic games (Specially the hexa ones :3).","April 22","true","2.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

War on Folvos offers players the chance to play as either side, the invaders, or the rebels. Each side has an interesting mix of units - some based off of real-world vehicles.\n\nThe combat mechancis are good, with units having a set number of 'action points' per turn that allows them to maneuver or shoot - or both. Additionally, there is a logistical layer that limits fuel and ammunition per unit. Both sides have repair/resupply vehicles that keep units supplied and repaired.\n\nOverall fun game. Good price. Pick it up.","April 24, 2015","true","2.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"
