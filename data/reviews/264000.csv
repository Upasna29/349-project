When you enter the world of Nor you are assailed with nostalgic feelings of Magic Carpet, Gothic 2, Myst, Alladin and other Shaherezad tales. The game gave me that googly eyed feeling of listening to a campfire story from the village elder.\n\nOnwards to features... You get to throw rocks, no wait. You get to bury a lizard in a pit of sand, charge up a rock with awesome wind power and ram it in its snout at supersonic speeds. Or toss some lava rocks at em and watch em burn. You make the rules. Aaaaaand once you pile all the corpses in a neat pile in the corner you can grab a cup of tea and wrack your brain on the intricately designed puzzle that lets you get to the next room.\n\nObviously this game needs polish and work, but the framework is solid. Devs seems to be dedicated to making a good game. And once they get the cash, feedback and time the final product is sure to impress.\nPS: You get to throw rocks... Any SWTOR Shadow needs to get this game like NOW!!!","July 24, 2014","true","3.2"," 62 of 72 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","62","72","0","2"

The game has an original fantasy story and Zelda-like puzzle dungeons which I enjoy. But the game’s core experience is its physics based combat. You raise and lower the ground, you throw stuff at enemies, you throw enemies at enemies… you get the point. It’s a lot of fun and very rewarding. Combat can get out of hand in larger battles. But it hasn’t frustrated me yet. Simply reload and retry - I usually manage well the second time around.\n\nIt was a wonderful experience to see how the game (bumpy at first) got more and more polished and complete with each patch. The indy developers published funny behind the scenes videos almost every week since before the Kickstarter. Now that the game is released, including recorded voice, intros and so on I cannot wait to play it in full glory from start to finish. Because, once again, smashing your opponents with large chunks of rock is such soul pleasing fun :)\n\nAppendix: After playing through single player\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat a wonderful game. Learning new skills and progressing to more complex fighting mechanics is very well done. After about a third of the game, I started to control my abilities with a lot of precision and so I could start to control encounters. It became so much fun to get the hang of a new enemy type and then wreak havoc amongst foes. Phisics based combat is something larger titles usually refrain from. Mostly because so much can go wrong (glitches, exploits...). It's remarkable how well it works in Son of Nor.\n\nA good change of pace and also my personal favourite in Son of Nor are the puzzle dungeons. If you like Zelda, you'll like these dungeons. Level design and puzzles are pretty clever. Though most of the puzzles are rather easy to solve, there is a tricky one or two\n\nIt's nice to see that in some parts of the game, sneaking past enemies would have been a viable option. But then again... I control earth, wind and fire. Come get some.","March 31, 2015","true","18.3"," 50 of 56 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","50","56","0","0"

The story/lore in Son of Nor is very unique/intriguing and is the main thing that pulled me to play it. The story is very great, but there are so issues I have with this game. Two of the big things is the fact that the multiplayer is so dead, and the voice acting is very bland at times. With this being said the intriguing story, platforming, puzzles and cool telekinetic powers (Pick up stuff to throw and terraform sandy areas) really pulled me in to play and keep playing. I really just wish multiplayer had a place, but unfortunately its dead as of now.\nPros\nCool mechanics\nInteresting story\nInteractive environments\nAwesome Co-op\nSandbox/Proving Ground mode\nPlenty of graphics options\nGreat controller and Keyboard/mouse support\n\n\n\nCons\nDead multiplayer\nVoice acting is bland at times\nA few performance issue (I had none, but I’ve seen a lot of people complaining about it)\nCombat is a bit clunky\n\n\nConclusion\nSon of Nor is really fun and a great experience, but does have a few problems. (Nothing game breaking or completely annoying) The multiplayer seems completely dead, but the single player and co-op is really where this game shines. If you are looking for a really cool story with great puzzles, platforming, and powers, this is the game for you.

The last one I enjoyed being the Tomb Raider reboot, yet Son of Nor pleasantly surprised me.\n\nThe back story is actually rather interesting, and it’s rare a game these days has a decent back story. One of the developers narrates and explains what the game story and setting is during an intro cutscene.\nRight from the start the gameplay mechanics and movement system worked brilliantly. It's actually one of the smoothest controlling games I’ve played in a while, There is no latency between issuing a command and it executing. Jumping platforms and picking up items worked brilliantly, and it certainly helps that the game’s performance is also great.\n\nMotion is smooth, and responsive, the game runs well and plays even better. The graphics might look a decade out of date, but the gameplay easily makes up for that.\n\nDid I mention the beautiful water effects/physics? No? Well it’s amazing! The game is certainly an oddball, with visuals that look very dated, but gameplay, and mechanics that could easily surpass many games that have come out lately.\n\nIn fact it handled better than Tomb Raider for me, and even allows you to use the Emotiv Brain Computer interface, for really getting into character as a mighty telekinetic.\n\nPuzzles are also solved using your telekinesis, and I’ve never been good at puzzles in games. Easily getting stuck on the most simple of them. Yet here, well; I rather like them. The designers really knew what they were doing and puzzles are introduced very early on in simple quests.\n\nThere’s someone stuck in some sand, quick! Lower it with your powers to let them out. This man needs help carrying melons, here, use your powers to lift and move them to a set area/pen.\n\nThese might seem like boring quests, and that they are; but they give you the underlying skills you need to solve some rather complex and amazing quests later on. Such as breaking a pillar, and using it on a massive pressure plate, which in turns activates some sort of later that kills if you’re too close. It shows you how to increase and decrease the distance of the object you’re controlling and more. A rather great game design.\n\nThere’s even a little tidbit some people might even miss entirely, and I loved it! During the intro cutscene it’s shown that both primary races were created from sand. If you kill an enemy, their body reverts to compacted sand. The same for your character as you take damage; the more damage you take the more of your body reverts the material of its creation.\nFrom dust to dust, a rather brilliant little thing to add to the game and play on its very lore.\n\nNow the music? Well, it along with the rest of the game so far is phenomenal. I really, like the music. They really put in some effort here, and I could easily just stay in an area and listen to it.\n\nAll in all Son of Nor is a great indie action-adventure game. They seamlessly blended their mechanics into the gameplay and it just works. Plus it’s damn good fun!\n\nI could easily recommend this as an early access game, and you should certainly keep an eye on it. Yes the game still needs quite a bit of work, but it’s got a very good base already, and I’m eager to see how the game develops.","July 25, 2014","true","2.3"," 43 of 56 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","43","56","0","0"

I have no idea, but I could speculate that whatever API is used for controller support was messing up the mouse controls. (all Unity 4 games seem to have this bug, the first time you start the game the mouse is broken)\n\nOk, so it seems to work now. Here goes a quicky review:\n\nI haven't played through all of the single player yet, but the game offers very nice and colorful graphics with very interresting effects. Yay for sand waves! Audio sounds fantastic. I'm very excited to play through this game now! Gameplay is a 3rd person view and a magic system that is easy to use. It's quite hard to describe, but very easy to learn the basics.\n\nImpressive for early access and since I got the mouse working I'm changing this to big thumbs up.\nThe only thing I'm missing is more than four players for online games, but hey, four is better than zero, which is what many indie games offer. (network code is hard, really hard)\n\nLooking forward to a full release and seeing how Stillalive studios will continue to develop this really interresting game idea. ^_^\n\nEDIT: got more gametime in and the single player mode is EXACTLY how you introduce players to new games and hook them.

From a fairly small team comes this title which allows you to terraform, use telekinesis and manipulate your environment to swing things in your favour! Multi-platform, extensive co-op/multiplayer modes as well as co-op story mode with lots of challenging levels and puzzles. Combine magical powers with your friends and make fire tornados! Who wouldn't want to be able to use their mind to throw boulders at your enemies' head?\n\nGameplay?\n\nThe gameplay reminds me a lot like Jedi Academy while the visuals and the feel of the game makes me think of Stargate, Indiana Jones and Prince of Persia. Not a bad combination! It forces you to think about your surroundings and the abilities you have to hand in order to defend yourself. Unlike a lot of action-adventure games, you don't wield weapons but have to use elements and take advantage of your surroundings. You can kind of use weapons, but not physically hold a spear, but take it from a Sarahul's hand (the bad guys in this game, like big lizard men) and throw it right back at them. There is also freedom to choose different paths as to how you're going to proceed to your goal. Are you going to go stealth? Go in blazing and take on an army of lizard guys? Flank strategically with your friends? Up to you. For an Indie game title, it's not as linear as you would expect. I believe there is roughly 12+ hours of gameplay available single player and/or co-op, plus PvP arenas and a few other multiplayer game modes.\n\nCool stuff, GADGETS!\n\nAnother thing which really caught my eye was the amount of gadgets you can use in this game. It's compatible with Oculus Rift (although I believe there are some tweeks needed), Tobii EyeX which is an eye sensor bar and finally, EPOC Emotive which enables you to almost literally control the game with your mind! Other than being awesome features, it really broadens the market to other avid gamers who may not be so physically able to enjoy games. Having eyetracker software, and being able to train your hardware to the thought patterns of your brain is truly astonishing. Again, I don't know of many Indie games that enable you to do this. So kudos to Stillalive Studios!\n\nOverall?\n\nWell, I can't be the judge of this game only you can. With anything I would always advise to check out some gameplay of something first and this would be no exception. I personally think it's a really cool little game and a bit of a diamond in the rough. The team at Stillalive have been awesome to everyone by listening to feedback, developer diaries to keep you up to date with changes and to give you a chance to express your views whether they're positive or negative. You can tell a lot of hard work and love went into this title and even if the game isn't your cup of tea, you'd still want to support the developers.","April 1, 2015","true","4.3"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","28","32","0","5"

It looked fun thought the graphics needed a lot of work (around 2012 I think) and mainly because it is a small indie team. But now playing the beta version in 2014 I see so much improvements in the graphics department, it's literally a new game and looks great!  Character animations need a lot more polishing but I suppose that will be fixed for the final version.\n\nBut the real meat of the game is not the graphics itself but the powers that you have: telekinesis, fire, wind,  and the most awesome of all terraforming! So imagine that an enemy is chasing you with shooting arrows, you can easily terraform the sand and create a barrier. This could be used to climb to another places! And mixing all this stuff in multiplayer is insane and fun, sometimes just messing around with telekinesis is pure fun.\n\nJust messing with stuff is so much fun, you can grab materials like rocks and trhrow them using the power of telekinesis. I was really surprised the moment that I  and even the enemies to throw to other enemies.\n\nCan't wait to play the final version and to see how all the story folds. Right now the game it's in early access stage so don't expect to be a finished release and you can also help with feedback (they have a tool inside the game I think for that).\n\nNote for the record: I have played this game a lot more than the hours here in steam, since I have played the very early alpha builds and some beta builds too.","October 28, 2014","true","9.3"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","29","36","0","0"

I wish more games had a terraforming element to them and not be based around the 'God' genre.\n\nHere are my first impressions and overall commentary of the first few stages of Son of Nor:\nhttp://youtu.be/A0NyWe6sw1A\n\nEven though this is only an early access game, the amount of content and game that is actually playable still warrants a solid playthrough and will most likely fill up most of your day if you're just a casual gamer looking for something new and out of your normal genre.\n\nREVIEW UPDATE:\nThere are a few areas that need to be worked and these are as followed: (IMO)\n\nTextures: Some aren't too bad but they could use with some blending in some areas, such as rock faces and areas where the textures are tiled could use some blending or realigning.\n\nCharacter/s: Character models could use some work with their motion/s and the main character needs eyelids to blink. Them eyes are popping out of his head at the moment.\n\nMemory: I'm not sure why a game of this calibre needs to use much memory! I have 16Gb of 2400Mhz RAM and this game uses 1.5-2.0Gb on idle doing nothing at all but inside the in game menu. Memory optimization needs to occur.\n\nSupport/Fixes Needed:\n- Starting the game for the first time does run it in fullscreen, however the Fullscreen option in the menu is not ticked/activated.\n- Support for greater resolutions higher than 1920x1080 (Full HD). With the current immersion of 4K and Ultrawide displays hitting the market, resolutions need to be bumbped up or supported if possible. I myself have an Ultrawide monitor with a resolution of 2560x1080 and aspect ration of 21:9.\n- Selecting the preset graphic quality from the current drop down menu is somewhat of pot luck. If you select the 'Fantastic' quality option and then accidently select 'Beautiful', some fiddling needs to be done in order have the 'Fantastic' graphic option appear again\n- Some Dialogue needs to fixed to make it easier to understand who is talking\n- Some collectibles cannot be collected","July 28, 2014","true","8.6"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","23","29","0","0"

The developers put a lot of effort to make the most out of it, so it can be easy to forget that it's just a very small indie game and should be considered as such.\n\n"Son of Nor" is a combination of adventure, action and puzzle game built around an unique combat mechanic: Instead of using normal (or abnormal) weapons, you command the world and the elements around you using your extraordinary telekinetic and elemental-magical powers.\nThese powers remind of "The Force Unleashed", the puzzles and archeological adventures of "Tomb Raider".\n\nBut the "Son of Nor" is not only a mere explorer: the destiny of his race, that fled into a hidden refuge from the threat of total extinction 400 years ago, depends on him, his special powers and his wits. If you are smart, you can even decipher an ancient alphabet to reveal the secrets of a past long-gone and the frightening future soon to come.\n\nNo worries though, the gameplay itself is rather streamlined and its puzzles were reduced in complexity so that even less patient players should not have much problems to move on. The more challenging riddles are only optional and give access to collectibles, more powerful spells and insight into the surprisingly elaborated plot.\n\nSo even if some aspects seem unpolished and far from state-of-the-art, the conception of the game flow is certainly not one of them, and this is an outstanding achievement. There are multiple facets working together hand in hand to make it very dynamic, fluid, complex and offering lots of options, while still being very intuitive:\n\n- The controls are very intuitive and responsive and help to materialize your intentions effortlessly (with some exceptions like rotating objects, jumping and switching specific elemental spells).\n- The saving system builds on smart use of checkpoints.\n- There is a surprising variety to combine spells and "tricks" with each other. Even after beating the final level of the game you will not have seen them all!\n- There is no ammo management.\n\nOn your quest you will be able to snatch three energy crystals that each can be filled with three elemental charges of wind, fire and spirit essence obtained from obvious sources in each level.\nThese sources will regenerate after a small time. This results in a very dynamic gameplay as the powers at your disposal will constantly change. You will run out of elemental power or objects to shoot, but at the same time defeated enemies, dropped weapons or destroyed environment will offer new opportunities. Or you can decide to take the fight close to a source of elemental. It's up to you.\n\nThis is definitely a refreshing and unique gameplay and makes "Son of Nor" special and worth of a recommendation!\n\nThe presentation is quite good for an indie game, but of course you can't expect a triple A production value.\n\n- The music is very well done and fits perfectly. Especially the combat music is doing it right, it doesn't annoy me like in most other games, and the gentle drum roll that signals the end of each fight is very welcome.\n- The voice overs are from top-notch actors and are well done.\n- The art concepts and graphics offer a lot of nice sceneries.\n- The models are ok for the most parts, but the Sarahuls don't cut it. On the other hand though I am glad that the lizards look a bit goofy and more comical than realistic. This makes sadistically experimenting with them a lot less sick and cynical.\n- The animations are acceptable, but lacking in some areas: There are no face animations, and no proper animations of turning characters during cutscenes.\n- The graphics engine has nice effects, but in some areas severe performance issues.\n\nGenerally the game shows a lot of dedication, but at the same time evolves the certain kind of charm of indie type amateurishness through occasional deficiencies in story telling, presentation and discrepancy between aspiration and delivering.\nSo even if you are in for nitpicking, you will have a lot of fun dissecting every single flaw of this game.\n\nAnd most others will enjoy the game in any case.\n\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n(There follows the former short version.)\n\nThe gameplay of this Kickstarter title is similar to the Jedi Knight series (or sequels), especially "The Force Unleashed", just without any lightsabers or weapons of the normal kind.\nWell, except if you are able to telegrab a sword from an enemy, then it can be turned against the former owner – or his boss. I just was able to fatally headshot a boss with the sword of his servant... What can I say, I had no elemental powers left, you gotta take things as opportunities arise! Needless to say that it was very fulfilling to see the blade stick out of his body after it turned to sandstone (as every inhabitant of this world does after death).\n\nThis is typical for the very fluent and dynamic gameplay of "Son of Nor", you make your plans up on the fly and intuitively improvise your attack strategy. The very intuitive and responsive controls almost always do what you want to do (except for the lack of ability to rotate things). This is done much better than in "The Force Unleashed".\nThe checkpoint saving system is subtle and smart; a big improvement over the quicksave failure in games like "Jedi Knight / Outcast / Academy" which ruined the gameflow for me.\n\nThe production value is good – for being an indie title.

There are too few games that have local co-op in campaign mode to be picky. I played 2 hours with a friend, and it was good fun.\n\nBut, as a single player game, Son of Nor just isn't worth the time when there are so many better single player games out there.\n\nThe gameplay is dull. There's only one tactic effective against each type of enemy, and only a few different types of enemies. Telekinesis, which doesn't require mana and is available from the start, is the easiest way to kill most enemies, so there's very little reason to use the spells that cost mana.\n\nThe story is not very interesting. I feel like a lot of it was lost in translation, because there just isn't much there. It alludes to there being a lot more lore that wasn't explained. Also, I have no idea what happened in the ending - did my character save his people, or cause the destruction of the world, or was it a cliffhanger? I have no idea. It just cut to credits.\n\nAs a better alternative to Son of Nor, I recommend the game "Tiny and Big: Grandpa's Leftovers". It has similar telekinesis-style mechanics, but is MUCH more fun and it has a coherent story.","April 10, 2015","false","12.8"," 24 of 32 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","24","32","0","11"

I have just played a couple of hours so far, so I haven’t finished the single player campaign yet, but I already love the implementation of how you can use different powers. you can terraform your surroundings to your advantage (for example by lowering or elevating sand) or in order to solve a puzzle and use telekinesis to throw things around and fight against enemies. there are also some magical spells you learn later on. it is the balance between action, puzzles, and exploring that makes son of nor so good.","April 2, 2015","true","6.9"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","17","20","0","0"

It can barely handle even those tiny portions of the game filled with few enemies and items to smash and throw about.\n\nCharacter animations are non existent, from running to talking it looks unpleasant, like it was made years ago. I would rather play it in first person view just to avoid seeing those weird running stickmen hands and legs. In fact - it should've been first person, like Dark Messiah. Though i guess we would have to stare at those horrible, motionless, low polygon npc faces then... sigh.\n\nThere are bugs, there are slowdowns, the story doesn't make any sense whatsoever, with unknown names, places and characters introduced for no specific purpose. Oh that person cared for someone and betrayed us? Its fine - he's dead now. Lizards want humans dead? Humans saved by birds? Birds gone away? Long faces whatstheirnames saved humans again? Why is it so unnecessarily complicated, convoluted and why do you pour so much info in the first 5 minutes of the game? Surely there are better ways to present the world and its story than that?\n\nThere's also a disconnect between scenes, music, sounds and characters which almost gives me one of those "omg how did it make onto steam?!?" vibes. Its not THAT bad, but at times you can almost feel bad coding, graphics, animations and characters voices misaligning into something resembling "Garry's Incident" or "Slaughtering Grounds". Though, i will mention it again - its not THAT bad.\n\nI suppose what i am trying to say - its not finished. Its unpolished. Its bugged, its laggy, the dialogues are horrendous and the animations (except levitation, which looks pretty neat) will make your eyes bleed. The game is just too ambitious for its own good.\n\nBigger levels, first person view, scratch the story, make it a sandbox with terraforming, telekinesis, fireballs. Heck - a multiplayer arena with all of those same spells would've been amazing. Sadly - no one is playing this game in co-op, the server list is empty.\n\nI suppose i could've overlooked bad story if the game had bigger levels and better animations, or i could've overlooked tiny levels and bad animations if the story was amazing but (and i am sorry for that) - i can't recommend this.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUPD:\n\nI really wish there was an option for a "neutral" rating. While i would not personally recommend this game, i feel that voting down the game you got for free might be a little bit unfair. Thankfully the developers are nice and understanding and a lot of people disagree with my opinion, so this particular review shouldn't be a problem for those who still want to try that game.\n\nIts just an opinion after all.","April 1, 2015","false","3.2"," 34 of 58 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","34","58","2","4"

I was able to get across the abyss in the caves (of where the antharis egg is.) by maknig a bridge with my telepathic abiltities but there was no" lesson" on how to do this at least not a CLEAR explanation on how to do it. you seldom hear your avatar speak except THIS IS THE WAY I CAME FROM!! lol\n\nnow the negatives are out of the way THIS GAME IS ONE OF THE BEST GAMES I HAVE EVER PLAYED and I must have played near 100 different games over the years..  It was long-very long and well worth the money. The story well thought out and unique  with good characters and good chosen names for each of them - noldric etc.  I liked the various range of paces too - sometimes the game required your quickness on the controls for instance when fighting  at other times you are  free to explore at your leasure. you always know what you need to do next so theres no pointless wandering (unless you WANT to freely explore). it reminded me of the "myst" and "uru" franchise (regarding mainly the scenery) but with  available powers and alot of "action". Its also Like "uru" in that you can choose what your avatar will wear and receive at certain points in the game such as an arm shield , you can also choose male or female.

That's taken care of.\nA strong example: The first version was simply unplayable on my machine (<10fps  hiccuping). Then a few updates later, on the same machine, it was running smoothly at 60fps and much better graphic quality.\nYes it is not the *most* beautiful 3D rendered world. But what is not there in terms of gloss allows your mind to take far better hold of the world and free your imagination. Some effects however are worth notice, like the water & its physics.\n\nSon of Nor is a beautiful 3rd person action adventure game, with a nice story and strong lore. You will care for the protagonist(s). I won't spoil it here.\nSome nice touches and attention to details will reveal more about the world than is written.\n\nIt semi sand-box play with ESP powers (telekinesis, pyrokinesis...) is pure fun, and very intuitive. The gameplay keeps improving and is now almost perfect in some areas. And above all it is smooth and feel very dynamic.\nPuzzles are mostly physic/power based, and can be quite inventive, growing in complexity without becoming too difficult or feel repetitive.\n\nThe music is nice, and some of it excellent.

The level design looks like something you'd expect from a late 90's early 3d platformer. It all feels too designed and not something you could actually live in. The controls are ... off. Things that should be easy take way too much effort to pull of. Like creating a slope so you can reach a collectible on a high rock. Or creating an air bridge with rocks. I got those things to work but the game was constantly working against me. Your character will often clip through the rocks you've floated in order to create steps. They also won't rotate so that the flattest side faces up so you if you don't clip through you'll slide off instead. Controling objects you're levitating is also finicky with a controller. Rotating objects that are part of a puzzle works but took much longer than it should have. Character animations are stiff and stutery. Heavy rocks bounce around like they're made of styrofoam. Puzzles are very standard and fail to surprise or entertain. There are simply too many issues to make this an enjoyable game.","February 8","false","1.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Last night I accidently noticed Son of Nor on the steam home page & I almost broke my mouse while mashing the "Buy Now" button! I went through it already & I'm going to play it all over against at least one more time on my own and a few more times with different friend groups and last but definitely not least - I'll have genuinely fun experience while going through the Co-op with my girlfriend. There are so many great things about this game. First - it's developer team is one of the best ones I've seen (and I've seen a lot), so don't take this statement lightly. Rarely you'll see such activity from such a small team (when even huge ones are doing so bad), so many promises delivered & so many more to be! Second - the game is greatly innovative. I dove into the game without prior knowledge of it's gameplay, story or anything. I made sure that I know literally nothing of Son of Nor when I clicked "New Game". The mechanics are great even if a little clunky at times. The spell system is great - both in how you unlock everything & how you can use it in later playthoughs & in the multiplayer, and how the spells work. Story is great & I actually found myself digging for bonus lore, searching for collectables just so I can find more stuff & when the Bible of Nor was bestowed upon me - I was more than happy to eat it with it's covers! ^_^ About the spell variety - I can't stress out how hard for a game with completely new spell system is to make all aspects of it worth while! I found myself using absolutely everything non-stop in this game while in most others I just find what is "best" & "most efficient" & I just go with it from beginning 'till the end. Here it's not like that & credit Must be given where credit is Due! Good Job Stillalive Studios! About the pacing of the game - it's not perfect but it's really good & I saw on the forums that the developers actually changed the first 2 levels after receiving players feedback. This happens like once every millennium in the gaming industry. Again cudos to the dev team! The more I see the more I'm expecting from them but that's the thing, ain't it? We as gamers & consumers hardly expect anything of much value. We're used to be treated like consumers & we're used for big companies to milk their old cows even tho those cows are drier than the deserts in Noshrac! Also this game rewards explorers. I also found myself constantly going everywhere (except for when I really got hyped on the main story line & I just wanted to know What Happens Next!). Single Player is a Great Experience which I hope that anyone who reads this review has either experienced or will exp it! I also had the luck to try out the multiplayer with one of the developers. Even tho he lagged a bit - I had immense fun. And I must add - I'm a hardcore competitive gamer to the bone! And I played PvP without a single care of who's going to win. It was just so fun! But tbh I can't wait to find at least one person to get together with so we can practice some advanced techniques & fully optimize the potential of this great game!\n\nFrom the gamer who's played it all - Buy Son of Nor!","May 22, 2015","true","16.2"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","1"

However, I would still say this game is well worth the price. While the story/dialogue is somewhat confusing, the actual gameplay elements are truly one of a kind. The combat takes some getting used to, but overall, it really is a unique experience. Launching sharp/heavy objects from your surroundings at your enemy can be quite exhilarating, but also having the option to bury them in sand, or drop them off a cliff makes for some interesting styles of fighting. Having no UI is actually implemented quite well in my opinion, and turning to sand to indicate losing health actually feels natural. But where this game really shines is with the puzzles. It makes excellent use of telekinesis, and while some of the puzzles can be a bit confusing at first, once you realize what you're supposed to be doing, they actually have some very clever designs.  Overall, this game does have some rough edges, but for the $20 asking price, I'd say it's money well spent. and if you can get it on sale, then I say definitely grab this game. There really isn't anything else quite like it.","April 10, 2015","true","2.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The art style is great, the story is well in depth, but most importantly THROW EVERYTHING AT EVERYTHING!!!  Telekinesis and Terraforming  is a real friend as you navigate through puzzles, finding unreachable areas and rewards. I have yet to see any action in Multiplayer, but maybe with the game's full release, thatll change.\n\nHowever, because of my obselete graphics card, its a little difficult with clipping lag. You'll need a more modern day GPU to better enjoy this.  Also the other issue is being careful as you target single objects for TK as the reticle is pretty precise.\n\nOverall, using the powers of Gods to dispose of obstacles has never been so fun and challenging. So I would give this game a shot since it's just $20.\n\n","March 31, 2015","true","5.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/micbemac/recommended/264000/","micbemac","micbemac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/micbemac/","146 products in account","I recently got the opportunity to spend some time with Son of Nor from Stillalive Studios. In this action adventure you take control of the elements and set out into the unknown. Tasked with protecting the last standing home for all humans, you quickly jump into the action.\n\nEquipped with your power to control the elements, and it's setting, I can't help but be reminded of The Last Airbender when playing Son of Nor. The early tutorial section quickly gives you a glimpse at several basic powers. Taking advantage of the physics based engine, you control the earth, sand and wind around you. This allows you call rocks, broken branches, dropped weapons, even fallen enemies to your use. Throwing these objects at oncoming enemies, or at obstacles to clear them.\n\n\nThe early game play is quite simple, with your first quests having you aid the small starting town. Later you get to defend the town from it's lizard like foes. Generally though the only danger comes from falling, or mishandling your powers and accidentally dropping a boulder on your head. The quick feel of power however is rewarding. There are several other powers and abilities to be gained as you explore the world. The power over fire and water for example. You can also combine these powers to make more powerful attacks. Flaming tornado anyone?\n\n\nVisually Son of Nor isn't the best looking game. There are many clipping issues, textures pop in and out, and the polygon levels are fairly low. This is early access however, so many of these issues are likely to be smoothed out in later updates. The overall vibrancy of the game is subdued as well, with mostly neutral colours in the pallet. Lots of browns, and beiges don't add much life to your surroundings. The powers however work fairly well, and the control scheme is easy to adapt to.\n\nAll of the early scenes contain full voiceovers. This adds an element of polish to the game, however the voice over quality is a bit over the top and a little campy. The campiness goes along with the general storyline. There is a detailed story here, but it often feels like bits and pieces of other stories we have already played, or seen. What does come to the surface though is the developer's sense of humour. There are a lot of silly, funny lines in the game, some characters often complaining about you terraforming the ground underneath their feet gave a few laughs for instance. I have only spent a short time with Son of Nor however, so I am hopeful that the story will improve as I dive deeper into the game.\n\n\nThe overall sense of power early on makes Son of Nor a fun play. You get to smash a lot of stuff to your hearths content. As you earn new spells, this sense of fun continues throughout the game. The lighthearted comical nature of dialogue, though campy and sometimes overly silly often still adds to this fun. I hope that later parts of the game, are more colourful and vibrant than the early zones to encourage more exploration. I will definitely keep an eye on Son of Nor's progress and check in when they next update.","July 26, 2015","true","1.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

I want to see more, I want to see it done better, there are some ideas and first steps here with brilliant potential and in the hope they someday see the light of day I don't regret giving the devs my money.  But it's too laggy, a bit buggy at times, way too unclear on occasion, and the control scheme for doing the cool things you need to do just isn't there yet.  To put that last complaint in perspective (since I think that's the big thing that earns a 'I do not recommend' rating)... imagine portal.  Now, imagine you had to pull off button combos to place your portals and then add a couple of different combos for orienting the portals different ways.  The same basic amazing game is there but it's now made nearly unplayable by some major problems.","June 23, 2015","false","0.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

Just a bad game in every way but the physics based combat and enviromental control idea, but that is put into action so poorly you'll wish you just had a way to punch your foes on the nose.

I even lowered my resolutions from 1920x1200 to 1280x720, yet still the issue persue.  More on the topic of graphical issues, the 'telekanesis' ability when picking up rocks, in fact anything you pick up has a glitchty outer texture, whether that was supposed to be some sort of glowing effect- I do not know, but it was not well executed either way.\n\nOkay, enough about performance issues and graphics, more onto the gameplay. Do not get me the wrong, the story has a good concept just the characters seem too wooden, emotionless and the whole dialogue just seems to be cliche, typical. The transitions seems to be unnatrual, with instancing between certain areas of the level you are on, meaning you get a loading screen for fixed points in the level. Most items you can control with your abilities, along with shaping the ground with terraforming, I believe that due to most things be prerendered, you get a lot of lag on the start of levels.\n\nCombat is poor, I was expecting good combat with these great concepts, but mostly the AI is poor and enemies are too easy to deal with after playing 3 levels there is no challenge present (I am also playing on hard difficulty). And NPCs do most of the killing for you, which again, ruins the experience.\n\nIn conclusion, I would not recommend this game- it was a great idea but sadly was not expressed or brought out upon it's full potential. Which is a shame.","April 5, 2015","false","1.4"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","4"

Early on in the game, the player encounters an enemey camp that they must go through to get a powerup. Unfortunately, this is next to impossible, as the frames drop to less than 1/s due to the never-ending river of enemies that poors out. The menues are literally unreadable on anything but the highest quality setting, and since when is a minimum requirement of an nVidia 8800 a reasonable design descision? 8800's and higher should be for those players who want to get a little extra oomph out of the visuals, they should never be the base requriement. Based on the promotional videos, it seems like the devs spent thier time getting the game to work with some (admittedly really cool peripherals) when they should have been spent it to make the game run at more than 10 fps whenever there are any number of enemies on screen. I'll end on a positive note: the terraforming feature is a lot of fun, and the story sound incredible. I just hope that the devs optimize the game so that its playable.","April 22, 2015","false","10.7"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","27","3","11","3","2"

Its sooooo lame.  I just can't... I played 10 more minutes and removed from library.  The game is awful.  Terraforming is clunky and tedious... i went through every battle simply holding shift and clicking and killing everything.  Subtitles will have exclamation points, while the voice actor simply talks with no emotion. (except for Tanath, his voice acting is pretty decent).  There is ZERO enjoyment here.  My original  review still stands.\n\nI played the tutorial, or some of it, i dunno... i played for 20 minutes.  I got bored and turned it off, to me it just seems like a kids game or something.  Cheesey art, Cheesey story.  All i did was Pick up a rock, throw it somewhere.... Pick up a person, throw him somewhere...Pick up everything, throw it all somewhere.  Which, even MAYBE that would be fun, except that it looks super lame when you do it.  You don't feel like your smashing anything, or really destroying anything, everything feels light, physics feel off, FPS bogs constantly.   Its like a dull platformer from the N64 days lol. (not graphic-wise, just boring wise lol).  Granted, i only played for 20 minutes, but to be honest, i kind of expect to be "captured" by a game in the first 20 at least enoughto to want to dig in a little more , enough to want to continue to learn it, and play it at least.  The devs seem real nice though, reading through other comments, they seem anxious to hear feedback and seem very professional.  So maybe this gets patched into something better.  For me however, i just dont see myself turning it back on.","April 28, 2015","false","0.6"," 5 of 16 people (31%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","31","5","16","4","0"

The controls are janky as all heck.  By janky I mean that, holding a rock with Telekenesis feels like you're throwing spitballs, but pick up a character and it's like you're trying to move Mt. Everest.  The story is contrived, with the writing on the level of something you'd find in your High School drama class.  You're commonly thrown into sections with lighting so bad that you literally can't see what's killing you.  You'll run into a bush that kills you in less than 3 seconds, while jumping off a cliff that would kill a mountain goat leaves you with barely a scratch.  The camera finds wonderful ways of embedding itself in scenery and the levels are so linear they might as well be on rails.\n\nThere is some definite creativity here.  So much potential.  Given a good team, this could have been a great game.  Instead, it's relegated to the bargain bin section, with bland textures, and character models so stiff you'd swear you're playing  Han Solo in Carbonite.  Oh, and the UI?  Ha!  Just wait until you turn on subtitles, and then realize you can't read them because half of what is said is formatted off-screen... then realize that the spoken sections, while admirable, is voiced by the same person, dozens of dozens of times...\n\nSave your money for one of the other hundreds of fine games.  Skip this one, you won't miss much.","May 28, 2015","false","2.9"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","20","2","10","2","0"

The writing is roughly at the level of a seventh grade fanfiction. I played it both with controller and keyboard/mouse and I couldn't decide which I disliked more: the imprecise aiming of K/M or the difficult camera of the controller.\n\nNevermind the INSANE list of bugfixes and "level revamps" that came out A MONTH after it was released.\n\nThis plays like a kickstarted indie game rather than the AAA knockoff it wants to be, which is such a shame. I could forgive much of its flaws if the spellcasting were cool enouch - but sadly, the design of the game isn't polished enough to encourage the player to immerse themselves.\n\nSave your money.","May 21, 2015","false","1.1"," 3 of 18 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","3","18","0","4"

The game also seems to fail to register some button presses and the default keymap is completely wrong (ie instructions on the screen do not relate to the default button map).\n\nI have also tried the game windows (with the same xbox360 controller) and it was a completely different experience. Buttons are mapped correctly and the controller worked perfectly. I doubt this game was designed with a gamepad in mind though as it still feels a bit clunky and my fingers were having to do a lot of work just to run,jump, and move the camera at the same time.  Some sort of camera follow option might fix this.\n\nThat said once I had it running the gameplay seems quite fun, the plot is interesting enough and the puzzles kept me challenged at the right level\n\nI also tried it with the Oculus Rift DK2 (I know its alpha) and found it completely unplayable as I could not get head tracking working.  Based on the resolution it sets up I suspect this might be build to support the DK1 instead.\n\nI still have hope that this will be a fun game however due to the controller issues I experienced I cant recommend it to anyone that wants to play on Linux.","April 7, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"
