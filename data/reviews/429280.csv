This game isn't going to tax the little grey cells too much; it's more something you can play when you have a few minutes to waste, or just want to play something mindless to relax. Instructions are clear, the story is simple and the gameplay is fun. So far - and I haven't played much yet, but I play a lot of these games - this promises to be one of the better examples of this genre. Haven't found any negatives yet but if I had to be picky I'd say it was actually too easy.","April 22","true","0.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"
