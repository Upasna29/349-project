"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rankmenotplz/recommended/429220/","rankmenotplz","ReadingLies","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rankmenotplz/","2045 products in account","Introduction\nFullBlast is the first game that is made and published by Indie Dev UFO Crash Games with an Action/Shoot 'Em Up theme that is inspired by the same classic gameplay from older platforms.\n\nGameplay\nAs far as the gameplay goes for FullBlast, it follows the standard pattern of a Shoot 'Em Up game with some unique additions and adjustments.\n\nThe arsenals that you have at the start of the game are your trusty, auto-fire blasters which can be upgraded as you collect power-ups and the bomb/grenade that provides invulnerability for a few seconds.\nThere are also other power-ups that can help you to progress with the game such as the shield, rapid-fire, and 1-UP power-ups, and a power-down which is represented as a red spiky ball that drops your fire rate.\n\nAll in all, the game has 12 levels/areas for you play with bosses per area that has different mechanics from the other previous ones or a bigger version of a normal enemy.\n\nThe Pros\n+ Clean Art Design - I am a fan of clean graphics as well proper execution in layout styles, which is clearly present through the game. Most of the assets are even posted in their Community Hub and is really a sight to see.\n\n+ Great Audio - Arguably the best attribute that this game has to offer. It showcases great heavy metal soundtracks which really fit the action theme and blends well with the gameplay.\n\n+ Local Co-Op Ready - An addition that is always welcome for SHMUPs! However, due to some technical issues (which was also discussed in the community hub of the game), this game only supports LOCAL CO-OP at the moment that this review is posted.\n\n\nThe Cons\n- Lackluster Gameplay - The problem to why this game doesn't appeal that much falls generally into two parts. Most of the AI patterns are quite simple and easy to predict and the upgrade selection that is present as you play through the stages is also somewhat insufficient to make it stand out.\n\n- Weak Backstory - It follows the cliché of aliens invading Earth (and taking over different areas which serves as the levels in the game) and our heroes taking action to save our world. Now, there's no problem with having a cliché setting. The problem always come with how it is executed, and it is pretty much skipped detail in this one. Not a single characteristic that makes the two main characters shine, dialogues are generic and repeatedly used and on top of that are some vulgar words that came out of nowhere.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThough it is undeniable to say that the game has a fair amount of weak points, it follows a proper standard set-up for an action game that makes it worth the try to say at the very least.\n\nRating: 6.8/10\n\nThis review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games.","April 13","true","7.3"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGameTutor/recommended/429220/","TheGameTutor","TheGameTutor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGameTutor/","3112 products in account","The premise of FullBlast is pretty standard, aliens are invading earth and its up to you to pilot a ship destroy everything and save the day.\n\nThe gameplay in FullBlast is also fairly standard, split over 12 levels this vertical scrolling shooter sees you fight waves of enemies before finally reaching the Boss at the end of each level. Firstly 2 very important things to note. This game is definitely not a bullet hell shooter even on the hardest difficulty setting and on easy most shooter experts shouldn’t find a play through of it too difficult. That being said the games difficulty does ramp up fairly sharply in the last third.\n\nWhat is very cool however is that the enemy patterns across the levels are randomly generated so unlike most Japanese shmups released today you must always focus on spawns rather than learning the patterns.\n\nThe weapons in FullBlast are a little underwhelming to be honest even after several powerups they never get a lot more than simple dots moving forward or a collection of dots moving forward. As a big fan of the Cave shooters this left me a little disappointed. An interesting thing to note is that when you die you lose all of your upgrades which is very different to most modern shooters where you have to re-pickup the powerups that spread Sonic rings style upon death.\n\nThe game does not seem to have any real score system to speak of past getting points for killing enemies. There is not combo system no colour switching shenanigans or anything really past simply getting points for killing enemies and in a shooter released in 2016 this is a shame. Definitely a shooter for the more casual fan.\n\nVisually the game is very nice to lookout with the 12 stages spread over 4 visual styles of background. While the game is inspired by an 80s/90s shooter it definitely looks like a 21st century release. Sound wise is where the game really shines with a great metal soundtrack that really adds to the feel of the game.\n\nSo to sum up I actually quite enjoyed my time with FullBlast. It is definitely a more casual shooter than some I have played recently and definitely doesn’t add anything new to the genre. This is more a game I could see my Dad playing which makes him remember playing 1942 back in the arcades or introducing a new gamer to the genre rather than one aimed at hardcore shmups fans. That does not mean it doesn’t have a place but just be wary of that before you buy that this is one for those who fancy a trip down memory lane than a hardcore shmup to add to their collection.\n\nFor our video review please visit us below.\n\nFulBlast video Review	[www.thegametutor.co.uk]\n\nTHE GAME WAS REIEWED USING A CODE PROVIDED BY THE DEVELOPER.

But that a side when you play FullBlast if like me, you will almost have a surge of memories stretching back to those old classical vertical shooters especially from the 80’s and this game is a nostalgic throwback to those days spending your pocket money on Arcade Machines. In the 90’s my games library was taken up with vertical shooters as I made my way through the 16-bit era so I have had some good and bad experiences and went through a fair amount of controllers!\n\nNow the first thing to understand about FullBlast is it isn’t going to suddenly change the genre in any spectacular way but what it does do is update it in a way that makes it a pleasure to play without the sudden impulse of throwing your controller at the screen. You pilot an aircraft shooting at the hordes of alien, insect and plant like foes through 12 challenging areas!\n\nI got through the first three stages with ease but then suddenly noticed the game crank up a gear with bigger threats along the way not to mention the area boss fights, where certain encounters move the game to a rotational perspective all though not new it’s something I haven’t seen in a lot of shooters to date.\n\nFullBlast doesn’t bring anything radically new to the table, but in my opinion it really is a well polished modern styled 3D addictive vertical shooter with the great addition of co-op which seems to be an inclusion that a lot of similar titles leave out! My only complaint is I would have preferred a wider range of weapons!\n\nFor the price you will literally have a blast with this game (pun intended) With 12 areas and 3 levels of difficulty, a solid rock soundtrack that does a good job of keeping in with the momentum of the game. It will happily test your reflexes and I think UFO Crash Games have found a sweet spot where games like this are far and few between lately.\n\nIt really is a no brainer for gamers who have enjoyed the old classics like Terra Cresta, Air Gallet and Gunbird and are happy to enjoy a little nostalgia on the way! I have added a video of my First Playthrough to give you an idea of what to expect from this great little Indie title!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JasC6HjF7BI\n","January 28","true","0.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/recommended/429220/","genkipro","genkipro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/","2517 products in account","NOTE: This game was given to me by the developer for review purposes. This did not influence my review in any way.\n\n==========================================================\n---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------\n==========================================================FullBlast is a modern take on an 80's style shoot-em-up.\n\nPlay single- or two-player and take on the alien invasion that's threatening the Earth.\n\n==========================================================\n----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Graphics - The graphics in FullBlast are clean and colorful 3D (although the game plays in two dimensions), with a cartoony feel. There's only a small handful of themes to the levels in the game, but each has its own feel, although there are some shared enemies throughout. The players' fighters and enemy units are pretty enough and move about well, but the firepower graphics are a little underwhelming. Neat touches like explosions that include comic-like 'BOOM!' text add character.\n\nSound - The soundtrack is a thumping rock-like beat, reminiscent of an 80's shmup, which is presumably the sound the developers wanted. Shooting and explosion sounds are okay, but nothing special. It all gets the job done.\n\nGameplay - Gameplay is typical 2D shmup, similar to old classics like Twin Cobra. Play one or two players with keyboard or controller and dodge bullets by raining glowing energy death on the invading aliens.\n\nFullBlast starts out well, with a nice gentle difficulty curve, relatively slow moving levels, and relatively slow-moving aliens shooting not-too-fast moving energy 'bullets' at you. Your first weapon upgrade makes a significant difference, as does the next one, but all too soon you've hit the too-limited maximum upgrade, and after that youve seen most of what the game has to offer.\n\nThere are two weapon paths for you to go down: straight or spread. Each has only a minimal number of upgrades available, so unless you're dying often -- which you shouldn't, the game is mostly very easy on normal difficulty -- once you have maximum spread or straight (whichever you prefer), you might as well just ignore any more upgrade drops.\n\nThe game also includes the stereotypical 'bomb' in your arsenal, but you start with only one and in 12 areas I only came across one other bomb pickup, so they seem to be too rare to worry about too much. in any case, dropping your bomb causes a firestorm to start at the bottom of the screen and progress rapidly to the top of the screen, wiping out any enemies in the process. It's effective and looks okay, but I've only seen it twice in about three hours of play.\n\n==========================================================\n-------------------------------------PROS & CONS------------------------------------\n==========================================================Pros:\n+ nice clean 3D cartoon-like level graphics\n+ relatively true to its 80s shmup influences\n+ Steam achievements\n+ trading cards\n\nCons:\n- not enough variance in levels and they are a bit bland; repetitive areas within each region\n- not enough variance in enemy types\n- not enough weapon upgrades; too quickly max out damage potential, which is fairly unimpressive\n- no variance in speed or attack patterns; later bosses are just more of the same earlier bosses\n\n==========================================================\n--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------\n==========================================================FullBlast is a nostalgic return to the types of games I played in the arcades in the late 80s. It offers modernisation in the form of improved graphics, but due mainly to too-limited upgrades and repetitive enemies and bosses, doesn't quite manage to grab me the way classics such as Twin Cobra did. Recommended if you want a few hours of fun, collecting cards while you're at it.\n\n5/10\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here!","February 3","true","3.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","9","13","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198109626876/recommended/429220/","76561198109626876","TwitchinSal","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198109626876/","813 products in account","As a fan of scrolling shooters you learn to be somewhat wary of titles not developed in Japan, whose arcade culture has continually refined the genre almost since its inception; the sentiment goes double for smartphone titles. That being said, this particular entry appeared to show some promise at a glance, so I figured I'd drop the couple of bucks and see what happens: since you've already seen the recommendation icon you have a general idea of how it went, but I'd suggest you keep reading for a bit, as there are a handful of noteworthy things going on here.\n\nLet's begin on a positive note: the game's simple but bold visual style translates very well to a full-sized screen, and backgrounds "evolve" a bit as you go along (i.e. you see more alien landing craft and ruined buildings in stage 2 than in stage 1). A handful of cartoony onomatopoeiae ("boom", "whoosh", etc.) add a bit of additional personality to the proceedings; the brief story dialogue sequences come across as tacked-on and not always grammatically-sound, but that's hardly a rarity in shmups, so I'm willing to give them a pass. The movement speed and fire rate feel good too, and bullet visibility isn't a major issue. I also came to appreciate the brief audio cues that signaled the appearance of a powerup carrier formation or large enemy; it's a minor thing, but I liked having an idea of what to look for in the next moment or two when something notable was about to fly onscreen. It also runs nicely on my none-too-impressive laptop and supports both digital and analog controllers out of the box.\n\nUnfortunately, past this point things start to get somewhat sloppy; first and foremost, the game's 12 stages are lengthy and filled with loads of oft-repeated enemy formations, which cancels out a lot of the aforementioned visual charm as the proceedings (and the repetitive metal-guitar soundtrack) drag slowly on and soon wear out their welcome. The unexciting weapon selection (a standard straight-ahead shot or a 3-way whose spread is not worth the reduction in raw power, plus a single, albeit handy, homing missile if you power all the way up) doesn't help matters.\n\nYour plane's hitbox is on the large side, which isn't in itself a condemnation, but on occasion you'll find yourself in situations where a clean dodge seems next to impossible (and your limited smart bombs don't grant invincibility either); the developer has taken the lazy route out of this dilemma by granting players a generous health meter which is topped off after every level, in addition to occasional refill and shield items (more on those shortly). As such, even the "Hard" difficulty level is unlikely to challenge most anyone with even a rudimentary grasp of shooter fundamentals.\n\nThe final major issue lies with the power-up system: while carriers show up at regular intervals, their cargo appears at least partially randomized, which means during one run you'll be swimming in guns long after maxing out, while in another you'll have to avoid several "booby prize" shot-speed-down spawns in a row. This applies to every single enhancement you can get, including 1-ups, spare bombs, and the point doubler, which is as close to a scoring gimmick as the game offers; in one fell swoop, legitimate score competition is rendered pretty much dead in the water, as a fruitful run will boil down to luck far more than skill. The fact that certain enemies and items can't be hit/collected when they're too far towards the edge of the screen serves as one more indication of a lack of polish.\n\nAs it stands, I could see the game offering some entertainment to very "casual" players, especially considering the price tag, but I would warn everyone else to, at the very least, wait for a sale before jumping in. And it rather pains me to do so, because I believe the developer has some genuine talent, and that with additional study of the genre and practice UFO Crash could cook up something that appeals to a wider - and famously loyal, if notoriously picky - demographic. To that end I hope they find at least some success with this game, and are encouraged enough by its reception to aim higher next time around, but for the time being those like myself have little choice but to wait and see.","January 30","false","2.5"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thekillerbits/recommended/429220/","thekillerbits","thekillerbits","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thekillerbits/","784 products in account","FullBlast is a simple little shooter, very reminiscent of the classic arcade shmups of the late 80's/early 90's. Colorful, simple and focused on blasting your enemies, dodging bullets and collecting those power ups. It even employs the tried & tested formula of aliens taking over the planet and you are the only pilot capable of fighting back against the invaders. All this did give me those little pangs of nostalgia.\n\nBut I purposely held off doing this review until the game was released and I could see the price for this PC version.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJpgb69rSFg\n\nNow as you've probably guessed this is indeed a mobile port (and it has even made its way over to Wii U) and I have to admit it is a pretty good port. The controls are responsive. There have been tweaks to the UI, such as the score & health bar being pushed over to the side panels so not to clutter up the main screen. And the fact (like the Wii U version) you can actually play in co-op. This really isn't a bad game. Then again - it's not a good game either. It's just very, very average.\n\nIt does what it does well. It's just not particularly special or innovative. (Or does anything that a hundred other shmups haven't done in the past.)\n\nThe reason I'm not recommending it is not because its good or bad. It is purely down to the price. You can get exactly the same game cheaper on both mobile and console ($2 on both iOS & Android and, currently, 4 bucks on Wii U).\n\nObviously if you don't have those particular devices and you really like these type of shoot 'em ups you will probably get a couple of hours reasonable entertainment out of this PC version. But there is probably nothing here you haven't seen before and you are probably better waiting until it's on a daily deal or sale, and comes in at around about the same price as its mobile counterparts.","January 28","false","4.2"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","1"

Jump full blast into you vessel and destroy the invaders!\n\nFullBlast is a Shoot’Em-Up/Arcade game inspired by titles of this genre made in the 80’s and 90’s. You can play FullBlast either Solo or co-op if you have someone to play with on your pc.\n\nFullBlast is composed of 12 stages to beat in 3 different areas with 3 difficulty levels. You will fight in the city, forest and in the artic.  All stages are quite lengthy with a boss to kill at the end, and will become harder as you progress into the game. You will have to be on the lookout for the enemy, that looks like a purple butterfly; they come onto the screen in a sequence of 3. Destroy them and you will be able to upgrade your firepower, gain an extra life, an extra Mega Bomb and regenerate your health back to full strength. You can also gain a shield, double your points and your rate of fire (could be faster or slower) for a small period of time. On some occasions, you will be stranded by the overwhelming firepower of your enemies - that’s the time to use your “Mega Bomb” to wipe them out all at once!  Use the Mega bomb wisely as you only start with one at your disposal - you might get another one when you destroy the butterflies but it is very rare.\n\nThe game play is very simple . . . enemies appear on the screen and start shooting a large number of projectiles at you and you have to dodge them, return fire (auto fire available, see settings) and destroy the enemies.\n\nThe graphics are nice and polished and the controls are very responsive.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Nice and polished graphics\n-	Great and responsive controls\n-	Solo and Co-op gameplay\n-	Good price point\n-	Achievements & Trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Need to be slightly more challenging\n\n\nFullBlast is a fun Shoot’Em-Up/Arcade game with nice and polished graphics.

Although I haven't played through the whole game, its starts to pick up in the middle on normal. Don't let the 61MB download fool you, there is a lot of content here. Graphics and sounds are pretty good too, very impressed it seen my 2560x1080@75hz display. Yes its a port of some type, but its a great port. If you like shmups at all this one is a must have at a great price. To me personally it doesn't feel retro, it feels like a shmup on a modern smart phone done right, except its on STEAM for PC. Its got cloud saves, online leaderboards, trading cards and achievements, thats amazing in my books for the price.","February 3","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
