"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheLastHollow/recommended/321860/","TheLastHollow","shibitto","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheLastHollow/","529 products in account","INTROThere's a lot of mixed reviews but still a lot of unanswered questions. I am going to try to review the game and explain at least well enough to help you decide if you should buy this or not. Keep in mind this is MY opinion on the game, it might not necessarily be the same as everyone else!\n\nDifferences between "Free" Version and Steam VersionI'll start by informing you that the pack Steam is selling, is also available on the Disney Infinity website. You can also download the game for free on the same website.\nAlthough the game is supposedly Free to Play, the basic version of the game doesn't offer you that much, presenting itself more as a demo. You have access to 3 of the many characters that rotate each 5 days, you can play demos of the Play Sets (these are like open world story modes) and you have limited access to toy box (it's kinda like a creative mode). I recommend you download and play the game for free through the Disney Infinity website before you buy any pack.\n\nBy buying one of the starter packs (in this case, the Marvel Super Heroes one) you unlock:\n- The Avengers play set (basically it's an open world story mode)\n- 3 permanent characters (Thor, Black Widow, Iron Man)\n- Full access to toy box 2.0 (creative mode where you can create your own maps/levels, share them with friends, download other people's maps, race your friends, create/customize your own house, etc. In my opinion, this is where the game really shines)\n- Two toy box games (these are kinda like game modes. Eg: tower defense game)\n\nPROS & CONSI'm going to balance the pros and cons based on the version Steam is selling. Some of these are very subjective and they are based on my own experience of the game.\n\nPROS:\n+ Huge possibilities - Through the Toy Box mode, the game can truly be "infinite"! Create your own maps and levels, or download maps from the community! (Remember how Little Big Planet did it? Close enough!)\n+ Characters - Great cast, both from "classic" Disney and Marvel.\n+ VERY fun! - Personal opinion, of course. But I had a really good time playing this game! (Try the free version to see if you have fun too! If not, then it's probably not for you.)\n\nCONS:\nx Too expensive - and I don't mean just the Marvel Super Heroes pack. Even with this pack you only get to play with 3 of the Avengers. This means no Hulk, no Captain America, no Hawkeye, no Falcon and of course none of the other characters associated with them, like Loki for example. You can buy these characters on the website, they're cheaper than their physical versions (that can also be bought, but all you really will use is the code that comes with it. It's nice if you like to collect figures though). So basically, you have a bunch of characters you want to play with, but you have to pay for them. And that's not all! You want new story modes? You can play the demo, but for the full version you have to buy the corresponding Play Set pack (for example, Guardians of the Galaxy). You want new Toy Box games? (Not the ones you can download for free, the "official" ones) Well, that's also gonna cost you. Pretty much everything "extra" in this game is not only paid, but it's also kinda expensive.\n\nCONCLUSIONDisney Infinity 2.0 is a good game overall, in my opinion (7/10 for the story modes, 8/10 for creation modes). It will definitely give you that "greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s" vibe, but even with the content of one pack, you can already have lots of fun with it!\nOnce again, i recommend you try the free version of the game first because it really can show you the game's potential before you buy it.","November 24, 2014","true","24.2"," 522 of 615 people (85%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","85","522","615","9","14"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crimsonmoonmist/recommended/321860/","crimsonmoonmist","ANDY","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crimsonmoonmist/","183 products in account","Quick overview for those wondering what exactly this version of Disney Infinity 2.0 is:\n1. This is the full version of the game, no "toybox only" version or the likes we saw before.\n2. What you get with this starter set is three figures (Thor, Black Widow and Iron-man) and the Avengers play-set (essentially an open-world 5-hours long story mode) plus a collection of free-to-try characters that rotate at certain dates. You also get two toy box minigames:\none is a tower-defense styled game and the other is a roguelike styled game (and also includes randomly generated floors).\n3. There are no direct uses for physical figures. To compensate, digital figures are cheaper and physical figures come with download-codes for unlocking them.\n4. There is pretty much zero graphics customization available beyond different resolutions,\nluckily, the game is fairly lightweight for those with mid-range rigs.\n5. There are some bugs to look out for at this time.\nYou have to wait a couple of seconds after getting to the main menu to choose your play-set.\nIf you don't, the game won't recognize that you own the play-sets and instead ask if you want to          play the demo.  And lastly, some actions during the menus, like choosing your support characters, are currently impossible to do without the aid of a mouse","November 22, 2014","true","15.0"," 350 of 497 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","350","497","2","34"

If I could get a refund for this garbage I would.   This kind of greed is ruining the gaming industry.   I don't even want to play or buy anything anymore.  Worse yet, to do this in a kids game.  Talk about unethical manipulation.  Greedy scumbags.  I wish I had known all of this going in.

What is Disney Infinity? This product is a pseudo game builder that is intended for older children or young adults.\nYes, there is a pre-built Avengers (or Spider-man, or Guardians) game, but it's really just there as a means to an end... you are playing or paying to unlock new ways to theme the game you will build, or to fast-track access to a wide variety of models and features to add to what you build.\n\nTHE CONS:\nThe price is hard to justify, but once you turn that portion of your brain off (which I did when TF2 introduced micro transactions) you learn to let it slide.\nThe custom Exteriors & INteriors you build have a strong tendency to become corrupt... items disappearing (including floors!), INterior rooms becoming misaligned and closed off, props sinking into the floor... This is the biggest complaint I have. It can become terribly frustrating to work on something for a long time to have it ruined on load... in some cases irreversibly\n\nTHE PROS:\nI have had a great time building things with my kids. I love seeing them learn about logic connections between characters & props and watching them develop their own gameplay. I love the stylization & combination of the Disney properties... it's lighthearted, funny, and makes for a good time.\n\nI'm sure there are other game builders out there that are cheaper... but this is the one I bought...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mix__mash/recommended/321860/","mix__mash","MiX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mix__mash/","245 products in account","I don't know why some players said that this is a bad and underrated game on steam. Anyway, I'm reviewed this game based on my experience so far. Note that I don't have Disney Infinity 1.0 and also I didn't mention Disney Infinity 2.0 Free Edition. I will always keep update this review too, because I'm going to get some of the Play Sets for this game as soon as possible.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\n\nGeneral\nFirst of all, I really love Super Heroes game. Disney Infinity 2.0: Marvel Super Heroes bring back my childhood memories. I always play this kind of game when I was on school. So I bought this to memorize my childhood. Well, this game is not only play as Marvel Super Heroes Characters (don't get distract by the game title). You can also play Guardian of the Galaxy Characters, The Amazing Spiderman Characters, and Disney Original Characters. They are not only make The Avengers Play Set, but also Guardian of the Galaxy Play Set, The Amazing Spiderman Play Set, and Toy Box, that everyone make their own maps and their own storylines (more like custom stories). Some toy in the Toy Box such as the items in-game are locked, so you need to buy it with the game currency, called Blue Sparks. This Blue Sparks can be obtained in-game when you destroy items. You can join the race competition too in this game (on Toy Box or Play Sets if it's available)\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\n\nThese what I got from this Starter Pack Marvel's The Avengers Play Set\nMarvel's Iron Man, Thor, and Black Widow Digital Characters (Permanent to your Disney account)\nToy Box 2.0\nTwo Marvel Super Heroes Toy Box Games: Escape from the Kyln & Assault on Asgard\nThree Trial Digital Characters (these what I got: Hulk, Spiderman, Elsa. Those are expired in the next 5 days after you buy the game.)\n________________________________________________________________\n\n\nThe Pros(+)\n+ Impressive and immersive graphics.\nI have discovered that this game has a pretty good model design, because of it's simplicity. Character design in-game look same like the figure. (I didn't buy the figure, since it's really hard to buy in my country). The scenery, environments, atmosphere, the particle effects are outstanding.\n\n+ Amazing voice-actors.\nThe voice characters in this game are good enough. All of their voice characters a bit similar from what we heard in the movies.\n\n+ Good storylines.\nThe Avengers Play Set is included in this pack that I bought. So far, the storylines are acceptable from what I thought.\n\n+ Very fun, addicting game and nice combo moves\nThis game is a box full of fun and entertaining for me. Each characters have a unique attack moves too.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\n\nThe Cons (-)\n- Loading sometimes took a while.\nThis is the one issue that I occurred sometimes. While playing this game, I always failed to login and always retry to connect my Disney account for about 3 ~ 5 times.\n\n- Expensive.\nI must say that this game pretty expensive, but since I'm on SEA (South-East Asia) region, most Steam games are cheaper than outside the SEA region. (I bought it for only IDR 335.999 ~ US$ 30.00) I asked my friends how much was it cost on their country, and it was more than US$ 30.00, maybe? Prepare to spend more money like TF2 game, where you spend your money for virtual items.\n\n- Most features like Play Sets are sold separately.\nWith a lot of money that I purchase for this game, I think this game needs more features to be unlocked, because the price is not equal with the game packs. They need to unlock at least 1 or 2 Characters.\n\n- Decent gameplay.\nKinda same like old style of this kind of game, where you always fighting the same enemies.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\n\nReview Update!\n>> (28 Feb 2015)\nSo I bought Guardians of the Galaxy Play Set (include figurine and also the virtual characters) and I think the story of this play set is not that awesome, but I really like the game play.\n\nAlso, I occurred this issue: "Characters level reset into level 0" for two times so far. I reported this by send ticket to Disney Infinity Team and they replied back my message through my email. They said that they are trying to fix this problem and hoping that the update patch for PC gonna be release soon in March. They also apologize for this and asked me about my Disney account, they gave me free 25.000 blue sparks to my account too!\n\nThank you so much Disney Infinity Team! :)\n\n>> (13+14 Mar 2015) - Finally, first patch updates (they didn't write the updates)\n\nThe one that I noticed so far for the new updates are less loading time, added video advance settings such as SSAO, Bloom etc., and the last one is they added 2 new characters, Quorra and Sam Flynn from Tron that's available in PC.\n\nI'm waiting for the payment method update, so I can buy all of the items from Steam Wallet. Hope they will do this in the future.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\n\nOverall\nI'm satisfied so far playing Disney Infinity 2.0 PC version, even though I really hate the sensitivity of the vehicles in this game. I hope that the developer always updating this PC version in the future, such as adding achievements to the game, changing the payment method so you can buy the items easily using Steam Wallet, adding more Play Set for Disney Original character, that are not only can be playable in Toy Box. This game is NOT only for 10 yo, but everyone can play this game. I will rate this game for 8/10. You might wanna try this game for free too if you want to try it out. Just go to the official web https://infinity.disney.com/en-apac and the free version download is available for PC only.\n\nForgive me if there's something wrong with the information that I wrote in this review.\nIf you add me to play with you, leave a specific comment on my profile or I will ignore your friend request.","February 18, 2015","true","81.2"," 33 of 50 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","33","50","2","0"

They all play like the best of their individual games. Spider-man was so fun it reminded me of the old days with the Tobey Macgquire Spider-man games and the N64/PS1 Spider-man game. Iron Man was well done and plays like you would expect, Hulk like the old movie games, just amazing job.\n\nThe devs also have a fantastic track record.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CreepingWraith/recommended/321860/","CreepingWraith","CreepingWraith","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CreepingWraith/","1032 products in account","I've been playing this with the kids and I feel like microtransactions give this experience a bad stigma it doesn't deserve.\n\nI'll start by saying that the free version on the Disney website is where you should look first if you're considering getting this.  If you're an action/RPG aficionado, check out the Daily Challenge.  If you like open world adventure games, check out the playset demos -- I thought the Spiderman one was particularly cool.  The toybox games demos give you at least a quick overlook of what they are; there are two isometric action/RPG games and two Tower Defense games. If you like sandbox play, well, I honestly was sold on this before I even tried the toybox so I'm not sure what the toybox demo is like -- but I can tell you that I find a new cool thing to show the kids in the toybox every day.\n\nThe free version gives you free access to 3 rotating characters and demo versions of most of (all of?) the included activities.  The negative reviews on Steam all seem to be about the microtransactions, but I would argue that they are a good thing -- I'm gradually buying the content the kids and I want to play, and playing it as I buy it.  I think my only complaint is that the free trial characters are advertised when you open your Collection even after you've bought content, which led to a relatively complicated conversation with my girlfriend's 6-year-old daughter about why she couldn't be Elsa right now... If you're a parent, be prepared for that conversation.\n\nOne last thing on the microtransactions: there are hexagonal power discs advertised on the Disney site for toy box content... there is a LOT more toy box content available in-game for in-game currency, "Sparks".  You can also buy Sparks from the Disney website, which worried me after reading all these reviews... don't let that be the thing that scares you away.  Practically everything you do in-game awards you sparks by the hundreds and I've accidentally amassed a small fortune to purchase toys with just by fooling around with the game content.  The hexagonal discs are essentially premium content.  Interestingly, round power discs (special abilities & alternate costumes) are also purchased with sparks in the PC version as opposed to being sold in booster packs.\n\nA few more things you should know: no local MP on the PC version, online interactions only.  Toybox content created using objects you don't own is playable, but you might sometimes get gated from community toyboxes because their creator built it for a specific figurine (i.e. there's a Fantasia community level we played with Apprentice Mickey.  You can use either Crystal Apprentice Mickey or Apprentice Mickey, but if you don't own either you cannot play the level.)  If you're a parent considering this for children, there is cartoon violence in some (not all!) available toybox levels, and consistently in the toybox games and playsets.  Enemy figurines explode into 'plastic' chunks and sparks (I'd compare it to the violence in the LEGO games) which could seem a little morbid for humanoid enemies (Agrabah guards), but there is no visible blood or gore.  A lot of the Disney-themed combat is pretty silly and I've found myself laughing out loud more than once at an attack or ability.\n\nAll in all this is a silly amount of fun.  Give the free version a try (you can buy this pack from here afterwards if you still want it in your steam library).","March 9, 2015","true","61.8"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

Such as, instead of going to the Toy Box Introduction area, it will send you to a blank Toy Box.  The only way to get out is to either use the menu system to reload into the Introduction area, or possibly place a Toy Box Door which may send you back.\n\nWhen moving through doorways going back into your house, also called the "INterior", the doorways can glitch out and send you to a reset INterior.  Meaning, you'll have to do the INterior introductory quests all over again.  After the 3rd time, I'm giving up.\n\nI've read of other serious glitches in the game, but havent experienced those yet.  Doubt I ever will since I'm going to stop playing until they can fix the above issues.

Regardless of the fact some characters are behind a paywall or on rotation you are told about this beforehand on the steam page. The only thing the game really lacks is multiplayer in the playsets but otherwise I couldn't have more fun.","December 16, 2014","true","19.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Yet still need to polish for the network to make invite and join  in game while playing can invite our friends. Also, Disney Infinity must follow Marvel Heroes forum how their developer and support react fast after true believer complaining about anything in game.

Glad I was able to grab the Marvel Starter at 50%. Otherwise I would not have even started playing this. Mainly due to limited income. My other gripe with this game. Not designed for left handed players and no control edit feature. I can work around it, but does my playing very akward for me. Once you blow through the pre-made Quest (after buying the required charaters) that game losses its fun and flare. Then just becomes a money suck. Don't waste your time.","February 25, 2015","false","131.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
