You are mainly just punching red or green robots while dodging enemy fire, but it is strangly addicting and has a great "arcade" feel to it.\n+ Has a retro vibe, reminds me of classic arcade games.\n+ Great replayability, and leaderbaords to compete for the highscore!\n+ Very nice background music that's very cheerful","May 28","true","9.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","2"

The music is well made and reminds a bit at times strangely of something you'd hear in Phantasy Star or old Megadrive/Genesis games with the old Yahama synth sound. It seems to run on a endless board loop which get's more and more challenging as you progress levels with a pretty balanced diffculty curve. Scoring higher points can be assisted with the aid of using bombs to create chain attacks for higher bonus points. The controls and hitbox detection are pretty well done, although just catching the tail end of a bomb blast that you think you can avoid can be annoying at times. Certainly worth picking up for such a cheap price if you like older arcade style games. Well recommended.","May 8","true","5.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"
