Keeps things simple, doesn't stop it from being fun.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtUHVipe9As\nContains around 18 levels and 6 different worlds, all themed differently and introducing new enemies and hazards. Levels can be played in either standard or time trial modes and each world ended with a boss fight. Standard modes holds egg pickups that can be used for unlocking new characters and skins. Time trial awards gold, silver or bronze medals rather then global leaderboards, picking up eggs during these runs reduces the time on the clock.\n\nGame runs on the unreal engine supporting screen resolutions of 4k+, combine that with clean aesthetics and it looks quite beautiful. Both gamepad and keyboard controls were responsive but unfortunately could not be remapped. Biggest flaw is probably the length, outside of time trial modes there is no reason to return once complete. Depending on skill level that should take around 3-5hrs. Overall it's recommended for fans of classic platformers with some modern flair, certainly worth picking up on sale.

If you like platformers, you will definitely get some enjoyment out of it. You can see what the devs tried to do, and by what games they were inspired. You can definitely feel the fun they had when developing this. The execution may lack here and there. But overall it's a decent indie platformer, and definitely worth the discounted price right now.\n\nPros:\n------\n\n* 21:9 support (always love when an indie dev does, what many AAA devs are too lazy to do).\n* Speed-button like in Super Meat Boy allows for some nice platforming.\n* Good open level design (reminds me a little bit of Sonic).\n* Decent enemy variety.\n* Not too easy.\n\nCons:\n------\n\n* Controls are flawed. For instance, if you move only slightly in one direction when jumping, you will go on to move in that direction, even if you let go off the analog stick. That is unnecessary and makes the otherwise great platforming annoying, because you will end up doing something you didn't want to do (and maybe die because of that). This really takes some getting used to, and the devs should think about changing it. It is my main argument against the game.\n* Combat is not that great, but alright.\n* Graphics are mediocre, stiff animations.","March 4","true","4.7"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","16","16","0","0"

Yes, Iggy's Egg Adventure shows that's possible.\n\nStory:\nThe story is very similiar to almost any platform game released, but it works. Iggy's mom has been captured, and it's up to Iggy to get her back. Along the way he will also have to collect eggs that were stolen alongside his mom.\n\nGameplay:\nIf you've played platform games before, Iggy's Egg Adventure won't be very different. You move through a level filled with hazards (cavemen, other dinosaurs, tar pits to name a few) in order to reach the goal. On each level there are large eggs that can be found which you can buy more characters, and even costumes with. In the last level of every world, you will fight a boss which require a specific strategy to be defeated. This makes for an interesting experience.\n\nMusic:\nThe music in the game, is upbeat and nice to listen to. Each world has it's own theme which all fit the respective location.\n\nUnfortunately, i noticed a big issue with the game. The controls cannot be rebound, and while i myself got used to the controls after a while, others might find it clunky to play the game with the default controls.\n\nIn conclusion, Iggy's Egg Adventure is a fun experience. It might not be the most unique platformer ever, but it certainly won't disappoint you.\n\nFinal score 8/10.","September 20, 2015","true","13.8"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","13","17","2","3"

Five baby dinosaurs will go on an adorably murderous rampage to get her back.\n\nIn my review of Bad Rats, I made the bold claim that there was a 6/10 game hiding beneath the surface if only the controls and the art direction weren’t so abysmal.  I wasn’t joking, and Iggy’s Egg Adventure is proof of it.\n\nLike Bad Rats, this is very clearly the work of amateur developers. It has a handful of minor problems such as:\nGlitching ragdoll physics,\nAlt-Tab glitches,\nClunky, poorly-implemented menus,\nStiff-looking character animations with virtually no transition animations at all,\nMissing sound / tactile effects for many events which feel like they should have them,\nUnfairly tiny pickups which are very hard to grab and also lack contrast against the stage background,\nStage design that’s astonishingly poor at conveying which pits are passages and which are instant death. It even has the awkward and surprisingly irreverent gore of Bad Rats, as murdering human beings in a cloud of blood (by jumping on their heads, no less!) becomes commonplace since the very first level.\n\nSo, why am I giving the game a thumbs-up? Because it was ridiculously fun. I loved zooming around as a baby raptor, snagging eggs out of the air and slicing through enemies. The controls closely resemble the precise floatyness of Super Meat Boy, and with a little practice you can pull off seriously skillful tricks. The game’s problems are mostly easy to ignore and don’t affect gameplay; I never felt like I died because of a glitch or because of bad controls. This is perhaps the single most important thing the game could have gotten right, and it did! Besides that, the worlds are pleasant to look at, the music is very decent (if not a little forgettable) and the characters themselves are too adorable for their own good.\n\nThere are actually four other playable characters in this game besides Agumon Iggy, each with a different playstyle that becomes beneficial in different levels. Phredric is like Iggy, but swaps out his charge attack for a long-range projectile, which becomes very useful when speed isn’t needed. And then there’s the best character, Terry, who sacrifices the ability to run for the ability to double-jump, glide, and air-lunge. Under the right circumstances, you can use him to soar over the whole level much like Plague Knight. Terry makes this game a blast once you get to know what he can do.\n\nThe other two characters I found badly balanced and useless: Perry swaps out the lunge attack for some invincibility frames, but all the other characters are invincible anyway while performing their special moves, so it’s mostly a downgrade. Patrick gets a long-range headbutt while standing on the ground, but it’s too slow and not flexible enough to compete with just spamming charge attacks with Iggy or Terry. But two dud characters out of five isn’t bad at all when the other three provide such a useful and interesting change to the gameplay.\n\nIggy’s Egg Adventure gets a 6.5 / 10 from me. Though the game is very rough around the edges and clearly an amateur work, I can’t not like it. The dinosaurs are too adorable and I had too much fun. Despite its problems, it focused on what mattered the most, and stands as a solid, fast-paced platformer with decent length and challenge. It definitely should have gotten more attention than it did.\n\n(Achievement Hunters: It’s about 15-20 hours to 100%, and with some rare achievements, too! The last achievement is a bit on the ridiculous side, but if you stick it out, you'll find that it’s a bit easier than the “boy” achievements in Super Meat Boy. Practice, get a handle on the Terry character, and have a quick finger on the escape key, and a full-game no-death run is very doable.)","March 15","true","17.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","8","8","2","0"

Iggy's is reminiscent of games like Donkey Kong, Sonic, or other similar platformers of yore- it starts off easy enough.  But as you push your way through the different environments it demands more from you each time.  The balance is spot on though, not too hard and not too easy.  Time trials and alternate dinos give you more reasons to replay the game.  Collect hidden eggs, fight bosses, and defeat a variety of enemies, what's not to love?  I'd suggest this game for old school platformer lovers to beginners.  Iggy's has that classic feel you love, but a modern approach that beginners will like too.\n\n","August 27, 2015","true","54.6"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

You play a baby Velociraptor named Iggy who is searching for his mom who was kidnapped by cavemen.  As you run through the levels, you collect eggs along the way (both large and small) that will unlock costumes and other cute baby dinosaurs.\n\nI love the prehistoric theme to the game.  Your health bar is shown as cartoon pieces of meat, the landscapes are simple yet deadly, your opponents are cavemen or animals now extinct (ie sabertooth tigers).  The levels are fun, upbeat yet challenging.  Combined with the happy music, I never felt frustrated or wanted to quit.  In fact, working to unlock other cute baby dinosaurs has been a huge motivation to continue playing.\n\nBeing an inexperienced player at platformers, I had a little difficulty using the controller, especially since I had to use the sprint button often combined with a jump or attack.  There are only 4 buttons to use - jump, sprint, attack, and special attack. No special combinations, which I'm actually grateful for.  Gamers with more platforming/controller experience will have no trouble with the controls.  My most common death was due to my lack of aim while jumping - I would fall into brambles, land right in my enemy's path and get hit, or miss the moving landing pad (or in this case, dinosaur heads, giant mosquitos or sea turtles) and fall to my death.  Nevertheless, it's still lots of fun!\n\nFor those who love platformer games, or those who love dinosaurs, I think you'll enjoy this game.","August 28, 2015","true","3.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It looks amazing- everything is 3d rendered but doesn't look choppy or crappy, there aren't any weird half-♥♥♥♥♥ character animations, and there are several neat skins you can unlock for each character! I think the addition of more than just Iggy as a playable character really makes this game fun- Terry can fly, Patrick can charge and ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ up, Perry can go invulnerable for a bit, Phredrick shoots projectiles- unique mechanics for people who prefer different playstyles.\n\nThere are several levels and most of them are decently challenging, but its not like you're playing Dark Souls here; this game is more meant to sit back and enjoy it. All of the achievements are doable, but not easy, which is a nice balance. Its definitely an ideal choice if you have some kids you want to entertain.

The controls are solid and it would be a shame if you overlooked this game because it looked easy (it's not).\n\nReally the only true complaint I have is not being able to rebind controls.\n\nEdit: Seeing most of the negative reviews say the jump mechanics are awful (and some accusing positive reviewers of not knowing what a platformer is lol), I honestly have yet to really have any issues with the jump mechanics that prevents me from progressing. I play via controller and the only thing that's truly hindering to gameplay is being unable to rebind controls. I did previously use a Logitech controller but I've since gotten my PS3 controller working on my pc and eliminated much of my previous hand cramping issue due to how the controls were binded. The jumps control just fine in the arctic area and beyond, where the platforming segments becomes more precise and punishing. Granted I haven't tried the game via keyboard, but my experience with a controller has been fairly smooth. There's no point in insulting the people who played and didn't share the same opinion. I think the game is fun for what it is, your mileage may vary, obviously.","March 8","true","7.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Along with feeling blending together they just felt bland/uninspired, the 3 first world levels felts the exact same.\n\nMy biggest problem with the game was the keys which effect the gameplay; J-K-L and movement keys(up or space for jump) felt awkward and you cant change it. The jump height was hard to control and the layout didn't help this.

(Except they can rip your face off, and they will if you mess with their eggs!) Some levels require speed, but most of them can be played at a leisure pace. You can collect little eggs for points and collect big eggs to unlock more characters and/or costumes/skins. Each level has a few big eggs hidden around the stage.\n\nThe game starts off pretty easily and then increases the difficulty a bit. Nothing too unforgiving, though. Finding all of the eggs becomes a challenge on the later stages, but still stays enjoyable.\n\nThe enemies have ragdoll carcasses so they sometimes spasm. I've even had one fly UP off the screen at one point. (They stop colliding with you once you kill them, so they never get in the way or anything.) I happen to enjoy seeing that, so thats a plus from me. Thank you Unreal Engine for your crazy ragdolls.\n\nAlso the huge boss fights are pretty sweet.\n\nDid I mention that this game is cute? Them dinos are too cute. Cute rampaging dinos on a killing spree to reclaim their eggs and Iggy's mother. (From cavemen, who else? I don't care if cavemen technically were not around with the dinosaurs. Take your logic elsewhere. I have a cute dinosaur platformer to play.)","February 29","true","9.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The levels start quite easy and gets fairly challenging by the end. Each world is made out of 3 levels + a boss, and each level takes around 5~10 minutes to complete depending on how hard you're searching for the secret eggs.\n\nSome pros:\nMultiple characters to choose from with varying abilities\nGreat music\nSolid controls - there is very little momentum, so you get complete control over your dino of choice\nFantastic bosses - one of my favorite parts of the game - the bosses are all unique with some neat way to kill them (such as one you don't even attack it to kill it)\nLevels vary greatly and have tons of suprises\nLevels are not linear - most levels have multiple paths you can take, some leading to secrets and some leading to the end, so you can play the same level multiple times and get a completely different experience.\n\nSome cons:\nNot much enemy variety - there's only a few enemies in the game (probably around 10 total?), with humans being there throughout the entire game\nSometimes you'll get hit by something launched off screen, with very little time to dodge it. It feels very cheap getting hit by these and is pretty annoying. Luckily you can take 4 hits\nNot many levels - I beat the game in a casual playthrough in about 5~ hours [though the ingame timer says 3 + 1/2 hours?]. When I played I collected 60/100 of the secret eggs, so there is still tons of exploration left to do.\nBosses are really easy after you get their pattern - most of them, while unique, all repeat the exact same pattern over and over, so if you figure out how to beat it once you've essentially beaten the boss (they speed up each time you deal damage)\nDisappointing last boss - you go from fairly difficult levels to simple boss. On the plus side the last boss is quite fun to play\n\nIf you've got $10 to drop and love platformers, it's a great game. You can beat it in a single sitting, so it's a nice way to spend an evening when you're alone.","September 7, 2015","true","4.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

You will not be dissapointed with this game. With it's hightened color and beautifully smooth animations, a certain baby velociraptor's very dangerous yet captivating and whimsical world is brought to life.\nThe controls are simple, very user friendly! Not to say this game is a breeze; far from it. There are numerous obstacles and many different types of prehistoric enemies for each zone/climate. It reminds me of the old SNES games (Super Mario World, Donkey Kong Country, etc.) where it takes a good amount of skill to be able to progress through each level. Which is a very welcome change of pace when compared to many of today's linear games!\nIt also takes a lot of finesse and problem solving skills to defeat each of the bosses, but that makes it all the more satisfying when you finally take them down!!\nPlus, there are a handful of playable characters each of whom is adorably badass in their own way!! Even more so when you unlock all of their costumes using the giant eggs you collect from each level.\nI would recommend this game to anyone!! It is a beautiful, simple, witty, and challenging game that keeps you on your toes and coming back for more!\n\nSide note - I find it is easiest to use a controller over a keyboard.

The graphics are pretty good. The controls work well. The levels are well designed while also being pretty straight forward. Most of the levels also have multiple different paths that offer different challenges. Make note though that while the game may look like it is for young children it is not since there is some blood in the game.\n\nAs far as difficulty I would classify it as a medium to hard platformer. Most of the difficulty comes from the long length of the levels. A lot of the levels can last over ten minutes and if you lose your last life you have to start all the way back at the beginning of the level. At times this got kind of frustrating especially since I always seemed to die just a couple jumps away from finishing the level. If you get frustrated quickly, Iggy's Egg Adventure may not be for you.\n\nWhen I first started plying Iggy's Egg Adventure I had some serious issues with the frame rate. Despite my computer having at least twice the recommended specs I was only getting around 15 frames per second which made the game choppy and almost unplayable. At that frame rate the game was not fun to play. By reducing the resolution I was able to get the frame rate back up to a respectable 30 frames per second. If you have issues with the frame rate you may have to lower the resolution of the game.\n\nIf you like medium to hard platformers I think you should enjoy Iggy's Egg Adventure.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy of Iggy's Egg Adventure. Other than the free review copy I received no other compensation for this review.\n\nRead My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com]","September 2, 2015","true","12.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Iggy's Egg Adventure puts you in control of Iggy, the cutest little Veloci?...Veloca?....Velosa?....raptor who's on a quest to save is mother and her eggs in the process.  Excellent artwork, character design and fun music accompany a surprisingly difficult at times platformer.  That's not a problem though as what fun would a platformer be if it were just a straight shot?  Combine that with the replay value from unlockable characters makes Iggy's is a recommend from CaptainCardsworth over at HardLeg Gaming and should be in everyone's library!  -Edited 11/26/15 to correct spelling errors.","November 16, 2015","true","5.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Along the way, he must collect 5 large eggs from each level (in order to unlock additional characters and costumes).\n\nThe graphics are drop-dead gorgeous, and the cavemen have the appropriate funny grunts and primitive weapons you'd expect from Stone-Age humans. There is a small amount of bloodshed, but it's kept at a tame level, so even younger children won't be turned off by this game.\n\nWhat will turn them off, however...the floaty control scheme. You can run at high speeds, and jump really far and quite high, too, but you won't be able to easily stick the often precise jumps the game requires from you, starting at an appallingly early stage in the game (as early as the third stage of the game).\n\nThe game has a nasty habit of punishing even slight mistakes (especially of the jumping kind), by dropping you straight into bramble patches (and the resulting "hurt loop" as you frantically try to hop your way out of them)...or straight into bottomless chasms, if you so much as miss a jump by a single pixel at times.\n\nIf you can somehow overlook these often aggravating difficulties, you should have no trouble completing this game, and eventually unlocking everything. I give this game a 6/10, mostly for the aggravation factor. It's the graphics that keeps the score from completely bottoming out.\n\nI do recommend this game for those who love platformers, as well as dinosaur fans.","December 19, 2015","true","1.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

A frenzied talons-out pounce, a little chomp-chomp, and my personal favorite, straight up LANDIN' on people.\n\nThe sweethearted portrayal of cartoon saurian action may have mislead you- there's basic but satisfactory ragdoll death and a necessary amount of blood! You could give this to a child to teach her about mortality without inducing bad dreams. It rekindles the thoughts i had as a young thing playing Gex and wishing his tail attacks would induce medically accurate trauma.\n\nIt aint perfect! the in-air momentum shifts make the jumping a little less conventional. It works, Combat is nifty, and It's more than enough for what I came here for. You get to unlock extra babbus to play, seems they all have unique animation in some form to hint their personalities. Love the costume selection, too!","January 1","true","4.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

How do you mess up Mario?\n\nThe good:\nDecent selection of characters.\nVery cute.\nGood sound dirrection.\nGood art dirrection.\n\nThe bad:\nThe most awkward controls I have ever seen in a platformer. For example you press the jump button right? The moment you let go of the jump button you character starts to drop right away, straight down. You have almost no control over your character at this point when you start to drop. The only way to have full fall control over your character while playing is if you always do full jumps, never release the jump button before hand to do a tiny jump.\n\nNot a lot of variety.\n\nI cannot stress this enough, the awful controls make this game absolutely unplayable. How people have given this game such high ratings is beyond me. The fact that only one other review has pointed out the disguesting controls means one of two things: The reviews are either stacked via the devs, or the people that have played this game have never played any Mario games, or any platformers at all.\n\nTHE BASIC JUMPING IS SO AWFUL, HOW?!","March 7","false","0.5"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","1"
