Game is broken, you may need to tweak files yourself to get past a nasty crash bug on episode 5. If you're familiar with XML and/or can edit a .TGA, congrats - you can mod the game and fix that bug. Also, it'll let you create custom attire.\n\nNone of the above-mentioned facts will make the game FUN, however.","March 15, 2013","false","0.0"," 36 of 45 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","36","45","5","1"

No matter what you do they vote the black girl off first, and the character models look like The Sims 1, but up close. Clothing selections range from quaint to ludicrous. When you look for 2012's 2008 Fashion Game of the year, look elsewhere.","December 30, 2012","false","0.0"," 42 of 58 people (72%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","72","42","58","19","3"

She would NOT play this!\n\n[Post Review]\nThis Ghetto game wouldn’t record my playtime even though I invested 20 painful minutes. I wasn’t going to let this prevent me from telling you how bad this game was. (My Fix) On the startup it will show “running” for a few seconds… at that time you immediately click the “X” button and hold it for 5 additional minutes. – Figuring this out was way more fun than the game.\n------------------\n[Original Review]\nThis game was on my list so I finally decided to bite the bullet and check it out. I mentally prepared myself to design outfits for the next hour or so; but I can't do it. The graphics are mediocre for 2008 and we are lacking some real content here. Sound and Playtime doesn't work.\n\nThe problem that can't be overlooked is this; a game focused on outfit designs has to have a massive plethora of options to choose from or some kind of editor. This game only has around 100-200 valid outfit combinations such as only 20 pants, shirts etc... LAME. How am I supposed to WOW the judges picking from 20 options.\n\nBasically, you "design" outfits and put your creations against other designers in a runway competition. The judges will rate the outfits and send the worst designer home. (Me) There is no gameplay, just pick out your totally cute outfit and watch them walk the runway.\n\nWorth nothing; they should pay us!\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

Graphic quality is very poor. Having in mind that this is a dress up game made in 2008, graphics really matter and I expected better.\n2. I have no idea how do the judges judge. I don't know what I did right or wrong. Each level is a guessing game. I would have expected the jacket that I chose to fail me, but some levels it seems to be rated amazingly well, in others, so so. In fact I do not know if it's even possible to fail.\n3. Did not find any sound control.\n\nObviously the intended audience is much younger, however I still recommend picking anything else over this.\n\nAlso while this wasn't the intention of the creator of the game, but because how the game launches, only that brief moment while it launches will it count you as playing it. As you need to play the product for 5 mintues or more to review it, but it's nearly impossible to get steam to recognise that you're playing it, it's kind of impossible to leave a review!","May 26","false","0.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If there was an over-world it would rival Ocarina of Time, the combat system is very similar and in many ways an improvement, the art style is both macabre and manic, like you would expect a sequance of dreams to be, Alice contols satisfyingly and her varied abilities make her seem strangely both helpless and empowered. My only quip is that the game feels the need to remind you every 5 minutes how to play it... but atleast theres no Omochao with an obnoxious voice or any of that.","January 10","true","0.1"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","20","2","10","2","0"
