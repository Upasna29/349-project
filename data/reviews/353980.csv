The song and dance about girls and hair is hysterical.\n\nGame: Assil manages to get a death curse and now he must break it.  Follow his adventure from breaking out of his house (He is grounded), dealing with a man eating crocodile, goofy palace guards, looney market merchants (and a very talkative slave), rescuing a damsel with attitude (Thara), some palace intrigue (and the pharoah's daughter), a missing caravan leader, and finally the underworld and Osiris, the Lord of the Underworld.\n\nFirst in a series of three.  Good storyline, nice art work, and with lots of humor built in.  The dialogue options are a must read.  Do not forget this game can be challenging, and at several points the player must switch back and forth between Assil and Thara.\n\nNOTE: Best guide is written by Deck 13 Interactive (Walkthrough by MaGtRo copyright March 2006) and can be found on the internet.

Puzzles were not overly difficulty which kept the plot moving. The length was perfect for introducing this three part series. I rushed to purchase the next two tales. Any racey jokes were mild enough I felt comfortable my kids overhearing. Lots of fun I would run through it again.","November 29, 2015","true","26.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The only sound that seems to work is GERMAN speaking....  Since playing the game requires knowing what is being said, the game is useless, and CANNOT be played unless you speak GERMAN...\n\nAnkh 2 and Ankh 3 games seem to work well, BUT I would stay away from this one, unless you speak GERMAN,,","May 21, 2015","false","0.5"," 21 of 118 people (18%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","18","21","118","7","8"
