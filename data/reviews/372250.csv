Turnover is set in the near future where private security firms have more power than ever and are effectively running the world. You play as Clea, she works for such a firm and after a merger between her firm and another firm fell through her building is now being taken by force. Your job is to get Clea out of there safely and to do so you’re going to need to strike a balance between being patient and making split second decisions to evade the people trying to kill you.\n\nI’d like to say that at the time of writing this review I haven’t completed the game. However, the core mechanics of the game have all been introduced over the course of what I have played and I wouldn’t mention anything that comes later anyway to avoid spoilers. On that note, I won’t be mentioning some of the more minor game mechanics as half the fun in this game is figuring things out for yourself.\n\nFull Disclosure: A review copy was provided by the developer\n\nPresentation\nTurnover not only has a really nice pixel art style, it’s also been very well designed. Obviously, if you’re not a fan of games with pixel art styles you won’t like its appearance but as someone who does I thought it looked great, there’s only so much you can do with such an art style but it does look good. The design, like I said, is also great! All of the models and whatnot look good and I really did feel as though I was in a building which had been taken by force. That may sound strange considering it isn’t a realistic looking game but there was just something about the way everything looked and played that made it feel like that to me.\n\nGameplay\nBeing a stealth game, most of Turnover’s gameplay is about sneaking past guards and trying to escape without raising the alarm. However, Turnover is also a game about assessing the situation and maybe some trial and improvement if you’re not so good at that. You see, often your ability to sneak through a level depends on your knowledge of guard behaviour in that level. For instance, if you want to cross a corridor you need to know when and for how long a guard will turn their back, allowing you safe passage across the corridor. There are two ways of finding that kind of thing out, you really take your time with every level, making sure you know where guards are and how they’re going to behave before making any moves or you discover each part of the level through trial and improvement, dying gives you an idea of how to get past that area but it also sets you back to the beginning of the level.\n\nOf course getting spotted by enemies is the easiest way to get caught, but they can hear you too and with the enemies having visible vision cones you should be able to avoid their deadly gaze. Simply by moving you create enough sound so that an enemy who is a couple of feet away from you can hear you, sprinting will be audible from even further away but there are also objects/obstacles in the game which will create loud sounds if ‘activated’. For example, if you step on a pile of broken glass, it’s going to make quite a loud crunching sound which can be heard from quite far away. There are a few other ways to get yourself discovered but those are the two main ones and it’s better to discover the other ones yourself!\n\nIf you do get spotted by a guard, chances are you’re dead. They all carry weapons and they all have quick reaction times so you’ll probably be bleeding out on the ground before you can even say hi. If you are lucky enough to get away you’ll be left with a guard in a more alert state. The guard’s cone of vision will turn red and they will be much more aware of their surroundings, meaning they’re more likely to see you and they will be able to hear you from further away too so you’ll have to be extra careful if you get an enemy in an alert state.\n\nOn some floors of the building you’ll find other people who are willing to help you and depending on what job that had, they will be able to help you in different ways. If you come across someone from IT, they will be able to unlock any terminals which have been locked by the raiders. If you come across a friendly guard you can command him to move around and if an enemy enters his line of sight then he’ll shoot them! Finding and using these people is pretty damn important if you want to get through some of the floors as often having them ‘do their thing’ will be the most straightforward way to get yourself out of there!\n\nBut why should other people get all the offensive fun!? Occasionally you’ll find items in a level which can be used as an offensive weapon, some of them will simply knockout an enemy for a few seconds while others will have a slightly more permanent effect.\n\nHere’s a short video I recorded if you wish to see how the game looks in action:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq46gaeeQqg\n\nMiscellaneous Turnover is good in the sound department. All the sound effects are great and fit in with the visual style of the game and the music is good too, I’m particularly fond of the track that plays if you get yourself into a little bit of trouble!\nWhile the story isn’t the main focus for most of the game it’s definitely an interesting one regarding how much control private security firms have and how certain countries have become ‘Security States’.\nThe default controls are good but you can re-bind them if you wish.\nTurnover manages to be incredibly difficult without the difficulty feeling gimmicky like other games. For one particular level, that should have taken me about five minutes, ended up taking me half an hour because I kept screwing up. Yet I kept on playing because, like with other super hard games that get it right, the satisfaction of beating the level greatly outweighs the frustration you feel while trying to figure things out.\nVerdict\nWorth Purchasing.\n\nTurnover is a great example of a very difficult stealth game done right. It looks good, the gameplay is great and beating a level is oh so satisfying. If you’re up for a bit of a challenge, give Turnover a go!\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.\n\nEl K.","December 16, 2015","true","7.8"," 59 of 69 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","59","69","0","4"

An old retro sense of difficulty, a vibe similar to that of the Metal gear series(minus the combat) and a story mixed with realism. The writing for the game is much more than I expected. The game is well-polished, we made sure of that.\n\nThe game is as difficult as you let it be. If you get spotted by a guard, you are most likely dead. The sounds are excellent, the pixel-art is great and the game leaves you with a sort of accomplished feeling. So yes, I can recommend this.","December 17, 2015","true","1.1"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimaLyca/recommended/372250/","UltimaLyca","Rye Roen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimaLyca/","190 products in account","I WAS GIVEN A FREE COPY OF THIS GAME BY THE DEVELOPER\n\nIf you’d prefer a video review, have a look here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n0KUluzXhM\n\nTurnover is a stealth game, and a hardcore one at that. It takes a top down Hotline Miami-esk approach, and rather boldly the game actually lets you straight up see the detection range for pretty much all of your enemies. In many ways it harkens back to old, challenging, stealth games, which has become somewhat of a lost genre, as it feels like you can be stealthy in almost any game now, and many of the games which originally had stealth at their core like Splinter Cell and Thief, have become closer and closer to action games. That’s was what really intrigued me about the game so I requested a pre-release review copy, here are some thoughts from a guy who has never really been into hardcore stealth games.\n\nPresentationWhile there isn’t really anything new when it comes to the art style, it’s a unique blend of pixels and hotline miami. It doesn’t take any of the wackyness from hotline miami, but it gives the game it’s own, kind of dark, feel. And a large part of that is due to the atmosphere and the context of what’s explained about the world in the cutscene you get when booting up the game. Or, at the very least, I think that’s where the game is at its strongest; when it embraces its, kind of brutally depressing tone. The choir music that comes in when the guards have been alerted to your presence and are looking for you I thought was really inspired, I just felt that the tone shifted in the latter half of the game and found itself being a little more generic, which i’ll talk about a bit more in the story section.\n\nMechanicsThe mechanics are certainly good. This isn’t an easy game, and you are given a ton of different items and objects in the environment which allow for a lot a freedom. That said there is almost always an optimal way of playing, which there’s nothing wrong with, but just know that this isn’t really a game about multiple paths or ways of doing things, it’s about finding the right way of doing things. Like a stealth game should, each level is presented as a puzzle; the camera pans over to the exit and objectives to show you where you need to go, and then lets you roam free to figure things out. It starts simple, you just need to find your way to the exit in the early levels, but the longer the game goes on, the more enemies you need to avoid, and the more objectives you need to complete to create a path to the exit.\n\nThere are also optional objectives within’ certain missions that can grant you perks, and I have to praise the game for allowing these perks to be missed entirely. If you fail to complete the objective for a perk on a level, you cannot replay the level to get it. You’d have to start a new game, and get it the next time. It’s just a shame that the perks are not all that useful. The bonuses you get are really minor, like a very slight delayed reaction from enemies, and in the end I don’t know that they saved my life even once.\n\nDespite the praise I’m giving it, the game has a pretty major flaw in my opinion, and that’s unpredictability. One in every ten times you are making your way through a level, you’ll die and it won’t be your fault. Whether it’s a companion running right into gunfire and therefore failing the level, or an enemy seeing you for seemingly no reason, there’s something every now and again which’ll really ♥♥♥♥ you off. It’s fine in a game like hotline miami which has short levels and checkpoints, but many of the levels in this game are very very long, and to have a good five minutes of work go down the drain because of some derpyness in the game really tries the player’s patience. It’s not a universal negative, because I know that there are some very patient people out there who can deal with this stuff, but if you have a relatively short fuse for frustration like me, and I’m betting most people, then this is going to be an issue for you.\n\nStoryI was a big fan of the story at the beginning of the game. It’s set in the very near future, in a, kind of, dystopian US. I say kind of, because, without getting too political, it’s basically a very corrupt US, and a lot of people would argue that the US right now is corrupt, but maybe just not hugely corrupt like in this version of the US. But without getting too hung up in the details, you are playing as a woman who has simply been caught in a corporate feud, and has found herself needing to sneak past men with guns in order to survive. I’m really compelled by that idea, it’s kind of what fueled the creation of another game called “This War of Mine” where the focus is on the real victims of war, rather than glorifying one side as the heroes and another as the villains. The only heroes in “This War of Mine” are the people that do what it takes to survive. And that’s how I originally viewed the story of this game. Unfortunately, as the game goes on she becomes more and more like a Bruce Willis character. She acquires more ways of killing enemies, like grenades, and the story at one point becomes about saving other people rather than saving herself. Maybe I’m selfish, but that was a lot less relatable to me.\n\nI think they missed an opportunity here, and I wonder, now, what the point of the world building was. Why couldn’t it have been an office building in 2015 being threatened by terrorists if the main character was going to take it upon themselves to be a hero? What was the point of making the bad guys corrupt businessmen and politicians, and setting up the world as one full of bought, privatised, policemen? Was it just as an explanation for why the cops didn’t show up to help? The things that were interesting about the story to me just amounted to nothing, kind of disappointing.\n\nVerdictIt sucks to end on a negative note, because I am recommending this game, and it’s mostly down to the price to content ratio. The main story is 10-15 hours long, though can certainly be completed faster if you’ve mind for stealth, and is only $9.99 Steam with a discount on launch. It’s very very hard for me not to recommend the game because it’s gameplay, coming from a non-stealth fan, was satisfying and rewarding. Definitely worth the price tag.","December 15, 2015","true","23.6"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","19","30","4","0"

Turnover is a particularly unforgiving game and has pushed my patience with the short amount of time that I have spent with it.\n\nThat said, from each death I learn how to better navigate the game as Turnover has very solid and consistent mechanics. Each level takes me a few deaths/runs to understand where to expect encounters and available paths and how to get through, but getting to the end is wonderfully rewarding and I feel like I really deserved it.\n\nLong Division, LLC is also very open to feedback and is responsive which will make this great game even better with time.","January 8","true","11.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Alas, I found Turnover!\n\nTurnover is the hidden gem (pun intended) that you should be playing if you are a careful player. Like stealth games, patience is rewarded, you can never be too careful, and planning is key. The mechanics aren't too difficult to understand, but mastering how you get around takes time to learn. It's dark, simple, and fun.\n\nPros:\n+ Good mechanics, especially regarding stealth.\n+ Does an especially good job at tension. It's definitely not a horror, but you will get your thrills.\n+ Decently long story lasting a little over 2 hours. Maybe less if you're a quick learner.\n+ Interesting storyline and plot.\n\nCons:\n- Framerate changes between 30 FPS and 60 FPS. Rarely 15 FPS but it still happens. I'm not sure if this is just because of my computer, but a setting to keep it at 60 would be nice, even if it's just a game feature.\n- You can't change the floor/level at the beginning of the game. I've missed a few perks here and there because the objectives for getting them weren't clear, nor if you DID get it. I don't like how you couldn't repeat a past level to get try again.\n- (Not really a con) Difficult and unforgiving at first. Even in "hostage" (easy) mode it was difficult in the beginning. It gets better as you learn, but you will often be frustrated.\n\ntl;dr good 8.5/10 stealth game. worth the price.","May 3","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
