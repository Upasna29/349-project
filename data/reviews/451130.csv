I'll be adding to this review as i go.\n\n- The loading times are ridiculously long, not a huge deal for me, i've got patience but you know. Something to look into. Starting a sorcerer and loading the actual game took around 10 minutes.\n\n- If you're using Windows 10, be ready to deal with quite a ton of technical bugs. Compatability issues, when minimized you can not summon the game from the shortcut, you have to relaunch.\n- Constant crashes, i can't get farther then thirty steps without my game crashing.\n\n- I love the style, oh it gives me a little bit of nostalgia that i can not toss aside, i still look forward to giving this a full play.\n\nThis is all the reviewing i can do until the game is more refined on Windows 10.","March 18","false","0.4"," 103 of 131 people (79%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","79","103","131","11","14"

Perhaps I'm just early, that no other bad reviews (aside from those reporting about technical issues, mainly game crashes and loading times) have been written as of this moment.\nLet's get to the main issue I have with the game: This game is simply unable to be able to compete with many other MMORPGs in (possibly nearly) EVERY aspect.\n1. There nearly isn't any tutorial, or starting help that aids a new player (which pretty much includes everyone right now). No automatic tool tips (aside from the HELP section, which should only be secondary), no mini-map, no quest helper (that helps you locate the next NPC involved in a quest chain). This leaves nearly everyone absolutely lost (and frustrated) at the start of the game.\n2. The graphics and animations are among the worst I've seen. It would be (somewhat) forgivable if it were 2002, but it isn't. There isn't even an animation for stationary characters.\nAny good parts to the game? Perhaps there are. Unfortunately, I will likely never find out, whether or not the storyline is interesting and engaging, whether the in-game skill mechanics are unique, etc etc. Because getting a player started is almost always the most important part of every game; if you can't hook players within a relatively short period of time, and players have not invested (financially-wise) into the game, they are likely better off finding just another MMORPG that's better.","March 19","false","0.6"," 66 of 86 people (77%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","77","66","86","5","5"

I will add more to this review if I discover new things. This game feels and plays a lot like Final Fantasy XI the more I think about it.\n\nEdit 2: They've fixed the windows 8-10 compatibility issues (for the most part) and they've added an anticheat to keep those lowlife cheats out of a game they have no business playing (if they can't play it fairly, they don't belong). I have another comparison to make too, if you like games like Diablo this game can satisfy that itch with no problem.\n\nThis game is free, it's pve [edit: plus duels and guild wars] and  there is no pay to win .  Yes, it does have some compatibility issues due to it's age but they have since added some fixes to allow windows 8-10 users to play the game smoothly.. This game is perfect for those with low end pcs who want a fun mmo, with a focus on pve. The dialogue is bad, and the quests are a little confusing but not hard to ascertain what you need to do [edit: but the quests are completely optional, the game is more open ended than linear]. I think the people giving this game a bad review are mostly childish, don't know much about playing older games, or even how to review a game properly. You can't really review something you haven't played. Get it to work, then review it.  I give this 8/10 [formely 7/10] because its a good game for it's apparent age and still holds up against other games in the genre. I challenge the other reviewers to give this game a second chance and give an honest review. No one wants to hear about how you are not willing to toggle windows settings. I also encourage you to try this game, give it a chance and you will be rewarded.","March 20","true","83.5"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","0"

I didn't expect a whole lot, but at the moment it really is as bad as everyone says.\n\nThe beginning quest line has you killing gray wolves. With no armor, no weapon. Punch them to death. Except that they eat your face. I assume that it wants you to group up for this. Happened to find someone punching a wolf and helped. We almost killed it and then we both died. I see no skills available to me.\n\nUnless I'm missing something major, in which case, feel free to let me know what that is.","March 21","false","0.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
