I love mostly everything in this game, but my favorite part is that you can build anything that comes across your mind. The inprovements I would make on this game is I would add more "bad guys" to each lego island. Also, I think that you should make sure that the skeletons don't make an annoying sound when they attack. Last time I checked, skeletons don't have lungs. Also, I think you should add more animals to choose from.","June 20, 2015","true","16.2"," 570 of 610 people (93%) found this review helpful 249 people found this review funny","93","570","610","249","20"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bkwyrm/recommended/332310/","bkwyrm","bkwrm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bkwyrm/","618 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNow that update 2 is out my kneejerk thoughts from the little time I had today:\n+Camera is insanely better.  Just go to settings ingame (not the world choose menu), and choose Tracking under camera settings.  Honestly they still need a first person view for building and moving around inside houses, but this is very doable.\n\n-The camera centers around where your mouse is pointing, not the direction the camera is.  More freedom and great for posing shots, but also kinda disorienting.\n\n+New Discovery system is interesting.  Lots of animals/npcs require an item given to them to be unlocked.  For example to unlock a horse, you first need to get the apple item and than give one to him.  You are actually giving him the one you have, so you will have to find a new one later.  Like the idea behind it, but since chests give random items it is slightly annoying getting the item you want.\n\n+Map.  This is great, there's now a minimap in the upper right hand corner that you can place beacons on.  Need to test with long distance travel still, but I was getting lost constantly or driving in circles sometimes before.\n\nBuild mode I just spent a few min dealing with.  Seems slightly easier anyways.  Although my guy had gotten wedged inside a tree by the time I was done messing around.\n\nAll in all they seem to be listening to player feedback really well.  Still needs a lot more polish, but it's getting there.\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOld review from release, still need more time to play to determine what is still valid :/\n\n-Horrible camera. Has a nasty habit of trying to be helpful and angle/move itself instead of giving you full control over it. Makes many other things like aiming, looking around, building, running through structures, ect much harder than it should be.\n-Controls are very finicky as well, mostly when using vehicles. A lot of the time pressing backward will result in you going forward yet pressing forward will move you forward as well.\n-Needs a specific button to be held to climb IMO, but that again could just be due to camera control issues. I found myself climbing fairly often when inside structures when I had no intention to.\n-Weapon switching. Seems to want you to have a ranged weapon and a melee at the same time, but doesn't show you anywhere what the other one is that is equipped and IT decides which you will use on an attack. If it's what the game considers is a ranged target (which could be 5 ft away) than it will use the last ranged weapon you equpped. Quite annoying.\n-A small area shovel item would be nice, just for precise environment destruction. Not a big thing just would be nice.\n-Building is kind of wonky. Seemed like too many key bindings share the Shift key as well as every time I delete a single block I have to reselect the item I want to build again (it switches to block select mode instead of allowing you to keep placing).\n-ATM it's just building stuff and exploring/unlocking. No redstone or logic blocks, no crafting vehicles, no quests.\n\n\nNow all that seems negative, here's the positives.\n+Very stable. Have not had it crash or bug out on me yet.\n+It performs great on my I5, 750ti, 8gb of ram system (medium textures). I can play on higher textures as long as I'm not flying or moving fast it seems. Hopefully this stays the same after multiplayer is added eventually.\n+Perfectly captures the Lego feel. Graphics, characters, how the world is crafted, everything is spot on.\n+It is quite fun running around unlocking various set pieces, characters, environments for your character to purchase (allowing you to build them as well). Just touch it or kill it and it's there.\n+Vehicles and various weapons right off the bat are a nice change.\n+Friendly npcs as well as enemies and animals are wandering around. I only mention this because it is quite possible to add them to your structure as you please.\n+Character creator. At any time you can adjust various the various bits on your character. As long as you have that character unlocked you can wear parts from it for the most part. ATM I'm running around as a zombie in wizard robes (Lich). No fireballs yet, but a bazooka instead.\n+A surprising amount of content is included already for just being released on Early Access. Lots of set pieces and environments.\n+No wedged in survival/crafting mechanics. If done correctly it could be fun, however I far prefer being able to build as my imagination dictates as opposed to spending ages grinding large amounts of crafting materials.\n\n\nBasically the game is early access (beta) still so it has a ways to go. However it hits a lot of the right notes and I am enjoying it. First item on my todo list: Build a castle in the sky on a cloud and populate it with my own harem...\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTLDR. Early access so lots of wonky things needing fixed still as well as more content than just building stuff. But if you enjoyed The Lego Movie or remember playing with them as a kid you will probably like it. A game to watch, I have no regrets purchasing it.\n\n\nJust going to add a final plea to the developer: Please keep the DLC reasonable. That could easily make or break this game. As long as a Set unlocks a reasonable amount of pieces, characters, and prefabs, people will shower you with money. Nickel and dimeing however could kill it.","June 1, 2015","true","9.1"," 406 of 431 people (94%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","94","406","431","20","14"

YES IT IS!!!! I dare you to play this game without smiling. Pretty sure it's not possible.\nLove what I've tried of the Early Access so far. Worth my 15 dollars to help support this project. I can't wait to see all the different worlds. I GOT TO RIDE A BEAR!!!!\n\nPart 1: Building\nSo far from what I can tell, this early access lets you randomly generate a starting terrain, then you get to build whatever you want using LEGOS!!!\nBesides using just basic bricks to build whatever you want, there are premade structures and trees and things that you can set up in your world. When I set up a basic castle it also spawned some skeletons I was able to fight.\nSetting up a western house unlocked a horse.\nSo yeah, tons of potential here, Can't wait to see more!\n\nPart 2: Exploring\nThe second random world I generated was HUGE. I dropped in, and there were treasure chests, animals, other LEGO people, and vehicles. There was also tons of terrain and things to add to your LEGO collection so that you could use them to build in the future.\nSo far the exploring is my favorite part. I was driving dune buggies, flying planes, riding on eagles and bears, and unlocking all of it for future use.\n\nI'll be uploading video's to YouTube at the Hidden Level channel (https://www.youtube.com/user/HiddenLevelStart) as I can make them. Absolutely worth my money still, and it's only Early Access. Woo Hoo!\n\nEdit 6/3/2015: Still playing this game and enjoying every minute of it; it's really nice to be in this early access so I will be prepared for when multiplayer is released, and when updates come out it will be easy to learn/focus on the new stuff slowly at my own pace\n\nPart 1: Building/Menus\nhttps://youtu.be/cV6Dyc02Kq8\nPart 2: Exploring\nhttps://youtu.be/FHpWIVfTlbU\nWhat I've unlocked so far.

It's a LEGO version of Minecraft, essentially. Which apparently some people take offense to. Sure, another accurate statement would be the successor to LEGO Creator. They want to achieve the same things Minecraft does; open-world building done right, and with LEGO bricks, that's the perfect recipe.\n\nA lot of people have been complaining about no multiplayer, but give it a shot. Multiplayer isn't everything. While yes, it would extend the time you'd play the game, it's not going to totally transform it. Build a bit in singleplayer or mod the game if you're bored.

Do you have the guts to create one too?\n\nThe detail is jaw dropping amazing, I mean you can see that the world is made from piece by piece!\n\nThe graphics are fantastic, it honestly feels like I'm playing with real Lego, and not just some digtail 3D model replica.\n\nEverything you do, everything you find, everything you create is satisfying, and the game makes sure your satisfied.\n\nTT Games/Traveller's Tales always do a fantastic job with Lego games, this is easily their finest work!\n\n\nCons:\n\nIt's in Early Access meaning there are some bugs here and there, but even so I've only encountered about 4 so far, the first one is the Plane bouncing all over the place when it's on the ground, the second being the camara likes to hide underground sometimes, the third being that when I'm flying in the Ocean, some biomes don't spawn properly, I get introducted to the new biome, but nothing is there except water and this happened with a Swamp and a Crystal area, and lastly the game started up strangly, no music, no title screen, I just got to the main menu and the background wasn't there, the lighting was different too in the menu, however ingame everything was fine.\n\nCar and Boat controls are confusing at first, but easy to get used to.\n\nThe lack of a sprint button feels odd, I know it's a Lego game and they don't usually have a way to sprint, but for an adventure game like this, it would be nice to have one.\n\nBuilding is hard at first, however it's easy once you get used to it!\n\n\n\nOverall this game IS A MUST HAVE for any Lego lovers, it's one of my GOTY 2015.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lHm-stXdM\n\n\n\n\n\n*Also some feedback for the Devs*\n\n1. Add some content from previous Lego games, like some Dinosaurs from Jurassic Park, Batman and Villians, Star Wars characters, honestly it would be amazing. Even if you add it as DLC, I would easily pay full price for it!\n\n2. Add more sets, so far we only have 1, and more would make the game already more awesome!\n\n3. Add more strange creatures like the Burnard, a lot of us created our own strange animals when we were kids, why not add more?\n\n4. Multiplayer is a must have for this game, however I understand the engine isn't designed for Multiplayer, I have a suggestion to assist with this, make Multiplayer it's own Seperate DLC, kinda like how Just Cause 2 did, so the base game isn't effected if something goes wrong.\n\n5.

It's very subtle, yet so compelling. It's not something you notice until you settle down to build after you're finished exploring the world. Seriously, just sit in a quiet room and crank up the volume of the game, then wait for the Sun in-game to go down and the moon to come up, you'll know what I'm talking about. These faint nuances within the sound design of the game make the worlds feel truly alive and interconnected. I really felt like I was immersed in a fantasy wonderland ripe with imagination.\n\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW: If you are a creator like me, go buy this game right now! Don't even think about it, just do it!\n\nAfter playing this game for a few hours I've managed to make some very basic houses. Sounds boring, yes, but I now know I can never go back to Minecraft and its cube blocks again. Sorry buddy. You will be missed.\n\nThe first house I created was ayssemtrical. Every block you place down has that signature Lego clicking sound, so it feels soooo satisfying. So as I was creating my first house I had some choices: Should I use the piece that is 1 peg wide or 2 pegs wide for my foundation? This to me was monumental. Just a simple choice, but a choice that has been lacking for so long in a building game. I went with 1 peg wide to allow me to have more space in my house. Usually with the classic 1meter by 1 meter blocks of Minecraft, it was very difficult to implement any sort of crazy details into the structure. Lego bricks allow you to be much more precise and focus more on the details. On the corners of my house I ended up using the smallest bricks which allowed me to give my house an extremely realistic-looking diagonal shape.\n\nKeep in mind this is all a learning process as well. Since there are a multitude of different bricks available, you are able to focus more on the details of your creations, but at the same time it is very challenging to gain an understanding of even the most basic of building methods. This to me is a PRO, however, because it challenges you to best utilize your equipment to yield the best results. For example: after I was done creating my foundation I moved onto the roof. It took me at least a couple tries to get the roof done right. After a couple of hideous failures, I was finally successful in creating an aesthitcally pleasing and practical roof for my house. Taking what I had learned so far and applying it into my structures was such a joy.\n\nI have many more things to learn before I can build truly masterful creations. That's the appeal of this game for me: more choices and a higher learning curve. You actually have to put time into learning basic methods so you can create even the most basic of structures, and I love it. I have since created a few more houses, and along the way i have been learning new techniques, so each house is looking a bit better than the last.\n\nIn minecraft, creations only looked impressive if they were immense in scale as a result of a very limited selection of blocks. Once the community gets a hold of this game, however, creations will not only be immense in scale, but extremely detailed and intricate. I cannot wait to see what the community creates.\n\n\nPros:\n\n-multitide of different bricks to use (duh! this is lego afterall)\n-beautiful graphics and colors\n-very impressive for being so early in its development, meaning it has much potential\n-easy to use controls (although I wish there was a zoom button on the controller)\n- fluid movements by the characters\n-fun exploring elements (since the environments look so beautiful and relaistic, exploring IMO is worthwhile\n-surpisingly powerful atmosphere, reminescent of Flower\n\nCons:\n\n-Controller needs a zoom-in/zoom-out function\n-no mutliplayer YET\n-camera is a bit wonky at the moment when precise building\n-no 1st person mode\n\n\nI haven't been this impressed with a game in a long time. Seriously, go get it now.","June 3, 2015","true","59.8"," 126 of 135 people (93%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","93","126","135","6","0"

Interactive Entertainment\n\nNote: A key for this game was provided by the developer for the purpose of writing an informative review. No other compensation was given.\n\nIntroduction\n==========\nLEGO has been around for years, captivating the minds of children and adults alike. We are all familiar with the dozens and dozens of LEGO sets they've produced over the years, as well as the different video games they've made featuring different franchises. However, now they've decided to try something a bit different: a veritible LEGO playground, where it's your creativity and imagination that shapes the world(s). LEGO Worlds is a sandbox/creation game, where you (as a LEGO minifig) are dropped into a procedurally generated world and literally turned loose to do whatever you please. Whether it's exploring, creating, or destroying, all the tools necessary are at your disposal, and it's up to you how you use them!\n\nLEGO Worlds is the first LEGO game to be made available in the Steam Early Access program. It was decided to make it available in this manner because the developers would like the game to evolve by listening to player feedback and turn it into a great game that the players want. Being an established developer already, they didn't need to take the Early Access route, but they chose to anyway to have a closer bond with the community and share feedback and information with players. In the Steam forum for LEGO Worlds, there is a mega thread full of suggestions that the developers have been combing through for ideas for new features and things to add into the game. There are some great ideas in there, and some have already been announced for the next content update. Updates have been planned to be released monthly, so look forward to LEGO Worlds evolving into a great game (it already is one, but it'll get even better).\n\nGameplay\n==========\nLEGO Worlds is completely different from the previosu LEGO titles we are all familiar with. But there are certain elements that LEGO Worlds retains from other LEGO titles. Breaking objects yields studs, as always, which can then be used to purchase all the different characters, models, props, and tools you find in the world. As you find new things, they get added to your LEGO catalog, where you may buy them when you have saved the necessary amount of studs to purchase them. Once bought, you can spawn in those items, models, vehicles, etc, at any time thereafter. There are so many different options available, it's unreal. There is a character customiser, where you can add/remove certain features from your minifig, or choose to play as one you've found in the world. There is a Brick Builder, where you can choose from nearly any size/shape/color brick you can think of and build yoru own creations with them. There is a painting tool, which allows you to change the color of pretty much anything you see freely.  In addition, there is a terrain shaping tool, that allows you to smooth, flatten, raise, lower, and flatout cut/paste portions of the world however you choose. This allows for shaping th eworld in any way you want.\n\nAs you explore, you will find many, many, many different things. You will discover a lot of different biomes as you explore, such as the candy hills, forests, mountains, and sometimes a dark, obsidian plain with pools of lava scattered throughout. There are Props such as flowers, bushes, and other such items are littered throughout the landscapes, and in a lot of different varieties. There are trees, hills, boulders, and other such terrain features, and even some generated structures like houses and tower. Sometimes you will find small treasure chests with thousands of studs inside, or a big treasure chest in the generated structures which holds a new tool or prop for you to play with, such as a sword or a club. Think that's enough? Nope, think again! Throughout the world you will also find vehicles and creatures which you can mount and ride. Bears, goats, pigs, cows, horses, and even ostriches and rdagons are just a few of th ecreatures you'll find.  Boats, cars, a driller, airplane, helicopters, and even lawnmowers are some of the vehicles you may stumble across during your adventures. All can be unlocked simply by touchign them and then spawned it at anytime through the LEGO Catalog in the menu.\n\nGraphics\n==========\nThis is your standard LEGO game, and as such, EVERYTHING is built entirely out of LEGO brick. That tree over there? LEGOs. That mountain off in the distance? LEGOs! The clouds in the sky? Yup, you guessed it: LEGOs! Despite being made entirely out of LEGOs, the game worlds are incredible detailed and beautiful, especially if you can get really high in the skies over the land (through the use of a plane, helicopter, or a dragon) and look at the landscapes around you. It's all LEGOs, but it all works and makes sense for this type of game!\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nThis is probably the game's weakest point at the moment. There is almost no background music, and when you discover new things there is a little jingle that plays every single time you find a new character, creature, or vehicle. You may get tired of that quickly, but it's a minor nuissance in my opinion. It just emphasizes the feeling of exploration and discovery as you traverse the land! Nothing really special is needed for this type of game, but I'm sure the developers have plans to expand things in this area.\n\nPerformance\n==========\nLEGO Worlds is an Early Access title, and naturally it has some of the issues other Early Access titles have. I encountered a few random crashes during my playtime, usually after an hour or two of play. The game would just shut down and return me to Windows. I did not experience any framerate issues, except for when using the LEGO Set building to spawn pre-defined builds into the world the first or second time. It would freeze for a second or two while the building occured. After that it was very smooth. Despite the problems the game runs very well and I can only expect it to get better as Early Access implements optimization patches and changes throughout the course of development.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nA great concept that has been LONG overdue, LEGO Worlds is that game you have always wanted as a LEGO fan. The ability and tools to build, create, and destroy anything you want are all here in your own LEGO worlds! As more and more features and blocks are added throughout the course of Early Access, I'm sure LEGO Worlds will not disappoint!\n\nI had the opportunity to speak with one of the developers about the game, where they offered some insight into a few of the challenges presented when developing a LEGO game, and also some plans for future updates.

I then skyjumped out of the tree and rode into the sunset on a tiny plastic wolf that was better animated than any animal in Skyrim.\n\n10/10 Would punch nurse and ride into the sunset again.\n\nAdding an actual review to this review.\n\nI've played the game now for about nine hours at the time of writing this and while I will most likely continue to do so... I do have some problems with the game that I'd like to point out.\n\nNumber one (and this is a big one): The camera manipulation is downright nauseating. They seem to have adapted their camera movement from previous LEGO games like LEGO Lord Of The Rings and the LEGO Star Wars games. Now I don't have any problem with the camera angles in those titles mainly because they tend to be well scripted to always focus on the right thing or the level is linear enough for it not to be an issue.\nIn LEGO worlds however, this means you get a third person view that kind of follows you around rather than actually listens to your direct input.\n\nThere is a good reason that most open world building games have both a first person and third person perspective you can switch between, this is because a lot of the time you will be sticking your nose into details and you don't want your character getting in the way. You also want to be able to look around quickly when under attack.\n\nIn ground vehicles it becomes really apparent how ill this system fits the game.\nI propose that the entire camera system should be redone with a higher field of view and more traditional third and first person camera controls because quite frankly I don't see how you could ever get the current system to work in a responsive kind of way for this type of game.\n\nNumber two: You can't build vehicles. I really hope that a system for assembling vehicles will be implemented because that will really be the thing that makes or breaks the game for me. Building stationary objects is fun but there already is LEGO Digital Designer, not to mention countless other building games in the style of Minecraft that offer a lot more interactivity.\n\nSome smaller issues I have are the lack of multiplayer/co-op, some lack in UI functionality and bugs, a big lack of LEGO parts and low draw distances but I'm sure all of this will be fixed later on.\n\nDespite the short draw distance the tech behind this game is quite impressive and for the amount of detail on display it runs pretty well. I get between 50 to 60 fps pretty consistently with exception of when I'm in an aircraft.\n\nIn conclusion I will say that it shows promise but it's very rough around the edges. It goes without saying that the open world building game-genre is a perfect match for the LEGO theme and I have no doubt the game is going to be very popular upon release.\n\nRight now though, only buy this title if have high tolerances when it comes to field of view and odd camera movements.","June 5, 2015","true","9.3"," 234 of 300 people (78%) found this review helpful 249 people found this review funny","78","234","300","249","5"

It's definitely worth the $15 now, especially if that goes up when the game is finished. The graphics are beautiful- it feels like real lego instead of a pseudo-lego 3d animated world. I have not encountered one bug, although I  only bought the game 2 days ago.\n\nPros\nYou get to be in a world made entirely of lego. Really, that's worth $15 by itself.\n\nThere are land and air vehicles, something I wish minecraft had. (I realize that its nature makes any land vehicles very difficult to make. I mean, every surface is either perfectly flat or a wall.)\n\nThere is a great variety of people, biomes, and creatures.\n\nMaybe-an-easter-egg-maybe-not: Whenever you unlock something, it plays a fanfare from the "Bifrosty Reception" level of LEGO Marvel Super Heroes.\n\nCons:\n\nThis game has no multiplayer. This is the one reason I was divided on buying it- I knew it didn't have this feature. This is a pain for me because I usually play video games with my younger sister, and haing to take turns is pretty much the bane of anyone who plays games.\n\nMY GOD, THE MENUS: The menus in this game are even worse than the ones in The Hobbit. To equip an item, for instance, you must:\nOpen the "General" menu\nScroll up or down until you find the tab which includes items (it also includes creatures, characters, vehicles, 2 kinds of models, and props)\nOpen that tab\nSurprise! The tab was actually a submenu. (As is every other tab) FInd the "Items" tab in the submenu\nPsyche! That tab was also a submenu. (As is every other submenu tab) Scroll around until you find the item you want\nSelect that item\nClose the menu\n\nAt this point, even a monkey could have killed you twice.\n\n\n\nOther suggestions for the developers:\n\nMake nights darker, so the lantern is actually useful.\n\nMake monsters more dangerous/aggressive/numerous/varied (One thing I missed from minecraft). This also gives people an actual reason to build a shelter. (this and the previous suggestion could be part of a "Hardcore" mode.\n\nAdd an option to make your own creations indestructible to you (In case you slip up with the bazooka or drill machine)\n\nAdd a wielding torch or something which gradually restores damaged structures.\n\nAdd more varied items- most of them do basically the same thing now.\n\nAdd characters from  other franchises- even if they're DLC.\n\nMake more realistic bullets- the one for the pistol is the same as the one for the bazooka.\n\nAdd the option to import lego models from Lego digital designer\n\nMake it workshop enabled so people can share creations\n\nAdd more specialized weapons like a rifle with a scope (like the telescope) or a machine gun\n\nAdd a first person view, because third person is kind of annoying in small places like the pyramid. Also, it would feel more realistic.\n\n\nAll of these are secondary to multiplayer (preferably splitscreen), however.","August 30, 2015","true","27.9"," 94 of 104 people (90%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","90","94","104","7","8"

Since the original lego games came out for the computer back when I was visiting my aunt in 1998. I loved the idea of a online build and unlimited block capabilities. But even those games where very limited based on the storyline. Just as Lego Jurassic world is today.. While I still love it , it has it's limits and for a creative person like me it does hit ya a little hard :/.. But lego worlds!? OMG I've had it all of three days and I already love it, the exploration, the unlimited amount of generated worlds. The caves, the biomes, the animals , enemies and characters. Props to unlick, Worlds to build and hours of Adventure!? It's like minecraft was just a building block for this, and now with the concept out full steam. the lego I dreamed for 16 years ago has come to life and I can not praise the creaters enough. Keep going, keep improving, keep growing this world. You have generations of gamers salivating and the potential in it's future. The game is fantastic and I could care less if it's ever published as a full game.  The continual improvements makes everyday a adventure.","August 19, 2015","true","10.8"," 96 of 110 people (87%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","87","96","110","16","4"

So small, you could stand on the shore on one side and see to the other side of the island. I proceeded to explore this small island in the middle of nowhere. It seemed all life that once inhabited this land had died off; I found a few animal skeletons, so I did what any normal person would do. I punched them for money.\n\nIn my attempt to find treasure rich lands far away, I began to swim. After a couple of minutes I stumbled across a tiny land mass barely big enough to stand on, inhabited by a lone pig. I chased the pig around for many minutes in the shallow waters before jumping on it and commanding it to swim. More minutes past, and the pig was starting to tire. We came across a boat in the middle of the ocean, so I immediately jumped off the pig and let it drown while I checked out my new boat. It had a bubble roof, and looked like a submarine, but as far as I can tell, you are unable to submerge the submarine yet.\n\nIn the distance a new land came into view. This was it. This was where I was to make my fortune. I could sense the treasure. The island turned out to be only slightly larger than the one I came from, but in the middle stood a large, thin pillar. Atop this pillar, a treasure chest. I was right, this IS the land of treasure. I took a deep breath, thanked the pig for its sacrifice, and climbed the pillar, awaiting the riches contained within. I lifted the top of the chest, and dived in headfirst. With great anticipation, I pulled from the chest.... A fish. A FISH. A. FISH. IN A TREASURE CHEST?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FreeBird_toby/recommended/332310/","FreeBird_toby","FreeBird","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FreeBird_toby/","80 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDisclaimer: This game is in early access and clearly not finished! It may not even run properly on your machine (AMD CPUs are at this point apearently not supported too well). You should not buy any early access games if that bothers you. It may also lessen the fun you will have when the game finally comes out, as you may be tired of it.\n\nSo that out of the I have to say that this game amazes me. This really is the video game that captures the spirit of lego perfectly. It marries the procedually generated worlds that made Minecraft special with the lightheartedness of the worlds favourite toys. The worlds just look fantastic.\n\nIt is obvious that this game was heavily inspired by Mojangs smash-hit, but it deviates from the formula in all the right places. There is no survival here. Weapons and other objects are found in structures around the world, so no crafting in that sense either. Instead of first person the game uses the classic Tt lego game third person. Building is done very differently as well. You pretty much switch to an editor view, which is very powerfull, but also no where near as intuitive as Minecrafts building is. You can achieve a lot more, but it is also going to be harder.\n\nThankfully you also have the ability to put prebuild structures into the game. These have 3 categories: Sets, Brickbuilds, and Props. Props are prebuild small anythings that range from foliage to lamps and a barbeque. Some of them can be interacted with, which results in some good old lego game humor. Sets are actual lego sets that are availiable for purchase. So far there only is one of them, which essentially is a (nice looking) collection of props. Brickbuilds is where it really shines. There are a bit more than 50 buildings already in the game. Most of these are pretty goofy with things like a gingerbread house, the Tt Games logo or some random pixel (bricksel?) art, but there also are two really nice houses. The truly amazing thing about this category however is that you can import your own builds from Lego Digital Designer. This is incredible for building big structures like houses, or things that you will need often, like tables chairs and other pieces of furniture.\n\nThere also is a good terrain editor in the game. It is intuitive and produces great results.\n\nThe gameplay and combat in particular is pretty much what you know from Tt Games lego games. It is not very deep, but fun and sufficient for this game, where the focus clearly is on building things. (It also definitly is an upgrade over minecrafts cardboard-waving combat.)\n\nThere also are some problems. Obviously there still are a lot of features missing. Those include multiplayer, meaningfull interaction with NPCs, a ton of lego bricks (DOORS!) and many other things you could wish for. As this is early access these things will change. The camera can be terrible, especially when building underground or driving a vehicle in small spaces. Building brick by brick is flawed, but you have Digital Designer for that.\n\nIn conclusion I say that this game has huge potential. The randomly generated terrain alone is fascinating. Add to that the ability to pretty much build anything you want and you have a true lego experience. Another thing that made a positive impression on me is the balance between male and female characters, which are all pretty likeable. If you just want an infinite box of lego you can buy this game right now and will not have regrets. If you are focussed on game mechanics you should not, as at this point there really is not a lot you can do.\n\nNow if you will excuse me, I have to dig a cave using my bazooka, have a nice day!","June 14, 2015","true","23.4"," 63 of 71 people (89%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","89","63","71","9","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/recommended/332310/","mrluchador","Chris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/","1587 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is a quick first impressions review based on the hour of gameplay I've had so far with the Early Access build. I'll update this review as new builds are released.\n\nFirst Impressions\n\nFirst things first, I've already seen and been asked about comparisons to Minecraft, this is understandable considering the nature of the games. I'd like to think that LEGO and Minecraft have inspired each other in someways, due to the nature of LEGO and the way it draws upon imagination to create and build. Minecraft got their first in regards to computer games, so it does look like LEGO are playing catch up. If LEGO can capture the physical wonder in LEGO Worlds than they'll be onto something great - and I personally don't mind if they've drawn some inspiration from Minecraft (afterall Minecraft were probably inspired by LEGO).\nHaving said that there aren't too many similarities. Sure you can explore a randomly generated world, you can dig, but there's no real 'crafting' system in place yet. Certainly not to the scale of Minecraft's where you have to punch a wood tree, to craft wood tools, so you can harvest quicker and better items, etc. and I personally like that LEGO World hasn't gone down this route. There are too many Minecraft clones out there, and it's refreshing to see LEGO World attempt to be it's own thing, and stick with what makes LEGO so great - building blocks.\n\nThe first hour of gameplay was mainly spent just exploring the first seed world the game created for me. At first it appeared small on the menu reveal, however once I was placed into it the world seemed to have grown into a huge environment containing several different themed eco-systems. Each little themed eco-system had it's props (the pre-molded LEGO pieces like plants, trees, etc) and characters, which you are able to harvest/collect simply by touching or destroying them. The characters/props are added to your collection for you to use, available at various stud prices (don't worry too much about Studs as with previous LEGO Games everything you destroy spawns studs).\nI enjoyed the exploration part, there was something relaxing about running around trying to collect various props and see what the seed world had to offer. It was exciting too, as you stumble across different animals, prop and vehicle spawns - the most interesting of which I've discovered so far is the massive Digger.\n\nHowever, there's not much else to the current build. At one point in the game I dug as far down as I could with the digger and hit the bottom of the seed world. There was nothing there other than an empty tile grid. I dug through what looked like a rich mineral environment and discovered nothing. It could be that these are features that will be added at a later date, or simply put there will be no real need to dig and search for minerals (after all who does that in LEGO anyway?).\n\nWhat do you get is a huge range of Lego Blocks to use in Builder Mode where you can create your own creations with the LEGO blocks you've probably grown up with. I can't decide if I like that you get the full range straight away, or if perhaps I'd have liked the challenge of hunting bits down similar to the props, such as more 'interesting' blocks hidden in the various chests that you can find around the world (which so far seem to contain studs and items such as swords, fish, guns, etc for your Character to hold).  I did find it a little cumbersome to try and build using the default controls for the 360 pad, so hopefully this can change in the future. I'll attempt again using Mouse & Keyboard to see if it feels more natural.\nLikewise there doesn't seem to be anyway to customise you own character yet, despite the options being available - I didn't manage to find a single custom piece for my character in the hour I've spent playing (which isn't really a lot of time). I'm hoping we'll be able to discover them and they won't be tied up in various themed DLC releases down the road. I remember this happening with the LEGO MMO that was released a few years back and hating it.\n\nYou're probably wondering why TT & Warner Bros have released this via Early Access, thankfully the developer and publisher have been honest about this approach - they want our feedback. They want to develop the game alongside the user's experience. So hopefully we can help mold LEGO World into something we'll enjoy.\nThe early impressions so far, for me at least, is that this is something hugely promising, and if TT can capture the real essence of LEGO in LEGO World - the imagination and creativity with exploration - we'll be on to something good.\nHopefully TT take on suggestions about system & graphics settings too, as the default controller settings weren't too my personal like (no way to invert the axis), and the lack of 'windowed mode' could disappoint some people.\n\nIn short a very promising foundation for what could be a great creative experience different enough to separate itself from the various Minecraft/LEGO Clones already out there.\n\nMore updates to follow.","June 1, 2015","true","2.1"," 74 of 88 people (84%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","84","74","88","7","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zackcasey/recommended/332310/","zackcasey","Zack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zackcasey/","86 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI've been a fan of Lego and their video games since Creator and Loco days. Back in June 1st, 2015, I heard about Lego Worlds the minute it was released. I'm quite suprised such a high profile company would go the early access but I'm not complaining.  Like everyone else, I was hyped and wanted right now. I didn't have the budget at the time to get and remained out of the loop until recently.\n\nProir to my purchase, Lego Worlds lacked titles in the cutscenes that told which binome you were in and who each Minifig was; map, waypoints, and "quests" per-se. We'll get to the last one in a moment. After my purchase, it had all these features. So while I'm disappointed I wasn't able to get in earlier, I'm NOT disappointed with the game and glad I got in now or wouldn't know what some of the less obvious stuff is.\n\nMy only criticism is how you gain new minifigs and pets, the former is to use on your avatar, in the form said "quests". Minifigs and pets are spread out throughout their respective binomes and ask for specific things in a form of a thought bubble. This may not be obvious to you if you watch the day one Let's Plays where you can get on them without having to hunt for objects or just to new to the mechanic in general. Once you have what they needed, they will be available  to purchase using the in-game currency. HOWEVER, this is easier said then done.\n\nAfter you see what it is they need, you etheir check your inventory and hope you're lucky or go and explore, opening thousands of large chests miles/meters away from where you first found them to find said item. Once you got the item you hope to return to the binome you found them or hope to find a new one with same minifigs and their pets.\n\nThis method of gaining minifigs and pets is a mixed bag of chips. On one hand, it encourges you explore and gain new items along the way. On other hand, it can get repetitive and or frustrating when you all want is that cute little wolf pup. D:\n\nIn a nutshell, ths is basically Lego Creator on an grand and epic scale, encourging you to explore and rewarding you in items, minifigs, and pets to make your world more rich. I'm just kinda suprised a or any "AAA" publisher would go the early access route.\n\nIs it bad or is it good? As of now, they're doing good. So, it's good. Keep it up Lego. I look forward to the future now, 1.0, and beyond. It's simply playable and fun with it's typical rough edges.","October 21, 2015","true","7.6"," 39 of 41 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","39","41","4","0"

The game completely lacks substance and tries to establish itself as some form of building game yet adds no real reason to build in LEGO Worlds over LEGO Digital Designer, if I want to build in LEGO Worlds the stuff I build should come alive, not to mention if I build a house in this game my character keeps trying to climb across the ceiling like monkey bars, so I dismissed that this game would ever establish itself as a 'great LEGO building game' yet there was still potential as a LEGO sandbox adventure game. Yet TT seems to just add updates with collectibles and some new characters....? That's fun and all but that's not substantial content or really much good reason to play. Sure I might play longer to find those new characters, but that's not really enjoyable. This game could've incorporated so much more from the LEGO theme such as LEGO City biomes where cities with people spawn, a Kingdoms area and so on, where you could go and interact with people in these areas. Overall this game just continues to disappoint me, not even to mention the fact they still ignore multiplayer, the game continues to sell because people are completely sold out by the thought of multiplayer. In all honesty though, multiplayer won't make this game great. #MakeLEGOGamesGreatAgain","May 4","false","13.5"," 76 of 102 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","76","102","3","4"

As it is right now, it has a lot more stuff then Minecraft, Cars, Aircraft boats, you can ride every animal you find, horses, dragons, dogs, goats, and so much more! It's not a Mincraft clone though, it feels and plays different, just looks very similer.  There's also some good weapons to find, swords, caveman clubs, bazookas, blunderbuss, and other things like that. Once you unlock the Warlock, you'll be blowing stuff up with fire like a pyromaniac. I still can't decide what's better, shooting fireballs with the Warlock, or blowing stuff up with the bazooka. Also, I hope your hungry, because candyland awaits! Just watch out for the Skeletons, their battlecry is kind of funny. On one last note you can import Lego digital designer models into the game, but not all bricks work yet. I imported a sports car model, but the wheels never showed up, and the exuast pipes where replaced with basic bricks in game. anyway, Lego Worlds is fun.","June 3, 2015","true","18.2"," 45 of 53 people (85%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","85","45","53","10","0"

Upon opening a chest or discovering a player/creature/vehicle/object for the first time, the attempted cinematic camera angles can result in some very jumpy behavior. If these things may affect you, please exercise caution!\n\n\nThat being said, I see a great deal of potential here. Right now gameplay is comparable to Landmark with less fancy combat but quests and ridable vehicles and creatures. Its mostly exploring and discovering right now, but there's plenty of biomes and contents in them to find and have fun with.\n\nNo idea if the price will go up in the future, but its reasonably fun where it is now, and pretty safe for kids as the closest thing to "gore" is knocking something to pieces. If you like the LEGO games that are made for other branded series, you'll probably enjoy this too.\n\nAside from the camera... my only other knock in the current state is that the controls are really wonky sometimes. I don't really like K&M or Gamepad 100%, and they have some discrepancies to work out before either one of them is solid.

Sure, it looked cool, but could it be as good as LEGO Universe was, or Minecraft is?  While it's not quite there yet, it is easy to see that LEGO Worlds has great potential.  It's a seemingly infinite sandbox for you to explore (I say seemingly because I don't know if there is a limit or not), and plenty of items to find.  Overall, it's a great game.\n\nThe main problems that I believe are holding it back from being just as good as Minecraft or LEGO Universe are basically just the complexity of builds, the lack of exciting gameplay, and the few glitches it contains.  The blocks you can place, unlike Minecraft's blocks, are definite shapes, which is both good and bad.  Minecraft is a bit more simple in this regard, but, as stated before, this is not much of a problem, especially if you're willing to take the time to place each little detail on your creation.  Also, the sandbox world seems to be lacking the ability to grasp the player's attention in the way Minecraft does.  If you have ever played Minecraft for at least 5 minutes, you will already understand how the game seems to grasp your attention, and won't easilly let go.  LEGO Worlds is currently lacking that.  However, I have high hopes that the developers will be able to easilly fix this problem.  I believe that a simple way this could happen is by implimenting a "survival mode" for it (LEGO Worlds seems to be stuck in "Creative Mode;" it's fun, but survival could potentially be more so).\n\nFinally, the glitches, while few in number, do add some annoyance to the game.  But first of all, this is obviously perfectly normal for any game still being designed, so there is not much to worry about.  Worst case scenario, you might have to just exit and re-enter your world.  Again, perfectly normal for a game still being developed, so don't let this be a hinderance to you for buying this game.  The developers are constantly updating LEGO Worlds, and adding more and more fun and facinating options into the game with each update.\n\n\nLEGO Worlds is amazing, and I absolutely love it.  While still quite a ways away from becoming the next Minecraft, or a LEGO Universe replacement, it has so much potential.  And, especially considering the great quality and dedication poured into its creation, the price of $14.99 is amazing!  I definitely recommend this game to anyone and everyone!\n(Except my dog- he's not allowed to use the computer  :P)","November 6, 2015","true","15.4"," 34 of 36 people (94%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","94","34","36","11","3"

I'll be honest, I almost didn't purchase this game, but I'm glad I did!  I've played Roblox and Blockland before, and I felt like this wouldn't be any good. But, it continued to amaze me as I played it. It has TONS of content for an Early Access game. It's fun to walk around and explore new places, looking for items to give to people and animals so I can play with them. (The animals want different foods, and the people want food, clubs, guns, etc. depending on who they are.) I heard alot of people complain about this, but it really isn't hard to finish. When you begin the game, you begin with tons of bricks and colors to build with (even though some people say you don't, you do), so if that's the only reason you want to play, you don't even need to worry about quests. :) The quality of the game is amazing, and it's really fun and easy to build. I have legos, and don't use them often, but this game puts legos to a new perspective with you as the minifigure! Definitely a great buy, and with multiplayer coming up I'm sure it will be even greater.\nMy only worry is that the online play may not be moderated properly, and it'll be filled with inappropriate content. That would make me unhappy, considering how often my siblings play this game.\nI'm sure Lego knows what it's doing though.\nAlso, I'd really enjoy it if there was a music brick so I could play certain music in certain places of my builds. (Like preset choices for suspenseful, happy, sad, music.) Blockland does this, and I think it would add a new level of creativity to some builds. Maybe they could compose their own music if they don't want people uploading music that could be inappropriate.

Tried swimming in the lava...well we bearly got out alive.\n- Exploration is encouraged as you can find new sets, new characters, and new designs.  Some areas have secret treasure chests where you can find currency used to help constuct building diagrams in your journey. You can also find usable items like pistols, bow and arrows, bannanas, to use along your journey. You may never know when that banana might come in handy, allowing you to try and interact with the games world to find its purpose in the games mechanics. A sense of wonder.\n- Spent an hour creating my own custom block by block home and was immensly fun, it simulates the freedom of creativity as if it was using real lego blocks. Perusing the world for window blueprints/ and door plans is what I set out to do next as I want to finish my home before midnight when zombies come out.\n- Can customize your character. From the types of hats you wear to what your hands and hips even look like. There is also a cape slot....Does that mean we can glide or fly in air if we find a blueprint in the world?\n- Pre formed buildings and layouts already made.  Full homes and models like trees made to fully customize your own lego world.\n-Interactable objects like basketball hoops or swimming pools where you can shoot and swim.\n- You can ride horses, camels, sheep, and other animals...\n-Found some bandits and yetis, beat them to a pulp. Yetis are shockingly cute.\n- One of my favorite parts was flying in an airplane around different islands and finding all the goodies and sights to see.\n- Fight awesome lego inspired monsters and baddies like warlocks, skeletons and zombies.\n- Exploring is half the game to me, the other half is creating awesome structures and my own dream lego world!

However, most of the fun comes from terra-forming (some of the best tools to do so since Magic Carpet), as trying to build your own structures is going to be a lesson in tedious camera correcting and axis monitoring. Once these things are practiced though it starts to become second nature, and most of the problems with the game (damn camera) can be easily fixed in time.\n\nSomething I am nervous of is if there will be microtransactions. Right now all unlocks are bought with in game coins (found buy interacting and destroying things just like in the other Lego games) but the menus hint at a purchase setup for complete build sets especially. Though a really nice one is included already, I can easily see Lego charging arm and leg for more (after all this game has real potential to cut into sales of their physical sets).\n\nIt's pretty amazing that the entire world, sans sky and water, is completely made up of Lego bricks. It is mighty impressive that destruction or addition of pieces is easily handled by the game's engine, but the framerate can often stutter as distant terrain and objects load in. It's not enough to ruin the experience but it's always noticeable.\n\nHere are some cool tips for a newbie:\n\n- Use the bulldozer vehicle to clear large swaths of land for flat building. Keep in mind that vehicle controls are view-relative, so always keep the camera behind the player when steering. You can also use the delete function but that doesn't work too well for removing generated terrain. Bulldozer is also good for setting up terrain for roads for the car.\n\n- Use a certain flying creature's attack to create natural looking caverns and valleys.\n\n- Infinite cash flow can be had by interacting with the light post object in the house set, over and over again.\n\n- Don't touch the orange glowy stuff. However feel free to place the glowy stuff by painting with the bright orange texture (only found in main paint menu, not block painting).\n\n- When trying to build up in a vertical line, restrict to Z and X axis / When building lines horizontally, just use the view-relative axis control. Hold Shift before placing down a block and then drag to create a line.\n\n- When matching heights of several blocks using the line feature, listen for the "click" sound that accompanies a correctly placed piece.\n\n- Utilize switching between Overlap and Non-overlap modes. It can really save you a headache when editing small mistakes or gaps in the structure as you probably won't have to find the exact piece that will fit.\n\n- Avoid using copy/paste because it's kinda screwey how it currently selects things and its camera is even scewier. The camera is not coded the same way as the other building modes.\n\n- Bears are easier to control than horses, and faster at climbing hills too.\n\n- If you get stuck, scroll to Options in the main menu and activate sky-dive","June 2, 2015","true","13.9"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","97","30","31","3","2"

There are a couple of niggles, for example you have to chase down the studs when you destroy something and they vanish quite quickly. When you are riding around on something, like a crocodile, you have to quickly try to turn around and travel over them. This is OK but a pain. I miss quite a lot and the "cost" of unlocking new props and characters is taken from this pool of studs.\n\nAnother issue I have is combat. Skeletons just keep on coming and I am struggling with the controls to keep on top of the swarming bones... I am using keyboard / mouse and this might not be an issue for people using a controller however.\n\nThe islands seem pretty small to me, perhaps I just haven't found a world size selector yet so this might not be an actual problem with the game but with me not looking round well enough. The worlds that are offered seem to be made up of a lot of water and not a lot of land. This should be OK when update 2 comes out as you can build underwater apparently. This will be a good addition i think.\n\nYou can do all the terrain stuff you expect, lower, raise, smooth etc and you can change the colours of everything. One warning, if you change the colour to the red and yellow quarters in the colour pallette, you are not changing the colour but LAYING DOWN LAVA!!! Found this out the hard way :-(\n\nThe sounds are OK, each brick when put down makes an approriate noise. I am old enough to have had a box of Lego bricks that were just that, bricks that you could build what you wanted without having these Lego sets that build something like the Death Star or a JCB digger. You have all the little bricks that you could ever want, make them any colour you want and design what you want. and the best of all? You get to do this WITHOUT THE RISK OF TREADING ON A BRICK BARE FOOT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT!!!!!  Lego without the pain!!! What more can someone ask for?\n\n:-)\n\nThere is a lot of potential and as I unlock things and the game evolves I will add to this review so if you are thinking about buying the game but not just yet, check back and see what I think as time goes on.\n\nEdit after update 2\n=============\nThere are some really nice additions now and the way to discover some of the characters has changed, for the better I must say. You will often need to hand them something, maybe a fish, telescope or banana. Won't tell you who wants what... These things are to be found in the big chests, found at the top of important landscape bits. Or sometimes not.... Again, don't want to give anything away.\n\nI am now happier with the building mechanism, I am not sure if this has changed or I have just got the hang of it a bit more. There are issues with building underwater, yes, you can now build underwater. I suggest waiting till you have a skeleton or scuba diver. One doesn't breathe and one brings his, (or probably hers, haven't found female scuba diver yet), own supply.\nThese problems are being looked at and fixes found.\n\n\nSo, do I still reccommend it? Yes I do and I have high hopes for the future.","August 20, 2015","true","19.0"," 37 of 43 people (86%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","86","37","43","11","1"

I went away on a school trip the day this came out (June 1st) and was chatting to my friend on the bus about how epic a lego sanbox game like minecraft would be. I got back on the afternoon of the 5th and saw this on Google+, so i thought i would give it a whirl. I downloaded it and began to play. On the world select  a create new world option comes up and you can see your world to see if you are happy with it. I fiddled with the coords (like minecraft seeds) and had a look at the Terraria style character system. Finally i entered my vast and beautiful world and found myself falling out the sky! I instantly got the hang of the game structure and began exploring. I discovered i could ride veichles to unlock them, walk past characters and plants to unlock them and punch skeletons and mummies! As night fell I began to build some random bricks. The sun came up again after my fist night and i set off towards the desert i has seen in the map. On my way i saw a huge treasure chest. I sprinted towards it and opened it. A short cutscene began of my character pulling a bow out of the treasure chest. A bow, now i can go hunting!\nThis game has a beautiful atmosphere and I would recommend throwing your money at this game. Yep, i can see the look on your face at that sentence, go ahead!

It can just hover above the ground in one spot if you let it).\n-Vehicle camera controls (It's like the game wants me to stare at the tail of the plane, instead of what's infront of the plane).\n-Submarine does not submerge\n-Odd spawns for creatures/vehicles (I found a submarine stuck in a tree, nowhere near water).\n-A whole lot of Giant Drill glitches (Don't drive it into the ocean, you'll be sent flying).\n-Tricky and confusing in-game menu (Was it really necessary to have the rotating buttons hunched in the top left corner?

I'll explain.\n\n-This game's brick building system is amazing.\n-There aren't that many bricks to use, but the ones that are there are usable for many things.\n-Game looks amazing without being graphically intensive.\n-The ability to edit every individual block in the seemingly infinite world. (someone get on this! Find the farlands!)\n-So many vehicles, biomes, creatures, minifigures, and little items to unlock.\n-Soon to be multiplayer.\n-Great terraforming tools.\n-Neat stud system where you unlock something, then buy it to spawn it infinitely afterwards.\n-The items you unlock become spawnable on every map you create, much like terraria.\n-Incredible movement animations for the characters.\n-Awesome rocket launcher physics.\n\nSome things can be fixed or edited.\n\n-When you copy something, like a roof, and paste it on a house that is smaller than the roof, the generation puts land where there was something hanging off.\n-When pasting and you have the outline of what you're pasting, there are some positions where you can't place it. (if an explanation is needed, I can make a video.)\n-The panning camera stops working on occasion, fixable by restarting the game.\n-When brick building, the panning camera might zoom out very far. So when you middle click on a block, it zooms very far out.\n-When you dig with the drill into water, you fly into space. (Extremely funny the first time)\n-Minifigures getting stuck in trees.\n-can't make your own vehicles.\n-No technic pieces or upside down/sideways pieces.(as of yet)\n-The driving. I don't know what kind of "method" of driving physics this is, but holding forward, no matter what, should make you go forwards. When you are panned so you are facing your minifigure and "go forward" you go in the direction you are facing, or in that case, backwards.\n-No first person.\n\nThere are so many more great things and gripes than I have mentioned, but these are the ones I have noticed while playing this game.

From exploring and unlocking new items/vehicles to building your very own structures. There is a great concept behind the game, and that has been clearly demostrated in the few hours I've played so far.\n\nBut, in my opinion, there is an issue... The game is dirrected towards children. 'What is so wrong with that?', you may be asking yourself. Well, not fully understanding the nessessary requirements to play the game, kids (and maybe parents) are purchasing LEGO Worlds. So, if the game doesn't 'work properly' (lags or crashes), they resort to blamming the game itself rather than thier computer. This gives the game a bad reputation when in reality the game is great.\n\nIts always risky to release a kids game on PC because everyone has different PC specs. What are the chances a 7, 8, or 9 yr old has a gaming computer? Its rare. The same goes for the kid's parents. In my opinion, a game such as this one should be release on Xbox One or Ps4 where the game is guarenteed to function properly. But, don't get me wrong... I'm still glad the game was released on PC.\n\n8/10 Legos.

I think I'm going to run out of pre-loaded content before too long, but the ability to make your own models through the LEGO Digital desiner will certainly add a lot of lifetime to the game!\n\nLots of people have claimed it is a "Minecraft killer," but it's definitely a very different experience at the time of this review. What surprised me was the "survival" gameplay has far less risk than Minecraft. Yes, you can die from enemy attacks or falling in lava, but you do not lose your items, just 2,000 studs, which is a very small amount. You also do not have to worry about food or fall damage. There is currently not resource management/crafting game like Minecraft, where you'dcollect blocks/ores and craft your materials and tools. You find item treasure chests chests in towers/igloos/treehouses.\n\nOnce you encounter characters (defeat hostile NPCs), decorations, or vehicles (ride animals or drive vehicles once to unlock the purchase option) that you find in the world you can purchase them (one time stud fee) for unlimited use/placement. This is very much like Minecraft's creative mode. You can use the pieces of lego characters\n\nFor example,  I found a helicopter, a plane, and a lot of tool items within the first two hours.\n\nThere are good terraforming tools, which will really come in handy for base building!\n\nCurrently this game is single-player only, but when they add they add multiplayer, I think it will really shine!\nAdding more content (more biomes/items/characters) will really give players a lot of replay value.\n\nPerformance-wise I had some issues using mouse/keyboard controls instead of a controller. There was also some lag as new biomes/chunks loaded.\n\nAs many have said, DLC content pricing/value will be very important for this game.\n\ntl;dr: This game is definitely reccomended to LEGO fans, especially those that enjoyed the Traveler's Tales LEGO movie games (Star Wars, Batman, Marvel: Superheroes). For those a bit more hesitant, wait for it to go on sale at $7.50 or $5, or wait for the multiplayer it's definitely worth it at that price.","June 4, 2015","true","3.0"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","19","19","3","0"

I found and understood every tools without external help and this is a very good sign. Thanks to the copy tool, I was able to build as fast if not faster than in real life. The landscape editing tools are excellent as well.\n\nIt also has the right attitude: vast. To have such a wide variety of biomes this early in the development is a good sign. A key selling point of such a game is the possibility to own an infinite number of bricks and I hope the list of bricks available for building will be exhaustive.\n\nThe explore-and-adventure side of things is drawing from other Lego games and is rudimentry at this point and yet already very rewarding.\n\nmultiplayer is coming\n\nAnother key selling point is the come-to-life aspect.

While my recommendation may or may not change, the content of the review certainly will after many updates pass.\n\nMy time in-game is dwarfed by my time watching live-streams here on Steam. That is why I believe I can review this.\n\nIs this worth fifteen bucks at this point in time. I think so - but you need to realize that it is in a very early state right now. There are loads of stuff that need to be added to even really make it much of a game.\n\nGood stuff so far:\n+Graphics are beautiful - although code is totally not optimized yet\n+Crafting proper has been changed in an awesome way. You now have to explore, and any builds you touch, you can now make. This is brilliant.\n+Controller support already\n+It feels like LEGO\n+The terrain is awesome. Even this early there are cool biomes and LEGO clouds.\n+Character customization is already really cool. Once again you unlock characters by finding them in the world.\n+Combat is actually pretty cool so far. It plays a bit funner than it looks. The bow and arrow is really well done.\n+Lots of wild life to ride\n\nStuff that needs to be implemented and/or changed:\n-Desperately need a first-person view, especially for in caves or dungeons\n-Graphics need to be optimized for lower end systems\n-Multiplayer desperately needs to be implemented\n-Map is not infinite - the devs said they walked two hours in one direction and didn't find the end (I have certainly walked much farther in Minecraft)\n-There is no 'storyline' right now, so be aware that you are basically playing a 'creative' version and not survival, right now\n-We all fear that DLC's and pay-to-win structure will rear its ugly head - this has not been discounted by the devs yet\n-As far as I know, you cannot swim underwater\n\nIs the game worth fifteen bucks right now?

Welcome to a land of combat and building. Welcome to a land of destruction and exploration. Welcome to Lego Worlds.\n\nFirst thing's first: This is an early access game. The game in no way is close to being the final game yet, and the content they have in it already is very fun. My eight year old self literally burst out at the seams when I saw this game, and I instantly had to buy it.\n\nNow, the game itself is fun, however it is not yet optimised for DirectX Version 11, but they're working on that (if I presume correctly.) The camera angles are mildly iffy and the controls, if not using an xbox controller become hard to master. However! If you have an Xbox Controller, that will make this game much, much more enjoyable.\n\nThe graphics in and of themselves are fantastic; They have the same plasticy feel as they do in real life, only less expensive; in this you don't have to buy sets and there's no stupid DLC as of now, which is a very high plus on my charts.\n\nAnd what's great, is they're not even done putting content into this game! It's seriously a great game, and whoever is reading this, this is a definite must-have.\n\n~DignifiedPeach","June 16, 2015","true","5.1"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","22","27","2","0"

Only a few LEGO games have impressed me. When I saw this, I thought that LEGO finally captured what LEGO was about in a game: building! This world is open as can be, and is very impressive for beta. IT IS ALSO KID FRIENDLY AND FUN! There are only a few things I would like added. Here are my recomendations:\n1) ADD MULTIPLAYER! This would add so much to the game, and with optional singleplayer, this game would be awesome. We also want to see PVP in multiplayer along with co-op exploring and building.\n2) Survival mode! This would add a lot because LEGO Worlds has no objective now, am I was dragging doing nothing just wondering around finding things. Yes, it is fun, but when I do that, I want something to do! Therefore, Survival mode would give a nonstop exprience of challenge and fun. Also, put this with multiplayer for up to 4 people survival, 8 people creative.\n3) Quests! I often find myself wondering how to explore next! Now, we should add quests so we can earn rewards, entertain ourselfs, maybe unlock some new gear, and even new places. Quests are an idea that provide limitless oppurtunities.\n4) Map and compass! We want to see a map and compass, so when we build the most epic house, and go exploring, we don't lose it! We want to have a map to tell where we are going, and even leave markers on places we liek for easy access.\n5) Endless worlds! We want to see a randomly generated world that never ends once you start that world! This gives us more replayablility and fun!\n6) Car cuztomizer! We don't want to drive around in the same boring cars! We want cars, with upgrades in performance, traction, and cuztomizing looks and sportiness with a car editor. For example, it could cost 10,000 dollars (in game) to make a custom car and 5,000 for each upgrade done to the car. This would make a lot more diverse community.\n7) Dedicated servers! We want servers the people run, so we could have a Skyblock (SkyLEGO) server, and cops and criminals. This could be an endless idea.\n8) Full character customizer! We want to cuztomize our minifig to the max, so he/she is unique in every way.\n9) A better camera! This camera is all over the place, so pease fix this.\n10) GUNS!! This would make the multiplayer experience better, and the LEGO Worlds experience better. We also want a good aiming system, perhaps one like GTA V. This would add a lot to the game. (LEGO Worlds could learn a lot from GTA Online)\n11) Electronics! We want to build advanced machines, so there shoudl be some sort of engineering involved.\n12) MANY MORE BLOCKS! We want doors, lamps, see through blocks and more. This could add a whole lot.\n13) Simplified mode. For anyone who does not want all these advanced features like electronics and guns, we could have a simple mode. There could also be a kids mode with no guns, and kids mode servers.\nThis is just touching on the possibilities with LEGO Worlds. Most highly recommended.\n","June 8, 2015","true","1.0"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","1"

Every time you touch a new item or destroy a baddie you add it to your collection. Movement is smooth, although the camera can be a little annoying at times, particularly in enclosed spaces.\n\nThe real test of this game for me was "Can I build the models from my childhood?". In short...no...but all things considered, especially as this is a pre-release, I wasn't far off. I decided to build the Soldiers' Fort from the Lego Pirates set and, except for some specialist pieces like cannons and jail cell doors (and oddly, rounded pieces which don't seem to be in the game yet), I was able to build a fairly close approximation. Not bad Lego, not bad!\n\nPros\n1. Good building options\n2. Fun game that would be good for all ages\n\nCons\n1. At this stage, there is a limited selection of bricks\n2. It feels very sandboxy at the moment, more of a building simulator than a survival game. Whilst this might be what they're going for, this might struggle to hold my interest,\n\nOverall, I'm impressed with this game so far and, considering it is an early release, it's got a lot of potential, but not quite there yet.

It looks the old generation meets the new one in a totally new type of game for the series.\n\nOnly two negative points : the camera (but I guess it's a common feature on LEGO videogames nowadays), and the control settings for XBOX controller when it comes to building. Hitting the "back" button almost every time we want to change a thing is quite annoying. Hope there's going to be a fix on this.\n\nI highly hope there will be addings such as Lego Technics and Lego City, and maybe interactions with physical sets to unlock exclusive content on the game.

There's probably a LOT of stuff to be added and its no-where near ready.\nSo, I came from past experiences with LEGO games (LEGO Universe will be missed.) I was unsure if this game had what it takes to be a good exploration game but after 2 hours I can't really lie, it's quite magnificent. I can't quite describe it, even if it's in early access, and I'm glad I spent £11.99 on it. So you have a wide transport range. Pigs, tractors, ancient looking cars, and my favourite vehicle, bi-planes! (And helicopters!)\nThere's an impressive world generation system. Please note that if you find something in a different world you can buy it with studs/spawn it whenever you please.\nNow to the big one. Building, something LEGO is, obviously known for.\nThe building system is pretty good, however if you ask me, I think there needs to be a few changes before it can reach it's potential. Now you've got terrain editing features. You can take chunks out of land, flatten land, make large circles/caves etc etc. You can also paint tiles, plates and bricks. If you want you can also choose from a ton of pre-brick-built things. So you can make a castle if you want. Or...\nYou can use the building system. Now the building system is actually really surprising. Your character starts to float and can then just phase through everything, and can fly essentially giving for better views on certain things. You can make houses, beds, sofas (which I messed up really badly on.) and it's all so interesting. But, I hope in future updates they add more additions such as being able to build your own car and since LEGO has so many bricks to choose from, MORE BRICKS. And light-up bricks too please.\nNow for the other side. What do I think is genuinely, bad, about this game? Well theres only a few things. Sometimes the camera will go CRAZY. I'll be walking up something and the camera just sinks into the ground. Also if you shift+tab to talk to friends and come back you can't right-click to move your camera around, although I think that was fixed. (Not sure on that but it hasnt happened since the first content update.)\nThe game also needs to be optimized. What optimization is, is.. well.. let's say people with beasts of gaming computers might experience quite large FPS drops. And that's about it, but then again, it's early access and I can assume that it'll be optimized very soon so cross that off the list.\nOverall for an early access game it's got so much potential, but this isn't even the tip of the ice-burg. This game has a lot of potential. As of now I rate it 8.5/10. If this game changes I'm sure I'll modify my review too. Have fun, and build to your heart's content!","June 20, 2015","true","6.6"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","16","18","4","2"

It's not a throttle and then you just have to steer with [left] or [right] but it is a recurring issue in all the Lego games.\nCombat is... well... a bit limited, you just throw some punches at some skeletons or other foes. It could be great to have weapons, I ain't asking for a whole armory but at least a gun and a sword for instance could be great. Or we could even add weapons related to the character we are using (sword for the king, gun fo the cowbow, shovel for... i don't know if there are undertakers in this game).\nThe map size is suitable, could be a bit wider for me but that's my point of view. One BIG issue is, we can't see the whole map. I ain't talking about the fog on undiscovered area. It could be nice to be able to open the map to see were we are. Nearly lost a house I built on a map. Had to go through some weird scrapyard with monkeys climbing on piles of wrecked cars.\nNow let's talk about building. That's the most awesome part of the game (yeah "everything is awesome"). We can litteraly do wathever we want with the ground, put some lava, grass, water and all that. Make it higher, deeper, flater... harder, better, faster, stronger. Terraforming is great. Building stuff is almost as good. Unlimited supply of bricks ! Only drawback there's a lot of missing bricks. For instance all character items (fishing rod, sword, shield...) are absent. There are no doors... Well let's just say there are bricks but onlys the simplest ones. Now the only thing they could add would be a vehicle builder or something like this, I really want to build my own car.\nThis game has a lot of potential and I'm sure it will be great once released !","September 15, 2015","true","54.9"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","19","24","2","1"

But i bought it, and i have to say its the best game ive played in a long time. Ive played a lot of minecraft, but since buying this i have never looked back, this is brilliant! minecraft is just a bunch of squares! My pc is a piece of junk, i dont even have a seperate video card, but this plays fine for me so it should work well on most peoples pc's. As for the camera problem, the driving and building can take a while to get used to, and is sometimes annoying at first, but after a while of play it is very easy to play and build whatever you want, there are a load of pre made stuff you can spawn in aswell, but that was the only thing negative. Some people said it lacks a story, which is fair enough, but i think its almost possible to create your own stories in it that it is unecessary. Its sure worth getting, espacially if you love lego and lego games, or just building stuff in general, and also if u like adventure sandbox like minecraft. The only way to improve in my opinion is to keep adding new content, like themed lego, such as star wars, that would be great!  10/10 would buy again lol even though i already have it! but if u get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with the controls just keep playing and it'll catch on!!!\nps the small propellor plane is vtol lol","June 6, 2015","true","181.7"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Daveyploo/recommended/332310/","Daveyploo","Daveyploo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Daveyploo/","284 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirst off I want to say I know this is early access, and hopefully some of these things will be addressed in time. That said, let's get the bad stuff out of the way first;\n\nNo control/camera options!\n\nI *think* this might be because this will be ported to consoles eventually. I say that because the messages "Press any button/key" and the option of turning on or off "Vibration". Now sure some people play PC games with gamepads, and that's great, but I hope this PC version of LEGO Worlds will get some options for how we play. An irritation so far for me is that the right mouse button is for looking as well as pointing (ie movement). So if you want to go straight but swing the camera to the right to look at something, you have to correct your movement by strafing or something similar. Another annoyance is how low the camera is to the ground, so you're looking at the horizon all the time rather than your immediate surroundings.\n\nIntricate building with individual bricks is a bit clunky!\n\nAgain this may be because of the possible console like control scheme, but trying to build something is a bit more tedious than it should be. The interface for the brick selection and color selection aren't designed very well (scroll the mouse wheel to go through them, but that also zooms in your view, grr!). I prefer the dedicated building programs that exist more than this, even the Google Chrome LEGO builder. The low framerate doesn't help matters either, and I don't have all of the bells and whistles on maximum.\n\nNo way to affect the world without going in to build mode!\n\nI really wish a had a shovel or something that just dug where I was standing. Or maybe even dig with my hands, or *something* rather than nothing at all. To alter the landscape you have to go in to one of the build modes, and either remove bricks one at a time via clicking, or delete huge chunks at a time in a somewhat clunky interface (that interface again!).\n\nThis is *not* like Minecraft!\n\nI mentioned MC again because, if you're like me, you might have been hoping that this was a LEGO version of Minecraft. It isn't, so get that out of your head right now. What's more like is an open world, no story mode TT game. You explore and if you run in to a NPC you haven't collected yet, you unlock them for purchase. Ditto for vehicles, little models (ie plants, various decorative objects, etc.). You get studs for destroying stuff, and use those studs to permanently buy one of the things you've unlocked. You also get studs for interacting with one of the supplied builds (a lovely little home with a pool and BBQ). These studs come pretty freely, so I never felt low on 'money', however all this paints a somewhat different picture than what Minecraft does; there's a lot more video game here than just building.\n\nNow on to the good stuff shall we?\n\nGenuine fun!\n\nI actually enjoyed exploring the different landscapes, even if they were somewhat barren for now. I had a rush of glee when I found a NPC I hadn't encountered yet and quickly harvested their sweet parts for myself. I enjoyed riding the dragon and blowing up craters in the mountains. I enjoyed mowing the lawn (aforementioned pre built house object), and giggled when I saw what it did. I liked finding the big chests that yielded me a hand held item (though the gun mechanic of shooting is a little odd for now). Basically there is fun to be had here, and it should only get better.\n\nBeautiful views!\n\nBoth the theme areas as well as the character models themselves look wonderful. Luckily we have ambient occlusion already for us (no need to fake it for nice screenshots like MC!) as well as gorgeous lighting effects. Everything looks amazing and really sucks you in to the world.\n\nOk now on to the stuff that isn't even in the game and my personal opinion/hopes on what happens, you can skip this bit if you want.\n\nMultiplayer?\n\nUnfortunately it doesn't *seem* like this will be like MC again. There won't be any 64 players joined here, I'd be very surprised. There isn't even (unless I'm blind and/or not smart enough) chatting of any kind yet, but as I said I could be wrong. The game certainly didn't prompt me to say hello or anything like that, and I couldn't check the control scheme. There was an option to 'search for worlds', though I didn't look in to it. I fear it might just be something similar to Little Big Planet, where players upload their world to the server and let other people play *in* it, rather than *with* other people. And since multiplayer was technically at the bottom of the list of 'features to add', I'm worried it'll just be basically co-op. Certainly not the social juggernaut that MC had become even in beta, LEGO Worlds multiplayer seems like a footnote rather than core feature of the game.\n\nI guess that's actually the only bit I'm not certain about. I hope we can get some good multiplayer, but we'll see!","June 1, 2015","true","5.4"," 24 of 34 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","24","34","3","4"

Why not? Right? I mean, seriously. It is LEGO. Now, keep in mind: The game is Early Access, which means that it is far from finished. With that said, Some things I am looking forward to in the updates:\n\n(UPDATED: 9/8/2015\n-Better Menu layout. Seriously. I had to hunt for 5 minutes just to figure out how to exit the game (And Alt+F4 seems to set to false in the code, preventing that nice little Windows trick from working). Nothing is labeled, You are just expected to figure things out via trial and error, apparently.\n\nSeriously. This whole needing to go back to the main menu to exit the game is obnoxious, as I have to do it even in windowed mode. For being the game that many say will put Minecraft in its place, it seems to be trying too hard to live up to that expectation.\n\nSo, to Warner and Traveler's Tales: Make this game your own. Don't just assume we want a minecraft clone. I re-installed this game to see what the updates brought, and I am glad that AMD is now supported archetecture.

Comparsions to Minecraft are inevitable, but this is really a different sort of game.  There's no survival, and combat is very low-stakes.  This is partially an exploration game, but first and formost it is a building game.  Building controls are...finicky at times.  It can be hard to line up the Legos how you want them.  But the selection of bricks means that, with patience, you are pretty much only limited by your imagination.

The game with the updates couldn't get me interested. It's actually the same as in June 2015. Maybe less buggy, but still a bad building UI, and not really exiting to explore worlds. It might be nice the first few minutes, but the game gets boring really quickly without any clear goals. Yeah yeah yeah, it's early access, but I still see no improvements in GAMEPLAY sinds june.\n\nReading the news from the developper, they will improve the building UI. Well, looking forward to it. It would be a nice game if building your own creations would be a lot easier and more intuitive, just like real lego. if they can't be minecraft, at least be Lego.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------ earlier review below--------------------------\n\nRE-REVIEW\n\nLet's keep this one short:\n\nPros:\n- it's Lego!\n- many different types auto generated worlds to explore\n- lots of preset buildings, plants, weapons, vehicles, characters and props to encounter and make it yours to play with.\n- it's fun to freefall, hit, fly, ride, drive, shoot, bomb around\n- i walked on the clouds, kept throwing dynamite down below, created an enormous hole that reached to the middle of the earth, skydived right into it.\n- "summoning" an aircraft / vehicle lets you fly or drive right away, feels good.\n- you can use the current building system to build structures with many different available Lego parts\n\n\nCons\n- no clear goal in this game, current game is really sandbox like. Not sure what the developers wanted this game to be.\n- discovering new vehicles is fun, but the fun wears out quickly\n- discovering new plants and props is not much fun.\n- discovered the diver character, went to the sea, he could NOT dive...\n- water doesn't act like water, it doesn't flow where it should. I digged a long and deep tunnel with dynamite. And connected it to the sea... nothing happened. I could bomb a hole in the water with a dynamite. Felt like I was Moses splitting the sea in half... not much happened after that... bored.\n- sometimes the camera angle + mouse + keyboard combination doesn't feel comfortable. Prefer a fixed 3rd person view and a special button to let you look around freely.\n- The current building system is for the patient ones only . It's annoying and not easy to use.\n- no option to build your own vehicles or adjust current vehicles\n- Lego building physics does not relate to real Lego building\n\n\nAt this moment I still won't recommend this game for someone who wants to buy a game and spend some real quality time with. But if you like discovering vehicles/aircrafts/animals to drive/fly/ride with, hitting/shooting/bombing things with no purpose and have all things prebuild for you and you just want to rearange the prebuild stuff neatly in your own way, then buy it!\nFor the ones who loves building with Lego, buy real lego.\n\n\n\n------------------------------ earlier review below--------------------------\n\n\n\nNOTE: played 1.6hours of this game, but played over 9999hours of real life LEGO.\n\nWhile being a fan of lego and minecraft, I always wondered when Lego would step in. So I was excited to buy and try this game when it came out as a beta version. Unfortunately, it's not what I had in mind.\n\nI loved playing with real lego, where I can create my own cars, planes, crazy structures, mechanics (technic lego), and I could find my younger self creating my own stories in the lego world. It's nice to have an out of the box lego toy. But it's even nicer to try and experiment, building crazy stuff by combining different sets. To make it your own. This I find lacking in this game. Preset structures, preset vehicles, it;s nice to have them, but it won't give you the kick of buidling something of your own.\n\nComparing to minecraft, minecraft gives you the feeling of achievement. Digging stuff, building stuff. Simple UI but very effective. This I find lacking in this current beta version of Lego Worlds.\nIn Lego Worlds, you can build your own structures brick by brick, but the user interface is not user friendly. While in minecraft you just walk to the position where you want to place a brick and click. In Lego Worlds, I find it too complicated. I had prefered them to use "Duplo bricks" for better orientation during building.\n\nAt this current stage, I think this game is fun for teenagers or younger kids.\nI really hope this game will improve a lot and make me experience my childhood again.\n\n- Common guys, ALT+F4 = exit game...\n- Don't let me chase coins lying around, let the coins chase me.\n- Please improve building interface. I don't mind taking time to build my structure, but the building experience must be simple and effective. The current way of building is just too annoying.\n- add some technic lego, electrical motor, let us build mechanical structures, moving interacting parts\n- let players build custom cars, planes, etc... make it work\n- let player save their custom made objects/buildings, and use the autogun to reproduce saved stuff quickly.\n- Earning coins by smashing stuff, not really rewarding. Let players share their structures/buildings/vehicles online. Let others vote. The more likes, the more coins you get for other usage in the game. Let creativity be rewarded. Coins used to upgrade your available building blocks.\n- Let player earn skills, from Lego Noob to Lego Master\n- Let players play different games inside different worlds with different rules settings. Counterstrike Lego, Lego The Sims, Lego Themepark, Lego Mario Kart... etc... That's the power of Lego, mimicking other worlds with it's own touch.\n- Please stick to the real world rules while building with Lego blocks. Keep true to Lego. Block on block can only stick when you put it the right way. In Lego Worlds, blocks sticks like they are made of glue.\n- Primarily, please make the core game more interesting. Focus on the inner beauty, copy minecraft for Gods sake! I don't care about skins of different characters yet, the core game must be correct. I wanna build, dig, destroy and save my efforts. Skins and stuff are secondary.\n\nAt this moment, not recommended unless you like fooling around.","June 22, 2015","false","6.7"," 334 of 601 people (56%) found this review helpful 41 people found this review funny","56","334","601","41","41"

When I first heard of this game I was extremely excited, a Lego Sandbox game! I've been waiting for this game for years. But when I started to play the game, it wasen't that good. It was buggy, and laggy, with terrible camera controls, but it has come a long way since then. Here is my Pros and Cons list for version 5:\n\n\nPros:\n-LEGO Sandbox\n-Great, Vast Terrains\n-Beautiful Graphics\n-Only $15\n-My jaw dropped open when I want under water.\n-New backpack menu, no more confusing wheel!\n\n\nCons:\n-Terrible Camera Controls: These are still some of the worst controls I have used in a sandbox. You mainly control the camera with your maoue to turn your character, but if you are walking past any tallish objects, like trees or if you are on a side of a cliff, you still cannot turn the camera so you can't turn in one direction! Please make the camera zoom in when moving, like when you are standing still.\n-Terrible Building Controls: Honestly, they need to import the building from Lego Digital Designer. Building is so hard and confusing. In order to place a brick it needs to be in line of sight of your floating character, which is one of the worst elements in game design I've seen in a while. If you are not in line of sight of brick you want to work on, the bricks go invisible, so it is hard to get up close to add detail. Sure, your guy looks cool floating up in the air, but at least give us a way to get into first person, that would make this game so much better.\n-No Objective: Sure, this is an open sandbox game, but could you add more stuff to do after the camera controls are better? Maybe more of a survival mode? Please? Thank you.\n-Performance: This one has not been on my list, but it has always been a problem. It's not really getting any better, especially for older hardware. Sure, its old hardware, but this game appeals to kids who probably have lower end machines that match the performance of older mid to high end PCs. Please, get this to run better!\n\n\nMy conclusion still stands, the game is gorgeous, has a lot of interesting terrain and its LEGO, but the camera and building controls hurt it so badly that I cannot recommend at this time. Once the camera controls become better, I will recommend this game. Buy it for the price and potential, wait until it gets better. Oh, and add LEGO Technic stuff, please? It would be awesome to build a car or cool contraptions.","October 23, 2015","false","2.9"," 57 of 98 people (58%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","58","57","98","6","19"

Instead of having a narrative, it's totally open-world. Though there are a few objectives you can complete, the player is free to roam as they please. I think this really hits on something Lego hasn't really had in its repitoire since it shut down Lego Universe a few years ago. It's an important counterpoint to the more linear games that Lego has made through the years; those have their place, but they're only one part of the Lego experience. Roaming around and experimenting are a key part of Lego-ing, and Worlds gives the player the tools to do it.\n\nIt's still in development, but from the looks of it the devs are truly committed to making this a good game. I would say this is a good buy outside of a sale. Of all of the games I've seen in Early Access recently this one is a safe bet.","January 11","true","0.9"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","12","15","2","0"

I got in and the first thing i got was an plane and that may be a little OP but i was quite happy... until i started driving it, first off the camera is WAY too close to the plane, and that made it hard to see things around the plane. secon the controls was wierd, not a lot of physics in play, its just up and down and stering around, no gliding or forces in play. I jumped out of the plane and started breaking things to get money and diffrent items. and of course i got some pets.\n\nAfter i got some items i decided to start flying around to look after intresting stuff (i dont really care about the colectables). i found some cool stuff but not a lot. i flew off the island i was on and then i found a big no no. A LOT OF WATER, i flew for about 5 minutes before i found another island and that was generally very boring. and i found out during the flight that if you start scrolling in the menu you have a clothes changer, when i scrolled into this IT MADE ME JUMP OUT OF THE PLANE. and i lost the plane in the water, and there i found out that you can go under water... but the camera dosent follow soo the only thing i could do was to swim to the nearest island and buy another plane.\n\nBut enough rambling about. Do i recomend the game? Maybe as a concept, but as a game, not really. It needs fixing, yes its early acsess but that doesnt give it permission to be this bad. I will play it later on but firstly it needs some updates and some fixes. They need to fix the camera and the controlls.\n\nI recomend this game because its a cool consept and its on good way to become a game but right now its only a sandbox.","June 1, 2015","true","1.9"," 22 of 35 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","22","35","0","0"

It encourages you to find more people because the more people you find, the more parts you can make your character with.\n\n-It's a really great looking game! The lighting effects are very good, and I like the little touches on the slopes to make them look like they do in real life.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n-The system for brick-by-brick building isn't that improved from before. It's still very slow, and the camera is a bit iffy. Still hoping for a built-in LDD sort of thing like the old Lego Creator games did. I know you CAN import stuff from LDD, but it's not the most convient thing to switch from the game to that program.\n\n-I should have touched on this aspect in my original review, but the menu really should be changed so I don't have to keep scrolling though a bunch of things. This problem becomes a pain when you have a ton of props or minifigure parts.\n\n-I wish there were more ways to find the items NPCs want other than just chests, especially for thing like an apple or a bone.\n\nOVERALL: Searching the world for stuff is more enjoyable other than the one nitpick I mentioned before, but the current in-game building system is holding this back for me to fully enjoy it.","August 18, 2015","true","8.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The worlds consist only of lego bricks - you can delete just about every brick and place most "simple" bricks (e.g. 2x4 bricks) in any colour you want, but no specialist bricks (e.g. flags) can be placed. Hopefully the ability to place these specialist bricks will come out in the near future\n\nAs you play your Lego World, there are different objects, such as plants and cauldrons, that you unlock by paying in studs you can earn from destroying these objects, allowing them to be placed. Furthermore, there are npcs that you can unlock to play as, as well as using their clothes to create a custom character. There are also animals and vehicles that you can ride, which also must be unlocked\n\nThe camera is quite good when walking or riding around, but when building, it is not very precise, and difficult to line objects up. i have also encountered a glitch where shift+tabbing out stops me from moving the camera angle.\n\nBuilding in the game could possibly be a bit better, perhaps more akin to the controls of lego digital designer, and as mentioned before, the camera prevents accurate block placement in many instances\n\nCurrently the game has no set objectives and also has little in the way of models and items. However, the current items and models are very detailed and useful, and I am sure that there will be hundreds of more exciting models that will be able to be placed\n\nUltimitely, the game has an array of exciting features and unique worlds, and is priced exceptionally well. Although some of the controls are a bit finicky, I am sure as the game develops further controls will be streamlined\n\nThis game is definitely a good buy if you are interested in the world building genre, and obviously if you like Lego\n\nPros\n-Exciting and unique worlds\n-Great prebuilt models\n-Npcs that you can dress as\n-Vehicles and animals are fun\n-Movement controls are excellent\n\nCons\n-Camera can be a bit dodgy\n-Building is not always precise\n-Lacks a large amount of models and objects (but being early access there will be more added, so this point will be pointless in the near future)","June 5, 2015","true","13.8"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

My highlights have been riding a dragon, landing on a cloud and finding a massive drilling car and driving off the cloud, all to drill down as far as I desired. The exploration is mental, just collect the studs and meet pirates, ninjas, warlocks, scientists etc etc! Then you can spend your studs to get their clothes and you can roleplay as a pirate, killing everything in sight or sneaking around at night like a ninja. I have yet to find anything hugely wrong with the game, it runs great, looks great and is a different experiance everytime you play.

I still can't do anything with the current building controls (I've seen people build amazing stuff, but they don't feel as tight and controllable as I think they should), which is a pity, because building is the core of the game along with exploration, but the exploration feels so good and the worlds are so charmingly built entirely out of LEGO pieces (my biggest gripe with other LEGO games) that just wandering around is enough for me to heartily recommend this game.

My computer definitely surpasses the minimum system requirements and probably is around if not past the recommended requirements. Yet, I still get a bit of lag.

There is a lot of potential in this game if there is continous imporvement. 3 things catch my atention: 1) there is no control settings; 2) after the 1st few character and vehicle discover, the cut scene becomes tiresome; 3) camera settings. The game, unfortunately, is limited to just one camera setting to move your character around, which makes harder to see inside the buildings. Same thing occurs while building block-by-block. They  should use the same concept of the old LEGO Creator camera.\nDisconsidering these observations, the game is very fun.\n\nPortuguese (BR):\nO jogo é bom e a jogabilidade bem simples.

It is like having every single piece of Lego ever created right in the palm of your hand.  You are always mere clicks away from building castles, cottages and Wild West Saloons, as well as having the ability to build something one single Lego brick at a time - Which will take a lot of time and dedication.\n\nIn the beginning you will be able to randomly generate a world that you would like to play in.  My world had a small forest that was home to cavemen and cavewomen, a desert biome that housed warlocks and vampires and one corner of the world was dark, it looked evil and was spewing lava. Once you have generated your own personal world, you will be able to skydive in, Just Cause style and just play with Lego.\n\nI was running around and constantly finding new and exciting things.  I came across horses, sheep, dogs, vampires, cavemen and women, skeletons, cars, bulldozers, boats, a swimming pool, snowmen, etc.  From the short time I have spent in the game, there is a lot here already for a Early Access title.\n\nThe world renders every single individual lego brick.  That means, if you use the tools that the game gives you to edit the terrain as you see fit, you will find more lego bricks.  Take away a huge chunk of the world?  You will still find every single individual lego brick has been rendered underneath.  Unfortunately, this may be wear I began to have my only performance issue - I have experienced some pretty bad framerate issues, even when trying to mess around with the settings and lower quality (My PC should be able to handle this game at the highest anyway).  However, I give LEGO Worlds the benefit of the doubt as it has just released and is still in Early Access.\n\nOne other weird issue: Pressing 'S' when In a vehicle does not put the vehicle in to reverse, the vehicle instead just goes in a circle until it is facing the opposite direction that it was before.  I suggest this is changed to the 'S' key reversing a vehicle. EDIT: THIS SEEMS TO ONLY BE WITH THE BULLDOZER VEHICLE.\n\nNice audio with soothing music and fluid game animations are present.  You can really tell that LEGO Worlds has high production values and that TT and Warner Brothers are really backing this title.\n\nI believe that if this game gets the love and attention that it deserves, it could truly be a fantastic game.  With updates, patches and more content this could be great.  The game is fun right now with a lot to do, but more content in this type of game never goes to waste.\n\nI would also love to see some sort of survival mode - For example, like Minecraft.  Something where the player has to collect materials and resources to build shelter, mining tools, etc.  As well as harvesting food or something like that.  I believe that a survival mode along with this current creative, free roam mode that is in the game just now, would be incredible.\n\nIf you enjoy sandbox games like Minecraft and of course Lego and also like to be creative and build your own world with it's own buildings and communities - You may have a great time with LEGO Worlds.","June 1, 2015","true","2.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

The game is extremely fun and the developers have added minor tweaks and differences to how the game works since I last played it. I find myself hooked in just exploring the worlds and collecting new characters and items. I often find myself roleplaying a werewolf character during the night and a human during the day when he turns back. The game is basically super fun for people no matter how old they are and I would certainly recommend if you enjoy open world sandboxes and lego.\nNonetheless this is a very cautious review because of the amount of things which are still glaringly wrong with it. Last time I commented that the camera angles of the games worked terribly with a controller and it had multithreading CPU issues, happily these things seem to have been ameded. The framerate is a little dodgy however and I won't tell you my specs but let's just say I'm running the best of the best at the moment so the issue certainly isn't hardware. I'm not a massive framerate snob but I think anything lower than 60 can be a little jarring for people who get simulation sickness. One more huge caveat emptor is that splitscreen multiplayer is glaringly broken. When I played this yesterday with my girlfriend I found the framerate to be poorer than usual and whenever either of us got into a vehicle it dipped to 10-15fps which is unplayable even by those who don't notice framerate dips as I do.\nI'll be keeping a close eye on this game because the devs seem to listen to the community in regards to controller support and performance issues, but I think this game has a bright future.","April 15","true","8.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

No, it is not a Minecraft killer as the two games are conceptually different and comparing them would end up being skewed in one direction or another.  I think instead of comparing it to existing sandbox voxel-esque games, people should realize that this is much, much more than a lego Minecraft.

Imagine this all with multiplayer and it would be great fun.\n\nMy friend would say that this game suffers from "Consolitis" the controlls are absolutely horrific for a real PC gamer.\nIt's inviting you strongly to play with a controller.. eeew! even that word. This could ruin the whole experience, it needs a first person view to make it stand out, it feels like the other LEGO games that are aimed for consoles that my kids play.. clunky.\n\nIf they will create an option to change the view/controls this will be a definite winner and last long, maybe it could measure itself with Minecraft at some point. If not it will slowly fade away as just another LEGO game.\n\nIt stands out very well as being LEGO and not just like LEGO Minecraft, it keeps it's own distinguished charms (no.. the abysmal controls and 3rd person view are not part of that) The game is too cheap, please take my money to better the game.. the price needs to double at least. I can't wait to see how this game will grow and evolve.\n\nI so hope that the minecraft view/controlls will be followed, unless we PC gamers are just a guinea pig start for the consoles out there..\n\nEither way I will most likely buy it for my kids, it would be fun to play it with them.

I may have voted it down but I want to say first before you make a judgement on that, that the game has an extreme amount of potential.\n\nAs it stands the game life (without building things) is around one hour of time, in which you will get bored. Now the devs are adding more content on the 3rd of July (even though they said "end of the month" apparently the start of the next month is the same thing to them) with some underground caves. This should add, maybe another hours worth of entertainment.\n\nUnfortunately the Devs, while getting a content update out without about a month of release are focusing on the wrong things.\n\nThe main feature of a game like Lego Worlds is that you get to build anything out of Lego! That sounds awesome right? Well, since the devs didn't feel the need to include all the blocks at release it makes building things nearly pointless. Why spend hundreds of hours building things out of blocks when more blocks will come in the future and ruin all your previous builds because by any new standard they will look sub-par?\n\nNot even the basics of windows and doors were included. Imagine building nice house with an open door but when the door is released (if they even do) you find out it will screw up your entire design?\n\nAs much as I want to dive in and build something epic I know that when new blocks are added that I will want to rebuild whatever I built with something better.\n\nThere's also been no exact details made by the devs about what they are going to do and when they are going to do it. Why buy a game this early with NO clue what the game will end up being like? It makes no logical sense.\n\nHere's the negatives that I can think of so far.\n\n1. No basic blocks like windows and doors.\n2. No advanced blocks, virtually no bits for decoration except premade props.\n3. A money system (studs) that's very easily abused making it completely pointless\n4. Night cycle is bad, it's not dark.\n5. There's no real lighting. Objects that light up put off no light. This makes potential for night time activities pointless. Why have night cycles at all if you don't have propper lighting?\n6. Physics don't effect vehicles. You're going down a hill full speed and going up it full speed, no difference.\n7. No multiplayer. Promissed at the release of the full game (whenever that is) and without ANY details of what it will entail.\n\nEssentially the only thing to do is build things, which would be worth it if it had all the blocks from the start, but not having them makes this game pointless.\n\nThere are plenty of neat things with the game and it SCREAMS of potential, it could be light years better than MineCraft but without the Devs telling us their vision of what this game will be I say DO NOT BUY IT.\n\nSeriously Devs, how about you let us in on your vision of this game? Or don't you have any?","June 29, 2015","false","17.0"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","14","24","0","0"

Now, Traveler's Tales has taken back their crown, and given us a lego version of the digital lego playset that Minecraft built.  It's something the world has been wanting for years, but never knew was coming.\n\nNow that the summary is done...  Holy ♥♥♥♥,  What a knockout.  On the surface, TT has given us a mostly barren world, and some tools to explore and build in it.  But this game has some fantastic nuances that honestly put it ahead of the Early Access crowd.\n\nPROS:\n-The game already has a crap load of unlockables. Weapons, characters, vehicles, items...

The graphics are delightful with fun lighting, motion blur, and shadows.  It was fun to attack everything, ride everything, drill holes, explore new biomes, and build a few kits.  Then what?  It's sandbox, but it seems pretty limited for $15 of early access.  I did not yet try to build my own things out of stock parts so I have no info there.  Some things I'd like to see is a path to acquire more kits (which I assume is in the works) and a world map.  Getting lost sucks.  If you are indestructable to falling and drowning, then a persistant world map with waypoints is not a huge suspension of disbelief.  The driving controls could be simplified for keyboard and mouse.  There were times when 'W' and 'S' both made me go backwards.

For where the game is at right now, you can do quite a bit. Only limitation is your own creativity/desire to explore.\n\nThe Good\n* Great variety of biomes - way more than your standard forest, desert, lava, jungle, etc.\n* Lots of props to discover - pretty much anything that decorates the current biome you're in is something to acquire which later goes into your build menu. You later can unlock them for a nominal amount of studs and then they're yours to place in the world how you please. You unlock minifig models for yourself to use as a skin the same way, as well as mounts, creatures, and vehicles.\n* You start of with over 50 ready-made trees, random structures, and buildings for you to place. Hoping you can discover structures in the wild the same way so you can with other items.\n* Fun items and vanity(?) pieces - remember all the tiny accessories your minifigs came with when you were a kid? You can discover these in random treasure chests all throughout the world. Spyglasses, rifles, swords, etc. Some you can use as weapons or to cull giant holes into the earth, some don't appear to have a use other than for cosmetic purposes (but I'm not 100% if maybe all their capabilities aren't in the game yet).\n* When it comes to building your own things, it's pretty straightforward, and there's so much variety. Lots of pieces, TONS of colors, and the ability to undo/redo is a great feature too. The menu is a little bit clunky in its current state, but I think it'll be improved upon in later iterations of the game.\n* You have the ability to fight and beat up guys (so many screaming skeletons, good lord) and tame (as far as I can tell only one for now) creatures to ride.\n\nThe Not-So-Good\n* Camera controls are the least reliable thing so far. Right-clicking to spin the camera around sometimes doesn't work and you rotate in some crazy directions. This also translates to riding in vehicles/on creatures. You'll press W to go forward, move your camera and it'll go backwards. I would love an option for the directions to be fixed. My other gripe is the lack of distance when you zoom out during build modes. This ability (camera zoom in/out) doesn't exist at all when you're running around with your character.\n* I don't think you can swim underwater? (yet?) Maybe I'm dense, but I couldn't figure this one out haha\n* Not enough free-standing structures. I would love to see more buildings in the wild. Tiny villages with more people. Possibly NPCs/Merchants would be really neat. I know this game's early access, but this is something that'd be fun to have.\n\n* Some features I wish for the future - multiplayer is a given, and I'm sure that's coming. Weather effects, graphical settings for higher end computers (bloom, DoF, lighting, etc.), and hopefully Steam Workshop.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThis game feels like it has a lot of potential. With a few quality of life adjustments to the camera and basic controls, it'll add a lot more polish. Looking forward to later builds of LEGO Worlds. Definitely recommended.","June 1, 2015","true","2.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Which also leads to humourous discoveries). This game presents, in its very early state (the day this review was written, it hasn't even been available for a week) a lot of content:\n\n•There are over 25 different playable minifgures; a lot of them have special abilities and you can even customize your own minifigure (though I am disappointed that you cannot use pieces of some of the figures, such as the Yeti. I hope this is changed in the future)\n\n•There are over 10 different biomes in the game, with some of them being unconventional landscapes that you probably would not find anywhere else besides LEGO Worlds.\n\n•There are many different vehicles -- with many of them having special abilities, such as the drill machine, the digger, and the steamroller. Of the vehicles, there are three different classes (thus far): air, ground, and water.\n\n•The explorable world of LEGO Worlds' randomly generated landscapes is fully destructible. You can also use a large variety of Lego bricks (with also a large variety of colours) to build what you wish.\n\n•LEGO Worlds allows you to climb up any vertical surface, as well as hang off and climb ceilings and the bottoms of suspended masses. I was very impressed and glad when I first found this out, because most of the open world games I have played -- this just isn't there.\n\nThose are just some of the positives that this amazing game already has as content. There are a few negatives, though:\n\n•The game sometimes lags and/or jitters.\n\n•The camera is sometimes fidgety and gesticulates a lot.\n\n•The camera seems to have problems when you go into small spaces/interiors.\n\n•I sometimes become motion sick or develop a headache from playing (despite turning off motion blur, et cetera; this is more of my personal pet peeve, because my brain and eyes are rather sensitive to movement).\n\nOverall, this game is simply amazing and to see the amount of content it has as of now is astonishing and a good omen on the game's status in the distant future.

For where the game is at right now, you can do quite a bit. Only limitation is your own creativity/desire to explore.\n\nThe Good\n* Great variety of biomes - way more than your standard forest, desert, lava, jungle, etc.\n* Lots of props to discover - pretty much anything that decorates the current biome you're in is something to acquire which later goes into your build menu. You later can unlock them for a nominal amount of studs and then they're yours to place in the world how you please. You unlock minifig models for yourself to use as a skin the same way, as well as mounts, creatures, and vehicles.\n* You start of with over 50 ready-made trees, random structures, and buildings for you to place. Hoping you can discover structures in the wild the same way so you can with other items.\n* Fun items and vanity(?) pieces - remember all the tiny accessories your minifigs came with when you were a kid? You can discover these in random treasure chests all throughout the world. Spyglasses, rifles, swords, etc. Some you can use as weapons or to cull giant holes into the earth, some don't appear to have a use other than for cosmetic purposes (but I'm not 100% if maybe all their capabilities aren't in the game yet).\n* When it comes to building your own things, it's pretty straightforward, and there's so much variety. Lots of pieces, TONS of colors, and the ability to undo/redo is a great feature too. The menu is a little bit clunky in its current state, but I think it'll be improved upon in later iterations of the game.\n* You have the ability to fight and beat up guys (so many screaming skeletons, good lord) and tame (as far as I can tell only one for now) creatures to ride.\n\nThe Not-So-Good\n* Camera controls are the least reliable thing so far. Right-clicking to spin the camera around sometimes doesn't work and you rotate in some crazy directions. This also translates to riding in vehicles/on creatures. You'll press W to go forward, move your camera and it'll go backwards. I would love an option for the directions to be fixed. My other gripe is the lack of distance when you zoom out during build modes. This ability (camera zoom in/out) doesn't exist at all when you're running around with your character.\n* I don't think you can swim underwater? (yet?) Maybe I'm dense, but I couldn't figure this one out haha\n* Not enough free-standing structures. I would love to see more buildings in the wild. Tiny villages with more people. Possibly NPCs/Merchants would be really neat. I know this game's early access, but this is something that'd be fun to have.\n\n* Some features I wish for the future - multiplayer is a given, and I'm sure that's coming. Weather effects, graphical settings for higher end computers (bloom, DoF, lighting, etc.), and hopefully Steam Workshop.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThis game feels like it has a lot of potential. With a few quality of life adjustments to the camera and basic controls, it'll add a lot more polish. Looking forward to later builds of LEGO Worlds. Definitely recommended.","June 1, 2015","true","2.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nooknc/recommended/332310/","nooknc","Nook","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nooknc/","221 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nLego Worlds is a fantastic adventure game and a decent building game. THAT SAID the game is 2 days old, in early access, but is still more functional, fun, and mechanically sound than 90% of other Early Access titles I've played. Lego Worlds keeps it's own ideas from previous Lego themed games such as collecting studs as currency, but also takes inspiration from Minecraft and Landmark.\nThe exploration and adventure is a lot of fun - roaming mountains, fighting wizards and dragons, finding Drill Machines and going straight through that mountain, under the ocean, and dig up to find yourself on a snowy island full of cute huskie puppies, polar bears, and snowmen. Not to mention that you can interact with just about anything you see. Along your adventures you can find giant chests which is incredibly exciting and just makes me excited to explore.\nNow for the building aspect of the game. Being a Lego game, remember that these started out as physical building blocks you bought in a box and dumped out on the floor then find the missing piece like a landmine hours later, it seems like the building mechanics and contraptions should have been some of the most refined parts of the game, but unfortunately this is where the game got frustrating for me.\nLaying brick by brick, easy - fun to do - little issues. Building pre-made stuff - pretty awesome! Look at my suddenly Old West town in the swamp lands! But when it comes down to making your own mansion like you dreamed of having digging through you Legos as a child - you might as well pull out your old Legos. Getting these parts of the game to cooperate are frustrating as a competent adult that has played Minecraft and Landmark for several several days worth of game time. I can't imagine how a child would fair in these conditions. Again, the pre-made stuff is great and is an adventure all it's own plopping down a cottage next to your obsidian volcanic structure. But right now the Undo is completely broken and when you make a mistake - you better know how to bend your hammer at a 90 degree angle to bang that back into shape or just select it all, delete and start from scratch.\nThe Select Tool itself was amazing at first. I'm so glad to see it implemented because it's a genius tool that Landmark made work incredibly well. But it got stale and frustrating and deflated as a clown's party tricks for 3 year olds  in an outdoor party in the Artic. Copy and paste? Forget it. The pasting is based off of where your cursor is and not where the objects would interact with each other once pasted. I was building a set of stairs in my mansion and wanted to have a classic big stairway that splits in two toward the second level and so I thinks to myself "Self, I'll just copy that side and paste it here." Nope. You can't mirror, only rotate, and when I pasted the bricks were either a few studs off or a mile away with no in between in my control - and no undo. Select, delete, start again.\nTHAT VERY CRITICAL THING SAID I go back to my first point of view, this game still functions better than any other Early Access game I've played - save a few. And even then they operate on the same high quality level that you would expect from a big production from someone like Lego. Although the UI is a little bulky and cumbersome and the building tools need work I still played this game for close to 6 hours straight and had a blast the whole time. It's so much fun to ride a horse then find a boat, ride the boat, then find an eagle, then ride the eagle, scale a mountain, find a dragon, and then fly around spitting fireballs at the fully destructable world. I didn't go into detail on the world manipulation tools and UI here because they fell in between for me - worked, but obviously were early versions of the amazing tools they will be some day.\nIf someone were to ask if this game is fun, I would say yes. If someone were to ask if I would recommend this to their child, I say yes. If someone were to ask if this was the way they would be able to easily create blueprints for that shed they've been meaning to build out back all these years I would say - pull out your old box of Legos.\nI know this game will do nothing but improve in the future. And I want to be around to see it. 2 days old and this game has me enamoured - distracted at work writing a review instead of my job.\n\nGo have an adventure. Have a story to tell. Lego Worlds will help you do that.","June 3, 2015","true","8.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I UNDERSTAND IT IS EARLY ACCESS AND THIS REVIEW IS MEANT TO HELP PEOPLE PURCHASING AND DEVELOPERS.\n\nThis game, in its current state, is already looking to be very promising. The graphics are just beautiful, with the lighting and the amazing textures of the game. The controls are very well done, animations look fluid and combat works pretty great and is very similar to other LEGO games. But for building, in its current state, could be better. There are an extremely limited amount of blocks to choose from, so don't try to get out one of your old LEGO booklets and build something, as I've already tried and failed D: . But I WILL say that it has potential. The system in which you build actually isn't that clunky and awful. It offers a lot of freedom when building but the camera could use a bit of work.\n\nOne complaint I have about this game is the camera in every aspect of the game, including walking and building. The building camera is OK but you can't move it around to the exact position you want it to be in. While walking, LEGO resorts to an MMO styled control, where you hold down your mouse button and move your character around, opposed to other AAA games. I would prefer it if you didn't have to hold down your mouse button, but that's just me.\n\nSo my OVERALL review:\n\nGraphics: 10/10: Beautiful game overall, no complaints.\nGameplay: 8/10: Running around is fun, and building is great, but the camera needs work and WAY more bricks need to be added.\nOverall Enjoyment: 9/10. It's actually really fun to play. It gives me a very nostalgic feeling because it's been so long since I played a LEGO game. However, I can see myself getting bored in just a few hours of the game in its current state.\n\nOverall Review: 9/10.\n\nAs stated in the disclaimer, I hope the developers read this review and learn a lot about what I've said. I have read what they are GOING to add in the early access description, and those features are looking to make this game pretty great and WAY better than what it is. Looking forward to this game in its final form: the release.\n","June 3, 2015","true","3.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

LEGO Worlds allows you to play with Legos again, which has been quite a while for most people. My experiences have been great, but I'll write a good review since this is early access.\n\nPROS: Travelling from place-to-place is a lot of fun. Seeing the biomes is a highlight, since every brick is rendered and Legos have never looked this good. Collecting is one of the first things I did, which enables you to customize your characters and drive different vehicles. Some vehicles you need for a stable town, and some you need to kick-flip over some bricks. Building is fun as well, though it still needs work.\n\nCONS: Controls are fidgety and a bit clunky and could be worked on. Camera angles are extremely awkward, especially for singular brick building (which I still can't get a hang of).

The game starts you with 3 characters and you can unlock more by either finding or smashing other Lego minifigures (depending is they are hostile) after starting you are dropped into the world you choose were you can start unlocking things (creatures/vehicles/items/ect) by interacting with them in various ways and then buying them with Lego studs that you can get by smashing things. The fighting controls are very similar to most other Lego games (Batman,Star Wars,ect) and the characters movement is much easier to get around giving you the ability to climb just about anything. My only real complaint is the game is a bit too easy but there is a lot to do even in early access so I can only be excited looking towards the future of this game.","June 1, 2015","true","1.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I love LEGO, but was worried it would be a cheap ripoff. Sure, this game is early access, and you can't be sure of the full product, but when I landed in my procedurally generated world, I instantly fell in love with the recognizable blocks.\n\nThat was, until I saw my first skeleton. I immediately found myself surrounded, and not just by mindless bones. They were bobbing and weaving, with their bony fists raised like they were trained by Mike Tyson. I couldn't land a hit, and was forced to run. Luckily, I was saved by early access bugs, as the skeletons ran into trees and were glitched so badly they fused into them, becoming prisoners of the bark. I used Mother Nature herself to survive.\n\nI also rode a horse.

Its fun running around and smashing things up, like in any lego game, and the fact that everything is lego makes it all the better.  The terrain editing tools feel difficult to use accurately, and i ended up making a mess. The smooth tool however is very nicely and works well.\n\nObviously the building aspect is the main pull. I built a little house  and a garage, and it was fun doing so. Again, it feels at the moment that the camera never did what i wanted it to, and that it could use a few tweaks here and there. But over all the building was like building with lego, but with every part you need, in every colour. No more hunting around for that blue 1X1 block you needed.\n\nThe main thing i feel this needs is just a more interesting world at the moment. There are differeent biomes, and the game kindly shows you when you discover a new one, with that weird panny zoomy camera thing. But the biomes kinda all feel the same at the moment. More pre-built structures, maybe even small towns could really make a big difference.\n\nAlas, multiplayer is planned, this game needs it. We all spent a fair amount of time in minecraft single player, and we got bored. Im not saying this game is minecraft, but i felt the " I'm just walking around aimlessly on my own" feeling came on very quick. So multiplayer, yes please !\n\nI do like this game, and it has promise. Do us proud TT.","June 1, 2015","true","7.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The controls are much like the existing Lego games, but in this, you don't have any specific tasks. You can generate random worlds, share the worlds with your friends via universal code, or save and load worlds from your hard drive. You can choose your Lego minifigure, which you have 3 of initially, before starting the world. As you play in the open world, you discover new creatures, characters, and vehicles. Though you can interact with the ones in the world already, you can also spawn new ones. There are many tools to build, change the terrain, and select pre-built models.\n\nPros\n+The characters are very unique, and some of them have different abilities\n+You can ride any animal you encounter\n+The driving mechanics are very smooth\n+The tools are easy to build with\n+There are many different animals that spawn randomly in the world\n+Eight (?) different biomes to discover\n+Treasure chests!\n\nCons\n-The camera sometimes wanders off of your character\n-The camera can be very hard to control\n-After building, it is possible to spawn in a dangerous place/in the ground and die\n-Tools can sometimes break and not work correctly\n\nRating\nOverall, I would give this game a 9.4/10. I am satisfied with the amount of detail in it, especially for $15. It is perfect for children and adults who grew up owning and loving Lego sets. I'm glad they didn't mess this game up (so far), because right now it is great. If the tools were improved and the controls were smoother, it would be a 10/10.","June 2, 2015","true","0.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I can see this game could go very far. In its current state It is a building game with experimental combat. There is no inventory, no resources, no progression of any sort. What I mean by this is that in most sandbox games you start with nothing and progress towards the bigger and better things. That is currently not part of the system (Hopefully it will be at some point). Right now you wander around discovering different props and use the building system to create terrain (Just like the creative version of Minecraft). You do not have to gather materials, everything is available at the start (With the exception of props).  There are vehicles that allow various functions (Dig terrain, pave roads, etc.), which I love.\n\nDon't get me wrong as I said this has great potential, I can see this going very far. I just don't want people to hate it because it is missing so much content.\n\nNow I am not one to point out flaws and not provide something constructive in return, so here are thing I think could be added in the early stages to make the game more desireable (Please note my reference to brick is a base 1x1x1 lego piece, and Block is referring to larger parts such as a 4x2x1):\n\n1. Inventory and resource management. By this I mean the player should have to collect 10 dirt bricks before they can place 10 dirt bricks. These mechanics are the base of what makes a sandbox builder successful. The sense of accomplishment is important to keep players interested.\n\n2. Crafting of bricks into blocks. Each block harvested is worth a proportionate number of bricks. For example a 4x2x1 block would yield 8 bricks.\n\n3. Place limitations on early building, and incorporate tools that help advance building and gathering. For example if you want to harvest and build metal structures, you need certain tools (Forge, Anvil, Strong Pick etc).\n\n4. Resource renewability. If you chop down a tree, there should be a way to replace that tree or the world should replace that resource randomly (I'd advised against the latter as it could cause problems with players designs. Who wants a tree sprouting up in front of their door?). Easier to let players re plant a new tree where they want.\n\nI know that these mechanics take a lot of programming and work, but I feel they are essential to keep players interested while developers work on other content.\n\n\nSo in closing I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys unrestricted creative mode building. However if you are looking for an adventure mode game, I would hold off for now.\n","June 1, 2015","true","2.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Its still in early access so its to be expected.\nOverall gameplay is a blast! Exploring a vast Lego world whilst destroying or discovering anything in your path is great! The camera controls still need a bit of work in my opinion, such as zooming in and out of your character, along with vehicle camera controls. That being said, being a wizard while riding the drill vehicle through the mountains because why not is the best!

You do not have to read it but i thought i should mention it no matter what.\n\n=INFO ABOUT THE REVIEW=\n1. This review might be a bit longer.\n2. This review is about my point of view and opinion.\n3. If you want to discuss with me about what i wrote then please be reasonable and put up arguments that actually make sense to everyone present. (This does not mean that if i dont understand it or dont like it that you are wrong.)\n4. If you cannot be reasonable i will use my Right as reviewmaker to ignore your comment.\n\n=REVIEW=\n\nSo this review is about a game i havent played for long yet but i can only say that it already is very good.\n\nNow about the game i can say that i had to turn down some of my settings for a good fps but after i did that it was solid. My PC is decent but not a high end gaming PC and most of the games on my Library were played on this PC without problems so you can see that it isnt that bad of a PC after all. Back to the point. The game runs good on my settings and i have no fps drops so far.\n\nThe main controlls, those were an issue for me in blockland, are easy as in every other Lego Game that we know. You use WASD to move around. F to interact with things. Q and E to change the size of your brush and space and controll to ascend or descend.\n\nThe Controlls about going up and down and resizing mainly play a role when you fly with a helicopter or when you build something. While flying in a helicopter you use mainly WASD to move around but you use space and controll to move up and down. While in buildmode though you also use Q and E to resize your brush so you can use it on a bigger or tinier area.\n\nAs of for the main game there is currently not much to do. The reason for that is that the game is currently in early acces and having the game itself and the engine done is for me good enough. This of course is only my opinion. But from what we have here right now it is more a game you explore instead of you building big ♥♥♥ Castles and such. But updates will come and add even more blocks.\n\nSo would i recommend the game? - Yes\nBut i also would say that if you arent a fan of exploring: Dont buy it yet\n\nThe game is still in development and updates can come whenever. But since there is not much to do at the moment it might be boring for some people what is understandable.\n\nIf you dont care though and still want to try out building i recommend watching the tutorial by paulsoaresjr about how to Build and Import your own custom Models into the World of Lego. Since there is a program people can use to make certain structures this might help you out a bit.\n\nAnd that it is. I have gotten Blockland and Lego Worlds. Both games are similar from the Idea. But only after playing a tiny bit, even without a tutorial, i can already say that Lego Worlds is the better one. Now people might disagree but hey that is how life is.\n\nI wish you guys a good one~","July 3, 2015","true","1.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It brings to mind the many, many fun hours I had building with LEGO as a kid, and extends it to the kinds of videogames that exist now.

In politics.\n-Precise building can often be painful and awkward\n-No particularly fast way of getting around, the animals and air vehicles are all slow and the ground vehicles are almost uncontrollable\n-The character often climbs bricks when you don't want it to\n-There's no way of deleting a vehicle/character that spawned with a set, it always respawns every time the world loads.\n\nTo summarise: LEGO Worlds is a fun game, and perfect for the creative type, but if you're not really into building with lego, wait until multiplayer comes out before buying this one.","June 9, 2015","true","21.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Than this is Lego's answer to that statement. It's proceedurally generated, like minecraft, but it's actually lego, and you can build/create anything you can think of using any Lego block around.\n\nThere is also a pretty cool exploration feature too. You can find various vehicles and pre-fabbed sturctures through out the world, the more you unlock. Once you have a vehicle unlocked, you can summon another at any time to tool around the world. You can also use the pre-fab items to build your own lego-y structures whereever you like.\n\nAs of this review, it's best played with a controller though.

I love that you can ride dragons and animals. It's pretty fun, although, it does get a little too boring when all you do is run around, nothing is really that much of a threat, not even the lava. I would have liked to fight the dragon to be able to earn to ride it. It needs some form of multiplayer or co-op. The only thing that's fun about it atm is getting all the items, characters, and animals. Other than that a achievement system would be good too! I also find the building system to be annoying, as well as the third person view. I can't exactly have too much freedom where I look, and it becomes a hassle when building. I also found myself spawning the place holding house in the tools bars on top of each other, giving me endless coins! I also find the camera to just randomly look off into the distance with no real direction as to what the hell on earth it's looking at. It looked off into the water and I thought there was something in that direction. I ended up flying for 30 minutes over plain ocean.\n\n\nPros\n-Fun!\n-Riding animals\n-Great characters\n-Heaps to collect\n-Nice biomes\n\n\nCons\n-Camera angles\n-No real danger\n-Building is annoying\n-No farming\n-No way to really create a personalized house\n-No use of materials to make vehicles (Ability to mine materials to get already bought vehicles rather than to just spawn them in)\n\n\n\n\nI do have a lot of cons compared to the pros, but it is early access and it still needs a lot of improvements,. There's no real danger, or mission, no survival, no real combat. Overall the game is fun, but to an extent, I'll definitely still be playing it ;)  6/10","June 7, 2015","true","31.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Any problems I have are nitpicks from an adult perspective who can see the potential for a true Minecraft 2.0 killer.  That said, I like it, and will be back.\n\nMy first impression is that it plays a lot like the Lego story games set in a minecraft world.  Fighting destroying and collecting coins have been ramped up.  Creation, destruction, exploration and unlocking new items is fun, but will run out.  Longevity will rest on the creation toolset, and I have a thought.  Minecraft is addictive because of how easy it is to build.  Redstone ensures that you are only limited by your own creativity.  So how does LEGO Worlds stack up?  "Building" is more or less a three click affair.  Once something is unlocked and paid for, you can build it anywhere and the terraforming and creation is done for you.  This is a double edge sword.  On one hand building a town will be a piece of cake, and once multiplayer is implemented, you will be able to populate large areas very quickly.  On the other, it takes away from the guarenteed uniqueness each minecraft world.\n\nThe individual brickbuilding tools are there, but they are as clunky as trying to build with a pile of bricks on your living room floor where your are only allowed to use one of those arm extending grabbers instead of your hands.  I'm sure this will get refined.\n\nThis game mirrors Minecraft in it's lack of physics, this makes me sad, because as a kid, I would spend hours with my brother building catapults.  We would launch rocks at eachothers catapults until one was too broken to work.  I don't see how that is possible here.  There may be motorized parts, but the interaction between objects is nonexistant.  I also hope there is a way to build your own vehicles at some point.  Multiplayer is going to put this game to the test.\n\nPros:\nThe LEGO look has been nailed.\nThe biomes are varied, dense and detailed.\nThe world is made of the tiniest bricks, which adds to the detail.\nThere are no rules.\nCreative and Survival modes exist at the same time.\nExplore to unlock.\nPotential to unlock realworld kits for use in game.\nDestruction is satisfying.\nThe sheer volume of figs, props and creations.\nRiding a dragon.\nMowing lawns replaces bumpy bricks with smooth flat ones.\nSteamrollers lay roads.\nThe driller, wow, it is fun to drive.\nEagles, planes, motorcycles.\n\nCons:\nNo physics engine.\nMouse and Keyboard control doesn't play well with controller controls\nSelection tools are pretty rough.\nThe obvious setup for microtransaction after microtransaction.\nNo MP yet\nWorld creation options not present yet\nNo aiming retecule.  Not a big deal till you blow a hole in the side of your castle when you were aiming at a skeleton\nNo first person mode\nBrick building tools are really tedious","June 1, 2015","true","7.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's a cool concept but falls short on the actual building.\n\nFirst, if you want to build you have to go through a super convoluted menu that doesn't work well with a controller. Your character moves as you build and the camera seems to follow your guy and not where you're actually pointing to. Your character floats up and you're free to build wherever you want. However if you want to switch from building to terrain editing you have to exit the menu, your guy will fall down, you open up another menu and he floats back up. It's cool to see the lego guy build everything but it's at the expense of precision, very frustrating.\n\nThe building doesn't feel too great and needs a lot of work, the camera makes it very difficult to build anything half-decent. The game comes with a lot of presets that you can use but it feels like cheating, it doesn't feel as good as building something entirely by yourself. You can unlock more models to use by bumping into them, along with vehicles, animals and other lego people, there are also props that you can interact with.\n\nThe actual gameplay is every lego game so far, the only new feature is that you can climb anything, walls, ceiling etc and feels really smooth. The camera sometimes can't keep up and it can get stuck in the walls and floor. The camera also seems to dramatically pan and zoom into every new character or vehicle you find in a pseudo-cutscene, this happens very often, it's cool at first but gets annoying quickly.\n\nThe performance is solid all things considering, all the terrain is made of tiny pieces of lego, I've been running it at around 90fps, dips to 40 when the terrain is loading, using fast vehicles also dips the frame rate.\n\nThe price makes it hard not to recommend it tho, it has some major problems, if you just want to freeroam as lego characters and unlocking stuff you may get bored quickly, the building needs a huge amount of work but as I said it has potential. Hopefully the camera can be tightened and allow you to actually build stuff precisely without your lego character getting in the way.","June 1, 2015","true","3.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I probably havn't played it enough, but i'll change this review when i get more into it.\n\nEven with that said, i'd still advise you to wait till they add more blocks and vehicles to the game and work out a few of the bugs.\n\nIf you want to get into it now, you can think of it of an underdeveloped Minecraft + Roblox clone. Minecraft in the sense that you have a wilderness to run around in and Roblox in the sense that you can build everything with very small details... and with legos. And before you ask, No, there is no resource collecting and processing... if you don't count discovering foliage.\n\nI really hope they continue working on this game and don't drop it.

Ok let me clarify. The recent negative reviews treating the game like a final product/bashing it for not having multiplayer are stupid. Here's a legit review.\nPros\n- The game looks awe-inspiring. It's like if Crytek made a kids game... NO A GOOD KIDS GAME. So you Graphics ♥♥♥♥♥s will be pleased.\n- It has a sense of adventure reminiscent of Zelda. Even has big chests which the protagonist opens Wind Waker style.\n- The music seems to take cues from Nathan Drake's theme from Uncharted. BABABABA BA BA BA BAAAAAA BA BA BA BA BA BA BAAAAAAAAAAA. Tt chose the perfect ambient sounds for this game.\n- It's got SHAAAAHKS. And guns. Minecraft doesn't have guns.\n- It has drivable vehicles.\n- The gameplay is fun in short bursts especially if you wanted a more open ended LEGO Videogame Game.\n- It get's quite funny under the right circumstances.\nCons\n- Get it on sale because the 15 dollar pricetag is too high.\n- Occasionally the game's Random Number Generator will spawn a bad map.\n- Camera's bad.\n- Falling into Lava could trigger an infinite fall in lava glitch which is inescapable unless you save and quit.\n- The devs changed how the game works so you can't just needlessly slaughter characters/animals to unlock them. Now you have to collect items to unlock them. Which is annoying. Even if the item's a sweet weapon, I am not giving up my sword to unlock a knight!\n- LEGO Worlds is gonna fry your potato. At least try to get above the maximum requirements.\nAll in all I give it a 8/10","December 24, 2015","true","1.2"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

The controls are a bit wonky and ungainly. I hope there are more environments in the future and more wildlife.

I hope it continues because it's fantasic, but needs some more work (obviously).\n\nPros:\n-Great Graphics (too good that the game lags my computer)\n-Decent controls. Some of the controls should be re-worked, but they're fine.\n-Lots to unlock. As you go around the world you unlock pre-built objects that you can use.\n-Good Character Customization. As you unlock characters, you can either be that character, or just build your own.\n-Building. The building function is good, but the block-by-block function is a little wonky.\n\nCons:\n-Limited Worlds.\n-Menus (top left). [MY OPINION] --> The menus should either be moved and re-done, or just completely gone and instead use certian keys/buttons for each different menu.\n-More than one option for an action. For example, walking, I use WSAD but for attacking I use Left-Mouse Click; when I try to attack it will sometimes move my character instead.\n-Camera. It tries to move on its on to help, but it just messes things up instead. The choice of a fixed or un-fixed camera would be great.\n\nOverall, I think this is a great game already for only being Early-Access.

STOP messing up camera angles. Hardly playable now, you can't see if you are going to jump into lava, the camera doesn't know when you turned around so going into buildings is near impossible. It was better the first time.\nStart. bump into plants. able to use them. bump into people able to steal their identity. killed some enemies able to become them. bumped into a dragon and bought it. blew up some water. blew up some lava. looted a bunch of big chests. became king. became caveman. weilded an ice cream.\n\nFor real though, this game is pretty well made. I'll start with the cons.\n\nCamera angles are total crap, if you are indoors or near walls, most of the time it will block your view.\nWatching the terrain load is just an eye sore. Nuff said.\nNo variety. You can stumble across new things every now and then, and the big chests with loot items are fun to hunt, but it can get repetitive, and yes I am aware it is still in progress so..\n\nProtime.\n\nVariety. I know what I said, but starting out, its like exploring a billion worlds at once. Its just after you've gotten used to the new car smell that you notice it isn't that great. There is only a finite amount of things at the moment, expecting more to come.\nSimple, smooth. Runs great, no lag of any kind, everything works how I think it is supposed to, everything was beautifully made.\nQuite a laugh, some of the things you can do, beating cave men with a fish, riding an ostrich like a mad man.\n\nNeutrals.\n\nThe build system is a little shaky, but it is still good, so I can't really decide if I want to lable it bad or good. Aiming is an issue, but that ties in with the camera problem.\n\nWorth $15 (plus tax depending)? Absolutely. The cons are puny and will no doubt be fixed shortly.

There are so many cool characters, animals, vehicles, buildings, etc in the game that you'll spend hours upon hours flying from island to island unlocking new things to later build those islands up with. That's essentially what the game boils down to:\n\nPart 1: Explore and unlock things by simply just finding them.\n\nPart 2: Build up your world with all the cool things you find.\n\nThere's no survival aspect, other than don't be killed by skeletons or animals. It's the sandbox LEGO game experience so many of us have wanted for all these years. I'm not going to list pros, because there are way too many small things that you should discover on your own, but I will list some cons.\n\nCONS\n-Some of the islands are just too small and spaced out. Sometimes you'll have to fly around for minutes looking for another spot of land.\n-The view depth is shallow, blurring a lot of your surroundings a bit.\n-Best played with a controller. Controls can be very wonky either way, but playing with a mouse and keyboard was nearly unbearable for me.\n-There's no real challenge to the game, although that could also be a pro. Having all this stuff to build with might get frustrating if someone's constantly tearing it apart. (Just like with real-life LEGOS).\n-The cars controls are pretty bad and made me sick more times than not.\n-Can't locate any map of the world. Maybe it's an unlockable item?\n-The game is repetitive and doesn't really have much of a point to it outside of exploration and building. Again, that's not a problem for myself, but it may be for others.\n\nAll in all, LEGO Worlds is an incredible game that will hopefully only get better as time goes by. I've had a smile on my face nearly the whole time I've played it. WELL worth the $15 price!","June 2, 2015","true","19.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Building interface needs a lot of work (especially the camera movements) and the other menus as well as they are very counter-intuitive. Game is already pretty fun. The amount of customization is absolutely amazing. You can build anything you want brick by brick or use prefabs. You can pick any existing LEGO brick and customize for hours. Worlds are randomly generated and full of unlockables. With regular updates and the introduction of multiplayer, this could become something very, very big.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RoberTime/recommended/332310/","RoberTime","RoberTime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RoberTime/","55 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo I played my first hour of this game after finding out this is just like Minecraft, but with things Minecraft can't do. I think this game looks amazing as if it was a whole new Minecraft game, but with nothing but lego. In fact, this combines the elements of not only Minecraft, but Roblox, Blockland, Disney Infinity, and Digital Designer as well.\n\nThe landscapes look more unique and advanced than Minecraft. It's all lego so it's really interesting, just like the Lego Movie. I also notice the characters you can find in this game are from the Minifigures series. The biomes are nice because there is a brief cutscene showing your discovery of a new region of your world. Another thing about landscapes, unlike Minecraft, you can sculpt the terrain which is a heck of a lot faster than Minecraft.\n\nI haven't wound up building anything yet, seeing how I don't see much of a selection of bricks and pieces, which is reasonable since Early Access started today. I am going to take a guess that it will be much much wider once the game is released. I would like to try rebuilding real life building sets if this game is updated enough.\n\nOther than the brick selection, here is a list of what else I would like to see in future updates:\n\n- Workshop, so people can share building sets and other goodies\n- New world types similar to "Superflat" and "Large Biomes" in Minecraft\n- Building sets from other brands like Star Wars and Lego Movie\n- Online play and minigames like the ones you see in online games\n- More sophisticated terrain editing\n- Custom-built vehicles, I would like to build Benny's Spaceship and fly it\n- Custom decals for bricks, like stickers that come with building sets\n\n10/10 for a Day 1 Early Access game. I loved it. Any of the above ideas for future versions would be great. Will make another review about the full game when it comes out.","June 1, 2015","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a better game than Minecraft, I'll conceed. Hoqwever, they're immensely different games so there's no point in comparing them. Minecraft is a survival sandbox, whereas LEGO Worlds is an adventure sandbox. I calll it an adventure sandbox because it plays like an adventure game and gave me that same sense of wonder that The Legend Of Zelda did when I first played that. That's mainly because LEGO Worlds incetivizes exploring - it starts you off by literally dropping you into the world. This freefall gives you time to look at the world and the places you can explore. I've tended to notice you mostly start on beaches, which is a great starting point and allows you to explore whatever mysterious jungle lay ahead. Usually you'll run across somebody. For instance, I met a cavewoman in my first 5 or so minutes of playing. As soon as she saw me she began to run away. Naturally, I was only trying to say hello, so I chase after her, intending to explain myself and make an ally in this new, dangerous world. I catch up with her and as soon as I do she gets added to my roster of characters (more on that in a sec). However, she's a prehistoric cavewoman - something I didn't factor in - and she starts hitting me on the head with a club. We get into a scuffle and I win. I open my menu and realise that she's now in my roster of playable characters. The downside I needed studs to unlock her. I don't have enough, so I continue on my way. Next I find a horse who's added to my roster of rideable "creatures" and I set off in search of treasure to purchase both my horse and my new character (I was quite bored of LEGO Indianna Jones SR. by now xD). I run across a treasure chest and punch it with my fist, which gives me the money I need to buy what I want. So, I switch to the cavewoman and climb up a tree which allows me to scout out where I want to go next. Eventually I found a motorbike mechanic and the cycle continues. At the end of my 2.8 hours clocked at the time of this review, I have built a house, lived in a castle, became the king, rode an ostridge, divebombed a plane into a volcano and made my tamed pet dragon blow up a cloud with a fireball. Really.\n\nI've heard a lot of complaints about this game and I'll proceed to address them now.\n\nFirst, about the camera. With a keyboard and mouse it was clunky but that's a common problem with TT LEGO games so I doubt it'll change soon; on the flipside, plug in a controller and it controlls like a dream. I know not everybody has a plug in controller but it's an option worth considering if you want to buy this game.\n\nSecondly, people have been saying that the building mechanics are too complicated. I believe that it's more it being full of stuff to build with - for an early access game this has more than most sandboxes (looking at you, Minecraft). This variety of bricks allows you to build really intricate builds. Kudos to the LEGO group and TT games for that. Besides, if you're still to lazy or incompetent there are prebuilt items and LEGO sets for the creatively challenged/\n\nFinally, no workshop and no multiplayer. This'll be a quickie. TT games have promised both of these so calm down foliks, it's coming!\n\nThe game looks good and runs wll but I have access to a top of the line PC so that's probably why.\n\nI have a few complaints but to be honest they're either nitpicking or something that I'm confident will be added, like proper underwater swimming and not just diving.\n\nAll of that aside though, I like LEGO Worlds and I do reccomend it for anyone on the fence!\n\nPS. If you're still here, thanks for taking the time out to read this! I appreciate that you've the courtsey to listen to me mindlessly rambling on about LEGO for 700 or so words. I hope you enjoyed every one of those 700! :D","June 4, 2015","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Paul Soares Jr. and stampylongnose introduced me to this game. But the real question is, is this a good game? To answer that: YEAH! From the stunning graphics to the creative influence of the game, I'd rate it a 10/10 : Just the right amount o' water (IGN Joke of the Day). This game takes off from Minecraft's main mechanic: creativity. You can create whatever the heck ya want! Make a giant cupcake! Oh, it already has presets for it, but you can make your own in no time! The best part of building is the use of LEGO Digital Designer models in the game! If building or lag gets you down, LDD will create a town! (das a rhyme!)\n\nOverall, this game may have been one of the best I've ever played. Go ahead, buy it now!

What makes this really fun is that it uses the same Lego currency of prior games (little Lego studs) to buy sets, characters and props. Think of all those studs you collected in Lego Batman or Lego Star Wars. Remember how you could use them to purchase characters or abilities. Now this game is just like that except more open world. You're not just confined to purchasing Batman characters or Star Wars characters but sets and blocks and characters and vehicles. By the way, you can build with lego blocks. It's a little tedious to do, but I guess if you really want to create something out of Legos, you can.\n\nThe physics are just like prior Lego games.\n\nI just hope it doesn't end up using micro transactions because I'll probably end up going broke!","June 1, 2015","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/njrabit/recommended/332310/","njrabit","Bunny Brewster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/njrabit/","603 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nYou ask: Is this another Minecraft-like block-building game or is there something different here?   My answer is Yes and Yes.  This is obviously a block building game in the Minecraft style, has many of the same gameplay elements of Minecraft, but given the many layers of polish and shine that only a much bigger budget can provide.\n\nI'll start with the graphics.  While Minecraft's deferred shadows both made the game look stunning (especially in bigger builds) as well becoming an important part of gameplay (torches to light your caves/fortresses/etc), Lego Worlds actually looks darn photorealistic.  I spent the entire time in awe of how despite being a blocky, cartoonish world, it looked like a real physical place.  Animals in the world are not 'blocky' but have continuous non-jaggy surfaces that move very fluidly.\n\nThe 'blocks' are not simple squares but actual Lego pieces of different shapes including angled edges so there is a considerable greater level of detail in every scene.  The worlds appear to be procedural generated, but the algorithm chooses out of various Lego pieces, sometimes creating some really gorgeous looking patterns in the landscape.  You can paint bricks, which is rather awesome - I just hope they don't remove this feature for eventual multiplayer mode.\n\nI haven't gotten into manual building yet but there are two prebuild sets you can drop in and watching them appear is a bit like watching a very fast 3D printer, cutting out a flat area then spraying the shapes into the scene.  One scene contains a lot of objects that your character can interact with like a BBQ, swimming pool and a house - I suspect there will be many many more of these.  One very cool aspect is that animals and vehicles are rideable and *extremely fun* - especially the car racing over hills.  I don't know if building custom vehicles is in the plans but that by itself would make this game worth 3x it's early release price.\n\n","June 2, 2015","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game plays fine with a controller; if you've played any other Lego game before, you'll feel pretty at home here. The major notable exception is building. I actually found it easier to use the mouse and keyboard to build stuff.\n\nThe good:\nDRAGONS! I was in the game for maybe ten minutes before coming across a dragon. Since everything else I had come across was rideable, I figured dragons would also fall in this category. They are. They shoot fireballs. At everything. People, plants, objects, castles, igloos, the ground... clouds... if it's there, it can be blown up with a fireball. I am pleased.\nSkydiving. This is how you enter the world, and also a mechanism you can use to get unstuck... or because you like skydiving, and it looks really cool.\nLots of stuff. For an early access title, there sure is a lot of collectible junk. Everything from prebuilt items to new characters. Also, you can make your character wield a banana as a weapon.\nVehicles/mounts. Having access to such a wide array of things that you can use to traverse the landscape makes exploration much more entertaining.\nThe environment. The world looks charming and interesting. The aesthetic is obviously similar to Minecraft, but it's also reminiscent of Cube World, which I absolutely adore. There are already a ton of different biomes to explore, each with their own collectibles. Only one has dragons, from what I've seen so far.\nThe idle animations. Find yourself a camel or an ostrich and just sit there for a moment and see what happens. The animations in general in this game are really well done, and very adorable.\nThe bad:\nGraphics distance. What I mean by that is when I'm flying around on my dragon, the world looks significantly grainer and blurrier than it does close up. I know there are just going to be some limitations, but I hope that this is improved before the full release.\nEnemies. Honestly, they're just sort of there at this point. They aren't really a threat; more of an annoyance than anything. If they're going to be in the game, I'd like to have a bit of a challenge. Also, they aren't instantly destroyed by fireballs from a dragon. I'm sure the developer will fix this grievous oversight.\nDragons only come in red. Red dragons are great, but I want black dragons. And green dragons. Maybe blue dragons as well.\nPerformance:\nFor the most part, I had no problems running the game on my GTX 650 on high textures. As I mentioned before, the game doesn't look particularly great from a distance. Close up, it's looking fantastic.\nThere were some issues maintaining framerate in relatively intensive areas. Again, this was on high textures, so that might have something to do with it. But I noticed in some areas the framerate would drop substantially. Most notably, around lava and when glitching out.\nGlitches. Most vehicles seem to work okay (although something about finding a submarine on top of a giant hill makes me giggle), but the digger is... well, it's not quite there. Don't get me wrong, its fun, but I've had it flip out and shoot itself across the map a few times. UPDATE: So, if you try digging water (which you can actually do), that's a surefire way to cause the digger to glitch out horribly and send you flying into the sky. You can exit it and skydive back down, but it doesn't always seem to put you close to where you started.\nOverall, this is a pretty solid game for an early access title. It will benefit greatly with the addition of multiplayer, which it doesn't yet include. If you're a fan of dragons, Legos, dragons, and also dragons, I think there's fun to be had in the game, even in this early state. But right now, you're probably going to be investing in the future of this game.","June 3, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Traveller's Tales are doing what they do best with the LEGO formula, merging their beat-em-up, stud-collecting platforming with world creation. Most voxel games miss the mark on not looking very natural, but the great thing about LEGO is that things can be out of place and it suits the formula well.\n\nAny other feature that I want that isn't in Early Access is already planned on the roadmap. Once this game has more polish and direction, it will be by far the best LEGO game on the market. In this current state it is definitely worth the $15 asking price, and you will only get more for your money as development progresses.\n\nWhile Early Access may usually be a gamble, with the backing of a LEGO license and the publishing of WB, it's almost impossible for this game to disappoint.","June 2, 2015","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

What makes this really fun is that it uses the same Lego currency of prior games (little Lego studs) to buy sets, characters and props. Think of all those studs you collected in Lego Batman or Lego Star Wars. Remember how you could use them to purchase characters or abilities. Now this game is just like that except more open world. You're not just confined to purchasing Batman characters or Star Wars characters but sets and blocks and characters and vehicles. By the way, you can build with lego blocks. It's a little tedious to do, but I guess if you really want to create something out of Legos, you can.\n\nThe physics are just like prior Lego games.\n\nI just hope it doesn't end up using micro transactions because I'll probably end up going broke!","June 1, 2015","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

If you're in for the journey of pre-release alpha's, absolutely. It's a decent game, and has a tonne of potential, but it has its flaws. Most noticeably the fps. GTX 970 user, game can stutter more than BF4 on ultra. Needless to say the game does look amazing, but it's optimization isn't up to scratch right now. It's an alpha though, what can you expect?\n\nSmall bugs such as zooming in at random points, and the generally difficult to use mouse and keyboard controlls aren't too fun either. But for a game released yesterday, it's certainly showing promise. The mouse and keyboard controls can be refined very easily, and the bugs can be patched quickly. Optimization will happen I assume, and well, we havn't got to the positives.\n\nThe game has a large amount of exploration to be done. Find civillization, find vechiles, even find bloody flyable dragons.\nAttack zombies and skeletons as you ride around the vast world on whatever transport you can think of. Chests can be found which contain weapons and currency, plenty of imaginative biomes can be explored, and everything you can come  across you can use to build your own little paradise.\n\nThat's just on the 2nd day of release.\nTL;DR game has its bugs, some very noticable (stuttering issues on mid-high end systems)  but shows alot of promise, and has very imaginative gameplay to make up for it. Think cubeworld meets minecraft.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/njrabit/recommended/332310/","njrabit","Bunny Brewster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/njrabit/","603 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nYou ask: Is this another Minecraft-like block-building game or is there something different here?   My answer is Yes and Yes.  This is obviously a block building game in the Minecraft style, has many of the same gameplay elements of Minecraft, but given the many layers of polish and shine that only a much bigger budget can provide.\n\nI'll start with the graphics.  While Minecraft's deferred shadows both made the game look stunning (especially in bigger builds) as well becoming an important part of gameplay (torches to light your caves/fortresses/etc), Lego Worlds actually looks darn photorealistic.  I spent the entire time in awe of how despite being a blocky, cartoonish world, it looked like a real physical place.  Animals in the world are not 'blocky' but have continuous non-jaggy surfaces that move very fluidly.\n\nThe 'blocks' are not simple squares but actual Lego pieces of different shapes including angled edges so there is a considerable greater level of detail in every scene.  The worlds appear to be procedural generated, but the algorithm chooses out of various Lego pieces, sometimes creating some really gorgeous looking patterns in the landscape.  You can paint bricks, which is rather awesome - I just hope they don't remove this feature for eventual multiplayer mode.\n\nI haven't gotten into manual building yet but there are two prebuild sets you can drop in and watching them appear is a bit like watching a very fast 3D printer, cutting out a flat area then spraying the shapes into the scene.  One scene contains a lot of objects that your character can interact with like a BBQ, swimming pool and a house - I suspect there will be many many more of these.  One very cool aspect is that animals and vehicles are rideable and *extremely fun* - especially the car racing over hills.  I don't know if building custom vehicles is in the plans but that by itself would make this game worth 3x it's early release price.\n\n","June 2, 2015","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The voxel based graphics make for some interesting interactions and the gameplay is very different.  Building is done as it would be with standard legos, you actually assemble models with actual lego pieces and can place them in your world.  You can also place complete models into the world as well.  The game will accept Lego Digital Designer models imported and you can also export.  The best parts of the game are the exploration and collecting elements.  Wandering the world looking for that hard to find minifig is both frustrating and ultimately rewarding.  Being able to hop into a helicopter and fly above the land seeing what you have either built or destroyed is and enjoyable factor also.\n\nThis game is already great in Early Access and only promises to get better as time goes on.","June 3, 2015","true","142.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The sword came in handy has a bunch of skeletons were now attacking me! After fighting them off I jumped on a camel and made my escape, then around the next hill I found a volcano with lava flowing everywhere and there I saw a dragon drinking from the lava. I jumped on the dragon's back and flew into the sky, landing on a cloud.

More skeletons were closing in so I leaped on a nearby bicycle and rode away. On the edge of the forest I found pirates who attacked me.

Wouldn't you know, my kids freaking LOVE Legos!  So, I thought we'd give this game a shot.  I'll start with the bad, since there's not much to say (even though it's early access).  First off, the camera angles get a little funky (zooming into lego blocks, getting stuck in that view from time to time, pushing forward and going backwards because the camera is looking that direction while you're turning, etc.).  Secondly, there's no multiplayer!  I'm sure that given a little more time, WB will work these things out.  Other than that, it's pretty fun.  You can fly in airplanes, helicopters, on a dragon, etc. and there are tons of different characters/items to find while you're exploring.  The kids love it, and I'm sold too.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrilloLogic/recommended/332310/","TrilloLogic","Trillo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrilloLogic/","28 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is really, really fun. It's building mechanics (large part of why I bought it) out class lots of other similar games, and it's exploration is really fun too!\n\nBuilding is great. There are loads of bricks options and the terrain editors are really well made and easy to use. It's all very intuitive. The only issue I have with building is the camera. Doing anything building related zooms you out and puts the camera controls in a wierd mode. It's hard to explain but it's very useful for terrain editing, but often very inconvenient for brick by brick editing. I think this mode should be optional, and you should also be able to walk around and place bricks.\n\nExploration is also really fun. There are lots of diverse biomes and in the world you can find props, animals, vehicles and characters, which you can buy with Studs and then spawn in indefinetly. There are also chests and buildings around, and there are characters too, which you can again buy and then be, or use their parts making a custom character. The enemies are rather weak and it's hard to die, but I don't think the main aspect of the game is survival so that's fine by me. My main issue is that there are often random cutscenes which can be irritating and they play the same sound clip which gets tedious.\n\nOverall I'd say that this game is worth the low price. I'm more into building and architecture but the exploring is also really fun. Since it's in Beta, this is probably a good time to get it, as they seem to be working hard to implement what the community wants. with a large ideas thread stickied on the forums with lots of Dev replies, so I know that it will only continue to improve.\n\nOne thing worth mentioning is that it's not too well optimised. Again, I imagine this will improve but I'll give an example. I'm running an i5 processor at 2.30GHz and I have 4GB of RAM, so in theory I should be able to run the game reasonable well. However I've had to put some settings low and I'm playing in DX9 not DX11. It still looks great for me, but I think if your device is significantly lower than the specs I've given, you may want to hold off for a while (I'm not the best person to ask though).","June 6, 2015","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a nice freeroam and has many features that is like a Minecraft Lego Game. I would rate this game 9,5/10 only because ofit is in Beta and there is still things going on that I want to see.

The sword came in handy has a bunch of skeletons were now attacking me! After fighting them off I jumped on a camel and made my escape, then around the next hill I found a volcano with lava flowing everywhere and there I saw a dragon drinking from the lava. I jumped on the dragon's back and flew into the sky, landing on a cloud. After taking in the view we flew back down where we found a bunch of skeletons in a forest surrounding a chest, we fought the skeletons and my dragon died! I raided the chest to find an apple. More skeletons were closing in so I leaped on a nearby bicycle and rode away. On the edge of the forest I found pirates who attacked me. I beat them to pieces with my apple, then got in a nearby buggy and drove off to a sandy beach where I met a scientist with an airplane.

If you're in for the journey of pre-release alpha's, absolutely. It's a decent game, and has a tonne of potential, but it has its flaws. Most noticeably the fps. GTX 970 user, game can stutter more than BF4 on ultra. Needless to say the game does look amazing, but it's optimization isn't up to scratch right now. It's an alpha though, what can you expect?\n\nSmall bugs such as zooming in at random points, and the generally difficult to use mouse and keyboard controlls aren't too fun either. But for a game released yesterday, it's certainly showing promise. The mouse and keyboard controls can be refined very easily, and the bugs can be patched quickly. Optimization will happen I assume, and well, we havn't got to the positives.\n\nThe game has a large amount of exploration to be done. Find civillization, find vechiles, even find bloody flyable dragons.\nAttack zombies and skeletons as you ride around the vast world on whatever transport you can think of. Chests can be found which contain weapons and currency, plenty of imaginative biomes can be explored, and everything you can come  across you can use to build your own little paradise.\n\nThat's just on the 2nd day of release.\nTL;DR game has its bugs, some very noticable (stuttering issues on mid-high end systems)  but shows alot of promise, and has very imaginative gameplay to make up for it. Think cubeworld meets minecraft.

What makes this really fun is that it uses the same Lego currency of prior games (little Lego studs) to buy sets, characters and props. Think of all those studs you collected in Lego Batman or Lego Star Wars. Remember how you could use them to purchase characters or abilities. Now this game is just like that except more open world. You're not just confined to purchasing Batman characters or Star Wars characters but sets and blocks and characters and vehicles. By the way, you can build with lego blocks. It's a little tedious to do, but I guess if you really want to create something out of Legos, you can.\n\nThe physics are just like prior Lego games.\n\nI just hope it doesn't end up using micro transactions because I'll probably end up going broke!","June 1, 2015","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Paul Soares Jr. and stampylongnose introduced me to this game. But the real question is, is this a good game? To answer that: YEAH! From the stunning graphics to the creative influence of the game, I'd rate it a 10/10 : Just the right amount o' water (IGN Joke of the Day). This game takes off from Minecraft's main mechanic: creativity. You can create whatever the heck ya want! Make a giant cupcake! Oh, it already has presets for it, but you can make your own in no time! The best part of building is the use of LEGO Digital Designer models in the game! If building or lag gets you down, LDD will create a town! (das a rhyme!)\n\nOverall, this game may have been one of the best I've ever played. Go ahead, buy it now! The price for early access may be less than the one for the full version later on.","July 8, 2015","true","11.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am 45 years old and haven't played with "real" Legos in many years but I have to admit that digital Legos are a blast.  Sometimes literally.  They set you into random worlds built completely with Legos with amazing detail and creativity.  It is so much fun to run around and "take ownership" of these worlds, then using the various means of mass Lego destruction, found during your travels, blow holes in everything, dig caverns everywhere, and say "screw physics" as you carve out a cave right through the seawater.\n\nJust an idea, I would love to see some "outer space" Lego worlds to explore.

This game adds what every other Lego game has yet to add, open world sandbox. This game is basically Minecraft, Lego, and GTA mixed into one amazing title. You can find a bazooka in a secret chest which will destroy the terrain around you, drive cars, planes, and every animal you come across. The building in this game is hard to get used to, but they give pre-built structures to make it easier. The combat system is very finicky, but very fun nevertheless. So far, I haven't found any huge bugs, except for the occasional stuck animal, and the physics in this game are very strange, but hey it's a Lego game. My only complaint is that it didn't come out earlier. I can't wait to see what they add in the months to come, and fingers crossed for multiplayer and mod support.","June 1, 2015","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The concept is exactly what any kid who owned a lego set would've dreamed of. A completely destructible world with  infinit things to create and discover. Given that the game is in early access it has it's flaws.  Specifically, there are some world holes and some occasional glitches. There also seems to be a small lack of physics in cars. aside from all of that, The content in this game is extensive and paying for it at the  reduced price now will pay off once the game hits full release","June 2, 2015","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I have had this game since the early access was released.So much content has been added and updated. When i was young i loved lego it was my life. This game takes my life of Lego to a whole new level, i have seen issues about  Minecraft vs Lego Worlds. I think there is no competition. These games have similarities but there are many differences between these games. They are both extremeley good games.\nIm gonna name some content that i think are most important and needed things that this community wants to see in this game. More bricks, There are thousands of bricks in the real worlds and what lacks right now in this game are bricks. Everyone wants to build wonderful creations but they cant. I mean at least have a window that is see through glass not just windows that open and close. More content, this is probably an idea yu developers are already working. Just keep adding more content like more animals and discoveries and maybe add a thing where you into space and maybe onto the moon :) One last thing that the community desperately want. Online multyplayer. Everyone wants online multiplayer in this game. I can tell making a multiplayer thing in a Lego World (haha puns) will b challenging but you developers can do it.\nI truly believe this game has potential to become one of the biggest games ever made.

My first build was a small tent, exploration wise the game has you exploring different biomes as well as meeting characters which you can morph in to and customize on the way.

I'm not going to waste a lot of time on this review while the game is still in Early Access (gotta get back to playing!), but just a few things to note:\n\n1) It's as good as you're hoping.\n2) Building is not markedly slower than building with actual LEGOs -- speedwise it blows Landmark away but is no match for Minecraft.\n3) You can ride flying dragons that breathe explosive fireballs.  This is my happy dance.\n4) The stud-collection-and-spending mechanic for unlocking new minifigs (and their parts), vehicles, animals, and props is a brilliant way to create in-game player objectives that are in-line with the core gameplay and do not feel arbitrary or unnecessary.\n\nMy only complaints are these:\n\n1) It'd be great to have some kind of map so I can find my way back to builds after exploring.  I want to do both freely!\n2) The block menu (for building) needs better contrast -- white is the only color on which I can tell blocks from each other reliably.\n3) The tool buttons (for building and inventory) don't "activate" visibly enough, so it's hard to tell from the menu what brush you're currently using or which weapon you have equipped.\n4) The 'copy blocks' function seems to be broken for now, which makes building large structures a little daunting.\n\nReally minor stuff that I'm sure will be resolved in the coming months.  All in all, this games reminds me of Minecraft in beta, before Mojang started tacking on irrelevant bells and whistles instead of improving the core building and exploration gameplay.  I hope TTGames does not make the same mistake with LEGO Worlds!\n\n","June 21, 2015","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When i take out headphones from my socket of my computer, the game either will not change to the other sound source or will crash entirely. it's mostly the crashing. Alt tabbing does it too.\n\n2. Climbing on roofs like monkey bars needs to be updated. most of the time, if you climb on them for a while, you can go through the roof and teleport to the highest part of the area. This kills going through a cave, and then getting teleported where you don't want to be. Changing the controls while doing it dosen't help either.\n\n3.

This game brings back so many memories of all the Lego games that I've played throughout my life, and I'm proud to say that this one by far is the best. It stands out from the rest of the Lego games for the simple fact that well... you can build and do just about anything in this game, just like playing with real legos! This game is addicting and I absolutely LOVE playing it because there are so many places to explore, things to build, stuff to discover, and money waiting for you to buy all the stuff you've discovered. Seriously if you're a Lego fan and have played Lego games before, pick this up on a sale, and say goodbye to Minecraft, forever. What are you waiting for? Just buy it already!","January 1","true","12.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

A journey that will be worth the price. Being a early accsess game, the lack of structures and anything to fill the lego world except for ruins is excusable. The enemies are easy to defeat and they all act the same. I hope they will fix that in the future. The world is however beautiful in its lego brick glory. With many charachters, vehicles and buildings to build, this game has a lot going. But some things i hope will be fixed in the future.\n\n\n-The combat system.

Most animals are ridable, not just the horses. So yeeha, I rode a polar bear, and a goat (one of my favourites). I won't spoil it for you by saying the "best" one. Another yeeha was seeing the cowboys jumping on & off horses (neat), and then jumping on a polar bear due to meandering from the neighbouring biome. And some of the vehicles are yeeha. After a few neat vehicles I found the helicopter...oh yes, I am a lego playboy...\n\nThe main downside is it's still pretty limited at this stage. In a couple of hours play I have explored most of the biomes, unlocked most of the vehicles and items, so there's not necessarily any motive to play on.\n\nOn a personal note, it's very similar to an old design i did for a game (pre-Minecraft), and it reveals some of the issues with my own design. With an open ended game, you need goals, something to aim for.\n\nSo far, collectign them all and exploring was my goal, but that's complete. So what next?\n\nBuild a castle perhaps? Ah, I can click on the pre-made one and dump it in. Hmm, ok.\n\nWhat about a defensive structure? Well, the game does have threats, but nothing like the terror of minecraft (death in lego means a respawn in the same location having lost nothing), so that goal is moot.\n\nIt needs more layers baby, more layers...\n\nUPDATE: First play it engaged me for a few hours, second play for an hour.\n\nThe game is definitely missing the "living world" element of minecraft (where collecting & planting things & watching them grow played a part of the game). Add to that the fact that some vehicles allow you to deform terrain, but terrain deformation is also a free tool. I think the designers need to pick which elements are in sandbox, and which are in survival (or real) mode.\n\nHas potential, but so do a lot of things in early access. Depends how the expand from here.","June 8, 2015","true","5.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Clearly it's LEGO's version of Minecraft but with a focus more upon the sandbox aspect as opposed to the survival. There's a lot of people that can find enjoyment or interest in the game and I see where it comes from; however there's still a lot left to be desired.\nIt's easy to get most of the rewards for exploration, and the building system is very clunky at times. I have good faith in the developers behind that in fixing most of the current issues and adding even more content to an already good looking game.\n\nOne feature I hope that they add is the ability to create vehicles and interactable objects. At the moment it's just House Building Simulator 2015 with only a small selection of basic bricks. People want to have dogfights in customized planes and duel with their friends in mechsuits, but at the moment its just wishful thinking.\n\nLEGO has tried their hand at Minecraft, but many of the key traits that made Minecraft so appealing for so many people are currently missing. With Minecraft's mixture of survival and sandbox, a wide audience could find their place in the game. With LEGO Worlds, since most of the game is just building, LEGO has thinned out that audience quite a bit. My suggestion is that LEGO fleshes out the sandbox and focus on that independently (Which is, from the looks of it, what they already seem to be doing).\n\nAs it is an Early Access title (and a mighty good one at that!) there is a list of promised features which will make the game much more appealing over time. Good luck to the developers at TT Games and Warner Brothers, I believe this game can make it very far.","June 8, 2015","true","1.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Don't expect Minecraft.\n\nWith that out of the way, Lego Worlds is by far the closest to capturing the creative spirit of Lego that any of the games have come since the old 'Lego Creator' games. The idea is you are given a huge canvas of procedurally generated world, and you have the ability to create and play with whatever the hell you want. It's an enticing concept, and a hell of a lot cheaper than doing that with actual Lego.\n\nThe game is quaint, fun, and I'm sure to be playing more. That being said, no Early Access games are without kinks, technical and conceptual, and this one is no exception.\n\n- Performance can be an issue with the Terrain Quality, as it is made up of all sorts of different pieces (not just squares like in Minecraft or clone games' worlds).\n\n- Controls are counter intuitive while building, and scrolling through piece selection often zooms the camera in and out which can be a thorn in the side of those who are working on a precise piece movement.\n\n- The seed generator is quite finnicky, and will spit a lot of worlds at you where all the interesting landscapes are leagues underwater and you'll have a couple of spits of land.\n\n+ The game has a LOT of content straight out the box, and even contains full replicas of existing Lego Sets that can be modified at will.\n\n+ You can paint the floor in lava.\n\n+ You have to work for the cooler pieces, lending to a sense of progression. This might be a downside for some.\n\n+ The landscapes can be surprisingly beautiful\n\nI definitely think for what it is, $15 is a quite humble asking price for an Early Access title that has this much promise. Hopefully multiplayer will come soon, as I believe this will be the real killer feature of this game.","June 1, 2015","true","8.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

(but that was due to my computer having a poor graphics card, so now, having a new good one, the game works amazengly smooth, excluding the sudden crashes). does anyone else experienced this too?\nAll in all, you can't go wrong with lego. i love all their video games, and they are one of the few things that anyone, in any age, can have fun with, and enjoy.\nLooking forward to future updates. can't wait!\np.s - this is my first ever review on steam! :)","June 12, 2015","true","6.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","3"

Exploring the large worlds and discovering different plants, animals, and terrain is really fun!  It becomes even more fun when you find vehicles to drive, airplanes to fly, or animals to ride. The graphics look pretty good and the controls feel pretty good as well.  I think a controller may be the best way to play this game.  I did find the menus a little difficult to navigate. Being able to zoom the view out a bit would be nice as well. I am enjoying this game a lot and I am looking forward to multiplayer being added. That will create whole new level of fun!

Finding all the biomes, meeting all the npcs and creatures, and unlocking all the objects, vehicles, and little props is a fun process, and the payoff of having everything at hand when you begin to build is really satisfying.\n\nI think my favorite part is the fact that you can import builds from other players pretty quickly and painlessly, and you can use the official Lego Digital Designer program in conjunction with Lego Worlds to build things, and then import into the game. This is a game that screams for an active cooperative community who like to build and share with one another. As far as I can tell, that's what the developers are aiming for, too.\n\nThe initial buzz of a year ago had quickly died down to barely a low hum, and it just seems like most people are waiting for this to get to a full release with online multiplayer. That's fair enough, but in its current state, the game already offers a lot of play value. If Lego Worlds can succeed at growing an active user base that is willing to share creations -- along with establishing a hub where people can go to do their sharing -- I think this game can become something great. It would be awesome for that sort of community to be cultivated somehow before the game reaches its full release. Right now, it feels like a bit of a hidden gem.","May 21","true","24.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","0"

Even in its current state its a great little sandbox of legos to mess around in for hours. It could also use the ability to build your own cars and aircraft. Or am I just not able to figure this out?\n\nLets just hope they don't patch it for micro transactions later. :/  I could see money being harder to get and special blocks costing a lot.

There are so many different biomes to discover, minifigs to collect and objects to obtain. You'll never get bored! Just when you think you've found everything you possibly can, there's always more around the corner. The crafting system is flawed, but not completely broken and I have managed to build a few decent structures. I realise that the game is far from finished and hopefully many more amazing updates are to come.

There are so many different biomes to discover, minifigs to collect and objects to obtain. You'll never get bored! Just when you think you've found everything you possibly can, there's always more around the corner. The crafting system is flawed, but not completely broken and I have managed to build a few decent structures. I realise that the game is far from finished and hopefully many more amazing updates are to come.

A rating of 'Nintendo Grade'\n\nTake it as you will. Ignoring the company and their recent actions. What Nintendo Grade means to me is a game that takes gameplay over gimics, quality over a fast sell, and above all the true feeling that the development team puts their heart and soul in the creation.\n\nThough the game at it's current state needs work, alot more added, and needs overlooks on features. I have no doubt this will be a great game upon it's full release.\n__\nThe game in current state has very little. It's basicly just a builder with afew vehicles, animals (all ride-able), and characters. You can explore the land to find these, along with various props. World size is vast but with very little land features. I've dug deep and have found no cave, chasm, or other reasons to dig for exploration. The water will be updated later for an actual water system. For now it is a blue-clear brick mass you can swim in and drive boats on. That's the extent of it. You can also use digger or other brick removers to cut wholes that persist, in the "water".\n\nFor building you have three options:\n\n"Terrain Edit" Has your standard tools, raise/lower, level, smooth, add/remove. By using this you can build large areas fast; While letting the game figure out what brick goes where. Currently no way to change the area sizes.\n\n"Brick by Brick" This is where I feel they need to re-evaluate this system. At it's current build it feels like a block builder with Lego themed blocks. What I mean by this it does not limit the way you connect bricks together. With other software like Lego Digital Designer it doesn't not allow connections to be made if a peg isn't being place under a slot. For Lego Worlds you can place a brick by any side, not the peg to slot only. Which I think is needed to be true Lego. In this mode they have a feature I love "Overlap" with this you can overlap peices. However, it doesn't really overlap! It actually does a boolean difference, in a rather smart way. It cuts the shape of the brick you overlapped out of the brick(s) pushed it into. Then replaces the brick(s) with new bricks that can take the new shape. This feature can be used to get the shape of the doorway you wanted. A beautiful feature I didn't expect and now can't live without.\n\n"Prop Placement" Simple enough. Take pre-built structures, props like bushes, tables, or doors, and then place them in the world fast and easy. You can even select and save structures you have created. Even with the Lego Digital Designer mentioned earlier, you can export and import the LDD files use from there. All to make fast creation of your structures.\n_\n\nPeople who have commented, ask for material bricks. Example, bown is dirt or grey is stone. This to me is a bad idea, as it limits what the bricks can be used for. It limits what the imagination can use the brick for and Lego is all about imaginative play. So for that reason I hope this doesn't come to be.\n\nThe game is truely at a state that can't be judged however from what I have played and seen. This game won't dispoint Lego fans or just creative builders.","June 11, 2015","true","30.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

While in the past few years LEGO games have been more based on platforming through various movie franchises, LEGO Worlds focuses more on building and exploring while still keeping the fun and memorable aesthetic that has become a staple of the LEGO franchise games intact. Great animation combined with a variety of LEGO bricks makes LEGO Worlds a great base game to start building onto. The current build of the game is very basic; with no real objectives implemented you may struggle to find fun in the current iteration of this game if you do not enjoy exploration and using the LEGO building tool. While I don’t think that this game will be right for everyone in its current state, I recommend anyone interested in the LEGO universe keeping an eye on it as it progresses through the early access stage of development.","July 11, 2015","true","11.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Total Play Time 6 Hours.When Multiplayer Comes Out More Like 600 Hours. I Do Recommend This Game If You Are Maybe In A Skype Call Or Talking To Someone Cause it Is kinda Boring Enless You Are Talking To Someone Or Even Better When You Are Playing It Side By Side. 7/10 Without Multiplayer 10/10 With Multiplayer I Recommend This Game For People With Friends.Sorry Loners Not A Game For You.","August 4, 2015","true","3.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
