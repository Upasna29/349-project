"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/recommended/417750/","AestheticGamer","AestheticGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/","3606 products in account","Left Alone is a first-person psychological horror-puzzle game about a man named Joel who was left by his family while in a coma, and has found himself in a miserable life where his only real companions are two friends he made while he was at war (where he earned a medal of honor). He's an ex-soldier now, and with his only real friends returning from their overseas stay, the three of them agree to go camping and fishing to reunite, relax, and share stories. However, things go south when his two friends arrive there before him and get trapped in a nearby abandoned school...\n\nThis game was much better than I anticipated it to be. To be honest it doesn't give the best first impression, and there's roughness about the title (some objects and models you can clip and walk right through being the biggest thing), but this game nails what it sets out to do.\n\nThis game actually completely unnerved me. I wasn't expecting it to, I am a horror veteran who has played all eras of the genre, and I've gotten harder to scare over time. And it doesn't accomplish this with jump scares or cheap tactics, it has some excellent sound design and slowly builds up a really thick atmosphere and creepy antagonist. You read about the people before you, and small things happen as you explore. It got to the point where I started feeling incredibly paranoid, and I admit I got completely spooked for a good 10 minutes. Rare for me, and worth bringing up.\n\nWhich also highlights the game's excellent sound design and slow burn elements. Sound brings a lot to horror, and they nailed it here. The music is appropriately spooky, as are the sounds, and most fit with the scenes so well I hardly noticed them, and yet they succeeded in unnerving me. Really helped the immersion factor, and knew when to go quiet too.\n\nAnd this is to be said; the game is a bit slow. It builds up its scenario, you spend some time exploring rooms. And the game has puzzles, some relatively challenging ones at that. There were a couple points I was stuck at a puzzle for 10-15 minutes before eventually solving it; none are really too hard once you figure them out, but many give you cryptic or little information you need to piece together to figure out the solution.\n\nWith all of this comes a rather nice story, though I will admit while the ending wasn't bad I kind of wished they would of explored it more.\n\nThere's not a whole lot more for me to say on the game. It's a fantastic psychological atmosphere piece with some great mood, cryptic puzzles, and builds itself up nicely. If that sounds up your alley, I'd recommend it.","April 29","true","3.2"," 92 of 98 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","92","98","2","0"

You will quickly learn that nothing is a threat. Nothing is chasing you. The scares are sometimes clever and unique, but they really don't scare you. Sorry, but when I'm bored walking around, it's nearly impossible to scare me.\n-Invisible walls everywhere. How about just making a wall or something blocking instead of all these invisible walls.\n-Graphical glitches. This applies to the trees where white stuff is on the edge of the trees. Also when you turn on the flashlight, it lights up the trees without touching them.\n-It has a broken interaction system. You can search specific items, but it's so unclear what those items is. The only indicator you have that you can search an item is that your crosshair turns red and becomes a little bigger. The problem is that it doesn't seem to work half the time. Sometimes the crosshair likes to stay red for a short period so you don't know what you can interact with. When you have searched something all it does is play a sound and write some text in the bottom saying what you have found. There's no visual indicator to what you have searched so you end up searching the same item again and again. You also don't have any inventory\n-It's all about walking back and forth. Nearly all I did was walk through the same hallway, the same pathway, the same doors. The area is actually not that big.\n-Horrible draw distance.\n-Bad UI. Default Unity UI, really? Talking about a way to make your game look very unprofessional.\n-Its about two hours long. That is if you don't know anything. Alot of times the game decides to lock you in or keep you from moving or basically make you wait in the same room for two minutes until it decides that you can progress.\n\n\nI was greatly disappointed by Left Alone. I had hoped so much from this game. I didn't expect it to be so liniar. I didn't expect it to even cost anything.\nThe big problem is that it's very boring. Its pretty and detailed, but the world feels so static. You can't really interact with it. As i said, most of what you do is backtracking and that becomes pretty tiresome after a while. It's not scary, because there's no threat. The story is forgettable.\nI was really expecting something much better than this. Now I'm really sad.","April 30","false","4.6"," 94 of 136 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","94","136","4","13"

We took it in turns to play the game which to start surprised me with it’s decent graphics.\nAs I say, we’re not big on horrors so we were suitably spooked for the few hours we played, really enjoyed the game. (Especially the sounds, because we had the surround on) and thankfully three minds are better than one when trying to figure out some puzzles. I’m not sure I would have managed it myself.\n\nOverall we liked the notes and information you find throughout the areas, giving little tid bits of story.

The scary and amazing atmosphere is more or less entirely build on sound and music, respectively on light and darkness. Diversified levels, clever puzzles and visually the game had moments of being interesting and spooky; no monsters/enemies, no hide and seek... ;-) The only downside is the save game feature. It can take a long time until the game saves your progress. Besides that, worth every single $/€!

The game is a quick, 3 hr psychological thriller.  Perfect for a single night sitting.  The puzzles can be a little tricky, but not hard enough that a walkthrough needs to be consulted.  I love an opportunity to support indie developers, and this game did not let me down.  I played this with my girlfriend, and we were thoroughly spooked.  The only negative is that the ending is a little weak, but this is a common mallady within the horror genre.

Including Alien Isolation for that matter. Of course it isn't fair to compare an indie title to a AAA company but I felt credit is due in that regard.\nSome of the puzzles are challenging at least if you are a spoon like me.\n\nWith all things horror your milage my vary, but I'm certainly enjoying my playthrough so far.\n\nThe only thing this game really is lacking is Ronnie Coleman. The most horrific thing to me was seeing the gym and no weights. Who knows maybe its Ronnie stalking the school and he has stolen all the weights. Or maybe its the vengeful spirit of Kai Greene out to get revenge on the Mr Olympia judges.\n\nAt least I'm glad I don't have friends to go camping with.\nSeriously though it might be an indie game but if you can get over that you will have a good time.","April 29","true","1.8"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","22","26","5","0"

The puzzles are fun, not too difficult (I did have to look up the answer to one, but the rest were doable on my own without feeling too easy) and it builds a great atmosphere through well-done sounds and some mild (but very well done) jump scares, including a very fun one that I thought was especially clever.\n\nThe game also had a few funny, self-aware moments that I appreciated.\n\nThe story is actually quite engrossing, and the horrors that await you are a bit disturbing. Unfortunately, the "twist" ending (which I won't spoil outright, but stop here if you want to go in completely blind) was a bit disappointing and I thought it could have been done better. I actually was able to guess the ending before I finished, but I'm sure some might be surprised by it. However it does feel like a cheap, "fake out" that makes the adventure feel a bit "useless" if you will. In a way, it feels like an insult to the player who wanted answers to the story. Answers which it mostly provided, but it still feels cheap.\n\nOverall though, for the price this is one of the best horror experiences I've had the pleasure of playing. It's nothing ground-breaking or particularly unique, but it does everything mostly right and is a fun way to spend a late night. The story lasts about 2-3 hours.\n\nGreat job to the devs, and I look forward to any new releases.","May 2","true","2.6"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

But this game really caught my eye I have been awaiting for the release a fair while now, and I have to admit, it was most definitely worth the wait!\n\nI'm not one that scares easily to horror games, but I do say, this one got me on so many occasions. I thought I'd wait to play this when it got dark (as you do) and I started out with the volume on full blast, but slowly as the game went on, the volume level dropped a little as my nerves got the better of me (I couldn't hack it). This really was creeping me out and sending chills through my whole body, exactly what a modern horror game should do!\n\nFrom the minute I began, I noticed the visuals/graphics were crisp and extremely well detailed and this persisted throughout the playthrough. This was also followed by stunning sound effects and music which were clear and fit the tone of the game perfectly. There really isn't anything to fault regarding the sound and visual, bang on!\n\nI liked the element of riddles and puzzles in which I came across (even though I found some of them really challenging) and took me a while to get my head around. I was almost ready to give up when trying to figure out the sequence of the levers near the start until suddenly I figured it out and began slapping myself because I had been sat there for 20 minutes mashing the levers like an idiot. If you haven't played this game yet, don't give up on the levers, you will work it out!\n\nI have been reading some reviews before this, and I have seen some negative ones regarding the price and stating it should be free. But really, is anything free these days? It's £4.99, that isn't exactly bank breaking? Most people are happy to pay more than that for a drink/entry into a bar or club.\n\nOverall, I really did enjoy this game, you can tell the 2 developers behind this have put 110% in. It also did exactly what it was set out to do, scare the s*** out of me! Really looking forward to what may come of Volumetric in the future, and if there may be a sequel to Left Alone in their locker!\n\n","April 30","true","5.5"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","1"

Some blending would help here to make it look more realistic.\nA little bit more work on the detail would also help in wood area, apart from a few school busses and logs outlining the path there isn’t much else that stands out.\nThe second part of the game takes place in a school building and to me this is where the game starts to get interesting as you try and find your friends.\nThe school is filled with quite a few puzzles which I enjoyed solving, although one puzzle had me stumped in which I had to get a code for a door. The puzzle included computer screens with shapes on them which had something to do with the code and I could not for the life of me figure it out so had to watch how it was solved by watching a YouTube video. Maybe this puzzle was simple and I was too dumb to see the answer but I felt like this particular puzzle needed more hints to figure out what to do.\nThe final part of the game you find yourself in a brightly lit corridor after taking a lift down too it. The corridor had many doors but only one of them opened.\nIt was at this point I felt the ending was a little rushed as it did not take long in this area.\nI really hope the devs will do a little more with the final area, maybe even open a few more doors in this corridor to extend the story a little and maybe include a couple of final puzzles.\n\nPros\nNice environment\nNice detail\nRuns smooth\nRuns smooth\n\nCons\nFog needs improvement, looks like unrealistic balls of smoke floating (Looks tiled Needs blending)\nMouse sensitivity a little high and no option to change it (DPI adjustable mouse did not really help either)\nSometimes you have to wait in locked rooms to progress (Can become confusing to the player)","May 5","true","4.5"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

It has a deep and well thought out story line which all seems to come together as you reach the end, I love the fact you can explore as much as you can as some games have such limited access to further parts/rooms and just tease you. The puzzles were really good, took some figuring out but its nice they weren't too easy, my advice to you is to stick at it and explore all options, its rewarding once you figure it out on your own. As for the horror side, some parts were extremely scary, i found it impossible to play with headphones as that really ♥♥♥♥ me up, and I played with the lights on the whole time haha.

A few unfortunate glitches impeded my progress and made forward movement impossible until I figure out what the game might have been perceiving that I was doing wrong.  The game also glitched again towards the end leaving me to start the final section yet another time and said section is woefully poor on save point points.  Still, by the hair of its chinny chinny chin I recommend Left Alone for diehard Steam horror enthusiasts that are looking for something new to play and are following the wise advice of avoiding Kidnapped and other unplayable games.\n\nIn Left Alone you play as ex-military man Joel who is on the way to meeting up with his old buddies (army) for a camping/fishing trip out in the middle of nowhere.  Things start peacefully enough as you gather wood and rocks to make a firepit, but once you pour on the oil and light the matches, suddenly things go terribly wrong.  You come to with the camp destroyed, lost in the middle of the woods and with no contact with your friends except for several text messages.  You have no choice but to set off into the woods and try to find your friends or even better yet, civilization.  That's the basic premise for Left Alone.\n\nYou can run, jump, use a flashlight and carry inventory items as you begin exploring the forest.  Use the flashlight sparingly because unlike other games of this ilk it WILL run out of battery power pretty fast which makes running around in literal pitch black darkness a chore because you literally can't see pretty much anything unless a rare lightpost or electrical station is around.  You'll eventually come to abandon school which seems to be the root of all evil as you uncover documents, cellphones and other pieces of those who didn't make it home.\n\nThe atmosphere is tense with the graphics getting the job done nicely.  You'll be frequently creeped out even if your mission involves the usual; find keys, unlock doors, open special doors with keycards, figure out which item goes where, power up dormant electronical systems, etc.  All of the task work is handled well enough and you always feel like something is breathing down your back.  SPOILER:  In some ways it was refreshing but in other ways it diminished intensity, but there are little threats in your path.  You can die in a few rare instances but they'll be at the hands of your environment rather than some vicious ugly wielding a pickaxe.  This take on tension will have you constantly jumping at the unknown at first but you'll soon become used to the fact that most of the scares are from your own imagination.  In this sense, Left Alone is like a good 50s horror flick where the unseen is just as scary as the seen.\n\nAtmospheric sounds with very minimal use of musical scores further the tension and the games controls are tight enough  to keep you in the fight.  Left Alone isn't without its problems though...\n\nYou'll get stuck on your environments from time to time and alot of forwarding the action relies on triggering events that spark your stalker's interest (you are not alone after all).  Sometimes this progression of events can become broken, since Left Alone avoids hand-holding and you can complete your objectives in whatever order you happen upon them for the most part, as long as you have the right items or keys that is.  The game also froze completely towards the end when I was about to finish it, leaving me to start a rather lengthy running section over again for the umpteenth time as there is no save point that I can find beyond the final run.  These quirks and glitches do hurt the score a bit and showcase a fun game that could have seriously used more polish on the cutting room floor.  Still, I had fun with Left Alone, so here's my basic overview of what's good and bad about the game for those that don't feel like reading an entire review.\n\nPros:\n\n-Eerie setting with terrific ambient sounds and graphics\n-Solid controls\n-No hand holding allows you to solve puzzles at your own pace\n-Creepy environments that only get creepier as you progress\n-50s type horror atmosphere focuses on what you can't see rather than what you can.\n-Interesting story.\n\nCons:\n\n-Very few threats or actual dangers.\n-Choppy movement can get you stuck on pieces of the environment.\n-A handful of glitches takes you out of the immersion.\n-Scattered savepoints became especially problematic at the end.\n-Story could use better resolution.\n-An inventory system would be nice to see what you have and what you need.\n-A once and doner.  Once you finish it, there's not much reason to go back.\n\nOverall:  7.5/10\n\nAlthough Left Alone is not without its shortcomings, the dark atmosphere and engaging story will keep you hooked until the end.  Unfortunately, a series of glitches caused me to spend nearly 7 hours on a game I should have been able to beat in around 3 1/2 tops.  The game is fun to progress in and see what horrible twist the story will take next, what creepy area will pop up and whether or not you ever find your friends.  The ending is a bit unclear but thinking back on it I think I understand what happened.  Left Alone is a small gem in the horror genre, hugely imperfect, but plenty entertaining which is considered a noble fate for alot of horror movies, so why shouldn't it be with horror games as well?","May 3","true","7.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

From the initial reveal of the game on Game Jolt right up until its release on Steam, learning whatever I could about it. The reason I took such a fascination with this particular indie title is because of how it stood out from the rest of the pack, as it were. With a plethora of indie developers churning out horror games of varying degrees of quality, Left Alone immediately struck me as a developer trying a fresh take on what is becoming an increasingly tired genre. When the game finally released I jumped straight in. The first thing that struck me as I took control of protagonist Joel Dent was just how good the game looks, especially from an indie developer. The detail that has gone into the environment is astounding. As I progressed further, and the game began to ramp up the tension, as the atmosphere started to become palpable, I felt myself being drawn into this world more and more. Volumetric have done an outstanding job of creating tension within the world, making you apprehensive but intrigued to see what's around the next corner. The puzzles are smart and intricate, they force you to use your brain and give you a real sense of accomplishment when you figure them out. The story is interesting and engaging and pulls you in from beginning to end. While not a particularly long game (it took me around 3 hours to complete) it's easy to tell that the developers have put in a tremendous amount of time and effort to create a superb psychological horror game. There are a couple of rough edges here and there but these are extremely sparse and not particularly noticeable. All in all, if you like well-crafted psychological horror games with great visuals, atmosphere and story then you should absolutely pick up Left Alone. And even if you don't you should still definitely give it a try. 9.5/10","May 1","true","3.3"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

I'd say this game is very good for someone who wants to try the horror genre.\n\nThe story is actually quite well written. I was kind of skeptical in the beggining, thinking it would be very cliche, but as you progress through the game you will find some really creepy stuff and that it is not your every day "I Know What You Did Last Summer" horror story.\nIt is very short, I must have finished it in 3 hrs or so, but that's ok for a game like this.\nThe puzzles are kind of easy, but given the fact that you are most of the time in the dark with that frightful feeling that there is someone following you, they end up becoming harder.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game, though I must talk about some of the things that could be improved:\n- Mouse sensitivity is REALLY high and I couldn't figure a way to fix that;\n- Auto save does take its time. There's moments when you wish you could save and take a break and that's not possible;\n- Some of the sound effects don't really...well, sound like they should.\nBut none of these things should prevent you from buying and enjoying this game!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPrimeiramente eu preciso dizer que não sou muito fã de jogos de terror...sim, eu por que eu sou medroso :P\n\nMas preciso dizer que esse jogo foi muito divertido. Eu diria que é um jogo muito bom para quem quer tentar algo do gênero de terror.\n\nA estória é bem escrita. Eu estava meio cético no início, pensando que seria cliche, mas conforme você progride pelo jogo você vai descobrir umas coisas bem malucas e que o jogo não é qualquer "Eu Sei o que Vocês Fizeram no Verão Passado".\nÉ bem curto, devo ter terminado em umas 3 hrs, mas tudo ok por um jogo assim.\nOs puzzles são meio fáceis, mas devido ao fato de que você está a maior parte do tempo no escuro com uma sensação terrível de que alguém está te seguindo, eles acabam se tornando mais difíceis.\n\nEu recomendaria este jogo, mas preciso falar sobre algumas coisas que penso que poderiam ser melhoradas:\n- A sensibilidade do mouse é MUITO alta e não consegui arrumar;\n- O auto save demora demais. Há momentos em que você gostaria de salvar e fazer uma pausa e isso não é possível;\n- Alguns efeitos sonoros não...bom, parecem com o que deveriam.\nMas nenhuma dessas coisas deveria te prevenir de comprar e aproveitar esse jogo!","May 9","true","3.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

It autosaves sometimes, but not often enough, so if you want to stop playing for the day, you will probably have to do all over again things you already did.\n- There's no inventory. Sometimes, you pick things up, but you don't have the time to realize what it is.\n- Also, I didn't find enough batteries for my flashlight, so I ended up setting the brightness on max.\n\nNow, the positive stuff:\nIt's a really cool horror game that will probably mindf*ck you. Everything start when your friends disappear during a camp. You will try to find them during the whole game, but there's a killer on the loose and your paths cross. I wondered during the whole game if the guy you're playing was psychotic and was dissociating enough not to realize he was actually the killer. (It's not a spoil, just a theory I had.) The atmosphere is creepy and there will be some jumpscares but not that much, you won't see any scary monster, everything is suggested (which is so much better than actually seeing things in my opinion). There are some puzzles to solve that made me feel like tearing my hair out, but nothing too far-fetched.\n\nIn short, really nice psychological horror game. Creepy atmosphere. Nice graphisms. You should definitively try it :)","May 9","true","5.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

I have been asked by the developer to write a review on this game and how I enjoyed it and things I will point out that I think need to be fixed.\n\nPositives-:\n\nSo while playing the game through, looked fantastic and had great scenery! I enjoyed the first 5 minutes of the game. The story really made sense and liked the way the game built up to something. Later in the game we come across an old school with good detail and had a great spooky atmosphere. I enjoyed reading the notes and the writing. I also enjoyed the sounds in the game, thought they were very well made. Overall in the positives, Good game.\n\nNegatives-: (Detailed tips to make the game better)\n\nJust a few negatives, more of tips really than negatives. I found it difficault to run through the puzzles at times. If I didn't look on the internet about the switches, I would have found it difficault to do, if not impossible. I don't know how other people managed to do it but I just coulden't figure it out. Then we have no "objectives". Where the map was torn in half, at first it didn't occur to me that you needed to go back and do that. Maybe put something like "Find out what to do with the torn map" or something like this. The last thing was I thought the school was a little too large but really I don't mind too much.\n\nOverall, great game, atmosphere and nicely made animations. Good job on the game, I feel as if you tried your very best on the game.

The sense of suspense for me was lost in these areas. So far I don't feel any sense of forbodding or dread you normaly have in these sorts of games.\n\nAs for on going battery problem with your torch, I kind of got over it by setting brightness to max and then only using the torch occasionally. Yeah I get the intentions of "endemic poor battery syndrome" which we find in these sorts of games, but it's unrealistic and more annoying than anything else.\n\nI can see what the developer is attempting but they may not realise that there can be a vast gap between what they perceive as playable and what their target audience expects. (re: the update notes referrring to "less observant" players)\n\n++++++++++++++6/6/2016++++++++++++\nI can see what the developer is trying to do. I'm alone, it's a dark forest, my resources are running out, my friends are missing and even the wolves are howling. A classic premise & a character with a backstory. Good start. A little preamble tutorial to introduce the player to the collecting mechanics (rocks and sticks). After the camps site I felt a little lost. Can I suggest a little "self talk" from the main character dropping a few hints to ease the game play style onto the new player. Don't get me wrong, I'm not asking to have my hand held, but sometimes the players thinking isn't in sync with the developer. A glint of light in the distance to suggest something in the woods maybe is also a nifty mechanic. Otherwise I'm begining to enjoy it. Cheers to the developer. I need more time this weekend (including a drink or two) to really get into this.\n\n\n++++++++++++++++ 13/5/2016 ++++++++++++++++\nExcuse my temper last time I played Left Alone......I don't write or .design games so I have no place making rash statements. SO I decided to reserve judgement....\n\n\n++++++++++++++++ My previous temper tantrum +++++++++++++\nOk...I'm only 40 miniutes in and it's getting annoying.

No fov, the mouse sensitivity can only be changed at the main menu. Prompts in game are not reflective of key changes made.\n- puzzles, if you can call them that mostly rely on you walking around often just clicking e (the use button) waiting for something to happen.\n- the above directly combines with triggers often taking a long time to occur, meaning you just are walking around aimlessly. These last two points are the reall issue with the game, an unsetttling atmosphere becomes mundane/boring if you make someone walk around the same environment for an extended period of time with nothing really changing up as you search for what will push the game foward.\n- you get stuck in the same envornments walking back and forth over and over.... and over again.\n- the story, in particular the ending is a disaster. Trully horrible, unengaging and makes what happened seem pointless (though i'm told there are multiple endings based on a fairly obvious choise, so maybe the other ending(s) is/are better.\n- very little content, the game is simply short and if you knew where to go could easily walk through it in 20ish minutes I imagine. The rest of the twoish hours it will take to finish is spent walking back and forth in the same environments as said above waiting for triggers to occur or to find the next thing you need.\n\nIn summary: Left Alone is a cheap game seemingly made by two people that at first intrigued me but ultimately feels to vague to the point my patience was being worn down. It has some moments and with some more compelling and interesting puzzles and more time to perculate we could have had something great.\n\nAs it is it may be worth picking up on a sale even at its already low price for those looking for a horror game. So this isn't entirelya  don't purchase it, but more of a wait untill it's even cheaper as there is a very strong chance it won't be for you.

This game is linear. This game is not challenging or scary in any way. This game shirks decades of basic UI and gameplay development in its genre. Don't buy it.\n\nLeft Alone utilizes what it considers to be a series of puzzles to block progression of an on-rails like linear "horror" experience. When I say puzzles what I mean to say is "Find this keycode, find another keycode, pull these switches in order - repeat."\n\nThe horror experience could be much better. With no fear of death or detriment of any kind the player is left nothing to do but blindly progress, knowing nothing will affect their gameplay negatively. The horror elements, such as audio, are severly misused. The audio itself is never properly positioned, so those looking to "chase" sounds will find nothing ever there except invisible walls. On one occasion a noise is heard from the other side of a bathroom stall, with the player unable to open the stall. When the curious player attempts to jump/climb the stall, you find it's entirely empty despite the noise, much as there is never anything where noises are coming from. Sometimes the "scary" noises are even directly positioned as coming from your head or feet if you're using surround sound, making it impossible to believe that something somewhere in the game is making a noise and worth being fearful of. The environments are fine (if non-interactable), but utilized so poorly as to ruin any sense of immersion necessary to actually scare ones self.\n\nThe ending is... horrid. Unresolving. It's just the end. You might as well just quit at any point in the game, as you'll experience approximately the same level of resolution. Or you could skip all that and just not buy it.\n\nMy message to the developers would be: This is a great demo, you could take it to E3! Have you ever considered making a game out of it?\n\nIf this game was free or part of a humble bundle more would be excusable, but as an actual game it simply doesn't pass muster.","April 29","false","3.1"," 26 of 53 people (49%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","49","26","53","3","4"

A tiny bit cliche also. The intro is just a wall of text; I wish it could have been voiced, or at least played out like the moving text after the control screen that follows the introduction.\n\nThere is a small typo in the word "none," it reads: "Non" in the game (after the control screen).\n\nMouse sensitivity is off the charts TOO FAST. I have it on the lowest default setting, and the movement is widly fast. I can not force myself to play like this (hence the quick in-progress initial review). Also, itseems as if the mouse slider doesn't save? Just for fun, I wanted to see what it would be like to RAISE it, started a new game, and just as before ... it was way too fast. I quit, checked options, and the slider was reset to default.\n\nThe graphics (the few minutes I could stomache the crazy fast mouse movement) are VERY nice (especially for a game that only costs $7.00). Sound is also good.\n\nHowever ...\n\nWhat is the point of giving us generic graphics options like low, medium, high? Without letting us change individual things like bloom, HDR, AO, and AA? When playing the game, pausing and checking graphics options (in-game as I mentioned), there seems to be words like "Pixel count: 7, AA: 0" etc etc .. but no option to change that ourselves. And seems to be like AA is automatically turned off with no option to turn it on ourselves.\n\nStill, for $7:00 (the cost of a mcdonalds meal pretty much) and if you feel like changing the DPI (not a big deal at all, but we shouldnt have to do this) of your mouse yourselves, I would recommend the game if you're just a graphics and sound fiend.\n\nHopefully these few nitpicks are fixed, and I can attempt to continue the game : ) Will update review if possible when I can~","April 28","true","0.4"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","48","12","25","4","0"

It starts off wonderful, by giving you direction into what you are supposed to do, but immediately after the introduction it drops you into a world with NO context as to how you are supposed to go about tackling the various road blocks.\n\nI say road blocks because that is exactly what they are. They aren't puzzles. A puzzle is something that you have all the information to, and only have yourself to blame for not being able to figure it out. This games idea of a puzzle is saying "do this thing" and givng you NO context as to where the information to solve it is, leaving you wandering around for god knows how long to try and GUESS your way to victory.\n\n20 minutes in I wasn't scared of anything, I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off.

Still leaving the original, because I really was ready to walk away from this due to the beginning being so very, very bad. It takes <5 minutes if you know what you're doing, so I recommend finding a playthrough of the entire outside bit and watching it first since I don't know of any "skip right to the school" cheat codes.\n\nThe controls are super glitchy. This is ok - if I can get past it, any gamer can. It might make you want to put the game down, but perservere, it really does become unnoticeable.\n\nThe story makes no sense. I literally can't tell you what this game is about. The writing is not good, and so the whole "is it real or not" thing is kind of buried under a layer of "is this an unreliable narrator is just poorly written?" I don't care about the character or his friends, and was picking things to hasten the sweet relief of death. I don't think you can be killed in game, though, just knocked out and returned to your last save point, which means going through the nonsense repeated times, so I guess that did motivate me to try to survive.\n\nNone of the puzzles is hard; the thing that took the longest was figuring out I'd just missed pressing a button or returning to a location when I was running around looking for another puzzle I thought I must have missed. I'm guessing the game would be less than an hour if you had a walkthrough. (Don't use a walkthrough; that would remove all fun from the game. There's just not a lot of substance, is all I'm saying.)\n\nAll that said, the sound in this game is really excellent, and the thing that kept me for asking for a refund. It's so good, seriously, the game would have been a thousand times better if they'd skipped the notes and just told the story through the spooky sound events. There were a few moments of yelling "no, no thank you, please go away!" and that was all down to the sound. Well done, sound person.\n\nAnd so then up until the end I was going to write a moderately positive "well, it's not good but you can get $5 of entertainment out of it so go ahead and go for it if creepy is your thing" but then the ending happened, so I take it back. If you REALLY need a scare, it will deliver in a couple places, but I'm not sure it's worth playing through the whole thing just for those.\n\nOriginal review:\n----\nWell, ok... the word is that the game gets good once you get into the school, but after an hour of really tedious walking around the woods I couldn't be bothered. Found a YouTube walkthrough and apparently I missed the button that's not near any of the other buttons and... nah. Already lost interest, I can't think of anything that might be through the gate that's worth sitting through the loading screen again.","April 30","false","4.7"," 7 of 23 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","7","23","0","0"

You want to know the Truth!?!?! You can't HANDLE the TRUTH! WHere to begin, thsi game overall if doing a speed run can basically be completed in less than 1 hour. There is no inventory only what you immediately have stored to be used at it's POO, or Point Of Origin. But POO sounded apropriate. The childlike developer cleverly set up what is commonly known as "SAVE POINTS" which is a sad, so so very sad attempt to make it seem like this game is longer. It's what unskilled developers to in order to create a "cash cow" source of income. (eg: You paying for this Poo) There is very little to none interactions with the "So-Called-Buddy" that texted you to begin with to even get you to come out to the camps location that quickly turns into a boarding School. Funny how that worked. What I say by Funny is what I mean by Sad or disappointing. Pricing: No , the $6.99 is if at all based on the TRUTH I just said is definately not worth it. That said, the positive aspects of this game are as follows:\n\nEnvironment:\nIt has a nice look to it that clearly has potential if expanded on.\n\nAmbience:\nSound and lighting are ok and has a good chance at scaring you. The potential of truly making your hair stand up on the back of your neck is there, albeit if the developer seeked out professional assistance to give this game an AWESOME or should I say GRUESOME and certainly advance Update.\n\nVisual/Art:\nYes there is some nice art in this game and to be honest is was almost as if the developer intended it to go to waste. You'll find nice drawing or paintings on the ground occasionally and really need to look as if "easter egg hunting"\n\nMap:\nThis one is tuff as I wanted to keep it seperate from the Environment section. The overall map is very, very good considering if this game was an "Early Access" game leaving what I would consider 75 % more room to add on to the story as in how you arrived, and why a secluded camp ground in the middle of no where is so very close to a Boarding School. For one in real life due to pedo's perverts and junkies this would have no basis in reality and would quickly be fenced off. However the potential is there expanding on that, the lake for fishing and a few cabins which can be not related to the Boarding School would make it great.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nOnce and if at all the original developer decides to follow up and expand on this game it has the potential of a $20.00 game. This game should be considered an early access and at best a "DEMO" of the real game and if any more experience developers are seeing this you may consider approaching the original developer for rights on expanding, adding in fun factors, scare potential, and Achievements to corrospond to each stage of events. As once you play you may off hand notice as small as this game is, I would have liked an Achievement for at least 5 events that took place. True controller for full control support is very simple and easy so those with Xbox 360 to PC can enjoy this game using Big Screen HDTV Steam options, spooky and eerie music and sound should be up'd a knotch and most certainly save on the fly feature is an absolute.\n\nBuyer Beware.\n\n\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/417750/discussions/0/357285398700444840/","May 5","false","6.3"," 4 of 19 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","4","19","0","3"
