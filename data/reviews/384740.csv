Right now, there's not much to it. It's basically a tech demo, but is fun to explore and look around.  For 3 bucks, you will prob get your money worth. Just don't go in expecting a game. The only game aspects is a couple instances where you are asked to go get this or that.\n\nAs I said at the start, the graphics are gorgeous, and while I normally hate filters, the filters in the game make it look really nice. It does a nice job making you feel like a robot...or at the very least at the controls of a robot.\n\nI wasn't a fan of the voice acting...Actually, that's a lie. The voice acting was tolerable, it was the scripting I had an issue with. hearing an android use words like "Awesome" just didn't feel right to me. Though the actors themselves could pass as androids.\n\nMy main concern is, like I said: The game is nowhere near completion, and in fact probably shouldn't even be released into early access yet. It has a long way to go before it's considered anything more than a demo. Anything can happen between now and then.\n\nHowever, I love what I see. If the game continues on the same track, this will most likely become one of my favorite games.\n\nWould I recommend it to you? If you understand the concept of Early Access, and you realize that the game as it stands right now is FAR from complete....then YES, I would recommend it to you. For 3 bucks? How could I not!?","November 9, 2015","true","2.8"," 56 of 61 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","56","61","2","3"

This is a promising game, the physics seem to work well, as far as I can tell there aren't any glitches with collision detection or anything, but so far there is nothing of substance.

Price point is not a factor for my reviews so should mention that as well since many will look at the fact currently it is quite cheap.\n\nTL;DR Version If even a tad more of the story was included at launch or at least one interesting mission included at the beginning I may of swayed to the recommended side. Once more story is in then I may change my review to that.\n\nLonger Version\nI do like the concept of the game and the terrain looks great but that is where it currently stops for me until more is added. I beat the game in 26 minutes and this includes doing the story, exploring, and throwing some random boxes around for fun.\n\nYou play as the "dog" which you can move, boost, jump, and grab objects although it looks rather plain in my opinion. You start off with being told a bit of the backstory of what is going on, I then was instructed to proceed outside to the next objective. At this objective I was instructed to find 3 boxes and move them to the skylift. After I completed that task I was told to go to the mine, an unforunate accident occurs there and that is the end of the game...currently.\n\nThis game will be story driven which is why at the moment I cannot recommend it, there just wasn't enough of the interesting bits added in for the launch which I wish I could of seen. Anything other than moving boxes could of been a better objective to start off with before further story is added on later that way I could of felt a bit more invested in the story before waiting for the rest to be put in. So basically to me, for a story driven game not enough of the story was available from the start.\n\nThe game itself runs quite well, no bugs or crashes from my playthrough at least. Option of VR or Play right off the bat in the menu which is great for those who want that.\n\nI hope to see in the future a bit more added to the surface as it already looks quite good in my opinion but could do with a tad more added to it, and will await for the rest of the story. When a bit more of that is added in I will update my review to reflect that. I wish the developers the best of luck and hope to see the story evolve into something I will enjoy.","August 28, 2015","false","3.0"," 53 of 75 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","53","75","0","9"

When playing the game we notice the UE4 engine in action, which is a satisfaction the human eye. Not only does the game looks stunning and runs smoothly, but also have a interesting storyline to be a assistance as the "DOG, either with keyboard or controller.

I don't think there are enough games that really scratch that particular sci-fi itch, so CAT Interstellar earns itself a gold star right there.\n\nThen I have to take away the gold star because both times I've tried to start the game up, I had to try maybe four times before it actually worked. I don't know if that's the game's fault, or my computer's, but I'm not having that problem with other games. Similarly I don't see any reviews here saying it's difficult to start up. So that's neither a positive or a negative comment, it's just something that happened to me.\n\nMy first and immediate thought is that I don't understand the title. The game is called CAT Interstellar, but you play a DOG module. That was a constant thought in my mind while playing the game. Is it a pun? What's happening? What does CAT Interstellar mean? "Construction And Terraforming?" That'd be pretty cool - CAT Interstellar is like, an offworld construction corporation, similar to Weyland Yutani or something. But then what does DOG mean?\n\nMovement through the areas is entirely functional, if completely standard. WASD to move, mouse to look, shift to sprint, and space to jump. My only complaint is that that default non-thrustered move speed is so slow that you pretty much just have to keep one finger on the thrusters constantly. The double jump is a pretty nice feature though, makes bouncing through the admittedly gorgeous terrain very fun.\n\nI love the androids too. The plasticy looking bodies with their glowing faces when they talk is really cool. They look like they've been committee designed to be "non-threatening", and "approachable". However I can definitely imagine them having some sort of hidden programming and when they want to be, totally terrifying.\n\nNow, on to the niggles. This is stuff that I think could definitely be looked at and improved upon, but is by no way a deal-breaker from a gameplay perspective:\n\n1) The DOG drone that you play. The texturing is... non-existant. As far as I can tell, it's just an ambient occlusion shader on the model, with some blue and some particles at the bottom of the thrusters. I don't know if this is because it's a placeholder for a final model/texture, or if it's by design, but I'm not too fond of it. And since we're going to be playing a game where this is constantly going to be on our screen, I kind of want a little more from it.\n\n2) The sound mix of of the androids is very very quiet. I'm glad they've got subtitles at the moment, because while it's not too difficult to hear what they say, the quiet tones make it hard to really take it in. This sort of links in with my next point too.\n\n3) Lots of telling, not much showing. So the DOG is equipped with a spectrometer that can detect stuff. But information about it is given to us via the quiet tones of the androids. I'd have liked it if one of the androids had gone "This is graphite, scan it, so your spectrometer can detect its chemical signature" Or *something*. Then it would have clued us in to what the blue splodges were on the ground that we're supposed to follow. You could have different samples of chemicals, and scan them all, so you can detect them while you're going around the planet, thereby finding more resources as you learn what the signatures of other deposits are.\n\n4) The android by the skylift tells you to go find three boxes, and put them in the skylift. I did that. He then says "You lost all three?" No man, I put all three in the lift like you said. I don't know if I'm just not getting what he says, or if the wrong speech file is playing, but it doesn't make sense to me why he would say that.\n\n\nOverall, this early access bit is really very short - almost too short to really get a good picture of what to expect from the full release. I really do hope that this turns into a fantastic game, because it certainly has the potential, and as such, I recommend it.","September 12, 2015","true","0.7"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","17","20","0","3"

Not worth buying. Future development may or may not change that.\n\ntl;dr;\n\nI bought the game about an hour ago, played for 27 minutes (played it twice). The first run took about 7 minutes, not 15. Possibly because I mistakenly thought I was doing the "intro" or "movement tutorial" and was expecting some gameplay when I suddenly found that I was not only at the end of the intro, but in fact the end of the game some 7 odd minutes later.\n\nFrom the description I was expecting some gameplay. There isn't any. This is only a tech demo at this point in time.\n\nYou can move around (normal & fast) and you can jump. That's it. Yes, some physics, you can bump into boxes, drift higher over some terrain small obsticales an so on.\n\nThe game seems to be heading down a bit of a puzzle or "find/fetch & carry & dropoff & complete a mission" path given some of the voiceovers. It is not a direction I personally like, but ymmv.\n\nHopefully the dev focus switches to some actual gameplay pretty smartly.\n\n\nNotes to Dev team:\nThe bounding box or cylinder on the 'dog' seems slightly too large.\n\nYour game description talks of an intended / targeted release date of March 2016. A later post (update 1.6) says 1st June 2016. Update your game description to match your post.\n\nSome of the ground clutter rocks seem a bit gravity defying.\n\nNice visuals, environment etc. Good tech demo.","March 4","false","0.5"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","19","27","0","5"

Exposition is as clunky as if the devs decided that they're going to draw from the worst aspects of that other Interstellar.\n\nBut I sense potential problems with the premise itself. There isn't really any explanation as to why would fully mechanized staff communicate in natural language or why a rover performing menial tasks even need an intelligence this well developed to understand it. Did people, having developed a strong AI capable of jokes and self-consciousness, presumably decided that they're going to make everything intelligent above necessity just because they can? This seems like a huge overkill to me, I imagine even in THE FUTURE that kind of technology must be somewhat costly.\n\nIf this game is suppose to be a fully developed story, it will need more character than this, because if all the heroes are some generic droids and rovers devoid of personality, like it is now, I can't see myself being too engaged by this narrative. Sure it might not depend on characters, but rather on ideas, but so far it doesn't seem seem to be heading into direction of a philosophical sci-fi and I don't honestly how it could with its current setup.\n\nStill, for 3€ it's worth checking out as perhaps we'll see something interesting come out of this.\n\nI wish the devs best of luck.","November 12, 2015","true","0.3"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","2"

I  don't mind as I consider that this small indie developer has done a good job so far and done it with a lot of polish and style.\n\nThe UE4 engine is a great platform to build this world on and, given the tech, the possiblities for potential future environments are promising. (This could be a great open world or node-based world for this type of scenario).\n\n\nGame mechanics?\n\nNot yet. If development of the story continues then I can see a game mechanic evolving.

You can be done under 30 minutes of gameplay. While the developer mention that this won't be a long game, it is to be noted the shortness of the game.\n\nFor an Early Access game, I gotta say it is very stable, functionnal and a visually appealing. The gameworld landscape seems big enough to wander around but without any objectives or thing to do, it ends up being pointless.\n\nAnother gripe was the lack of the current in-game objectives so I do believe that will be added later on.\n\nThis sums up to this:\n\nPROS:\n+Good visuals of the stations and planetary landscape.\n+Sound design is ok.\n+The open world seems big.\n+Stable game with a functionnal menu.\n\nCONS:\n-Limited gameplay and quite boring for the moment.\n-Very short gameplay (finish the game under 30 minutes... supposed to be an hour long once fully released).\n-Can't rebind the keys.\n-No clear in-game objectives.\n-The story seems interesting, more like a big teaser but there is no plotline at all!\n-Ain't Mars supposed to have a reddish sky?\n\nOVERALL:\nUnfortunately, there is barely nothing to do in this "tech demo" game. Maybe it got released too early or something but I would have loved to have something worth of doing in the game! For a 8 GB download, I expected something with more meat but I just received a little bone thrown at me! Give me something to do like scan something or any kind of possible fun gameplay to be had. Any possible mysterious plotline could draw more gamers in!\n\nI know the game is not pricy but that is not the point. There are games in this price range that offers more content for a longer playtime, but not this game. While Mars is an interesting planet, wouldn't the game setting been more appealing if set in another planet? Or maybe in an asteroid?\n\nCONCLUSION:\nFor what it's worth, this game can have potential. Just not for now! Which is why I give it a thumb down and advice anyone to hold out until the game is completed.","January 10","false","0.5"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","2"

That is about the only negative remark I have about it. The world is huge (it took me 35 minutes to get from the base to the edge of the map), and even though it is pretty much an empty desert, it is fun to explore that empty desert. What would be cool to add (in my oppinion) would be small caves around the world, maybe with some kind of trivia about space or a picture of the game in early development with some info about it.

The habitats are beautifully put together.

There's a grab 'facility' for fetching various objects. All the movement options work well together, so it's possible to pick up an item and carry it over rough terrian, etc.\n\nSo far I like what I've seen and found the developer to be very interactive with the forum...which is always a good thing.

The base idea is innovative, story and the foundation of the game is great. Graphics are amazing. Gameplay is smooth. Physics are good.\nI personally can see that if the development of this game goes to the right direction, this will be one hell of a deep atmospheric Science fiction game with a story based on real science.\nIf you love Science fiction and are ready to wait and probably help shaping a great game, buy it.\nBesides, the price is more than fair.\nDefinately recommanded to all Science fiction lovers out there.\n","August 31, 2015","true","2.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I did not expect a game from early access to look so polished, but the graphics are amazing. The gameplay, as it is in early access, is understandably lacking. Also there is a lot of dialouge, but little explanation on controls. I had no idea how (somewhat of a spoiler) to 'sense' the graphite, and had no idea why the graphite was so valuable on mars. But I look forward to future updates and the final game. I would like the story to be improved upon, and the 'sprint' to be turned off by a button without me having to hold down shift, because the graphite is hard to see, and if you move too fast it is easy to loose the trail, also the sprint makes DOG very clumsy, always smacking into walls.","November 14, 2015","true","0.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

I hope this game becomes huge, deep, rich, keeping the calming atmosphere & environment it has but doing an intelligent use of terrains, environments, lights and sounds to deeply provoke what I felt in the cave, to provoke an experience out of this world and at times make us feel lost and far from our human world. And maybe in a future even creep us out with that same experience, instead of using the way of all mainstream games: explosions and mosters to make us fall down our chair. I also hope new contents & updates improve the graphics performance and make the game a bit lighter. With an i5 and no antialiasing I still had some graphics delay. Please exploit its potential! :)","February 8","true","1.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Some work on finishing/polishing up on textures still to do.  Good use of science theory (Space Tether/Skylift) and of course not to mention the plot and story.  Good range of movement re: controls, easy and intuitive gaming style (simple objectives once tasks - boxes or fertiliser in this instance are picked up). Sandbox feel is good.  Re: the CAT/Dog model, maybe suggest damage and/or upgrades on mission. All in all a good play, albeit rather short.

The only problem I found is that it is easy to fall out of the bottom if you go exploring.  I love that the movements aren't restricted and I love to explore, but I kept finding myself in places I couldn't get back from, or falling endlessly.  Everything looks great and I can't wait to see what happens next.  I'd be awsome if DOG could do more too. Thanks!","May 30","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Somehow the slow pace is acceptable and exploring the isolated and sometimes spooky landscape with your little rover is fun.\n\nFalling water resembles a waterfall of slugs (needs to be sped up at least).\n\nVoice acting is pretty bad; note to the actors, memorize the lines and try to own them as your own words, rather than reading from a script.  The beginnings of the story that are present here are compelling enough though.\n\nI greatly appreciate the focus on real science in the background, but right now there is no evidence of it in-game.  That doesn't mean I don't enjoy the effects or the technology that is there, mind you.  But I'm not sure how an anti-grav rover with a force projector, space elevators (the barriers to which are monumental and multifarious), and microbes that can live on mars and produce illumination (even if they are extremeophiles) fit into real scientific possibility.  I'm hopeful the dev will improve on all this though over time.\n\nOverall for the price I think it's worth it to support this project and see how it turns out.","May 30","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately, the computer I had at the time could not handle the speed of the graphics and it would crash every time. Well fortunately I did not get a refund  and instead, I waited. I got a new computer and it worked! And it was so worth the wait! A game which takes place on Mars which utilizes the idea of exploring this alien world for the thrill of discovery and adventure, not so much tentacled monstrosities which one must shoot repeatedly or be horribly mutilated, ha! This game is definietly not that sort of game, Instead CAT Interstellar is a bit like a well written walking simulator instead one doesnt walk but flys. The graphics are very pretty and calming. I felt like Mars looked like a great place to live, Hahha. More so,  I felt like it was Mars, a hard feat considering the reality that I am looking at a screen of pixels, not wandering around Mars. But these guys did it. Excellent game, highly recommended! 10/10 gameplay, graphics storyling and the best part, it is early access so more is coming!
