If you were to ask me this question, there would be no way I would know how to respond simply. But, I can at least try to break it down.\n\nGameplay-wise, Borderlands has all the fundamentals of an FPS, shooting feels good and there's a wide range of guns with a unique feel to all of them (more on that later) without sacrificing movement. FPS makes up the core gameplay and how you interact with the world and NPCs in terms of combat, and it feels fantastic. However, the RPG elements are what give this game that extra depth that stops it from being 'just another' shooter. Every character has unique perks and skill trees that can be customised in different ways to alter general combat and your unique action skill. It keeps combat fresh and skills balance across characters really well. You might not see trees as unique as Zer0 or Krieg from Borderlands 2 but you can expect deep customisation nonetheless. No one character defines a playstyle, any of the four can be decked out with the according loot to keep you tanky, but the action skills and trees prevent the protagonists from feeling same-y.\n\nStoryline wise don't expect a deep tale, or even a sweeping adventurous romp like Borderlands 2. Instead, Borderlands goes for a strong atmosphere communicated through mission structure and world design, and yet I have no complaints about this lack of story. Gearbox balanced innumerable quests with a consistent world to combine for a truly unique experience. This is a game that, thanks to an RPG quest system, lets you get out there in the game world and get lost in it doing missions for insane amounts of time but lets you stay immersed in the storyline and world at the same time.\n\nNow, the meat of Borderlands. Let's be honest, RPGs have had shooter elements before, but, in my opinion, never has an inventory system in an RPG felt this good. Borderlands has my favourite inventory/loot system because it cuts the crap and gets right to the stuff you care about: guns, guns, guns! Don't expect to be picking up some arbitrary "Lord Generic's Gold Coin #74 with Blue Palette" to sell later. Borderlands gives you gear you use practically, and can sell for money. Expect to pick up grenade modifications, shields, class modifications which power up your skill trees even further and of course, guns.\n\nPerhaps what keeps the loot so good in Borderlands 1 as compared to 2 and Pre-Sequel is how they function relative to your character's level. I love Borderlands 2 and Pre-Sequel, but I found myself selling guns a lot more than in BL1, because Gearbox opted for a more balanced weapon system. Borderlands 1 has a different experience to opening loot chests. You could open something and still have the same giddy eagerness as when you first opened one in your early hours with the game because genuinely powerful and versatile weapons can be found. This is due to levelling and some manufacturers having incredibly unique traits that set them far above other manufacturers. Take, for example, the fact I own a Hyperion shotgun with a level 15 requirement that I still use on my level 44 Mordecai and you get an incredible idea of what this game can offer you. Not to mention the amount of guns outnumbers Borderlands 2 by around 3 million (5 mil vs 8 mil) and this game keeps a lot to see in it. Like the other Borderlands games there's a lot to see in the way of second playthroughs, offering more quests, even better loot and more challenging enemies.\n\nI feel as though my review barely scratches the surface even after typing all of this, but overall, I highly recommend you purchase this game if you want to get lost and spend countless hours in one of the deepest shooters I've played this past decade.\n\n10/10, would fight Texans again and again and again.","September 3, 2014","true","109.2"," 1,374 of 1,435 people (96%) found this review helpful 393 people found this review funny","96","374","1","393","9"

It is so totally asocial that it's a little bit sick. But I guess there come times in everyone's life when the only thing that suits your mood is to melt the faces off some midgets with a gun that shoots acid, or set bandits on fire and listen to your character laugh her head off as your victims run around screaming "Mommy, mommy!" It shouldn't be funny, but it's as funny as hell. It has some absolutely classic characters, not only in the main players like the siren Lilith, who has a ghastly giggle every time she hurts someone REALLY badly and who will abuse you if you leave her on hold too long, but also Dr. Patricia Tannis, the insane archeologist whose only reflection when a colleague is devored alive by one of the local animals is "He always had the more comfortable chair....I took his chair," Scooter, who could so easily have become a simple hick parody but turns out a great deal more, and funnier; and General "Doesn't Like Mondays" Knoxx, who is condemned to the hell of being commanded by a six year old child who outranks him because of nepotism gone insane.

I have never liked shooters.  My son came to visit and brought his Xbox 360 and he said he had a game that if I would give it a chance, he was sure I would like it at least enough to play with him when he came to visit.  When he loaded up Borderlands, my first reaction was "Oh God!  A Shooter."  I reminded him that I didn't like this kind of game at all.  He talked me into trying.  He suggested that I play Mordecai.  To make a long story short, within an hour I was so hooked I lost all track of time.  Between the pop culture knods and puns from my era (the story writers have GOT to be close to my age... which we won't mention what is) and the shere enjoyment of the game itself, it felt like we had only played an hour or so and I looked at the clock and it was 7 hours later!  I went on to play the 2nd AND the presequel!  I am still not very big on shooters, but I am at least a little more open to them because of this game and my son's persistance.  Borderlands have you laughing hard one second and then wondering "what the heck!?" the next.  The story is extremely engrossing, and the characters very relatable in their actions and motivations.  When you get to the end (is there actually and end??)  You will feel like you have acomplished the unachievable.  If you are even looking at this game and wondering, I have only two words:  "BUY IT!"  Whatever genre is your preference, you will fall in love with it!","February 10, 2015","true","464.9"," 175 of 182 people (96%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","96","175","182","26","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DryvBy/recommended/8980/","DryvBy","DryvBy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DryvBy/","1165 products in account","Growing up on games like Quake and Diablo really helped me to appreciate the greatness of Borderlands. There’s been a lot of games that have tried to pull off genre hybrids, but they either fail to deliver or just fail to program a game correctly. Borderlands is one of the few games that manages to feel like an RPG and a FPS at the same time.\n\nComing from a shooter side, the game is a very fun classic style shooter, meaning that the realism has been replaced with you getting to unload a clip into someone before dropping them. Sniper head-shots can generally take a foe down with one shot, but most all other guns are going to require you to get dirty. It feels an awful lot like a classic Quake shooter too. It’s just action based. Your ‘cover’ system is generally using you strafe and jump at the right time. By all means, this a welcome to some older gamers since most of today’s games are just striving to hit a certain realistic feel.\n\nFrom an RPG point, the game does take a few tumbling points in certain areas. The biggest problem is the skill tree. It’s pretty bare and some of the skills just feel useless. There’s also not enough skills to pin you into one type of character. Are you a Hunter looking to just be the stay-back sniper? Well, you can max those skills out but you can’t invest only points into one branch. It would have been nice to borrow a few more of the Diablo elements, allowing you to create an amazingly unique character from branches. Instead, you’re left feeling a bit underwhelmed by the skills. The only other problem with the RPG element is the characters all feel about the same. My Hunter manages to be a jack-of-all-trades character instead of just a hunter. While I might technically do more damage with a sniper rifle, my dark-orange rare machine gun that does 4x fire damage is going to take down the enemies faster. While these two things are a bit critical, the rest of the action role-playing feels genuine. Looting is fun; leveling up is fun; and having a huge inventory is very nice.\n\nFrom a graphic standpoint, this might not be a masterpiece, and some may feel a little turned off by the cartoony look, but by all means, you can at least distinguish this title from the other 90% of shooters that look like Modern Warfare clones. The one problem with the game’s graphics is some unstable frame rates, mainly when there’s a lot of blood on screen, a lot of elemental damage, or just towards the end of the game. It’s not unplayable, but the slowdowns shouldn’t be happening at all. Aside from that, it’s a nice refreshing look and feels more like a video game than a simulator.\n\nThere’s a story to the game, but even after playing through the game two times, I don’t think I could tell you what it’s about other than treasure hunting. Personally, I think the lack of story kept me more interested. I wasn’t worried about progressing to the end as much as I was trying to kill as many things as I could to find the next best weapon. While the story lacks in a big way, it would be nice to have a bit more of it in the next title release.\n\nWhere most people are probably going to go wrong with this title is trying to play this game as a single player game. Don’t bother. This was meant to be a co-op game. It’s like playing Left 4 Dead alone. It’s possible, but you’re going to actually enjoy playing the game when you have friends around. A benefit of having more friends play with you is that the game rewards you with more rare items. Plus, if you want to break away from the typical gameplay, they’ve installed arenas around the area to help you test out your gear against other foes, or to just play a little smack down with a friend.\n\nAnd for you achievement/trophy treasure finders out there, this title is pretty easy to get 100% in. What’s more interesting is the Medals (or challenges) you can try for with each character. Trying to get 2,000 head-shots or get the max number of cash in the game is wildly fun. It actually feels more like an extra quest in the game, since each challenge gives you a nice pot of experience points.\n\nMy final thoughts on the game: it’s a fantastic game, and for a new IP, it’s refreshing to see that there’s companies that still want to bring new or greatly tweaked genres to the table. While there’s some work to be done in some areas, the game had me fork over $60 and supplied me with $100 worth of entertainment.","November 26, 2013","true","35.2"," 146 of 160 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","146","160","0","0"

It's not long at all before you realise that this is more than your basic FPS, sure it has the First-Person viewpoint, and you, er, shoot, but there's an adventure in here too. It's rare that a FPS shooter has characters and humor injected into as rich as Borderlands, and looking back from when I originally played this on the 360, I'm not sure I've really played a game like it since.\n\nIt blends FPS and RPG elements together, and embraces our natural greed for better loot, to provide what I can only describe as a really fun time. It might have aged terribly since I last played, it and Borderlands 2 (and it's endless DLC) has been released since then too, but the first Borderlands game will always have a place in my games collection. It was one of the first fun Co-Op experiences I had, which in part was due to the 4 unique characters you could play as. Each character had their own traits and specialist role within a team, but could be equally as well-rounded if you played Solo. So you never really felt like you had 'picked the wrong class' when playing. Sure the game would change slightly depending on who you picked due to that character's 'natural' play style shaped by their traits and abilities, but nothing that would make the game less enjoyable.\nIn essence you had the Soldier, The Sniper, The Tank & The Magic classes to choose from. Each class comes with a speciality ability, and there are 3 seperate talent trees to spend skill points in to allow you to customise your characters abilities somewhat.\n\nThe way the Co-op System worked was interesting, and one I wish was used more often. Every game you had saved was YOUR game, and it was up to you if you wanted your friends to join in and help YOU out in YOUR game. So you could play Solo and progress, or you could call in your friends and progress. The game wouldn't progress without you being there, so there was no real need to worry about slowing down other people's progress due to other commitments.\nSadly, the PC version of Borderlands seems to come with a really terrible gamespy client that is hard to navigate compared to the Xbox360 Party System, which can at times make finding a party difficult and irritating.\n\nAs mentioned previously, the ship might have sailed on Borderlands due to Borderlands 2 being released, but I still enjoyed it and for those with an older PC unable to run Borderlands 2 this might still be worth checking out if you're looking to scratch an itch when it comes to collecting guns...","April 3, 2014","true","3.5"," 163 of 187 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","163","187","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/8980/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Commonly described as Diablo with guns, Borderlands can't really be explained by comparing it to other games. The closest you could probably get is Hellgate: London (as long as you were playing one of the gun/first-person shooter classes), but even then there are some pretty major differences.\n\nIf you haven't been paying attention to this game at all, Borderlands is a first-person shooter with action role-playing elements. You choose from four classes -- The Soldier, the Berserker, the Hunter, and the Siren. Each has a unique "action skill," which is basically that classes special ability, and three different trees to drop skill points into. While every class can use every weapon in the game (the only limit on what you can equip is determined by your level), most characters have skills in their skill tree that enhance one or two particular types of weapons.\n\nThe Soldier is best with rifles and shotguns, the Berserker with explosive weapons and his melee attack, the Hunter with sniper rifles and revolvers, and the Siren with any weapon that deals elemental damage. Luckily, there is enough flexibility that these don't feel like absolute restrictions. If you wanted to make a Hunter that mainly used rocket launchers, that's completely viable. Sure, it won't be the best build for the character, but you won't feel like you have no options other than to use the "recommended weapons" for each class.\n\nYou may remember some minor controversy a while back when Gearbox announced that they had scrapped the game's initial design in favor of cel-shaded graphics. I'm happy to report that I believe Gearbox made the right choice in changing the graphical direction of the game. Not only does it make Borderlands look unique, but it's gorgeous on top of that. Looking back at older screenshots of the game, the original art style seemed so generic and bland -- I'm really glad they decided to take a chance and mix it up. Other than some minor texture pop that resolves almost immediately upon loading and some slight screen tearing (VSync option please!), I didn't really run into any other graphical issues.\n\nThe game begins with you being tossed off a bus. You meet your first Claptrap who explains the basics of the game, and gives you a short mini-tutorial. After making your way to the first town, you're assigned your first quest and the game really begins.\n\nThere's a massive number of quests in the game, and Gearbox has done a reasonable job of mixing them up. While every now and then you'll be assigned a "Kill X enemies" quest, they are few and far between. For the most part, you'll be exploring various locations and recovering different items, usually with a bunch of bad guys standing in the way. Even after completing the game, I was still going back and finding quests that I had missed before.\n\nOne of the reasons it's been compared to Diablo is because of the emphasis on loot. The initial stories were right -- there are TONS of weapons in this game. There are seven main weapon types: pistols (this includes repeater pistols and revolvers), submachine guns, shotguns, combat rifles, sniper rifles, launchers, and a seventh that could be considered a minor spoiler.\n\nEvery weapon has a variety of stats: accuracy rating, recoil, how much the weapon can zoom, how many bullets the weapon can hold, how fast the gun can fire, how many bullets fire at once, how fast the weapon reloads, and more. In addition, weapons have a chance to have one of four elemental properties: Explosion, Fire, Shock, and Corrosive. You also have slots for grenade mods, your shield, and a class mod that will boost your skills and provide some benefits, each with their own special aspects and variations.\n\nCombat in Borderlands is a ton of fun. While the game is a first-person shooter at its core, some strategy is needed. Each enemy has a "weak point" that you can attack for critical damage. For humans, its their heads. For Skags (the world's dog-like beasts), it's their mouths (but only when they're open, which is not often). While initially combat will seem relatively simple, once you progress the game will get reasonably difficult, and you'll find yourself very carefully having to manage your cover, your shield/health level, and your surroundings.\n\nBorderlands blends the regeneration aspect of many popular FPSs with health-pack grabbing. You have shields and life, and your shields regenerate, while your life doesn't. While this will give you some leeway to run into dangerous situations with guns blazing, you can't just stand still and blow everyone up. If you're going to make a rush, you'll have to take out your opponents quickly.\n\nOne criticism I do have of the combat is the lack of variety of enemies. Skags, bandits, and spiderants make up the majority of what you'll be fighting throughout most of the game. A few zones have unique enemy types, and the flying Rakk are occasionally around to harass you. But for the most part you're going to be fighting the same enemies over and over again.\n\nOne of the ways Borderlands differs from games like Diablo and Hellgate: London is that nothing is randomly generated aside from items themselves. The maps and locations are exactly the same every single time you play, and immediately upon entering an area you're given the entire map of the zone. Quest items will always be in the same spots, vendors will never move, and even the chests, safes, and weapon caches will always be in the same locations in every playthrough.\n\nLuckily, the repetitive feeling goes away quite a bit when you're playing with friends. Borderlands was designed as a co-op game, and co-op is where it really shines. Gearbox has done a good job of adjusting the difficulty in co-op games, in that you'll need to work together carefully with your friends to avoid dying. I actually found myself dying more when I was playing through the game with a friend than I did in single player, because we had to think a lot more strategically and be more careful. Since the enemies have significantly boosted health and damage, if even one or two get through your defenses you'll get taken down pretty quickly.\n\nThe final thing I want to touch on is the story. While Borderlands starts out with a reasonably interesting story, it kind of takes a backseat to the action. This is somewhat understandable, since this is an FPS game at its core, but be prepared. The ending of the game is massively disappointing. Think Fallout 3, but worse. It's a shame, because the initial story has a lot of promise, and it's sad to see that potential squandered. This doesn't really affect the gameplay, but I found it to be the biggest disappointment I felt from my entire time with Borderlands.\n\nLuckily, even with these complaints, the first playthrough of Borderlands is an absolute blast, and will provide you at least 25+ hours of gameplay as long as you don't avoid all the sidequests. With tons of weapons to find, a great co-op system, fantastic art, and a whole bunch of exploding bodies, Borderlands is worth your money. Even when I feel that the game is starting to get repetitive, there's something about it that keeps me playing. Even my plans to jump into the game for five minutes to grab screenshots would suddenly turn into hour long play sessions without me even realizing it, and even having done most of the quests twice, I still want to head back and try again with a new character class. Despite a few imperfections, the game is simply fun -- and at the end of the day, that's what really matters.","July 14, 2014","true","79.9"," 138 of 156 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","138","156","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/8980/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","The first question that comes to mind when most people see some screens from Borderlands or watch a trailer for the game is, "Is Borderlands an RPG or a shooter?" Well, that's not necessarily an easy question to answer. On the one hand, it's far more an RPG than a shooter with its classes, experience levels, skill trees, quests, and all of the usual trappings of an RPG. On the other hand, combat is not a slow-paced methodical affair, being neither turn-based nor a simple matter of selecting the attack button and letting the CPU roll the dice. You need to aim, move, strafe, and everything else that you need to do to survive in a first-person shooter. So what we have here may be one of the finest shooter-RPGs. A hardcore RPG gamer may not appreciate the twitch-based combat, and a hardcore shooter gamer may be a bit put off by the fact that there's some dice-rolling going on behind the scenes (what do you mean I'm too low level to hit that monster???), but everyone else should have a great time with the game.\n\nBorderlands takes place on the planet of Pandora, a backwater planet with a character that's a bit Mojave Desert and a lot Road Warrior. Pandora is the kind of planet that wouldn't garner a second thought from anyone anywhere else in the galaxy except that it's also home to The Vault. The Vault is an ancient structure left behind by some long-gone alien race, but it's rumored to contain treasure and artifacts of vast power. The presence of The Vault has attracted the attention of fortune seekers from all corners of the galaxy, in spite of all of the dangers on Pandora from the testy local fauna and aggressive bandit groups. You are one of those fortune seekers, and while it may seem that exploring The Vault would form the bulk of your adventure most of your efforts will be directed at just getting there - but that's alright because Pandora is a pretty interesting place in its own right.\n\nBorderlands gives you the choice of one of four different characters, and unlike a full RPG there's not really much available in the way of character customization. There are four classes available, a soldier who uses all variety of weapons, a berserker who's basically a tank and can cause some serious damage with his fists, a hunter who specializes in sniper rifles and has control of an attack bird, and a siren who's a stealth-based character with the ability to turn invisible for short stretches of time. Each character provides a different experience, and that experience can be further tweaked by specializing in one of the three skills trees available to each character. While you can certainly complete the game as any of these four classes, it's when you play the game in co-op mode - either split-screen or on Xbox Live - that you'll realize how well-balanced a team these four characters make. And when you do play online, the story progress will be set to that on the host's machine but the level of the enemies will be adjusted to reflect the mix of levels of the characters taking part in the game.\n\nOne of the great things about Borderlands is that there is always plenty to do. In addition to the story missions there are always a number of other missions available, either from characters that you meet in the game or from job boards in the friendly settlements. Even after you finish with The Vault, you can return to the wastelands of Pandora and continue taking on side quests.\n\nThe developers of Borderlands must have spent at least a little time playing World of Warcraft, because they understand how much fun (and how addicting) it is to find a huge variety of loot. There are an amazing number of weapons in the game to be scavenged from defeated enemies, discovered in foot lockers, or pulled from corpses discovered in the wastelands. There are several classes of weapons such as pistols, assault rifles, shotguns, and sniper rifles, and they come in standard and rarer varieties. Each is rated on damage dealt, range, and ammo capacity, but some of the better ones will include the ability to use special ammunition like incendiary rounds, fire grenades, or even come with blade attachments to increase melee damage. You'll spend a fare amount of time in your inventory screen, deciding which combination of weapons to have equipped, which to save for later or to sell, and which to drop to make room for something else, but it's more a labor of love than a chore. The game is even kind enough to mark loot in the area with a small beam of light, and you'll more often than not decide it's worth the risk to fight through a group of enemies just to see what's sitting under that little beam of light in the distance.\n\nBorderlands has a great look to it - it's not quite a fully cel-shaded game, but it has a distinct comic book look to it. The violence also tends toward a comic book style, and although it would be pretty graphic in a game with realistic graphics it comes across as slightly humorous in Borderlands and fits the game's dark, subtle, and subversive sense of humor perfectly. Pandora certainly has its own unique look and feel to it, and it stands out from the myriad of alien worlds that you've visited in countless other games before. And it's not just the look of planet that makes Pandora, Pandora - everything from your chipper robot guide to the colorful locals to the mysterious woman who appears to you in brief visions, makes exploring Pandora a very interesting experience.\n\nHighly Recommended!\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 2, 2014","true","18.4"," 160 of 190 people (84%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","84","160","190","8","2"

Having beaten the game on that presumably illegally downloaded copy, I jumped at the chance to buy it on sale (Humble Bundle is OP :D), hence my low playtime.\n\nThis game has so much to offer the player, whether you be an experienced FPS player or an absolute n00b like I was on my first playthrough. This accessibility is primarily due to the RPG-like experience point system, that allowed me to level up and eventually defeat bosses despite my lack of skill.\n\nThe story in this game is above and beyond what you would expect from your average FPS game. I guess you can't really consider Borderlands a shooter more than it is an RPG, and this is one of the things that is so attractive about it. I would say that the game excels in many areas where other RPG's do not, namely the openess of the world and the fairly sizeable ammount of free choice you have when completing quests (I'm looking at you, Far Cry 3). The humor in the game is also brilliantly executed, and had me cracking up at many points throughout the story.\n\nSo is the game worth your hard earned money, even if it was realeased almost 6 years ago?\n\nHELL YES.","July 2, 2015","true","11.5"," 68 of 76 people (89%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","89","68","76","11","5"

Some Diablo fan developers of Gearbox reinvented the way of co-op fighting and looting in a post apocalyptic world named "Pandora". Containing 4 different iconic characters which you can levelup by XP gained from kills or solving quests is still today (6 years after release) a highly addictive game concept. The other thing is the random weapon looting generator which produces practically an infinite variation of all kind of weapons (with elemental damage, multipliers, rarities, weapon classes, character class mods, grenade mods and shields). You can buy weapons from vendor machines but mostly they are hidden in weapon cases, lockers or stashes all over the landscape or they drop from killed enemies. So you cleanout an area in action loaded sequences (the AI is great) and after that you compare stats of dropped and looted weapons.\n\nYou better play together with your friends. The game is up to 4 players co-op which is a great experience. Even if there are sometimes loot conflicts or quest solving / achievements asynchronities. Whatever is the reason it still makes fun.\nVery innovative was the unique cell-shade graphics at that time which gave the game the perfect comic look. Mixed-up with FoV and depth sharpness effects it felt quite modern and fresh. Today it feels a bit blurry but still nice to watch. Shooting at enemies let drop several damage numbers and criticals hits out of their bodies which is quite funny.\nThe Bossfights are totally epic. Everything seems very story driven. Other things like quests of collecting things are rather repetive. If you finished the main story you will reach lvl36 but on a second playthrough you can farm enough XP to levelup to lvl50 and lateron with DLCs to lvl69 (max level).   The 4 DLCs content is quite extensive storytelling and new epic bossfights. You cannot miss all the DLCs in the GOTY version which is totally recommended and worthy to buy.","November 9, 2015","true","139.8"," 75 of 89 people (84%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","84","75","89","9","0"

The game had a lot of unique features and settings. A first-person shooter set on a sci-fi planet - Pandora, with a lot of focus on RPG elements. The game was very well reviewed and recieved a various amount awards, including several Game of the Year's. Visually the game is beautiful and covered in cel shading, giving it a very comic book / hand-drawn look. The game took cel shading so far, that people often associate the game with that specific art-style. Thanks to the cel shading, the game could hide behind pretty simple textures without appearing low-res, as the game does not have to look realistic.\n\nPandora is a very hostile planet, as you quickly get to experience with the regular human bad-guys and also a selection of aliens and mutations. You get to choose between 4 characters to play, each with it's unique ability and weapons. There is a leveling system where you gain experience and level up specific perks for your character and set-up. When you level up, so does your enemies, and occasionally you encounter a 'Badass' (stronger and more dangerous than the regular), as well as a bunch of unique variants and bosses.\n\nThis game rewards you with more loot than your grannies wrinkles. You will drown in a sea of a billion different weapons, with different ammo types, reload speeds, firing speeds, scope zooms, damage etc. IT NEVER ENDS! There are 4 types of bonus damage; fire, explosion, shock and corrosion, all with an advantage and disadvantage to specific enemies. Luckily, you don't wear or find any armor in the game, only a shield and health augmentation, that has about as many billion combinations as the weapons.\n\nA lot of people compare Borderlands with Fallout 3. They are in reality very different from one another. Borderlands is very humoristic and bright, while still being twisted and deteriorated. This game is not set in a post-apocalyptic world that has been beautiful. Pandora itself never was a peaceful place, and the name should hint it's secrets within. Borderlands never really focus on a good story either, it's just about the loot, man, the LOOT!\n\nThis game shows it qualities when played in Co-op, where 4 people can do all this nonsense together. It really starts feeling like an MMO RPG when fighting the harder bosses in co-op, grinding everywhere - and then then rewarded with loot. There even is PVP arenas for fighting over the loot too. If co-op is not an option you can still enjoy it in Single-Player.\n\nPick this up if you are interested in a unique experience, with friends - or without - with a ton of loot and silly things to shoot.\n\nNote: Borderlands is the prequel to Borderlands 2, you might be looking into that game too.","June 9, 2013","true","103.0"," 56 of 64 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","56","64","0","1"

It's a great take from the early stages of the RPG/FPS hybrids that are outrageously popular these days.  The gameplay is a blast and stands up to the test of time and the randomly generated loot is always exciting to pick up.  One gun could be entirely different from the next even if they're of the same category and you never know what kind of crazy weapon you'll be adding to your arsenal next.\n\nMy only real complaints are that long range sniping could be improved and that by the time of the final DLC, if you're playing through all of them consecutively, the game starts to drag a bit.  Sniping seems to snap to a grid for particularly long ranged shots without a great scope which is unfortunate for those of us who have a sniper rifle preference.  The DLC is fun, though it's mostly more of the same.  There are new enemy types but the quest format is unchanged and they often feel like very well done skin swaps.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend the game if you have a friend or three to play with and consider it a worthy purchase even if you don't.\n\nJust make sure to have your volume control nearby for when Claptrap decides that he wants to start talking.","May 15","true","64.2"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","96","25","26","6","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunaril/recommended/8980/","Lunaril","Lunaril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunaril/","880 products in account","Borderlands is the first game in the Borderlands Series, originally released in 2009. It is a mixture of RPG and FPS where you can play as one of four characters, a Soldier, Hunter, Berserker, and Siren, and complete missions for various NPC's. You start on the planet of Pandora, where you are sent by the Dahl Corporation to locate a vault containing alien technology, which is believed to exist on the planet. The planet had previously been abandoned by several large corporations due to their inability to find any alien tech, so it is a broken wasteland of desert and scattered settlements, with wild creatures and raiders a plenty. There is more to the plot, but I don't want to spoil the surprises for anyone.\n\nThe graphics look a bit cartoonish, almost a comic book feel to them; However, there are settings and even Mods available to make the game less cartoonish. Borderlands has a Single Player mode, Multiplayer, and Co-operative mode.\nEach character that you can choose from has a different play style. There are mulitple DLC's available for Borderlands such as; The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned, Claptrap's New Robot Revolution, The Secret Armory of General Knoxx, and Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot. The game also spawned a Sequel, Borderlands 2, and a pre-sequel, Tales from the Borderlands: The Pre-sequel. Even though I don't personally like the cartoonish way the graphics look, there are workarounds for that and the game is still fun to play. It has a pretty good tutorial and very little learning curve, so anyone new to the series should be able to jump right in and learn from the playable tutorial. the NPC's are amusing, voice acting is pretty good and the game has decent music. Borderlands is worth purchasing, for those who like RPG-FPS games.","January 1","true","1.2"," 30 of 38 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","30","38","0","3"

It is long and it keeps you interested throughout, the storyline is amazing. I've really enjoyed playing so far and it is very fun.

I started playing it after it was on sale and a friend wanted me to buy it so we could play together. Borderlands 2 came shortly after I bought it, and then of course the Pre-Sequel long after that. We played it a lot together, and we had a lot of fun while we played it. I didn't get why he loved it so much until I started playing it by myself. I started listening to the story, playing it in Mordecai's perspective, and I had a lot more fun. There are the people who play it for the loot and shoot primarily, and those few who play it for the story and have less fun playing it. There are also the people who play it for both, and I think I fall into that category. It is very arguable that the game has little to no story, and I agree with that statement just a small bit. The story that Borderlands has is still decent, but there's no question it could be a lot better. I have around 100 hours as of now, and believe that number will further grow, but for now there are bigger and "better" things. Borderlands 2 and Borderlands The Pre-Sequel are those things.","November 6, 2014","true","129.1"," 26 of 32 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","26","32","0","2"

Lacked a little bit to perfection. Failure to include a sharing mechanism of items between players, effectively deterred from playing with strangers, and friends are not always online.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abedsbrother/recommended/8980/","abedsbrother","AbedsBrother","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abedsbrother/","525 products in account","Borderlands leaves me with mixed feelings. I had a great time playing it – when I wasn't bored by endless fetch-quests, easy combat and (in the DLC) re-used bosses.\n\nI enjoyed the weapons the most. They feel and fire great, with a lot of variety. There's a finite amount of cash, so most of your weapons will be found via looting. And there is a TON of stuff to loot. Any fallen enemy drops loot, from bandits to wild animals. And if you find a stash, well, you just might land yourself a rare. Sniper rifles have a fixed zoom, though.\n\nThe game world is huge and drab; a real wasteland. The visual style is still unique (even with Telltale using a similar hand-drawn, cell-shaded look for most of their games). It was a little jarring at first, but after a few hours I found the graphics very appealing. And light on system resources. I am able to run Borderlands at max settings @1440p on an R7 260X! Borderlands is just not that demanding.\n\nGetting around the huge world isn't a problem; Scooter's vehicle terminals are everywhere, making it very easy to “Git you one!” But why are we traversing the gameworld? Fetch-quests, mostly. “Bring me 20 fish!” “Destroy 3 fuel tanks!” “Find 20 parts!” They're not all fetch-quests, of course, but there's quite a bit of padding. The attraction was supposed to lie in the combat (and looting) while completing the quests. Which is fine, except the combat is easy. If you do a few side-quests and suddenly find yourself 2 or more levels higher than recommended, you'll breeze through the missions. Co-op play is supposed to mean harder enemies and better loot; I found co-op even easier.\n\nI'd heard so much about how good the characters of Borderlands are, and they're there, but barely; the characters are the start- and end-points of the missions, but that's it. You'll barely even see a cut-scene with them (except in some of the DLC). Claptraps are everywhere, and they're obviously designed to be cute. What about the story? Well, you're looking for a vault; think of it as a box. You're on a planet named “Pandora”. Put the two together, and hopefully you won't be too disappointed when you finally get to the vault after an endless level of “guardians”.\n\nSo, I have mixed feelings about Borderlands. I found it tremendously fun in co-op, though, so if you have a few friends who want to run around together shooting and looting, grab it by all means. If you're planning to solo most of it, it will be a solitary, easy grind for loot. Not a bad thing if that's what you're looking for; if you were hoping for more, though, you'll be disappointed.\n\n"Wait, you forgot about your reference to 'recycled bosses'!"\n\nRead on.\n\nOn DLC:\nThere are four DLC, all of them substantial additions to the main game; campaigns are large (as are the rewards) and well worth the purchase – especially if you're buying the game for its co-op.\n\nSome problems with the DLC, though:\n- No fast travel. Wait, wtf? That's right. You fast travel to the start of the DLC campaign, but within the DLC, there is no fast-travel, meaning you'll spend a lot of time running (or driving). If you pass a save-point deep within a level, and quit your game, the next time you load your save, you'll be back at the beginning of the DLC, and have to run / drive all the way back to where you were when you saved.\n- RECYCLED BOSSES. You'll re-fight the boss from the main campaign, and in the Claptrap Robot Revolution DLC, you'll also re-fight the bosses from The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned and The Secret Armory of General Knoxx – sometimes even multiple times! Borderlands tries to be self-deprecating as it does this, but it doesn't change the fact that they're re-using assets. It reeks of being cheap. Did the devs seriously think we would swallow the EXACT same boss three times without complaining? Come on.\n\nGet the GOTY edition. When on sale, it's only a few dollars more, and it includes everything.","December 15, 2015","true","72.8"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","13","15","3","0"

The makers of this game have twisted both the elements together very finely that you won't be bored if you're an FPS and RPG fan. Its very AWESOME if you play it with friends or not (i mean single player). In this game the hunt for bigger and better loot for guns never gets old. Its always AWESOME when you fight your way into the wave of enemies and get loot of better weapons, Shields, Class, Health, etc. and many more. You aswell face many different Bosses aswell as new soldiers to fight and after the fight when you get the access to cases you feel like you're rewarded.\nTheres also Vehicles in this game,  it gave me feeling like Mad Max as bandits created a conflict in a desert area with me in a vehicle.\nthere are 4 vehicles in this game and some you get by buying DLC.\nThe main story is a blast evenn if you play it alone for Hours and hours without getting bored. and if you play it with your friends its an AWESOME experience.\nI havent tried all DLC yet but still will write for what i have,\n\nFor DLC,\nThe Secret Armory of General Knoxx starts players off in T-Bone Junction. This small town is a rest stop on a sprawling stretch of highway raised above the dry basin of an ancient sea. In other words, it looks a lot like the other stretches of beautiful wasteland in Borderlands.\nPlayers are required to drive a good distance along these roads to get to the surrounding areas, as there are no teleport locations. There are a few new vehicles, one of which is quite a bit faster than what appeared in the main game, but you'll eventually get tired of the extended driving segments that come with each quest. The four person Lancer allows crews to travel together, but it is slower and not much fun for two of the passengers.\nIf you enjoyed Borderlands and still wanted more, then definitely buy and download The Secret Armory of General Knoxx.","April 12","true","32.4"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

Oh, and it's pretty dang fun too.\n\nBorderlands is a sci-fi loot-fest shooter set on an alien planet. You play as one of 4 "Vault Hunters", on a quest to find and open a mythical vault that may or may not hold untold riches. Each of the characters has one unique special skill, plus a set of strengths and weaknesses (better in one weapon type versus another, etc). Unfortunately you can only pick one character at the start of the game, so if you want to try different characters out, you'll have to start multiple games. That kind of sucks, but it's not too big of a deal ultimately, and adds incentive for multiple playthroughs (if you are into making that kind of time investment). The shooting mechanics are pretty good and it's cool how many different types of weapons there are. It allows for tons of experimentation and variety. Gameplay basically consists of discovering a new area, collecting a bunch of quests that need to be fulfilled (though many are optional), completing said quests, getting more loot, leveling up, and proceeding to the next area. Rinse and repeat. Even though that might sound slightly boring on the surface, I assure you it is not. The game mostly stays fresh throughout and the writing is pretty good, bordering on laugh-out-loud funny at times (the game doesn't take itself too seriously). And oh yeah, there's a cute little robot named Claptrap... 'nuff said.\n\nThere are a number of DLC campaign add-ons available as well. I believe all of them come with the GOTY edition, but if you don't have that version, I'd say it's worth picking them up after completing the main story (except maybe the Underdome DLC, which I haven't played), assuming you enjoyed the base game.\n\nIn summary, if you like games with a cool sense of humor that involve first-person shooting things and/or lots of loot drops and weaponry, pick this up. It has a great style, good mechanics, and enough content to keep you occupied for many, many hours.

Amazingly good for brain-dead gaming sessions whilst listening to music or podcasts. The story of borderlands, isn't anything spectacular, it's not something I really cared about whilst playing, there is however some great charming characters found within. Aestheticly, the game sports stylized comicbook-esque graphics, that not only look great, but is a nice change from realistic games. The soundtrack is stronger at some points than at others, but overall it's generally good. As far as first-person shooters go, borderlands does most, if not everything right, and let me say this now, reloading whilst sprinting is a godsend. Not only do I enjoy the combat, but the loot system is great, it's always nice to find a better gun and guns are pretty much Borderlands thing. I highly recommend buying this if you have friends to play it with.\n\nThose interested in buying the GOTY edition can see individual DLC reviews below;\nThe Zombie Island of Dr. Ned - The Secret Armory of General Knoxx\nMad Moxxi's Underdome Riot - Claptrap’s New Robot Revolution","December 29, 2015","true","50.9"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

The bosses are a pushover, the guns are all over the place; some useless, others ridiculously powerful. It's a team coop game, but you have to stick with the same team all the way through, thanks to the rubbish levelling system and mission flags. Baddies are initially rather difficult but after a few missions way to easy to defeat for the rest of the game. There are no field of view settings so on widescreen it looks like you are viewing the world through binoculars....the list goes on.......so it's no wonder that Borderlands didn't get rave reviews.  But despite all the problems, it's a brilliant game! The music, atmosphere and sheer playability are second to none. The comic book style graphics are fantastic.

All quests can be completed in single player, although two players on the same system works just as well, as does three or four people playing together via the internet. All quests offer a set number of experience points, but experience gained through monster kills depends upon the level of the character and the level of the monster he is slaying - more experience for tougher monsters, and little or no experience for very weak monsters when your character is far more powerful.\nThe art style is amazing, I know a few people who were put off by the cell shading look but once you're in game it all makes sense and the game wouldn't look right any other way, the characters are varied enough and some of the enemies are downright hilarious, shotgun toting midgets who fly back from the recoil when they fire at you are just one of the neat animations that this game is filled with.\nThe storyline is a bit faint, your dropped into the game with the overall target been to find 'the vault' but there are hundreds of missions to do as you go through each area, most areas finish with a boss and some of the boss fights are pretty interesting (Boss's tend to drop their weapons after you fight them which is nice).\n","November 16, 2015","true","27.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","1"

It boasts a masterful blend of FPS and RPG elements with an elaborate loot system to make for truly delectable gameplay. Complementing the gameplay is the unique and self-identifying art style and graphics, the blithe and cartoonish atmosphere, and the lighthearted narrative and zany NPC characters. All of these factors working in concert generate one hell of a gaming experience that should be able to bring pleasure to nearly any gamer out there.\n\nThe gameplay is designed to offer both the face-paced action of an FPS with the character progression elements and gameworld massiveness of an RPG. There is an XP system that awards level-ups and ability-boosts. There are scores of quests to complete; some ancillary and others pivotal to the core narrative. There is a crazy world to explore, filled with various interesting NPCs. Enemy spawns and combat occur in real-time, right in the midst of everything else that is going on in the gameworld. There is never a dull moment or a lack of something to be working towards.\n\nBorderlands also has an elaborate and semi-random loot drop system. In the style made popular by games like Diablo, loot spills out of chests, crates, and enemies to pile up on the floor for you to peruse. Much of it will be junk, but you must always keep an eye out for the rare high quality drops. Due to the nature of the stat-progression of the weapons and the sheer variety, you will find yourself experimenting with many more and various weapons than you would in a standard FPS.\n\nAnother defining aspect of Borderlands is the self-identifying art style and graphics scheme. The graphics fit the theme of the game with perfection, as they expertly relay the feeling of zany, cartoonish raucousness that the game is striving to evoke. This atmosphere sets the tone for the burlesquing narrative which never wastes an opportunity to poke fun at the other, more serious games it relates to.\n\nFinally, one of best aspects of the game is the multiplayer functionality. Also borrowing from the style made popular by games like Diablo, you are able to play with other people by either allowing them to join your session or by joining theirs. You bring your own characters and earn your own XP and loot, but the game will be progressed up to the point that the host has reached. Playing with friends, or even with random people, can make the experience exponentially more hilarious and fun.\n\nIf you have yet to give this game a try, then I envy you. It is one of the hallmark games of its generation and will forever live on a masterpiece of its time. So stop reading this and get on with it!\n\nAddendum: After the Gamespy shutdown, multiplayer functionality has been moved over to Steamworks in 2015, so it continues to work properly.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","November 18, 2013","true","101.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

It's a much better time if you play it with at least one other person. Getting past that, this game is an odd gem. Released around 2009, this is a first person shooter/open world/rpg game with quite a bit of weapon variety across the 4 classes you can play as. You have (as I just mentioned) 4 choices, Lilith the support character, Roland the most black support gunner in gaming, Mordacai, the sniper with a cool bird that kills things, and my personal favorite, Brick, a bulky hamfisted guy with a bad temper. Each of these classes have "action skills" which are unlocked at level 5. Brick being able to go beserk and punch things, doing very heavy damage and recovering health. Mordacai being able to use bloodwing, a bird that homes in on enemies and does damage  no ♥♥♥♥ . Lilith, being able to phasewalk (don't ask me how that works, I don't play much of the siren). And Roland has his turret, which is very useful if you do decide to play alone. Moving on, the game itself is quite large, but the locations are level locked with the foes. So if you're level 20, going back to the start you will still fight the level 1 enemies there. Grinding is also a debatable issue, but it's not terrible in this case as there are plenty of side and main quests that will fetch you decent XP. The gunplay is what you would find in any other fps, exept this has more of a Halo feel to it due to the slight moon jumping and grenade physics. Another big part of this game is the driving, which feels amazing once you get used to the mouse sensitivity on the steering  unless your a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who uses a controller, then your sensitivty should be fine from the start.  Again, the driving goes to the Halo style of control, floaty yet tight turns where the camera controls the car. Now on to the gun variety. I think that the marketing strategy they pulled for this game (and the ones after it) of having billions of guns, is a lie. You may have quite a few guns, by quite a number of in-game gunsmiths, but they are mostly the same gun with slighty different stats and maybe a longer name or a model change. Guns also have elemental effects, as do your action skills, going from explosive to corrosion, they make fighting some enemies go from hard to easy, or the other way around. Moving away from that, the controls are tight and the keybinds are set just fine. Maybe it was just my game or my pc, but voice chat is a little iffy on my reciving end. All in all, is this a good game and worth the $20? Maybe. If you're looking to have a good time with a couple of your friends, then yes, by all means get this. In my opinion, this is the best game out of the current three. I also advise getting the DLC along with it, at least the one that increases your level cap.","April 2","true","17.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","7","7","3","0"

Wacky characters and some funny references.\n\n— It feels pretty satisfying to melt enemies and bosses with insane amounts of bullets. Ammo is abundant in the world, especially when you can cheat the RNG making it so you always get bullets for the weapon types you want. After a while, bullets become unnecessary if you use an Ammo Regeneration mod, making it less annoying since you don’t have to keep looting it.\n\n— Looting is this game’s major annoyance. Press a button to loot an item, and then repeat the process for each other item scattered on the ground. Certain enemies, like bosses, drop a ton of stuff, making it so you’ll spend most of your time in Pandora looking at the ground and looting. You can hold the loot button to execute an area loot, but the range is extremely short and you inventory is very small, meaning you’ll stop being able to loot items after half a dozen of these, at best.\n\n— The loot/weapon system is a mess. Weapons have a huge array of variable stats, including shooting speed, magazine ammo capacity, inventory ammo capacity, damage per bullet, bullet accuracy, bullet lag (I’ll come back to this one later) and elemental damage. The first time you play through the game, you obviously won’t have any idea of which elements are effective against each type of enemy. Making things worse, you can only equip four weapons at once (late game, 2 weapons early game), meaning you will also spend a lot of time swapping guns every time you enter a different area. No, you don’t get to use your favorite gun all of the time. It just doesn’t work. Also, seeing as your inventory is very small even after fully upgraded (by saving Claptraps) most of it will be filled with guns of various types and elements that you will need, making it so you have close to zero inventory space for loot and have to keep running back to vending machines to sell your crap. Loot rarity is also mostly non-functional, since, thanks to randomly assigned bonuses, it is possible for the crappiest low level weapon be stupidly good until 20 levels later, due to RNG.\n\n— Bullet lag. That’s right. Some genius at Gearbox thought it was a good idea to make each type of gun have a different bullet lag. If you shoot a medium distance object with a rifle, it will take way longer that it’s supposed to for the bullet to reach it. Even with a sniper, it’s near impossible to hit a non-stationary enemy at long distance. And forget about hitting moving targets with SMGs, unless you’re literally on their faces. What were they thinking, honestly.\n\n— Quick Travel is a blessing, but it’s not present in the Knoxx DLC, which by coincidence, has Kilometers of highways and makes you travel for a long time every time a mission asks you to go somewhere (very often). Also the missions tend to be repetitive and sometimes you have to kill every boss in an enemy base every time you get a mission to do anything in said base. Also, having to go through the base game twice and then going through all the DLCs to reach the level cap. Also, weird level sync where monsters are always 2-3 levels above you making them excessively hard to kill……\n\n— Heavy Texture popping, especially after loadings, collision detection problems, where a small rock or piece of metal on the floor will bring you to a grinding halt, which means certain death against most bosses.\n\n— Most achievements involve hours of mindless grinding and some are virtually impossible unless you use exploits or design flaws. And even then the Coliseum achievements take several hours of uninterrupted play.\n\n— Multiplayer scaling is weird, making every enemy have several times more health, meaning that unless you and the other players are always focusing fire, each individual enemy becomes near-impossible to kill, unless you have infinite ammo or an ammo regen mod.\n\nSo there you have it. There’s no doubt the game has a lot of problems. I haven’t found time to start on Borderlands 2 yet, but I trust many of these issues are no longer present in the sequel. That being said it was a fairly poor first attempt taking into account that we’re talking about Gearbox.\n\nComplete Review @ http://blurbarians.blogspot.pt/2015/05/borderlands.html#more","May 5, 2015","true","113.8"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/8980/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nBorderlands is a First Person Shooter, which has very witty humor, a great story, and at times a very challenging level system. Because this game is now rather “old” (seeing as it’s 2014) a lot of the mechanics and quest-style will reflect that age. But if you can overlook that, you will undoubtedly enjoy this game.\n\n-Long Winded Review-\nHail Vault Hunters!  I will try to organize my review into sections, if you want a short review, look at my conclusion, if you’re interested about a certain part of the game look up the specific section, hopefully this will be useful instead of annoying. I hope my review will be useful to you.\nIntroduction: (you can skip if you don’t care)\nI'm a firm believer in “gamer loyalty”, so I wanted to play borderlands so that I got the bonus stuff in borderlands 2. So I came into the borderlands backwards, started with the second, then played the first.\nSo naturally there’s a risk doing something like that… you’re basically playing the higher quality game first, then moving on to an older one. It’s like if you played Mario Galaxy and then went back to the N64 Mario games. Analogy aside, you need to appreciate a game for how it plays to play a game in that way, and I do.\n\nStory-Review: (spoiler free)\nSomething I have always liked about the borderland games is its story, and weather you’ve played the first or second borderlands, trust me, the story is excellent, the second expands on what has been done in the first, but you don’t need to play the first to understand it! (That is good game design if I’ve ever seen it.)\nThe story has humor, drama, and twists and turns. Not only that but if you get the DLC you can to continue the fun with some side stories of your favorite (or new) characters in the borderlands!\nOne final comment about the story, after playing through borderlands, I understood things a whole lot better in the second game, just because you have a foundation, and it give that whole “coming back” nostalgia feeling too it in the second game.\n\nCombat: (pew pew pew)\nI played at least a little bit of each class in this game, but I ended up leveling Mordecai, (Because I tend to prefer the sniper play style), although I played as Mordecai, I found myself testing out many different types of weapons. The initial thing that attracted me to borderlands was the concept of having guns that had different stats and abilities. (And believe me, they have many.)\nChoose between a high attack weapon, with terrible accuracy, or high accuracy + low damage + burst fire while zoomed. There really is unlimited potential to the types of weapons out there, the best is when you get weapons with unique abilities like bullet ricochet.\n\nAchievements: (I like achieesements, if you don’t – skip this)\nI know not everyone cares about this in a game, but for those that do, I have soloed most of the achievements in this game however there are plenty that you will need a friend to get. I intend to finish them out, but most of the ones left require some heavy grinding. It’s a very fun game that you get most achievements for just playing through.\nAnyone who’s spent much time going after achievements there’s just that point in the game where you’ve gotten all the easy achievements and everything else require grinding out the work or farming until you get those last few achievements. I still recommend this game even if getting several of the achievements is a headache.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nWhether you get this game for the shooting, the story, the multiplayer feature, the classes, or the achievements, I recommend this game for anyone who is wanting to play a FPS in a more “quest” oriented story, even if you started out playing the first, it’s not that rough at you to go backwards into the borderlands, you’ll be glad you did. Fair warning, when you start out it does require a bit of work to get the hand of (or it did for me) but you can do it once you catch up in levels and gear.\nBest of luck, see you in the Borderlands Vault hunters!\n\n------Edits and updates------\nBorderlands 1\nEdit/Update September 18, 2015:\nHere's the URL to see my review for  Borderlands 2\nHere's the URL to see my review for  The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned\nHere's the URL to see my review for  Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot\nHere's the URL to see my review for  The Secret Armory of General Knoxx\nHere's the URL to see my review for  Claptrap’s New Robot Revolution","December 20, 2013","true","134.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

At the beginning, the game is really easy, maybe a little bit difficult, since I  recognize which enemies i can take on und which not. After i cleared of the first and second area, i thought the game would now be very boring but lucky for me i was wrong.\n\nWhy? Because on the next step of the story, i met a lot of interesting new buildings, new characters and i had a lot of fun to explore the region also to compare the new weapons i found.\n\nNormally, a very good game and i enjoyed playing it, really, but there are more than one areas, where the enemies are fully overpowered and its very difficult to beat them. Fortunately it is more in the middle of the game and at the end. But even at the end i did not recognize what i had to do to beat the last big enemy.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor you germans guys :\n\nIch hatte sehr viel Spass mit dem Spiel, startete in einer großen Umgebung, wurde sehr gut mit der Steuerung des  Spiel vertraut gemacht und konnte völlig entspannt starten. Etwas schwierig fand ich es herauszufinden mit welchen Gegnern ich mich anlegen kann und mit welchen nicht.\nNaja, nachdem ich dann die ersten Karten erkundet habe, hatte ich schon die Befürchtung das es nun sehr langweillig werden wird und sich alles wiederholt.\n\nGlücklicherweise lag ich hier vollkommen falsch, da ich in den neuen Bereichen, die ich nach und nach freischaltete absolut beeindruckende Charaktäre, und auch Landschaften kennenlernte, die mich offen und sprachlos erscheinen ließen.\nNicht weil es so ungewöhnlich ist, sondern weil das Spiel nun schon fast 10 Jahre alt ist und ich es beeindruckend finde was damals schon möglich war.\n\nDa könnten sich viele Spielehersteller eine ordentliche Scheibe von abschneiden. Jedenfalls hat mir das Spiel auf lange Sicht gesehen sehr viel Spass gemacht, einzig an einigen Stellen droschen die Gegnermassen derart auf mich ein, das es mir sehr schwer gefallen ist zu erkennen, auf welche Art und Weise ich dieser Gegnerübermacht Herr werden kann.\n\nGanz besonders hat mir auch die Hintergrundmusik gefallen. Da macht es mir wesentlich mehr Spass Gebiete erneut zu erkunden, da es oftmals vorkommt, das in eigentlich abgeschlossenen Gebieten neue Aufträge freigeschaltet werden.","January 6","true","57.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Arthur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FinnVArthur/","145 products in account","TL;DRAn interesting mix of an Action RPG and an FPS.\n+ Loads of side-quests\n+ Well-balanced for both SP and MP\n+ Setting and atmosphere ('MURICA!)\n+ Memorable characters\n+ Humour\n+ Art style\n+ Loot (some items are viable for a very long time)\n+ Skill trees\n+ Replay value\n+ Soundtrack\n- Picking up multiple items is a chore\n- DLC achievements\n- Relatively weak story\n- It requires an external program to change the FOV\n\nREVIEW\nBorderlands is a FPS game with some RPG elements. A wise man once said: "if Diablo and Battlefield had a baby, it would be Borderlands"*. This game combines the FPP and gunplay with level progression, skill trees, and tons of randomly generated loot.\n\nThe action takes place on a distant planet called Pandora in the future. There are rumours of some treasure being hidden in a Vault. The player can play as one of the four Vault Hunters: Lilith (specialises in deception and elemental weapons), Roland (soldier), Mordecai (sniper and gunslinger), and Brick (brute, specialises in melee and explosives). Each of them is memorable and adds to the game's replay value. Nevertheless, the story is quite weak, especially when compared to Borderlands 2. Pandora is modelled after a post-apocalyptic world, with a number of futuristic elements. Its ambience is enhanced by the unique cell-shaded graphics, marvellous soundtrack, hilarious (in a good sense) voice acting, and sense of humour. 'MURICA!\n\nThe gameplay revolves around shooting the bad guys in the face, getting their loot, and completing quests. There is a myriad of side-quests and even more weapons. Albeit the gunplay has been heavily consolised, it is fun to use all the guns. Apart from shooting, every character has a unique active skill and a skill tree. For instance, Roland can deploy a turret, which can be further upgraded to provide ammo and health to everyone nearby. Moreover, there are weapon proficiencies (bonuses for using each weapon type) and challenges to complete (e.g. scoring a certain amount of critical hits, collecting dollars, etc.). Apart from getting the loot from chests and enemies, one can also visit a few types of vendor machines. There are numerous open areas which the players can explore on foot or by car. There also is a fast travel system to navigate through them.\n\nThere are a few nuisances. Firstly, picking up mutliple items at once has a very short radius, making it somewhat tedious to gather all the loot. Secondly, in order to change the FOV, one has to use an external program. The default FOV may work fine on consoles but it is not suited for PCs. And lastly, the DLC achievements require a huge amount of grinding and some of them are purely luck-based.\n\nIn summary, Borderlands is a great game that can be enjoyed while playing solo or with friends. Its ambience and mechanics make it an outstanding title even now. I strongly recommend it. A 9/10.\n\n*Or something along those lines.\n\nP.S.

The weapons look less like toy guns and more like actual guns. The random loot is more useful. The main story is way weaker, but I enjoy the DLCs more. Overall, if you want the "hardcore" loot-grinding-FPS gameplay, there is no reason to pick this over the second game, since it is superior regarding the core gameplay. But if you just wanna do some casual shooting n' looting on Pandora, this one is just as good, sometimes even better.\nIf you have a weaker computer, or a lesser budget, yet still want the "borderlands vibe", then this game is for all intents and purposes, the same as the second.","June 24, 2014","true","74.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It sounded cool. Procedurally generated guns? A neat-looking world? Awesome. Then they made it cell-shaded, which was... well, weird, but fun. The resulting game? Pretty fun too. It's seared into my memory as nothing less than pleasant awesomeness. I can't even begin to tell you how much fun I had pretending to be someone's hat by riding around on top of their car in my own.\n\nI was the best hat.\n\nFinding a loot chest felt good. Spending time jumping around the maps felt right. The enemies were neat, the guns inventive, the bosses kinda fun. It took me a long while to kill the final boss--where a friend killed it in less than half a second. Okay, so I didn't get the best loot on the planet, but I still had a blast. The game was funny, too. While the actual plot could have been better, the story told in logs and lore was amusing, and the character barks were great.\n\nWhere Borderlands really excelled, however, was the DLC. Doctor Zed was a minor disappointment, not because it wasn't funny (it was hilarious), and not because it didn't have a lot of content (it had a lot of content), but because some of the content was an awful lot of "hey, go there, kill a thousand of that, bring me back some brains." This got a bit old after a while. Moxxi's arena DLC was, well, an arena DLC. Not all that fun. But then, like a spark of inspiration from the gods, we got The Secret Army of General Knoxx, which had like twelve to fifteen hours of content, cost $10, was fun, well-written, smart, and excellent. It is still the gold standard for DLC. After that we got Claptrap's Robot Revolution, which was not quite as excellent, but we're talking Jaws to Jurassic Park here--still greats, regardless of which one you value more.\n\nBorderlands is still, years after its release, a game worth playing. I still know most of the maps by heart, still have memories of some of my finest battles ingrained in my mind. Still feel a bit odd when playing the sequel and not having Bloodwing by my side. You definitely don't want to just skip it and head straight for Borderlands 2.\n\nOnly complaints? It wasn't a great PC port, so it had no FOV slider and used Gamespy for its online multiplayer component, meaning it was really hard to play with certain people.","November 26, 2013","true","105.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

(I will explain why in the BAD section) I've spent around 30 hours into this game so far, and I must admit that this is one of the best CO-OP games to have fun, I finished it with my girlfriend and we are still having fun getting all possible achievements and finishing the rest of the "story" on DLC content. This is the game for those who have 1-2 hours per day to spend on something and have fun with someone (in this case girlfriend, boyfriend, friends etc...doesn't really matter) since it's an awesome experience. I highly recommend you gettings this game, altho I can't recommend DLC content because it's simply not worth the money, well it is if you're buying full package (in the end you finish spending only 10€ on all 4 DLCs instead od 8€ on each).\n\nBADOky doky now bad things, where do I start? This game has some pretty bad issues with performance, whole game was running on 60FPS (since it's locked at 60) and once I got into DLC areas it simply drops to 30FPS sometimes and gets locked down, no matter where you look it's 30FPS no matter what. I don't know why, is it because DLC content wasn't optimzied but just ported to PC or something? There are some connection issues also, party members not able to joinn the game once you start it, not being able to rejoin from the invite section, some items doesn't display correctly for people in party, and loads of problems with invincible and disappearing enemies, now you see them, now you don't. I hope that second game in the series doesn't have the same issues, since I'm planing to play Borderlands 2 also. One more thing to note...seems like developers spent more time working on DLC content than the actual game, which is a shame, they simply put every second into polishing and finishing the DLC content in every single detail, it's much more rich content wise than the actual game (more things to disconer in one area of the DLC map than you will find in the 40% of the actual game), the only problem with DLC content is performance.","March 15","true","105.8"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","12","18","2","2"

It can be challenging, yet easy at the same time. But no matter what difficulty the mission is, it's rewarding and fun. With the exceptions of some of the DLC missions. A few of them are very annoying, such as Ned's Zombie Island's TK is alive! Brains series of missions, or the Clap Trap revolution DLC where you have to collect Clap Trap components. Other than that, Borderlands is amazing, and still holds up well with games today, and is easily one of my favorite games.","May 16, 2015","true","174.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

An excellent FPS is more like sci-fi FPS, that occur on world called - Pandora - and counts with a few RPG elements, since loot, to level up system. Is great!\n\nGraphically speaking could be a bit weired for some of you, i still remember the first time i saw a trailer and i was meh.. but i started liking the details, textures. Thanks to the cell shading, the game could hide behind pretty simple textures without appearing low-res, as the game does not have to look realistic.\n\nBefore we enter Pandora we have 4 characters to choose - The Hunter, Soldier, Siren e Berserker - that are all great and in case you play COOP, is better each of you use a different class. then you have the lvl up system, you will gain XP when you the main, secondary quest, also doing the challenges the game offer is great way to rank up.\n\nAfter you get your character, you are now good to enter in Pandora, and i must say is not a pretty place to be - laughs - lot of bad guys to kill and some weird dudes too. about the game difficulty, well is not too hard perhaps if you play solo some parts could be a little tricky but you will do it for sure.\n\nAfter beating the main boss you can do a new playthrough, there enemies/boss will be a bit tough, is like doing transition from normal to hard.\n\nIf you are someone like me, who love loot you will love this game, loot everywhere. There are a lot of ways to get the better loot, farming boss, chase the safe etc.. Like in normal games loot has many categories - green, blue, purple, orange e pearlescent - and of course everyone wants that orange one!\n\nAlso Borderlands has a huge variety of guns to choose, so you won't get bored of it.\n\nThat's it, i totally recommend you play this game, solo or in COOP and enjoy your journey in Pandora.\n\n~ 8,5/10","November 27, 2013","true","8.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","3"

Indeed, if you're looking for a good time with friends, you really can't beat the levity and wit of the Borderlands franchise. This first game has only very minor issues (and I'm nitpicking): co-op can be unbalanced with different rewards and disparate leveling at times (depending on what your build is, you can level up much more quickly than your mates). Besides that, rare gun drops are few and far between. Make sure you get the DLC as nearly all add to the fun, with the exception of the tedious Moxxi's Underdome.\n\n","December 5, 2014","true","125.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

The story is more than decent, although a bit drawn-out: you're a vault-hunter, lookng for the ultimate prize on a most inhostible planet, Pandora. You make progress through the vast landscapes of the planet, fighting lots and lots of monsters, bad-guys, and some VERY badass bossess (they're even labelled as such!). The actual fighting and shooting is extremely well done: every gun, every type of weapon has a great "feeling" to it and firing it is very satisying.\n\nBut there is more, much more to Borderlands. First of all, there are literally thousands, nay, hundreds of thousands of guns waiting to be looted. The game makes use of a random-generated drop-system, with ligher level enemies dropping more interesting and more unique loot. These are devided into several colours, with white being the most common ones, and going right up to purple and very rare green items. This system just works perfectly for me: it's so satisfying to keep on fighting, just hoping for that even better gun to drop.\n\nBut Borderlands is not only a very well crafted first-person shooter, it's also a RPG up to a certain extent. There is some sort of levelling-system which gives you action points, to be invested in better skills. You can also choose from four quite different classes at the beginning of the game, and having played each of them, I can say that all four have a unique feel to them. This really augments the singleplayer experience! As for multiplayer, it's almost - but not quite! - dead by now, but you really want this game for the immersive, action-packed singleplayer. Highly recommended!\n\nGameplay: 25/30\nGraphics: 16/20 (shell-shaded and very atmospheric, but sometimes a tad dull, brown and grey)\nSound: 7/10 (I like the totally different gun-sounds, but ambietent sounds could have been better)\nReplayability/longelivety: 14/20 singleplayer has really tons of gameplay, potentially you could play four times as each class)\nTechnical/stability: 18/20 (very smooth experience, tons of options to scale according to your rig)\n\nOverall: 80/100\n\nPlayed on a Intel Core2 Duo @2,66 GHz; Radeon HD 5850 & 4GB RAM","July 14, 2014","true","182.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

You can pick from four different characters Brick, Roland, Lilith and Mordecai\n\nThe game is an RPG infused FPS. You run around killing stuff and looting chest for better equipment. The game is very fun and getting better equipment is also incredibly fun. The four characters you choose from have different abilities. Brick has berserk mode where he punches stuff and in rage mode regains health, Mordecai releases his pet Bloodwing which is a one hit kill on a random enemy in the battlefield or damages bosses, Roland puts down a turret which kills anything it sees and Lilith goes into phaselock mode where she goes invisible and after that releases a shockwave which kills or damages anyone around them. Each character is awesome but it's best to use the one to suit your play style the best.\n\nGraphics are awesome. The cell shaded look is awesome and even though some of the textures are mediocre this game is very appealing. The environments are very bland since all of them are deserts. I'm still very glad that the change from realistic to cell shaded happened.\n\nAudio is mediocre, I like some of the soundtrack but overall it's very bland. The gun sounds are awesome and everything but a lot of it is re used and some of the sound effects are quite bad.  Overall very mediocre sound design\n\nThe game can get quite tough at certain points, some of the enemies are higher levels than you and will kill you in seconds. Your best option is to do every side quest to level so the later sections in the game aren't as tough.\n\nLevel design is alright for the most part but some of the maps in the later sections of the game get really confusing. Overall it's okay for the most part.\n\nThe main game itself took me 18 hours to complete everything with every side quest, with all the dlc it took me around 30 hours. The game also has tons of replay value, you can play Ultimate Vault Hunter and True Hunter which are more difficult versions of the game and you can also try the different characters and not to mention you can always play the game with friends which is a lot of fun.\n\nThe game has one big problem. It's incredibly buggy. I've had many problems playing the game and DLC and constantly look for solutions to the problems I was having. Some of the issues were quests not showing up, I couldn't turn in quests. get stuck in the environments and fall through the levels. Overall there's nothing too game breaking and with enough time you could find a fix for the problems.\n\nBorderlands is a must play for everyone. To date this is one of my favorite games of all time. This game is incredibly fun and funny too. This is incredibly fun game and even despite the issues this is a must play for everyone. My suggestion is get the main game and skip the DLC's cause they're not very good but if you want more then sure go ahead and buy it but I suggest saving your money for Borderlands 2. This is a must play for everyone. I give Borderlands a 9/10\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","July 11, 2015","true","31.1"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

Tons and tons of guns! This game is honestly just perfect. There's plenty of enemy variety and guns that your character specializes in that makes combat diverse and entertaining. The world of Pandora is yours to loot as you constantly keep searching for that better gun, and trust me, that itself is very addicting. I often find myself just running around looking for a new gun to blast some bandit's head off with. And the Eridian Weapons.... my god, the Eridian weapons. Ever wanted to snipe a Badass enemy with a bolt of lighting? Maybe you want to kill some Psychos with exploding energy balls? You can do all that and much more here.

Action packed, no joke the action never stops. A lot of achevements and weapon effects! The game is even fun after you finish it! You can choose to play it all again ( I recoment that ) with your whole inventory and level kept the same! 4 Player co-op is just the cheery on top! I don't think it would be as fun as it was playing it the first time with my friend! The one thing it does lack however is vehicles, it only has one (Or two if you count the rocket launcher and machine gun types different) and ofcourse you can customize the colour. But still the lack of vehicles in the game is not a setback. Also a good thing is that this game can run on a ,,potato".

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/recommended/8980/","whoota","[T-A!] Whoota","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/","307 products in account","When something is called Pandora, you can bet your marbles something bad is going down.\n\nFor those of you who are not so well versed on the subject of Greek mythology, Pandora was the name of woman who was sent to earth by the gods as punishment for their disrespectful actions. Pandora was moulded by the smithgod and endowed with all the desireable traits anyone would want in a person. Lastly they gave her boundless curiosity. She was then given a box (or an urn depending on your textbook) and sent to earth with the simple message to never open the box. What was in the box you ask? Well...despair, terror, disgust, disease, death, pain, agony, greed, lust and lastly: hope. Pandora opened her box and the world was made miserable and the only respite was the tiny bit of hope at the bottom.\n\nNow that we have a context, can you image what is hidden on a planet called Pandora? Há! Wrong! It's guns! Guns and bullets and rockets and bullets and bullets. There are so many bullets on Pandora you'll be wondering why people are still paying with cash when you can get bullets and guns from everywhere. The whole point of the game is to open a mythological vault (Pandora's Vault. See where this is going?) On your way you'll be beset by all manner of horrors and fiends. So it is nice that you can pick up guns everywhere and share your bullets with everyone. Obviously I meant: shoot at everyone. Stuff gets a bit blurry after a while cause the game is so vast, so huge, you'll be dragging yourself from one end of the planet to the other over and over again, and everything looks the same. This is my chief complaint with this game: It is huge, but doesn't offer much in the way of streamlining. There is some fast travel possible, but only from certain places. You can also rent cars, but arbitrary barriers stop you from driving them all over the place. So if walking is not your thing, steer clear.\n\nHowever, if hearing the screams of bandits, as they dissolve into a sloppy pile of green goop after you shot them with a round filled with acid then you are in for a delicious treat. Borderlands drops a lot of weapons. You can compare and contrast to find what suits your class best and go to town on people's face with it. Zap 'em. Burn 'em. Melt'em or Blast them into tiny bits. All off course accentuated by delicious screams of pain and horror. What do you mean "thats grim?" That isn't grim at all. That's life on Pandora man. You better get used to it, cause you'll be doing it a lot.\n\nA funny thing about how the game presents itself is its classification system. A normal wolf-like enemy would be a normal wolf. A big one would be an Alpha Wolf, and a giant, burning and barking monstrosity would be a Badass Wolf. This trend developes, and it makes it easy to gauge what you can deal with, and what will certainly kill you. Dying then triggers a short moment where you can save youself by killing anything on the screen to prevent a hefty ressurection fine. Of course, you can mitigate all of that with the help of some friends.\n\nYou can play the game with up to three friends at the same time. Everyone helps both eachother and themselves when completing quests. However, don't think it is weird to have all out brawls over who gets the good loot.

Anyone who has clocked in enough time in Borderlands 2 will know that finding anything better than Green is fairly uncommon, but in this you will be find 10 times better and more varied loot and twice as often.\n- Fairer Scaling. The scaling in this game is Linear instead of Borderlands 2's Exponential, meaning that when you find a powerful weapon, it will be useful for much longer before having to replace it with a more powerful weapon.\n- Easier to run. Granted this is just due to it being older but even still, it's something I guess.\n- Cheaper. Again this is just due to it's age, but still, the GOTY is cheaper than the bsae game of Borderlands 2.\n- Backstory to Borderlands 2.\n- Able to play as Brick, Roland, Lilith and Mordecai. Awesome NPCs, Awesomer Playable characters.\n- Modding ability. This game can actually have modded content, although it's not officially supported by the devs.\n\nPersonal Opinion:\n- Different feel. This game has a more dark and serious feel than the second Borderlands game. Some people may like it, some may not.\n- All the Areas have the same look to them. Every area is either a desert-like area, run-down buildings or Atlas buildings, with the Zombie DLC and the final area being the only exceptions. Again this can be a matter of opinion.\n\nCons:\n- Skill Trees. The characters skill trees aren't as fleshed out as in Borderlands 2, with the major gamechanger 1 point skills not being there. While i'm not in any way saying the skill trees are bad, they're just lacking something that Borderlands 2 has.\n- Voice acting. The voice acting in this game can feel very hit or miss at times, with some characters sounding cool, while others feel very flat and last-minute.\n- Animations. Same as above, some animations are good, while others feel robotic and basic.\n\nOverall\nWorth getting if you want to see where it all started, although as a first purchase in the Borderlands franchise, it's better going with number 2. Get if on sale and definitely get the GOTY.\n8/10","March 18, 2015","true","176.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/javokis/recommended/8980/","javokis","Javokis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/javokis/","318 products in account","My Borderlands 1 Review\n\nSUMMARY\n\nBorderlands 1 is an awesome mix of FPS and RPG; Taking a procedural weapon system like Diablo then adding in a tactical FPS system like Stalker. After having played Borderlands 2 then going back to Borderlands 1 out of nostalgia, I can say this game feels much less polished. While still a pinnacle gem of its time, Borderlands 1 now feels more like a beta engine containing the prologue to Borderlands 2. This prologue still has much to offer, but read on for details on my opinions of some of the game's features.\n\nTECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES\n\nFirst issue I had coming back to Borderlands 1 is the FOV [Field of View] on my 1080p monitor. The FOV defaults to 70, which long ago I didn't notice was so bad on my 1440x900 16:10 monitor I used way back when. On my new HD 16:9 1080p monitor it looks like I have training goggles on that are creating tunnel vision. I had to search the web to find workarounds for this issue, but could only come up with a quick key binding as a solution. Unfortunately, my FOV continues to reset to 70 every time I mount a vehicle or gun placement. Borderlands 2 doesn't have this issue and allows FOV adjustments in the main menu settings.\n\nPROCEDURAL WEAPONS\n\nWhile innovative at the time with plenty of stat variation, weapon brand names were not as distinctive in Borderlands 1 as they are in Borderlands 2. Most of the weapon models felt reused constantly no matter what the brand was. The weapon mechanics and procedural system mostly made brand name a stat adjustment. So going back to Borderlands 1 with some brand loyalty didn't lead to any feeling of distinction or difference in tactics. The lack of brand distinction made Borderlands 1 weapons rather shallow with no lore behind them.\n\nFinding new weapons in Borderlands 1 was a rather odd ball inconsistent process of trial and farming. I didn't realize this at the time, but it appears that even a level 21 bandit can drop a level 4 standard weapon. At least in Borderlands 2, the loot drops were very close to the enemy's level rather than so far away. The feeling of reward vs. difficulty in Borderlands 1 is not as good as Borderlands 2.\n\nThere is a slight bug that causes weapons to appear lower in level when equipped. Looking into it further it seems to be related to the proficiency of the weapon type. From what I hear, this is residual left over code from a feature that was canceled at launch that allowed players to equip higher level weapons as if they are lower level. The change has nothing to do with the weapon's function, which concerned me at first when I started noticing it.\n\nSTORY AND QUESTS\n\nIn a lot of ways, the content of the story and the way quests are handled felt very much like Stalker-lite, but without the immersive element.  Voice acting was limited and the way quests were logged was a bit too simplistic. The compass tracking system was almost useless to me along with feeling clunky. Navigating the map in the menu was also clunky due to how it handled the current active quest. In Borderlands 2 this was considerably fixed up and even optimized.\n\nThe plot was all over-the-top brutal humor with a ton of awkward fun. But was only skin deep, consisting of some villain monologue [which was always hilarious], but mostly instructional dialog by various characters you meet. The characters you meet didn't offer much beyond their initial introduction. There's really no emotional attachments to be had with any of the NPCs. The lack of NPC interaction beyond getting some transmission chatter kind of made Borderlands 1 feel lifeless, which was an issue that was addressed with Borderlands 2.\n\nCOMBAT AND AI\n\nMy first impression before Borderlands 2 was actually quite good [and still is], but I've played a lot of games before coming back to Borderlands 1. I notice things now... things I didn't see before that are important to me.\n\nI've always been annoyed by horribly inaccurate weapons that give me that "Naked Gun 2 1/2 - Gun Fight" feeling.  I am especially annoyed when an enemy that is dead center on my scope takes a missed shot to the point of emptying my "sniper" rifle.  It doesn't help when you stagger from every single hit you take even if it's a distant glazing blow impacting upon a fully charged shield. Much like Stalker, weapons in Borderlands 1 can be weird and misleading when it comes to accuracy through aiming. This issue was fixed in Borderlands 2 since you can see the crosshair shrink for a moment as you focus in allowing for a more precise experience with an aimed weapon.\n\nEnemies in Borderlands 1 can also feel a bit awkward, but they still have that signature hilarious dialog that leaves you giggling hysterically while trying to shoot straight with an already inaccurate weapon.  AI navigation is a bit more problematic as midgets have a much harder time moving up ramps or even around corners to charge at you. If the navigation was any worse, you would think that you were playing with Doom 1 AI programming. Even AI vs. AI interaction was sketchy at best as the AI would prioritize the player at random intervals without ever checking line-of-sight. Some modest improvements were done to the AI in Borderlands 2.\n\nThe enemy spawn rate is very aggressive in Borderlands 1, giving players no real opportunity to truly clear an area before another wave of enemies hit the field. This was a double edged sword as leveling and finding loot was easier to do in Borderlands 1 because of the aggressive spawn rate. On the other hand, if you were struggling in a large area while trying to escape back to the fast travel station, you would be in for a constant wave of ambushing on the return trip. Borderlands 2 toned that spawn rate down quite a bit.\n\nThere is one big problem that has not been address in Borderlands 2. There are a ton of bad navigation issues that involve getting stuck on terrain and being blocked by invisible walls on ramps. On several occasions, I'll get stuck on a hill of loose debris or the corner of a small ramp while attempting to kite an enemy.  I really wish Gearbox took the time to smooth out their levels before launch.\n\nCUSTOMIZATION\n\nYou get to pick a different color for your character and vehicle. That's it. You don't even get to view your real model when you do the customization - just a 2d portrait is used.  Thus another thing that was totally fixed in Borderlands 2.\n\nOVERALL\n\nStill addictive and still playing despite its flaws, but will likely be logging more hours into Borderlands 2 here soon.","December 11, 2014","true","124.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

It brings in an innovative plotline, with twists, turns, and everything around. It also adds 87 BAZILLIONONDIEREST GUNS, allowing players to really shoot 'n' loot, and kicks a** in general.\n\nPlot:\nBorderlands isn't linear. You can choose your way through Pandora, and do whatever the crap you want. It has approx. 30hrs. of Singleplayer gameplay for ONE PLAYTHROUGH, and countless more for the 2nd playthrough, four characters and DLC maps. In addition, there are progressive enemies, scaling up so you're never bored!\n\nGraphics/Performance:\nBorderlands is widely regarded as gray, grey, brown and grey. While I agree, it does have some beautiful art, and amazing guns. It can run on the modest of computers (mine is 2GB RAM, and it worked well on low settings), but is also a monster on those 16GB Alienware computers. Lag is non-existent, and the stuttering you get from COD: Whatevercrap doesn't exist.\n\nRPG/Skills:\nBorderlands adds a plethora of things to the shooting genre; customize your character with skill points, and morph them into whatever builds you want! In addition, players can swap out elemental relics to customize action skils, and that decisions in-game result into different out-guns, largely allowing customization. The guns in-game truly allow personality, with four elements, and 8 different manufacturers.\n\nReally, Borderlands is a great game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/recommended/8980/","Stefneh","Stefneh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/","777 products in account","At first I thought this game was pretty bad, I started it with a few friends but in honesty we were useless at it, we didn’t get very far and were playing it in completely the wrong order. I wrote the game off as bad and I was convinced I would never finish it.  I restarted with someone else and I was actually very surprised what an impact the people you play with can make. This time it was played properly (no offence, guys) and the game grew on me very quickly.\nAdmittedly it’s slow when it comes to storyline, it took a little while for me to feel like there was actually a purpose to the game and I wasn’t just doing the same stuff over and over. When I look at it that way, you pretty much are doing the same thing over and over, but as the storyline unfolds I didn’t even really notice that anymore. There is a lot in this game to keep you distracted, one key part of that being the weapon system. It’s the first game I had played where “loot” was a big thing and it being a first person shooter only made that even better. There’s a massive range of weapons with different stats and abilities for you to find, in all kinds of shapes, sizes and rarities.\nThat being said, I would never play this game solo. The co-op in this game is what makes it for me. That is very likely to be different for a lot of other people, so most people should just ignore that part, for me it just wasn’t something I would do on my own. I know for a fact I would get bored long before the end if I was on my own. So if you are like me, make sure you bring someone along you enjoy spending your time with.\nIt’s a fairly lengthy game, and there’s a number of classes you can complete it with. The characters all have certain charms about them, they are all completely different from each other and with the whole RPG like elements in this game it’s a good reason to come back and play again.

I wrote the game off as bad and I was convinced I would never finish it.  I restarted with someone else and I was actually very surprised what an impact the people you play with can make. This time it was played properly (no offence, guys) and the game grew on me very quickly.\nAdmittedly it’s slow when it comes to storyline, it took a little while for me to feel like there was actually a purpose to the game and I wasn’t just doing the same stuff over and over. When I look at it that way, you pretty much are doing the same thing over and over, but as the storyline unfolds I didn’t even really notice that anymore. There is a lot in this game to keep you distracted, one key part of that being the weapon system. It’s the first game I had played where “loot” was a big thing and it being a first person shooter only made that even better. There’s a massive range of weapons with different stats and abilities for you to find, in all kinds of shapes, sizes and rarities.\nThat being said, I would never play this game solo. The co-op in this game is what makes it for me. That is very likely to be different for a lot of other people, so most people should just ignore that part, for me it just wasn’t something I would do on my own. I know for a fact I would get bored long before the end if I was on my own. So if you are like me, make sure you bring someone along you enjoy spending your time with.\nIt’s a fairly lengthy game, and there’s a number of classes you can complete it with. The characters all have certain charms about them, they are all completely different from each other and with the whole RPG like elements in this game it’s a good reason to come back and play again. Which is always good, replay-ability in a game is never a problem.\nAs well as this being the first first-person shooter RPG-like looting game I had ever played, this was also the first game I had ever played that used cell-shading in the graphics, and I have to say that I loved it.

Plain and simple really. In fact, there are literally only a handful of games I'd willingly replay in their original entirety. And Borderlands is one of them.\n\nAround 2011 I got in a near-fatal accident I'm STILL recovering from physically. My whole world flipped upside-down and I stopped talking to most people I knew after. Even the people I did know...I started to slowly float away from.\n\nTo say Borderlands was an escape is an understatement.\n\nGames these days are insecure. They have drawn out tutorials, boring or complicated UI, and to be honest...not usually worth a second playthrough. Can't say any of that about BL. The one thing I love most about this game is the atomsphere. You're doing your thing, but you don't really feel like everything is about YOU. Moreso, you're a part of this huge world and you're able to explore it. The writing...oh my goodness...moar. now.\n\nI can't really finish this review because all I'll do is gush. Get this game.

The typical storyline, character story, dialogues and missions I knew from BL2 were already present in Borderlands and as expected I loved them all.\nWhile playing the whole game and its DLCs, I felt like Borderlands is way slower to play than the second game.\nI think that if you’re used to playing co-op and you play Borderlands on your own, this will most likely result in boredom. I mean… How can you laugh at a duel when if you’re not playing co-op?\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=294503913\n\nContras:\nDepending on your graphic card, you may not have Steam Overlay.\nI’d say that Borderlands could become quite boring if you play by yourself. Didn’t happen for me, but I generally prefer coop games, so I seldom play any game solo. I’d recommend playing Borderlands with friends though – sharing the experience is always more fun.\n\nPros:\nI had a lot of laughs and Borderlands is generally funny, but humour is highly individual, so this varies with the player. As already said – I love the dialogues and the playable character’s lines (Brick’s simple desire for ‘MORE!!!!’ made me laugh more than once).\nRagdolls can be sooo funny! (and yes! That’s definitely a pro point :D)\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=297298935\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=294504288\n\nDLCs:\nThe available DLCs are a good addition to the main game in general and of course if you’re an achievement hunter, then the DLCs are a must have.\nIf you don’t care about the achievements, then you shouldn’t buy and play Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot. This DLC is basically waves of enemies and killing them not only doesn’t give you any XP, but also doesn’t count for any of the challenges.\nThe other DLCs (The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned; The Secret Armory of General Knoxx and Claptrap's Robot Revolution) are quite fun until the point you decide to go for achievements. Trust me when I say getting all Claptrap's Robot Revolution will take some serious farming.\nWhat I felt like really unnecessary was the looooong driving in The Secret Armory of General Knoxx. I know the DLC introduced new vehicles, which is great, but the decision about the amount of driving should have been left with the player. What I try to say is – more fast travel stations would have been better.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you look for logic, then look somewhere else. Why? Because BORDERLANDS!!!!!","September 25, 2014","true","109.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lickbrains/recommended/8980/","lickbrains","Junebug #1376","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lickbrains/","281 products in account","Considering the release date (2009), I imagine this game was top-tier for its time. Borderlands is unique, it's funny, it's got balanced classes, and a great new mix of FPS-RPG. It was fresh...in 2009-2011. However, I can't recommend this game to players who are used to the streamlined gameplay mechanics and witty dialogue that its successors possess. I tried picking this up three times. It's very hard to get into after playing Borderlands 2. Unless you're a masochist...or a really dedicated fan of the series and wanna finish it just to say you did.\n\nThere are a lot of flaws in this installment that was addressed in the latter games. For instance, you're given quests to do only to run all the way back to turn in and fetch another quest—and tedious sidequests are mandatory if you don't wanna insta-die to mobs three levels higher than you. But if the mobs are one level higher, they're suddenly no match for you (doesn't make sense). For a game that's supposed to be open world, it plays very linear. Many quests are hard in the worst possible way: mobs are difficult—not because they have challenging mechanics—but because they come in swarms and they have massive health pools. That gets boring really fast. There is no ammo sharing, you have to manually pick up eeeeverything, no mini-map (you have an incomprehensibly broken compass), and there are rarely any voice-overs. The world feels as bland and lifeless as its sidequests—don't expect the vibrancy of Pandora that we see in Borderlands 2 to be here. It ain't there.\n\nFor its time, it was brilliant and fresh. For now, where quests no longer feel like chores, it's deeply flawed. I see why some fans of this game don't like Borderlands 2—it's sillier and full of memes and pop culture references (which I enjoy). It's rough around the edges but I'm glad I played this because I appreciate the sequels that much more.\n\nIf I played it first, 8/10. But I didn't so—3/10 (I'm sorry ;~;).","January 20, 2015","true","10.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

So I highly recommend to play this game before its sequel. It has almost everything that it's sequel has, just not as good. If you play those two games in chronological order, you won't notice how BL falls behind BL2 almost in every aspect, except for the loot system, perhaps. I finished BL and all of it's DLCs and then I finished the BL2 main story and then I switched back to BL again to play it with my friend, but it just didn't feel that great anymore. The character development and the story felt slow and only after we reached the middle of the game did things start to happen and it was the fun fast-paced action-filled post-apocalyptic experience everyone is looking for!\n\nDon't get me wrong! It's a great game. One of the best FPS CoOps out there. It's just that you need to get pass level 10 to see its true glory.\n\nPROS:\n- beautiful, immersing and vast deserted world (similar to that of Rage or Fallout)\n- tons of various weapons (even more than in BL2 and without the limitations of what the combinations might be)\n- cool upgradable characters (although, IMO, the Soldier's skill tree makes him by far the best, and that's a shame, if you want to replay the game with another character)\n- cool unplayable characters\n- interesting story; funny jokes\n- lot's of easter eggs and secrets to explore\n- DLCs worth of purchasing (I would even say that they're better than the main game)\n\nNEUTRAL: less enemies to shoot, which means less action, but also more time for calm exploration\n\nCONS:\n- Moxxi's Underdome DLC is too hard, IMO\n- It's not possible to complete one of the side mission's in the Secret Armory of General Knoxx, because you can't access the location, in which it's located, although you could before\n- 3rd party account/software is required for CoOp\n- Level caps and it's not possible to unlock all the skills\n- Picking up loot and ammo just by running over it was introduced in BL2; here you have to do it manually\n\nOverall rating: 8.5/10","November 24, 2014","true","100.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The screenshots are a joke, the game itself really shines. But if you want humour, buy Borderlands 2. Let's move on with the pro's and con's.\n\nLet's get the con's out of the way, shall we?\n- Travelling to another place/location takes some of your time.\n- Inventory space is ok, but not the best. Although I like the fact that it makes these games more challenging.\n- Some missions are impossible, even if your level is recommended.\n\nAnd now... *drum music* the pro's!\n+ Made in Unreal Engine 3, one of the best engine's in my opinion.\n+ You don't need a gaming pc to run this stuff, my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pc handles this game with Medium-High settings on 40+ FPS. If you can run Team Fortress 2/XCOM: Enemy Unknown, your pc will probably handle this game.\n+ Loot, loot and... Omg! More loot! :'D And alot of weapons!\n+ Great characters like Claptrap.\n+ Good story.\n+ Scared the ♥♥♥♥ out of me when I saw my first Psycho in the game.\n+ Many missions, open world. It's an official RPS (Role-Playing-Shooter) game.\n\nTL;DR: This game isn't the average Shilectronic Farts game, it's a great open world shooter. Try the experience for yourself.\n\nI rate this game 10/10, it kept me playin' ;)","November 11, 2015","true","64.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Great intro vid rare in games today the vid intro is what I would say one of the best parts for my experience with the 2009 hit from Cage The Elephant "Ain't No Rest For The Wicked" first time I watch it a year ago I am like "Oh yeah I used to hate this song but now I am digging it and it's fits so perfectly with the game's settings and all" etc. Anyways the intro vid is what grappled my attention so well but asides a video the game itself is just......MARVELOUS. This is not like Bioshock for those who have played that form 2KGames. This is Borderlands it's own game. Very originnal and you can get endlesss hours of fun and gameplay either by yourself or with others. THis game is one of those few games that asides great comic effects and visuals the MP is actually worth every cent the game is. The MP is where it's at the SP is good too but the MP is what makes this game epic. This game is like a much more graphic version of Serious Sam and less serious than Mad Max series. I would reccomend this game to anyone literally especially those looking for challenge, in depth gameplay, lots to do and MP based gaming. The Game should run decently on almost any pc for my HP G56 laptop it works like a charm on lowest settings but the game is best on a real gaming pc etc. Game itself is a 9.5/10 in my book only lacking a few settings and optimization options. But this is amongst my favorites and is not overhyped like many other games. THis game is a lot like the films: Mad Max, Titan A.E., Heavy Metal 2000, Heavy Metal (1980), I am Legend, Escape From NY, Treasure Planet and other post-apocalyptic films. This game is centered on one of four characters/classes, a Siren, Soldier, Hunter, and Brick. Each one has it's perks and downfalls, but the game is mostly the same experience just certain things easier and others not. Anyways amongst the four whichever you choose gets a random vision/message from a mysteirous girl/woman, to instructions to getting to the mythical but real vault treasure of the planet Pandora which is filled with wonders, and Loot. The point of the game is to be alive, kill bandits, and to get as much loot as possible and of course get the mythic treasure for yourself. The game is a lot like Fallout 3/New Vegas, Serious Sam kind of themed but it's truly a full on original fun experience with a lot of comical relief compared to the any of the examples mentioned beforehand I mean this game is filled with humour and it's good in general. One of the few FPS's I have respect for since it's not a COD or anything of the sort all in all the game is a hit, Fresh, and just a truly amazing game in general the sequel is even better on almost every aspect must have game for everyone!","September 28, 2014","true","37.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I need not have worried. Borderlands is one of the best games I’ve played. The visuals are very impressive and suck you right in. This is open-world gaming at it’s best, with many large maps to explore as you complete the numerous missions. There are hundreds of weapons to collect and use, or sell along the way (gathering loot quickly becomes addictive). A wide variety of enemies will take you on as you progress up the levels. The combat is varied and the AI is good if not exceptional. Although there’s little story to speak of there’s enough humour to just about make up for this.

Well, it worked for Nukem: Forever--... Right?)\nThis game holds my favorite level series in almost any video game, Fort Knoxx.

I don't think I would have played this in single player, I think my review would have been worse if I had played it alone.\n\nThere are a lot of things that I disliked more than I liked about this game. FIrst off, I did not like the story, a lot of people say that the missions don't seem to tell you WHY you need to do them, and it's true, for the mayority. I think it's just mainly for leveling up and adding extra content to the game which had really nothing to do with the story. Honestly I got lost with all the side missions, I kept forgetting what was happening. Lots of the side missions were also very repetitive, a lot of times I found myself wanting to stop playing. Honestly I would have liked that there were more story related missions to the point that you absolutely have to reach level 60 to finish the game in its entirety. And that's probably too much to ask.\n\nI don't like that I would find that one awesome gun and use it for almost 10 levels, to the point that other types of weapons became more useful than that one I absolutely loved. It would take another 5 levels to find one of the same type that might be just as awesome, but that may be my personal opinion I guess.\n\nI HIGHLY disliked that the bosses were REALLY easy.. most of them didn't even touch my shield, and I know, it was co-op, but even so I think it was way too easy to the point that random enemies that spawn as you explore the map seemed to be harder than a boss fight? I don't think that's right. I also noticed that the game become very easy after maybe level 20, maybe even before that.. a bit disappointing to be honest.\n\nHonestly, I liked the fact that I could play this with someone else, otherwise I wouldn't have even touched it, even if I had bought it. I like the game mostly for its FPS more than anything, and the RPG style of the game when it comes to the skills. It's really fun to play co-op I can't deny that, I had fun playing it. I also liked the graphics. I don't know if I would recommend it to someone, maybe if they played with other people but for single player, I can't see myself recommending it to anyone.\n\nI'll give it a thumps up for the co-op.\n\nI can't wait to play BL2, since so many people say it's so much better.","March 29, 2015","true","60.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But does it work? Let's find out!\n\nThe Good:\n------------\n1.  Excellent art style - Borderlands looks great and plays silky smooth. Using cel-shaded graphics, Borderlands has a unique and alien vibe about it, displaying the world of Pandora in lush and vivid detail. Although many may feel that this look is somewhat cartoony and basic, I love the art style for the game and felt totally engrossed by it.\n2.  High Replayability - The player can choose from 4 different pre-made characters, with each one having a unique skill tree to develop. The soldier, for example, gets a machine gun turret, that can be upgraded and made more powerful. Add in the fact that the game has a massively randomized loot engine (more on that soon) and the ability to keep levelling your character once the game has ended makes Borderlands almost seem like an offline MMO at times.\n3.  Fun and addictive gameplay - Borderlands is simply fun to play, albeit mindless fun. Getting in a vehicle and driving around Pandora, plowing over bandits as your drive, is immensely satisfying. I often found myself wanting to see what was in the next "zone", and trying to face it's challenges.\n\nThe Bad :\n-----------\n1. Very weak story - If you value a deep and immersive story, look elsewhere. The gist of the game is that you are dropped off on the planet of Pandora and using the telepathic image of a woman, you seek out the fabled "Vault", a legendary place of untold riches. There is a main quest, but the game basically is a bunch of "fetch this, kill that" mini-quests to grow more powerful to fight the final battle. There are bosses, but they are devoid of character and seem to serve no purpose other that saying "hey! We got bosses in our game!" The game feels very weak in the story department.\n2. Online is a mess - If you value your games having a strong multi-player feature, Borderlands falls flat. Servers are rarely up, and when they are you will find chat options a pain. There isn't a very good view of messages recieved by other players, and the game offers no microphone support.\n3.  Not optimized for PC  - This isn't a major point for me, but I know a LOT of people get salty when there aren't a lot of graphical options and PC-centric options. Borderlands feels a lot like a console game at times which is okay, but I really would have liked the menus and UI to be more PC friendly.\n\nOverall Rating:\n-----------------\n\nBorderlands is definitely worth at least one play through, especially if you are a fan of shooters and RPGS. While Borderlands doesn't do either one perfectly, it does enough to give the player a pretty enjoyable experience.\n\n6/10  - GOOD","July 16, 2015","true","31.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","4"

Borderlands is a game that built its atmosphere above its story, along with its main premise of randomly generated guns. Guns were reused and mostly reskinned, fine enough, but at least guns didn't noticeably clip through each other (like the sequel with hyperion's guns, that shiz was ridiculous).\n\nStoryline is fairly minimal, it may not be as engaging as the sequel due to characters' conversations be mostly text, but this game is pretty decent, it's not great, it's grindy at times, and padded in the DLC, but it's fun.\n\nThe two reasons that I would say the original did better than its sequel #1. it has brick, #2. It has more guns.\n\nwhat madness is this?! how could an inferior prequel have more guns than its sequels?! Let's deconstruct the gun counts based on brand per game based off the types of guns **not** made by certain brands.:\n\n**''Borderlands''**\nJakobs - SMG, Pistols, Rocket Launcher, Assault Rifle\nDahl - None\nHyperion - Revolver(?)\nTorgue -  Revolver(?)\nTediore - None\nMaliwan - Assault Rifle(?)\nVladof -  Revolver, SMG(?)\nS&S - Revolver, Rocket Launcher(?)\nAtlas - None (not completely sure)\n\n**''Borderlands  2''**\nBandit- Sniper Rifle, revolver\nJakobs - Rocket Launcher\nDahl - Rocket Launcher, Shotgun\nHyperion - Assault Rifle, Rocket Launcher\nTorgue - Sniper RIfle,SMG\nTediore - Sniper RIfle\nMaliwan - Shotgun, Assault Rifle\nVladof -  Shotgun, SMG\n\nthe gun type difference may be 2 to the estimated 13 of the sequel compared to the original's 11,  sounds small? well when you take the context of "gorillions of guns" and then note that burst fire, corkscrew shot, split shot, and gyrojets were not brand-limited features in classic borderlands, well little things add up fast.

I don't think I would have played this in single player, I think my review would have been worse if I had played it alone.\n\nThere are a lot of things that I disliked more than I liked about this game. FIrst off, I did not like the story, a lot of people say that the missions don't seem to tell you WHY you need to do them, and it's true, for the mayority. I think it's just mainly for leveling up and adding extra content to the game which had really nothing to do with the story. Honestly I got lost with all the side missions, I kept forgetting what was happening. Lots of the side missions were also very repetitive, a lot of times I found myself wanting to stop playing. Honestly I would have liked that there were more story related missions to the point that you absolutely have to reach level 60 to finish the game in its entirety. And that's probably too much to ask.\n\nI don't like that I would find that one awesome gun and use it for almost 10 levels, to the point that other types of weapons became more useful than that one I absolutely loved. It would take another 5 levels to find one of the same type that might be just as awesome, but that may be my personal opinion I guess.\n\nI HIGHLY disliked that the bosses were REALLY easy.. most of them didn't even touch my shield, and I know, it was co-op, but even so I think it was way too easy to the point that random enemies that spawn as you explore the map seemed to be harder than a boss fight? I don't think that's right. I also noticed that the game become very easy after maybe level 20, maybe even before that.. a bit disappointing to be honest.\n\nHonestly, I liked the fact that I could play this with someone else, otherwise I wouldn't have even touched it, even if I had bought it. I like the game mostly for its FPS more than anything, and the RPG style of the game when it comes to the skills. It's really fun to play co-op I can't deny that, I had fun playing it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kersalen/recommended/8980/","Kersalen","Kersalen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kersalen/","98 products in account","Borderlandsis original FPS/RPG game for co-op expierience. This game is unique idea of mixing FPS with RPG elements, adding some replayability after finishing the game. It's great fun to play with friends and smash some midgets or skags. The game offers us 4 characters with 3 skill trees, which u are free to add as u like. Because of high level cap(50 without dlc) u can easy master even 2 of 3 skill trees. Game have specific for this series dark humour, which is funny and entertaining. I need to say I've played borderlands after playing Borderlands 2 so I can now clearly compare them and see the pros and cons between them, and choose which one i would like to recommend u more, but for sure both are worth of playing if u want to get into the Borderlands story/universum.\n\nPros:\n+Funny story\n+Great gameplay\n+Best fun with friends\n+Many items/upgrades for character\n+Graphics still looks cool because of it's unique style\n+Many hours of fun\n\nCons: (u will notice them after playing Borderlands 2)\n-Lack of music/soundtracks\n-Walkthrough 2 is too easy.\n-Not many party bosses to farm\n-Low replayability (it was boring for me after 1-st walktrough)\n-Maps are way too similar to each other\n\nOverall: 7,5/10. I think it's fair comparing to series. Ofc it was first game so we can't blame that it has lack of some aspects, but still it's really decent and i would recommend it for you. Play with friends for best expierience and fun <3.\n\nAbout DLC's:\nZombie Island of dr's Ned is typical smash'em zombie. It adds some hours to play and kill tons of zombies with decent plot about undeads. Anyway it's not giving much improvent to your character after walkthrough, so i would recommend only for people who likes zombies.\nOverall:7/10\n\nMadMoxxi's Underdome Is DLC's with 3 different arenas on which u take challenge to survive waves. To be honest it's the worst dlc and I won't recommend it to anyone. I was trying to like it, i did beat 1 of 3 arena's and i must say: After 1-2 hours of playing it's so boring. Drops are craps, and u can't save beetween rounds u need to finish whole arena at once.If u get it with GOTY edition, enjoy ur bank store,otherwise don't buy it.\nOverall:4/10\n\nSecret armory of general Knoxx Is probably the best of all DLC's for Borderlands. Its decent lenght story for several hours, with good expierience gain, many quests, and new different enemies. What is more when u finish it u gain acces to place with tons of loot chests, so this DLC is for sure the best improvement for ur character after ending main story walkthrough. Moreover DLC is increasing ur level cap by 11 levels so it's a lot. At last i must say, in this DLC u have the hardest boss in the game which is Crawmerax The invicible, so it's great opportunity to try urself out with friends or alone, and get some additional loot. Only con is there is no fast travel in this DLC, so it may be kinda annoying.\nOverall:9/10\n\nI would recommend this game to u for story and fun with friends, but if i would choose between Borderlands and Borderlands 2, pick the 2nd one. It got a lot of improvements comparing to 1st game, and have more replayability which gives u an opportunity to play hundred of hours. Anyway BOTH games are really good, so play both if possible ;)","July 29, 2015","true","45.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

BL2 feels more refined than BL1 but if you really enjoyed BL2 and haven't played BL1, then I'd recommend picking up the first game for at least one playthrough. If you've not played any of the Borderlands games and want to get into them, then I'd suggest starting with the first game.

I need not have worried. Borderlands is one of the best games I’ve played. The visuals are very impressive and suck you right in. This is open-world gaming at it’s best, with many large maps to explore as you complete the numerous missions. There are hundreds of weapons to collect and use, or sell along the way (gathering loot quickly becomes addictive). A wide variety of enemies will take you on as you progress up the levels. The combat is varied and the AI is good if not exceptional. Although there’s little story to speak of there’s enough humour to just about make up for this. It’s possible that some might find the missions a tad repetitive but I was so engrossed in the game that I didn’t tire of them and completed every one, including the 3 DLCs available.

The game also supports singleplayer, but it should be noted that most of the DLC packs rely on cooperative gameplay since they are far more challenging than the main game's quests.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ANCRON/recommended/8980/","ANCRON","ANCRON","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ANCRON/","352 products in account","1st person, post-apocalyptic shooter with sci-fi, RPG elements and a lot of silliness.\n\nYou play as one of 4 vault hunters, so called "wanna be heroes" guided by the mysterious entity in promise of unworldly riches and fame. Everything happens on Pandora, a fictional post-apocalyptic looking planet, with a lot of alien monsters, bandits and random "friendly and unfriendly" characters who want to earn money off of your talents, and exploit you any chance they get.\n\nGame has "cartoony" look about it, and even though it looks a bit outdated and doesn't shine in terms of texture quality, you don't really notice it much while playing. Environments are large open areas divided by loading checkpoints for transition. This being post-apocalyptic game, landscape is a bit boring, with not much color in it, and mostly wasteland. You can use few vehicles in the game for faster travel between areas, or simply to kill and drive over enemies. Fast travel option is also in the game, which is handy, but it's not available in some of the DLC areas, thus require you to drive through the same "levels" multiple times.\n\nIn the game you kill enemies, complete missions to gain XP and advance in levels. Maximum level is 69, and to reach that you probably will have to do couple playthroughs of the game. Yes you can replay the game with your character as many times as you want, or join your friend to help him / her out with missions or hard boss fights. Depending on how many players are in the game, you get higher chance to get rare and more powerful items, but be mindful, more players means stronger enemies.\n\nEvery vault hunter has their own talents, uses as well as their strong and weak sides. All of them can use any weapon in the game, yet some are more skillful with specific type of weapon or no weapon at all. There are pistols, revolvers, SMGs, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, alien weapons and grenades. Every hunter has their own special activated skill and melee attack that can be influenced by 3 talent trees on every hunter you can spec in.\n\nGame supports 4 player co-op, yet you share your loot with other 3 players, so my advice is to play with friends or people you know, or just agree before hand to share the loot drops. Apart from story, humor and outrageous amounts of silliness, next strong aspect of the game is item variety. It's similar to the Diablo 2 system, where you get random stats on items, but in this case random stats and effects on weapons, shield generators, grenade module and skill / talent enhance module.\n\nThere are different types of "gear manufacturers" in game, and their items focus on specific attributes. Some manufacturers have higher reload or clip size in their weapons, others have higher damage or accuracy. So you can find pistol that has 2 bullet magazine, but outrageous damage. Some weapons have elemental effects, that add electric, explosive, burning or acidic damage to enemies.\n\nMain currency in game is money, you get it by completing missions, from selling items or simply looting from environment and defeated enemies. If you die, you're charged some percentage of your total amount of money for reintegration into the world. Basically they clone you back into the game, don't ask me how, they just can.\n\nWhen this game first came out, it was a unique experience, being similar to Diablo 2 but with guns in 1st person mode. Even now, this game is favorite of many players, it's a simple yet enjoyable shooter with loads of loot, freaky enemies and silliness. Played around 30 hours of it, completed the story and some DLCs, but no ability to fast travel in them, bored me really fast. Money well spent considering the GOTY is very cheap, but I don't recommend buying DLCs separately, some of them aren't that good.\n\nEnjoy.","August 24, 2015","true","30.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","2"

This is the first game I have ever enjoyed playing a female character. Normally being a female I play all male characters as I like their skill sets better, but borderlands made their females badass! The Siren in Borderlands is an awesome character to play. She has great skills and I chose to have her use smg's and pistols making her a powerful gal to mess with. I love all the quests in the game and the weapon variety is awesome. If a game lacks weapon variety I have a hard time sticking with it if it is a long play through. Again this is a game you will play through more than once. You have to try all the characters and their skill sets not to mention you miss things the first time through. I played this game the first time through in co-op and as with any game co-op is much more fun. However I did go back and play through on my own because I had so much fun the first time. And lets face it if you play through with friends you just have to prove to yourself you can do it on your own!

Well, as long as you dont fight about the loot, hah. Since we had different characters this wasnt as much of a deal because mostly we were interested into different weapons and items.\n\nBut what is this game even about?\nWell, there is a treasure in a so called vault. You are the one who should find out about it and uncover its secrets. You are helped by a woman which stays totally secret the whole game. You dont even know who she is but she is following your actions the whole game. Until you actually find the vault. Thats more or less the story. Yeah, not that special.\n\nThe game is a open world FPS. Open world more or less. I cant tell of many corridor levels luckily. I actually enjoyed the map design. The game also has some small RPG elements. Not that many though. Mostly its about killing enemies with a very big variety of weapons to get XP, items, loot. You can also use skills to do so. Like using a eagle to kill your enemies with the hunter class. There are also other classes like siren with its phasewalk skill. You always get levels with skillpoints which you can put into a skill improvement like more damage with shotguns or whatever. There is also a big amount of missions you can do like main story missions or many side missions. Those give items and XP too. The enemies usually have a level which you should have too, to be able to mess with them. Partly the enemies seem to scale with the player but im not entirely sure about that. You always should try to do side missions for XP. Those missions can be in the whole world but usually you are in a specific area for a certain time. You can also use a teleporter or cars to move in the game. The cars also have guns.\n\nThe Engine is the Unreal Engine 3 which had, for its time, nice graphics. Its cell shading graphic though. Everything looks like in a comic if you dont know what cell shading means. There is a somewhat big amount of graphic options you can select in the game. Definitely a solid PC port which doesnt really miss much beside of Anti Aliasing or Vsync. Vsync is activateable through a simple config edit. Anti Aliasing is quite a mess with Unreal Engine 3 games. But its not like you need it. Aliasing is not that bad with the game in my opinion. Might be because of the cell graphic.\n\nThe game recently got updated with Steamworks which is really cool! Multiplayer never worked that well before with Gamespy. Also playing in coop is much fun! Thanks to the devs for the continued support after many years.\n\nPositives:\n- Many different weapons with unique statistics\n- Around 40 hours playtime with DLCs, without somewhat like 30\n- Good multiplayer coop action\n- Interesting comic look graphic\n- Interesting characters\n- Nice soundtrack\n- Good DLCs with nice content\n- Good PC Port\n- Not possible to reach max level and a so called "Secret Final Boss" with only one playthrough, good replayable!\n\nNegative:\n- Might be boring in Singleplayer\n- Sometimes, especially in coop, enemies take way too many hits in my opinion, its like you have to pump like 50 shots of a shotgun into a somewhat common enemy. Im not talking about bosses. And also I talk about enemy with the same level as the player. This is kinda annoying and kinda breaks the fun. Its not that often though.\n- I dont know why but one DLC got kinda messed up because in it you cant teleport and mostly have to use the car to move around. This traveling takes quite some time and you often have to do it. And sometimes you are even stopped by baricades with hordes of enemies which respawn. This was really annoying...\n\nI personally can recommend this game. Its really fun and has a nice design and its kinda addicting. However, I personally could only fully enjoy it in coop for some reason. The singleplayer might be a bit boring for some folks.\n\nI think I will give that game a solid 8/10 rating.\nIf you like good coop games, this is a must buy. Singleplayer gamers might be interested too.","February 10","true","38.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The characters are memorable and the landscape across Pandora has its own special feeling.\n\nDriving the runners feels great how smooth it glides across the terrain and the infinite guns gives it a diablo feeling of loot progression.\n\nOne of my favorite aspects of this game is the New Game + system where you can play the game a second time with renamed enemies who are much tougher than before, which turns what used to be easy missions into a nightmare.\n\nThe DLC is fun and rewarding even though Mad Moxxi TD can be very tedious. As a game I own three copies for and have beat over a dozen times I have to recommend this game to anyone who enjoys fps/rpg elements with a funny and progressive storyline.\n\nI give it an 8.5 out of ten for replability, story, and great gameplay that will keep you playing for hours.","December 18, 2015","true","93.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Well, as long as you dont fight about the loot, hah. Since we had different characters this wasnt as much of a deal because mostly we were interested into different weapons and items.\n\nBut what is this game even about?\nWell, there is a treasure in a so called vault. You are the one who should find out about it and uncover its secrets. You are helped by a woman which stays totally secret the whole game. You dont even know who she is but she is following your actions the whole game. Until you actually find the vault. Thats more or less the story. Yeah, not that special.\n\nThe game is a open world FPS. Open world more or less. I cant tell of many corridor levels luckily. I actually enjoyed the map design. The game also has some small RPG elements. Not that many though. Mostly its about killing enemies with a very big variety of weapons to get XP, items, loot. You can also use skills to do so. Like using a eagle to kill your enemies with the hunter class. There are also other classes like siren with its phasewalk skill. You always get levels with skillpoints which you can put into a skill improvement like more damage with shotguns or whatever. There is also a big amount of missions you can do like main story missions or many side missions. Those give items and XP too. The enemies usually have a level which you should have too, to be able to mess with them. Partly the enemies seem to scale with the player but im not entirely sure about that. You always should try to do side missions for XP. Those missions can be in the whole world but usually you are in a specific area for a certain time. You can also use a teleporter or cars to move in the game. The cars also have guns.\n\nThe Engine is the Unreal Engine 3 which had, for its time, nice graphics. Its cell shading graphic though. Everything looks like in a comic if you dont know what cell shading means. There is a somewhat big amount of graphic options you can select in the game. Definitely a solid PC port which doesnt really miss much beside of Anti Aliasing or Vsync. Vsync is activateable through a simple config edit. Anti Aliasing is quite a mess with Unreal Engine 3 games. But its not like you need it. Aliasing is not that bad with the game in my opinion. Might be because of the cell graphic.\n\nThe game recently got updated with Steamworks which is really cool! Multiplayer never worked that well before with Gamespy. Also playing in coop is much fun! Thanks to the devs for the continued support after many years.\n\nPositives:\n- Many different weapons with unique statistics\n- Around 40 hours playtime with DLCs, without somewhat like 30\n- Good multiplayer coop action\n- Interesting comic look graphic\n- Interesting characters\n- Nice soundtrack\n- Good DLCs with nice content\n- Good PC Port\n- Not possible to reach max level and a so called "Secret Final Boss" with only one playthrough, good replayable!\n\nNegative:\n- Might be boring in Singleplayer\n- Sometimes, especially in coop, enemies take way too many hits in my opinion, its like you have to pump like 50 shots of a shotgun into a somewhat common enemy. Im not talking about bosses. And also I talk about enemy with the same level as the player. This is kinda annoying and kinda breaks the fun. Its not that often though.\n- I dont know why but one DLC got kinda messed up because in it you cant teleport and mostly have to use the car to move around. This traveling takes quite some time and you often have to do it. And sometimes you are even stopped by baricades with hordes of enemies which respawn. This was really annoying...\n\nI personally can recommend this game. Its really fun and has a nice design and its kinda addicting. However, I personally could only fully enjoy it in coop for some reason. The singleplayer might be a bit boring for some folks.\n\nI think I will give that game a solid 8/10 rating.\nIf you like good coop games, this is a must buy. Singleplayer gamers might be interested too.","February 10","true","38.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

No, not that expensive alien pocahontas rip-off, I'm talking about the RPG-like FPS that is Borderlands!\n\nThe game is about 4 vault hunters. Mordecai the Sniper, Brick the Tank, Roland the Soldier and then there's Lilith the Elemental Cougar (and the only female). With their powers combined, they scour Pandora in search of the fabled Vault, hidden deep within Pandora.\n\nNow that sounded awesome, right? NOPE! That is just the sugar-coated, honey-glazed, dipped-in-caramel with a double serving of sweets way of describing the story of Borderlands, the story is actually crap.\n\nFor a game meant to be played by 4 players, single-player is boring. It can get pretty lonely in Pandora with only one guy (or girl) out and about. The main point of this game is co-op. Now THAT's where the party starts. The game's multiplayer mechanics are simple but effective.\n\nMore players = Tougher enemies\nTougher enemies = Better Loot!!\n\nOverall, I give a 9/10","June 23, 2012","true","87.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The best comparison I can offer if you've played the second but not the first is to expect a little more vanilla as far as gameplay and graphics as well as a number of small issues that were ironed out in the second game. These include some leveling issues with enemies, forgettable boss fights, vehicle problems, useless fall damage, falling through parts of the map to your death, too much money, random bugs, etc... However, all the strong points of the second game are present in the combat, humor, leveling system, and overall aesthetics making the original a great experience. All in all, it's a lot of fun and especially so if have the ability to co-op with someone.

Playing as Brick the berserker was moderately amusing and had my co-op buddies laughing hysterically as I punched stuff to death, but the game seemed primitive, colorless, and repetitive.  I didn't stick with it long.\n\nSo time passed and my co-op buddies got me to play Borderlands 2.  I wasn't exactly excited about it but I humored them and went in with my Borderlands 1 experience coloring my view.  And if you're expecting to not like something, and don't really want to like it, you probably won't like it.  I played BL2 for a couple hours with them and put it aside, and quite honestly forgot about it.\n\nWell, for some reason I got hungry for an FPS and remembered I had Borderlands 2 installed.  So I figured I'd give it another shot, try another class and run solo for a bit to get to know the game.  And I fell in love with it.  I fell so hard I eventually came back to Borderlands 1 to give it another go and see if it just wasn't bad attitude keeping me from enjoying it.  Nope.  Comparing Borderlands to Borderlands 2 is like comparing Pong to Portal.  I got far enough in to recognize a few landmarks when they showed up in BL2 and that was as much as I could take.\n\nSo to sum up, save yourself some time and just go straight to Borderlands 2.  Maybe catch a YouTube video for some BL1 backstory.  The only good thing about Borderlands 1 is that its existence made Borderlands 2 possible.","April 24, 2015","false","8.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I was I think 10 when I got this on sale at my local Half-Price Books.  The game was fun, I loved playing the multiplayer and the people were so nice.  Then I got an OP weapon and shield where I could kill things in one hit as well as survive everything.  I finished the game at level 7...  Other than that, the game was fun and hilarious.  I didn't buy the DLC, so I was missing out on a lot.  Now that I have it on Steam, Im pretty happy I can play through the entire game as well as the DLC.  I would recommend BL 1 for the people who want more of the story behind the original Vault Hunters since this shows what they were like before they become leaders of the crimson raiders.  BL 1 doesn't exactly have the greatest maps like in BL 2, but its really fun especially co-op.  I would rate BL 1 am 8/10.","October 18, 2015","true","4.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Heaps of items of various types. Great audio-visuals. Stability + no bugs. Amazing music - the game gains so much from its magic. Silly humour and dialogues add a lot to atmosphere. Story is ok, but not that important - it nicely introduces new areas and enemies. DLCs are definitely worth attention - Zombies, Knoxx and Claptrap are awesome story based extensions and Moxxi is survival based arena (least enjoyable of all 4 dlc, but ok with friends), they will all add  quite a few hours of superb and fun gameplay. TONS of loot, enemies and most imporatantly TONS OF FUN! Excellent sandbox, with loads of quests and places to visit. Unique graphical style.\n\nTechnically Borderlands leaves a bit to desire. It's not the best port. You have to use fan made applications to get rid of mouse acceleration, low FOV, in-game chat and other stuff, but after tweaking game to your liking it's much more enjoyable.","December 1, 2014","true","238.8"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

A big open world to explore, a multitude of quests, and cartoon graphics in an age of gritty realism. What's not to like?\n\nThe only downside to Borderlands is the fact it is basically a tech demo for things to come. But when you step onto Pandora, you forget about that, you just exist in this fascinating world that has been laid out for you. Sure, the lack of a solid story can and will disappoint you at times, but once you allow yourself to be immersed in this non conventional world, you will be hooked.\n\nI say non conventional, because really it is not your typical FPS game. Nor your typical ARPG. It's almost a new genre, where all you do is loot, shoot and loot some more. Never have I felt so restricted in my choices to carry loot I find, but this is a good thing. You are given a steady stream of improving weapons and upgrades that encourage you to change how you play on the fly. This really gives the game longetivity and prolonged enjoyability, it just doesn't get stale.\n\nThe graphics, the world, the characters, the audio. All are wonderfully utilised in creating this game. You may find yourself shooting the same enemies over and over again, but that makes it even more exciting to find the "badass" version of them, and to beat the virtual stuffing out of them.\n\nBorderlands will continue to entertain you hours after you start playing. It is a funny, tough, exciting, non stop thrill ride (that's right, cliché time) from start to finish. In short, you need to buy this game. Come on, visit Pandora. Who know's what you'll find here....\n\n9/10\nExcellent","November 9, 2013","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You begin at level one and progress earning experience points by killing things, completing quests, and finishing challenges. One more thing, LOOT!! Loot plays a huge role in this game.

I've come back to this game after a lot of Borderlands 2 and Pre-Sequel co-op. Also, I started over and know nothing about the DLCs.\n\nBorderlands 1 feels more fun to play alone. The multiplayer interface made so seemless in the sequels, has a few extra hurdles. The one that left a lastingly negative taste in my mouth, was having to get everyone through the same quest as they joined the party. I had to get the gate key from Sledge like 5 times in 2 days. Maybe I was doing it wrong. That was before.\n\nI think I didn't really understand Bordelands the first time I played it. It was too silly to be immersive, the guns and the scenery all looked the same. It took BL2 make me realize that these games are not story-driven vehicles of immersion. They're to be played like a First-Person Diablo. BL2 shoved it in my face, crammed it down my throat. BL2 was obnoxious, but fun-as-hell with friends. There was so much dialogue you couldn't hear over shots-fired that the story just melted in the background with highly-varied scenery. BL2 was an ADD slot-machine spitting colors and bad jokes and prizes.\n\nComing back to Borderlands 1, I find it more mute, and atmospheric. And playing as Mordecai the Hunter really sells it because you have to setup a little ambush every time and keep an eye on sales for an up-to-the-moment awesome shield. When I first get into the game, I trudge around and check boxes for money/ammo, just letting the ambient sound and music sink-in. Then I think of that little joy I get from getting a critical on someone (another slot machine effect) and pick my way out into the wasteland.\n\nHere's to killing Sledge one more time....","January 10, 2015","true","49.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

First up, the gameplay is really fun; people have often made the 'Diablo with guns and FPS' comparison, which is reasonably accurate in terms of the pacing of the action. I played solo, but I can really see how it'd be a lot of fun with a buddy.\n\nOverall it was an enjoyable action FPS first and foremost, with RPG-lite elements. I'd recommend playing it to any fan of FPS games generally, but don't expect much depth here if you're a hardcore RPG fan. Personally I got a good 20 hours of entertainment from it, but I don't see myself replaying this game or farming it for items endlessly. Most of the 'named' guns that dropped throughout for me were worse than what I already had in greens and blues!\n\nWithout giving anything away, I'd like to add that the endling was a massive disappointment... I don't know what they were thinking. It's a sudden, jarring anticlimax that left me sitting in my chair feeling utterly puzzled.","January 10, 2015","true","20.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Cell-shading looks much better than overly complex next-gen graphics IMO :).\nThe gameplay is nothing special, you just follow the quests and   shoot stuff, it doesn't require any skill, it's a game for casual players and it's slow-paced but it's pretty fun if you play it in co-op with friends. Also, the weapon bonus system adds replay value to get rare items / epic weapons.\nReccomended if you need a relaxing game to play with your friends.

Co-Op is very fun, but you can play the game completely solo through multiple playthroughs.  Try out different classes to find out your playstyle.  I found that Roland was the best for me since he can regenerate ammo non-stop.  Since that is the case, I was able to hold down my fire button and never let go.  There are many possibilites in the game and it's worth the purchase just to see what guns you get at random!

When i say sheer amount i mean that there are literally hundreds of different guns, some may feel much like a copy, however this is countered by the level system meaning that as you progress you will begin to see more and more types/combinations of guns and gun parts. Now the main problem with this game is the repetivity, this comes in the form of both landscapes and enemys, though a few different types of enemys are added occaisonally it stays mostly the same throughout the story, (this could be a problem fixed in the DLC, i'm not aware if it is or not) however the game trys to make up for this with several various jokes and or references that make the game entertaining at points. To wrap up i would like to say that what really makes this game worth playing are these two things. One is that you can literally jump into the game and have no idea whats going on and still just have a good time shooting things. Two is the multiplayer, You and four of your friends can jump in at any time to play together, which can lead to some interesting competitions, forced teamwork, hilarity and sometimes fights over guns, So overall i'd say if your going to get borderlands i'd reccomend you have a friend that plays it as well.","February 12, 2014","true","91.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It features a large cast of loveable and funny characters, tons of loot and a relatively solid story, despite the terribly sudden and disappointing ending. However, everything up to that point is a joy to play. The game has been designed with co-op in mind and many people claim it's the only way to play it. I think that is nonsense. Playing with other people is almost always fun and yes, many quests in Borderlands are MORE fun cooperatively, but even if you play alone, the game is highly enjoyable, so I would definitely recommend picking this title up, regardless of having anyone to share the experience with or not.","January 15, 2013","true","123.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With four playable character classes to choose from you can select a character with skills that suit your play style and if you choose to play through again you can try out the other characters for a new experience.\n\nThe guns? The enemies? Yeah there's heaps of both of them. Too many guns to count and a range of elemental and other effects and stats that make each weapon have their own advantages. The loot is definitely a big part of this game, finding big containers full of weapons, grenades and shields that are more powerful than any you have seen before is very rewarding; it's even more rewarding when you beat your friend to the loot and then brag about how good your new guns are. You can always share too but where's the fun in that?\n\nThere are vehicles which handle well and allow you to take out enemies with the mounted machine guns. There's nothing really wrong with them and they do help to traverse large distances more easily but overall they're not as much fun to use when you have such a great arsenal at your disposal already.\n\nEach character class has their own special ability and unique skill tree to increase your power and abilities as you level up from doing missions and killing enemies. These different abilities complement each other well in co op allowing players to take out enemies more efficiently if they use their abilities right; enemies will adjust to your level too so if you're playing co op you'll get more difficult enemies to balance things out.\n\nOverall this game offers a whole lot of content and the choice of different character classes gives you additional replay-ability. Definitely worth a buy.","June 16, 2014","true","29.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

The Cooperative experience is where this game lives.  Playing alone will give only half the perspective. With a full party of four, this game goes places.  Much time will be spent clamoring over weapons and equipment. Sometimes the team will spend an hour just having a good time with the vehicle physics. Other times will be lulled waiting in towns and for shops to restock. When taken beyond the game's limit, Vehicles will be dropped through the map, superior parkour through entire levels and completely irrelevant adventures made by developer's mistake.  The game is just so engrossing, whether it is played as intended or off the record.\n\nSome people may ask how I manage to spend so much time on a single game. I ask myself the same question.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/8980/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","A crazy action-adventure RPG where you play a vault hunter - a mercenary who desperately tries to find the vault to claim its hidden treasures. There are 4 different characters (classes) you can choose from that offer 4 different play-styles. There is an enormous amount of items found in this game - really, the amount of weapons you can find is just amazing. Colours indicate their extra features - this is similar to Diablo. The rarer weapons you find the stronger it is.\n\nThere are tons of missions to complete and many conversations to listen to. It is a sin to skip even one single side mission as the dialogue is very, very entertaining and funny. In addition to this, the game has 4 DLCs that take you to different areas and continue the already silly story by telling you further adventures.\n\nI guess the only difference between this and its sequel is that the first episode lacks a proper antagonist. There's no main villain here which is a bit of a let down once you complete the game and encounter the final boss. Still, this one small flaw cannot ruin the experience for you as your walkthrough will be entertaining all the way.\n\nAlso, the sequel has a bit more vivid colours that was a nice change compared to this episode where everything is grey or brown. Anyway, Borderlands is a great game and best played with friends (you need them for some of the boss battles). Playing the first one to understand the sequel's story is not mandatory. If it is discounted, though, picking up the game of the year edition can be one of the best gifts on Steam.\n","March 10, 2014","true","89.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I highly recommend this game over the sequel if you prefer more challenge and more mechanics to loot.

The graphics areCo-op muitiplayer games, up to  four players, are a fun & welcome challenge.  The storyline is entertaining, engaging & comical.   All of the DLC's have a story arc that I found engaging.  The Secret Armory of Knoxx DLC is probably the roughtest part of this series.  There is no fast travel option which makes it difficult for players who play in shorter sessions.  Each time you load into the Knoxx DLC region, you start at T-Bone Junction & have to fight, walk & drive to your questing area.  Sometimes this push to the questing area would take 45 minutes.  The Armory was also dissapointing as you only have a limited amount of time to scour for weapon upgrades before you are booted from the safe, never to see this treasure trove again.","March 18, 2014","true","164.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But don't let great sequels overshadow some awesome games. All the stuff you love from BL2 came from somewhere but for those don't know, ONWARD TO VICTORY! So, the game's a shooter with a bunch of RPG elements and an addictive loot system. See, each gun has about 5 different RNG'd peices, each with the chance to have different quality materials. I'm no math major, but the result is you'll probably never see the same gun twice. So, that sniper you tear through the enemy and loved for the last 5 levels? Sorry but you just found an UPGRADE and you love it so much MORE AHAHAHHHAHAHAH.... Oh yeah, classes. So you've got four distinct classes, each who kick ♥♥♥ in their own badass way and each one has three skill trees with awesome perks to help you dominate the beasts, bandits, and aliens that want to eat/shoot and eat/what do aliens do to people? you to death. And hey, if all of that isn't enough for you, YOU CAN DO IT ALL WITH FRIENDS! [laughing like Brick] (and just realized I can keep typing too) Multiplayer is a must for this game. Period. Pandora feels a bit lonely at times, since most of the people you meet are crazy and trying to murder your face, and friends are always good, so PLAY WITH FRIENDS! CAPITALS!! And each of the DLC are pretty good, but if you're gonna get one, it has to be Knoxx. Also, the four classes add replay value too.\nGame's not perfect though: Time for me to calm down. So, game is a bit old, and it kinda shows too. Overall, the story is non-existent (basically), but other stuffLOOT outweighs itLOOTLOOTLOOT. Can get lonely at times, helped with multiplayer.\n\ntl;dr- Good game, feels a bit dated and can get lonely soloplay. Cool stuff? LOOT, classes and powers, awesome multiplayer (get 3 friends and have a ball), general badassery. DLC? All are good and worth the price, but get Knoxx at minimum, it's great.\nEdit: YO, it didn't take me long to realize that this game isn't pure gold (they lied and I fell for it). Looking at this, I know I'm biased. So look up there ^ and click on the "Negative Reviews Only". Dem fools who didn't like the game still have souls, AND VALID POINTS. Check 'em out.

Even though it is a FPS, the leveling system let you play four different characters with each three different talent trees.\n- Humour. The humour in this game is genius. Shooting to death a bandit at point blank with a sniper and stumbling across his arm a few feet farther is always nice in that kind of game. Plus the CL4P-TP robot makes me think of the hyperactive child GLADOS would have had if she could have one.\n- It plays well in solo and great in co-op. The game stays the same and you have many hours of gameplay. Took me around 40 hours my first time with a little try of every character and some fooling around.\n\nMinus :\n- It is kind of an open world but you can't really venture off to the high level zone if you're not yourself high level. The trash mobs will kill you pretty fast.\n- Community is greedy. If you play in a quick match online, you might have to fight for the loot.\n- PvP is not really insane in Borderlands.

One of my few complaints though is that enemies can feel somewhat cheap at times. For some of the later missions you might find youself doing a bit of grinding to raise your level since the difficulty of the mission depends on what level you are currently at.

On the way, you'll discover numerous towns, meet lots of unusual people, and fight tons of psychos and monsters.\n\nYou can play offline, LAN or online.

The inventory system isn't perfect, the NPCs are essentially static billboards, the story falls flat, and some regions and enemies are more fun than others. But overall it's a good-looking game full of challege, humor, wacky characters, a ridiculous number of guns, and many, many hours of entertainment. The bang for the buck is incredible. Don't forget the Secret Armory of General Knoxx DLC, which increases the level cap and adds some great new missions.

Well I say these people should be hung in a rope of Skag guts and left to rot under the scorching sun of Pandora, then respawned at a New-U station and beat to death with a Midget Psycho's arm - only to be revived yet another time and thrown again into the pit-fight/rat-race madness that is the planet's looming backdrop.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TacticalTruth/recommended/8980/","TacticalTruth","TacticalTruth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TacticalTruth/","184 products in account","Borderlands: The Good Kind of Stupid\n\nI really like borderlands, which is probably obvious considering I have played close to 200 hours of it. Honestly, that number surprised me. But, I guess that’s to be expected when you play through a game (and its DLC) five times.\n\nWhether you like it or not, Borderlands has a style that is 100% its own. I happen to love it.\n\nTake the humor, for example, I’ve heard many people use Claptrap as a negative example of the game’s humor. And I completely understand their point of view… Claptrap is annoying: it’s a fact. however, in a strange way, that’s what makes him endearing. Claptrap has never bothered me, but I also never took him seriously.\n\nI found characters like Scooter, Tannis, and Mr. Shank to be far more enjoyable. Scooter for his deliverance-esque drawl, Tannis for her first person account of her time on Pandora, and Mr. Shank for... well, I think you’d have to be there. Suffice it to say, the humor in borderlands is not subtle, but it’s purposely not subtle. And it’s my opinion, that it required some skill to prevent this game from turning into nothing but complete stupidity.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, Borderlands is stupid. It’s just the good kind of stupid.\n\nAside from the ‘distinct stupid’ Borderlands rolls with, it also carries itself with a unique visual style.\n\nBorderlands is cel shaded, like many of its counterparts, however this game distinguishes itself with its artstyle. The character models all have a nice -simple- silhouette to them, and the majority of their liveliness comes from detailed textures with strong black lines and a physically ‘drawn’ look that doesn’t feel like it’s trying too hard to look like a comic book or cartoon. Even five years after its release, the game’s graphics hold up, mostly due to the aforementioned art style. However, comparing the game to its successor, Borderlands 2, shows just how far the tech has come since Borderlands was released.\n\nUnfortunately, there are some negatives… the biggest gripes I have with Borderlands are actually a small aspect of the graphics, and in my opinion a pretty large design flaw. Concerning the graphics, my issue is with the ‘elemental effects’: they look very, very Unreal3. That’s probably because... the game runs on Unreal3, which isn’t bad, but the effects stand out to me as generic. Everything else has Borderland’s strong art direction and style wrapped around it. But when you proc the acid, fire, or lightning effects they just look like any other game using Unreal. It might seem minor, but it was enough that it pulled me out of the experience.\n\nMy only other real complaint concerning the graphics would be that there are low-res textures here and there. Not a huge deal. Other than that, the majority of the environments look the same, but when the game takes place on a desert planet used as a massive junk yard, there isn’t going to be much biome diversity. To their credit, the game’s DLC take place in areas vastly different from the desert junk yards of the main story. Like an ancient ocean floor that a massive highway has been built over, cool stuff!\n\nAs for how the game actually plays, the shooting mechanics aren’t amazing, but they get the job done. Really, the main draw of the gameplay is the different classes and their respective abilities. And the oodles and boodles of guns.\n\nEach gun feels different in how it fires. Unfortunately they don’t pack a major punch, and they don’t feel very heavy, but that also comes from the ‘dice roll’ nature of the game. (Damage is dealt damage similarly to how it would be in an RPG.) For instance, I’ve run into a situation in which I was fighting a Badass (elite enemy) and loading him full of HUNDREDS UPON HUNDREDS of rounds of ammunition.\n\nThis is actually my biggest complaint with the games mechanics: if you’re gear isn’t up to par, the game can become VERY difficult. Every time you die, the enemies in the area regenerate their health and you lose a percentage of your money. There were some cases in which I lost every cent I had because I died over and over again. Not the game’s best moments, but not enough to make me put it down\n\nOverall though Borderlands is a wonderful game with a stupid sense of humor that just wants to make you happy. If you can look past some dumb jokes, some minor graphical missteps, potentially irritating Badasses, and a couple annoying characters there is a wonderful game underneath.\n\nLike this review?

Man, this game has got all the guns!\n\nIt's the sheer variety of guns that drives the gameplay in Borderlands, that's 50% FPS and 50% inventory management simulator. The quests, whilst delivered with some humorous fluff, are standard-fare MMORPG types of "Go here, kill X amount of the thing" or "Bring me back Y amount of animal tails" that generally exist to faciliate in you shooting things. Unfortunately, this doesn't really change throughout the game, apart from the infrequent "Go kill this boss" missions which have you rampaging through a linear environment, but as you move through the world of Pandora, a plot does eventually begin to form and will drive you through the final few areas that are a little more interesting than the earlier ones.\n\nThe world will probably make or break your enjoyment of the game as the variety of ridiculous guns you amass along your way are all very satisfying to use and apart from the odd combination and those of lesser qualities, are generally all useful. The problem, if you see it that way, is that the world is one giant dust bowl. For me, I liked that it had this one, constant, drowning feeling of being on this crappy planet, where the greatest resources are dust, sand and rocks. Whilst the environments remain similar for the majority of the game, they're different enough that it prevents me from getting bored and quick teleportations and a speedy vehicle do help to get you to where you want to fairly easily. While enjoyable solo too, especially as a heavier damage dealing class, there's extra fun to be found in co-op, as different classes lend each other assistance and you can move together through the empowered enemies.\n\nIf you can survive the world and possibly some bad luck with random weapon drops, if you like shooting, random loot games and getting powerful, Borderlands is there for you.\n\nDLC:\nGeneral note - once you finish the main story, you have the option to commit to a NG+. It can be easy to out-level the early stages of NG+ by playing through the DLC, making both the NG+ and the DLC very easy and with little chance of upgrading.\n\nThe Zombie Island of Dr. Ned - Whilst the AI in the stock game is generally pretty simple, it's literally brainless here. There are few enemy varieties, but the new areas to fight in are mostly different and it can be completed in a time-frame that feels just right.\n\nMad Moxxi's Underdome Riot - Arenas! Solo, it can be pretty challenging and perhaps a bit dull especially as item rewards are pretty pitiful, but it can be fun for a few runs. It particularly shines in co-op, but other than for saying that you've completed a certain stage, there isn't really too much to it.\n\nThe Secret Armoury of General Knoxx - Possibly the best content in the entire game, this DLC package offers some fun questing, vehicles and weapons to amasss in environments that are fresh and great to explore in.\n\nClaptrap's New Robot Revolution - Whilst adding new areas like Knoxx before it, this DLC has you fundamentally refighting a lot of the same enemies under some thin premises, especially in certain cases. Its plot may be crazier than Knoxx's, but it's also less engaging. Overall enjoyable, but a let down after Knoxx.\n","January 19, 2014","true","88.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are some awesome bosses and settings, and facing a wide variety of hordes of enemies can be a good challenge (specially from the Crimson Lance) . The soundtrack provides a good blood pumping tempo for the endless waves of opposition and the plot can be quite cruel and overall less cartoony than the sequel. Nice and gritty, the game provides endless hours of fun even specially now that the multiplayer is back up thanks to steam!","March 16, 2013","true","123.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aronhard/recommended/8980/","aronhard","AronHard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aronhard/","102 products in account","Borderlands\n\nThere is so much I can say about this game good and bad, though mostly good. Like for example: The Gun-play in this game is very very good, it is very fun, it can be challenging (especially if you havn't played many FPS's before, like me), you'd think looking for loot would be boring but it isn't, it is always a treat to find a new gun or shield or a grenade mod that you feel suit you better than the last one.\nAnother very good thing in this game is the dialogue and the writing, it is absolutly hilarious, if you don't burst out laughing at how fun the dialogue is then I do senserly feel bad for you. It took a few mintues for the game with it writing alone to hook me right on for the rest of the experience. And the RPG elements in form of skill progression is appreciated, especially for one such as me (a.k.a RPG lover).\n\nUnfortunetly there is a part of that game that is severly lacking, and that is the story. What story is there is very basic but  I found that the writing that was there still made it enjoyable. And all the boss battles you'll have along the way are fun. But to give a basic introduction to the story of Borderlands (No Story Spoilers): 'You play as one of four different Vault Hunters who arrive on the planet Pandora (no not that one) to seek out the treasured Vault said to contained riches beyond imagination and you are being lead to it by your "Guardian Angel".'\nHowever the ending isn't anything so write home about, it is disappointing and it does bring down the score and as unfortunate as it is it does take away a little from what the game tried to do.\n\nOne last thing I should mention before I give my score is the co-op, I highly recommend playing with friends who also own the game. I did this I cannot even describe how much fun it was in the end, but to tell of the co-op. The way it works is that the more players there are in the game the harder the enemies will be, BUT and this is a big but (hence why I wrote it in caps) they also drop better loot. So it will become more of a challenge, more fun and more rewards.\n\nMy verdict for Borderlands is a Good game and I highly recommend it to just about everyone as long as you don't mind FPS's or doesn't like playing with others.\nScore: Good!\n\nThought the review was over? No not quite I want to tell you about the DLC's for this game as well. Three of them I would recommend and the fourth only if you like Arena Challenges. The four campaign dlcs are as follows (and the order you should play them in, after the main game).\nDr. Ned's Zombie Island: This is a zombie DLC, but it isn't at all boring, quite the opposite in fact. It is mostly very fun, there is 1 quest that is very grindy and takes a lot of time to complete but overall I recommend it. And even as weird as it sounds a little but more story starts to come forward in this.\nMad Moxxi's Underdome Riot: This is a Arena DLC and a very annoying one at that, it was fun for the first couple of hours and the first Arena Challenge "Prove Yourself" was genuninly fun. But then the larger challenges was also fun when I started it up but it became boring and grindy a while in. And it never felt like it was worth doing since you gain no exp or weapon skill or anything, the reward for completing the quests didn't feel worth it either. I would only recommend it if you are really into Arena fighting.\nGeneral Knoxx Secret Armory: This is what a DLC should be like, adds more to the story, feels relevant and deals with the consequences of the Main Storys ending. It is hilarious as always and as I played through I felt more and more drawn into the world of Pandora (no not that one). Highly Recommended.\nClaptrap's New Robot Revolution: The best DLC of them all and part of the reason you should play the other dlcs as well, since the DLC continues to build on the endings of the Main Story, Dr. Ned's Zombie Island and General Knoxx Secret Armory. This DLC truly captures the best that the rest original Borderlands and its other DLC has already created and does it all very well. Highly Recommended.\n\nAnd finally if you've made it this far down (which I doubt), then I just have one final thing to say: "Buy the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game already!"","November 14, 2014","true","108.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With four playable character classes to choose from you can select a character with skills that suit your play style and if you choose to play through again you can try out the other characters for a new experience.\n\nThe guns? The enemies? Yeah there's heaps of both of them. Too many guns to count and a range of elemental and other effects and stats that make each weapon have their own advantages. The loot is definitely a big part of this game, finding big containers full of weapons, grenades and shields that are more powerful than any you have seen before is very rewarding; it's even more rewarding when you beat your friend to the loot and then brag about how good your new guns are. You can always share too but where's the fun in that?\n\nThere are vehicles which handle well and allow you to take out enemies with the mounted machine guns. There's nothing really wrong with them and they do help to traverse large distances more easily but overall they're not as much fun to use when you have such a great arsenal at your disposal already.\n\nEach character class has their own special ability and unique skill tree to increase your power and abilities as you level up from doing missions and killing enemies. These different abilities complement each other well in co op allowing players to take out enemies more efficiently if they use their abilities right; enemies will adjust to your level too so if you're playing co op you'll get more difficult enemies to balance things out.\n\nOverall this game offers a whole lot of content and the choice of different character classes gives you additional replay-ability.

It feels like you're living inside a graphic novel.

I enjoyed this game a lot more than I thought I would. A friend recommmended this game to me. At first, I wasn't sure, but I decided to buy the GOTY edition during the summer sales. I've always loved RPG games. This game has a lot of aspects I like in a RPG game but with guns. Granted, I'm not a huge fan of FPS games but that wasn't a factor with my opinion of the game. It doesn't take itself seriously and I love it. When I finished building my PC, this was the first game I played on it. It will be special to me in that way as well though I hope that doesn't make my opinion bais.\nI recommend this game a lot. The only things that would make me say otherwise are if you enjoy single player games only, you don't like having constant side missions, and/or if you want to play with your friends RIGHT NOW. I played through this game all on my own because that's how I like to play, but with this game, that's harder to do mostly because it gets boring easily. The multiplayer is down temporarily due to the mulitplayer being intergrated with gamespy's site. Since gamespy closed down, playing multiplayer has been almost impossible. I say almost because there is a LAN option, but for most people I know at least, they would only be able to play through the multiplayer. Steam is in the process of changing this so the multiplayer is through their servers like Borderlands 2 but I have no idea when this will be finished.\nIf those reasons don't effect you, get the game. If you want to play multiplayer on the first Borderlands, you'll be able to at some point so I wouldn't say that's a huge deal breaker, with me at least.","September 9, 2014","true","34.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TenshiroNova/recommended/8980/","TenshiroNova","Tenshiro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TenshiroNova/","187 products in account","Originally posted by The TL,DR Genie:Join the Vault Hunters, visit exotic Pandora, meet strange psychos, then shoot them. Borderlands is one of those rare treats that managed to be wonderfully fun for me, no matter with how many people I was playing with or what we were doing. It's not perfect but it's damn close.\nSpiderants, Rakks and Skags, oh my!\nThe story of Borderlands is in no way new. There's treasure! Treasure so large and so old that there are stories about it. These stories attract treasure hunters. And then there's the uncountable number of enemies and inhabitants between the treasure hunters and the treasure. Do the treasure hunters give up? Naaah, they use guns. Lots and lots of guns. And one little annoying robot that somehow manages to survive and make it to the sequel. The characters of Borderlands manage to stay fun and interesting and very much unique which is actually surprising considering that at the end of the day they could all be using the exact same type of gun.\n\nThe main HUD is minimal and even blended in to the start of the story. The other menus aren't that fortunate though and until the user gets used them they will feel very clunky and unintuitive. This is to be expected with console ports but a menu overhaul or revamp would've been hugely appreciated. The feel of the controls is however very reliable and satisfying. Itemization focuses mainly around offense as there are no actual pieces of clothing or armor that can be found and worn. The amount of randomized weapons and the absolutely ridiculous number of enemies are what makes Borderlands feel like a hack-and-slash. The experience gain, skill trees, quest progression, open world and legendary items are what makes it feel like an action-role-playing-game. The fact that all those weapons are guns, that a lot of bosses have guns and that even the vehicles have guns are what make it a first-person-shooter. And all of these elements make it very fun.\n\nThe graphic style is one my favorites and as such, I can find no fault in it, although others might. The protagonists, the other characters, the world, the weapons are all very well made and blend in. There is no element that actually stands out. The music always fits the setting flawlessly, the sound effects are crystal clear and nothing users wouldn't expect and the voice acting is spot on as well. The protagonists do not really seem to interact that much with each other and that's a shame.\n\nFor a first-person-shooter all the controls are spot on as well and the integration with the protagonists' unique skills has no drawbacks. The options menus are not at all surprising considering that Borderlands is coming from a console port and the only main issue I found is the lack of an integrated Field of Vision option. There are a lot of Achievements but many of them will be reached by completionists without any issues. The others however, may take a little bit of work, depending on skill and luck.\n\nFinally, all I can say is: join the Vault Hunters, visit exotic Pandora, meet strange psychos, then shoot them.

I love everything about it, from its rough-around-the-edges visual style to its witty and often nonsensical dialogue to its killer soundtrack. The playable characters are so carefully constructed that you forgo class for personality and their particular background and skills provide a completely different experience on each playthrough. The NPCs grow on you like weeds and you find yourself hesitating to shoot enemies just because they look so cool. The gameplay is very straightforward and the RPG elements not at all off-putting for those averse to the genre. More importantly, despite making for an amazing single player experience, it’s co-op that really takes the cake. I cannot possibly express how fun the Borderlands game series are when played with your best friend so I can only urge you to try it.

The inventory system isn't perfect, the NPCs are essentially static billboards, the story falls flat, and some regions and enemies are more fun than others. But overall it's a good-looking game full of challege, humor, wacky characters, a ridiculous number of guns, and many, many hours of entertainment. The bang for the buck is incredible. Don't forget the Secret Armory of General Knoxx DLC, which increases the level cap and adds some great new missions.

Borderlands is one of those rare treats that managed to be wonderfully fun for me, no matter with how many people I was playing with or what we were doing. It's not perfect but it's damn close.\nSpiderants, Rakks and Skags, oh my!\nThe story of Borderlands is in no way new. There's treasure! Treasure so large and so old that there are stories about it. These stories attract treasure hunters. And then there's the uncountable number of enemies and inhabitants between the treasure hunters and the treasure. Do the treasure hunters give up? Naaah, they use guns. Lots and lots of guns. And one little annoying robot that somehow manages to survive and make it to the sequel. The characters of Borderlands manage to stay fun and interesting and very much unique which is actually surprising considering that at the end of the day they could all be using the exact same type of gun.\n\nThe main HUD is minimal and even blended in to the start of the story. The other menus aren't that fortunate though and until the user gets used them they will feel very clunky and unintuitive. This is to be expected with console ports but a menu overhaul or revamp would've been hugely appreciated. The feel of the controls is however very reliable and satisfying. Itemization focuses mainly around offense as there are no actual pieces of clothing or armor that can be found and worn. The amount of randomized weapons and the absolutely ridiculous number of enemies are what makes Borderlands feel like a hack-and-slash. The experience gain, skill trees, quest progression, open world and legendary items are what makes it feel like an action-role-playing-game. The fact that all those weapons are guns, that a lot of bosses have guns and that even the vehicles have guns are what make it a first-person-shooter. And all of these elements make it very fun.\n\nThe graphic style is one my favorites and as such, I can find no fault in it, although others might. The protagonists, the other characters, the world, the weapons are all very well made and blend in. There is no element that actually stands out. The music always fits the setting flawlessly, the sound effects are crystal clear and nothing users wouldn't expect and the voice acting is spot on as well. The protagonists do not really seem to interact that much with each other and that's a shame.\n\nFor a first-person-shooter all the controls are spot on as well and the integration with the protagonists' unique skills has no drawbacks. The options menus are not at all surprising considering that Borderlands is coming from a console port and the only main issue I found is the lack of an integrated Field of Vision option. There are a lot of Achievements but many of them will be reached by completionists without any issues. The others however, may take a little bit of work, depending on skill and luck.\n\nFinally, all I can say is: join the Vault Hunters, visit exotic Pandora, meet strange psychos, then shoot them. Borderlands is one of those rare treats that managed to be wonderfully fun for me, no matter with how many people I was playing with or what we were doing. It's not perfect but it's damn close.","June 4, 2015","true","197.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

(No FOV slider and counter intuitive clunky UI) BUT PLAYABLE.\n\nIt wasn't enough to ruin the overall experience. It's a lovely RPG\FPS that takes place in Pandora, a very interesting and stylized world.\n\nthe characters are interesting and the quests and maps are memorable. It's a good experience to have and it's even better with 3 other friends in co-op multiplayer.\n\nWhat makes it unique it's the guns system. There are millions and millions of guns and it's very unlikely to find the same gun twice... ever. They are all randomized and quite unique.\n\nThat being said the game relies a bit too much on bullet sponges, that makes the experience a bit boring and frustrating every now and then.\n\nBut even with that I still recommend this game. It's stylized, it's fun and it's AWESOME.\n\nGo shoot some bandits!","July 10, 2011","true","26.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a great leveling system, tons of loot to make your character stronger, and a very neat and organized skilltree. The story could have been better but its still acceptable due to the DLC and the amazing gameplay mechanics. There are some glitches that you can access and odd things happening, but its nothing game breaking. The soundtrack is also pretty good but it needed a lot more for how big the game truly is. So far even on a low end pc the graphics are decent and the gameplay is smooth. I didnt excpect it to be good on my pc. I am not saying every pc can play it but keep in mind I do not have a graphics card to run on its own. I currently have a processer with a built in graphics card.\n\nAll in all this game is a solid 9 in my honest opinion (on a scale of 10). I love practically everything about it and Ive been playing it for many many years. Pretty much since it came out. I definetally recommend this and all the DLC to everyone who has yet to buy and or play it.","March 14","true","26.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
