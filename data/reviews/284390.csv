At first I thought the Atari 2600 style (give or take) graphics would lessen the effect of the cosmic horror style storytelling, but I was wrong. It actually made things even creepier.  The story is pretty top notch (Chapter Three is possibly the weakest in the set)  and it reminded me of all the classic point and click horror adventure games I played in my younger years. Now, there aren't a lot of puzzles in the series save for the usual inventory based ones, but what the game lacks in testing your wits, it more than makes up with mood, style and atmosphere. I'm eagerly awaiting Season Two and if you're a fan of authors like Lovecraft, Bierce, Bloch, Chambers and the like, you'll absolutely fall in love with this game.","May 20, 2014","true","5.0"," 106 of 114 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","106","114","0","5"

A quick research informed me about the Kickstarter journey of The Game Kitchen and how wonderful a job they managed to put on the table with limited participation on backers and pixel art graphics only. Recently completing the first season, here will be my part actual review and part fangirl rant for Victorian Gothic - especially for the concept of horror itself.\n\nIt's 1891, England. Jeremiah Devitt receives an unsettling letter from his old friend, Anthony Beechworth, with whom he attended a boarding school in Aberdeen years ago. The letter contains one sentence only that would be vaguely familiar to Devitt: "Videte ne quis sciat", the long forgotten motto of the philosophy club they formed as young boys back in the boarding school. Knowing his old friend would only use this sentence as a distress call, Devitt leaves his apartment and catches the first train to Sussex to visit Beechworth residence. From thereon, his journey towards the unknown, the unspeakable and the unforeseeable will begin. In his journey for discovering the truth, Devitt will slowly yet surely pass the veil that separates the wisdom from the insanity, reaching for the knowledge of "Malum in se" or rather: evil within itself.\n\nAs one can get a grasp of the narration so far, The Last Door is a fine product of horror literature, inspired heavily from the works of Poe, Lovecraft, Maupassant, Borges, Machen and many others; playing on the horror of the unknown, the unexplainable or more so: the uncanny. Today, literary academics make clear differentiations between the notions of fear, terror and the horror. Fear is an instantaneous reaction or at least a basic worry, while the terror is being continuously under some kind of threat. With terror, you can fundamentally foresee and understand the threat that would befall on you, yet fail to resolve it or prevent it with a conclusion. With horror, on the other hand, you are rendered incapable of even grasping the meaning, the reason or the nature of the threat altogether, rendering your cognitive ability useless… and that specific kind of threat is the most fundamental, basic and dreadful experience anyone can go under. So dreadful, the narrative medium of language fails to describe its nature exactly, presenting only vague descriptions of associations. Being a masterfully arranged horror adventure, The Last Door is one of such experiences.\n\nEstablishing a horror adventure with pixel art graphics might seem like a repelling choice for most people, but I find part game's success in this specific display choice. With pixel art graphics, we are not always capable of understanding direct depictions of objects, nuances or happenstances. We are left with symbolic environment designs that are presented to arrange a vague image, a symbol for the actual. It is both familiar yet quite so alien at the same time. Freud's 1835 Article, Das Unheimliche or The Uncanny describes this specific notion as a cognitive dissonance; for being attracted and repulsed by a concept at the same time. This paradoxical nature deems a state or a being uncanny - and quite possibly dangerous. This fundamental concept perpetuated the fear of the unknown and established the foundation of all horror literature that will follow involuntarily. The art display in the game is an excellent example of Freud's Uncanny. Everything is somewhat familiar yet boundlessly alien at the same time. This psychodynamic arranges a triumphant baseline for the atmosphere. The same notion is supported by brilliantly picked sound effects and orchestrated soundtrack – ordinary and beautiful, yet unexplainable and unsettling at the same time - to exalt the setting.\n\nAside its psychological undertone, The Last Door is an episodic point & click adventure. Each chapter follows the one before to portray the first season of Jeremiah Devitt's unsettling journey. You are to roam within a limited environment in each chapter; collecting notes, items; interacting with people and solving puzzles to make the story progress. Even with the chosen style of graphics, it’s not that hard to notice and interact with objects. Puzzles take brief contemplation at first, but when figured, they are spot on and elegant. Anecdotes and nuances collected from the most memorable Gothic literary pieces are masterfully nestled into the game for your discovery. The primary motifs of the game - crows, or rather ravens - are a direct reference to Poe alongside countless others.\n\nIf you are interested in the collective experience that would portray the totality of The Last Door, you are in for a literary feast with imageries worthy of nightmarish depictions scribbled into your subconscious. It is a remarkable example of sheer success for both narrative and atmosphere without much graphic display. Recommended to be played with headphones and in total darkness!\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","April 13","true","7.6"," 48 of 51 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","48","51","0","4"

So much so that you can play the entire thing with only the use of the mouse. The graphics are beautifully designed pixel graphics that never feel like you are losing atmosphere. The story is intriguing and interesting with a feeling of The Raven by Edgar Allen Poe and has been called “A Love letter to H.P. Lovecraft” by Penny Arcade.\n\nThe music composed by Carlos Viola is phenomenal. In fact I would say that it is now in my top 3 most loved video game soundtracks after playing this game and worth the purchase price by itself. You can download the soundtrack from the website (https://thelastdoor.com/index.php/soundtrack), although they have plans to include it in an update at some point in the Collector's Edition on Steam. Here's a bit of a taste from the Chapter 1 OST, which should give you some feeling as to the atmosphere of the game:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkdM6T4uE0\n\nThis is a story of a young man named Jeremiah Devitt, who receives a letter from an old school friend he has not seen in many years with a cryptic message that makes Devitt know something is wrong. Dealing with his own psychological issues in which he tries to remember his past he traverses back to places from his younger days in Victorian England to try and remember what they had all gotten themselves into all those years ago. Once arriving at his friend's home he finds that his journey is just beginning and we are taken through a strange occultist tale.\n\nGameplay is simple point and click adventure fare with no real annoyances from my experience. Everything works as it should and feels natural. The game contains many puzzles that you must work out to move on as all the classic adventure titles do. Most are fairly simple with just trying items out in different ways until you find a match, but you will be required to read the many notes you find in the game to get some tips on what some of the puzzles entail. Found letters will give you clues on how to pass certain areas based on their eerie nature.\n\nAchievements are included and lead you some in places you may get stuck, but there are even more secrets beneath the surface that you may never discoever without a bit of help. One achievement entitled Master of the Occult tasks you with finding every secret in the game, and these are not at all easily identified. Odds are you will need to use the Guide in the community hub to find these, but they add a lot of flavor to the game that makes for some strange and sometimes creepy easter eggs.\n\nThe Collector's Edition that is available on Steam is a more polished and put together package than the free to play version that is on the website (https://thelastdoor.com/). There you must download each episode one by one, and it doesn’t include the 4 mini-sodes that the CE does, nor does it have them combined as one game like the CE does. Also, most obviously, the free version doesn't include Steam Achievements, or trading cards. Even though you can play the entire season of the game for free on the website, this game deserves compensation. It is far better than the vast majority of adventure games currently on Steam in almost every respect. Story, art, and music. So please consider either purchasing it on Steam, or making a donation on the website itself if you enjoy it. :)\n\nThis is considered to be Season 1 of 'The Last Door', which includes 4 Chapters/Episodes as well as 4 mini-sodes for a look at certain other people and situations that were not shown in the main game with our main character. The Season 2 episodes have just started to come out with Episode 1 being released about 6 weeks ago on the Last Door website. Episode 2 is expected to be released in early 2015. Currently, Episode 1 can only be played if you make a donation of at least $1, but when Episode 2 is released in early 2015 Episode 1 will be available for free download while Episode 2 will then be the one that needs a donation to be played immediately until Episode 3 comes out. They have not announced any plans to release a Season 2 Collector's Edition on Steam after it is complete, but I would wager that it will be done.\n\nA well made point and click adventure that deserves to be compensated for the quality it provides. It is well worth the purchase price for adventure fans, and the original OST is worthy of being mentioned among the best in all fo video games. Highly recommend this game to fans of the genre.\n\n8/10 Worth it at full price, but must buy when on sale.","November 18, 2014","true","15.0"," 47 of 51 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","47","51","0","4"

After the last scene, you roll the whole thing around like a completed Rubix Cube, pondering the moves that got you there and admiring the final work. I finished The Last Door awhile ago, and I'm still musing over all the threads it wove together.\n\nThe game is broken into four episodes, about 30-40 minutes of point & click adventuring each. Each episode is a tight, entertaining scenario, and together they form a surprisingly gripping story. You take on the role of Jeremiah Devitt, a young man investigating the fate of his old classmate in a particularly bleak take on Victorian England. There's a great deal to uncover in each episode, some welcome variety in gameplay between them, and quite a few unexpected turns in the story. The third episode in particular takes the gameplay and story in a very strange direction that was off-putting at first, but I was pleased to see it tied up neatly with the rest of the plot.\n\nIf you're not a fan of the low-res aesthetic, you may have some trouble with this title. The graphics are extremely chunky, almost to the point of obscurity in some cases. However, interactive items are usually very noticeable due to the layout of the scenes. Also, the lighting and animation is excellent and helps prop the visuals up. But what really carries the game is the sound design, both in effects and music. Every action in the game is accompanied with a perfect aural representation, and the music is expertly crafted to drive the emotions of each scene. The attention to detail in the sound work greatly enhances the impact of the game elsewhere, making many scenes a joy to play through.\n\nThere are plenty of spooks to be had in this one as well, especially for an adventure game. The developers have a knack for surprising you at the most effective times, and leaving unsettling clues in just the right places. The desolate Victorian setting is used to great effect in setting the uneasy tone, which the story picks up and takes off with. It's perhaps the only point & click game I've played where I was on edge for almost the whole time. The puzzles don't detract from the atmosphere either, as they are almost entirely reasonable and logical.\n\nI ended up far more pleased with The Last Door than I ever expected. The atmosphere, writing, sound design, and gameplay were all top-notch, and even the pixel graphics worked in its favor by the end, leaving all the right bits to the imagination. The final episode has a solid ending, but leaves matters open for a second season which is mostly complete at this time. You can get the first episode of this first season for free from the developer's website, and the other three are only 0.99 GBP each, but with quality like this there's no reason not to go for the superior Steam version.","October 15, 2015","true","2.9"," 44 of 47 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","44","47","0","0"

I think most of you would agree if I say that’s typical for a young human being that widens its horizon every day but can’t figure out why darkness is so much more uncomfortable yet exciting than daylight. Even now as a grown up I love Lovecraft and Poe, but also modern representatives of this genre, for example Hohlbein, and it still catches me when there is something you try to imagine but you can’t figure out what it looks like. As the famous H.P.Lovecraft said:\n\n“The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.”\n\nSo, enough of an introduction, let’s have a look at the game you came to read about here.\n\nThe Last Door is a Point-and-Click Adventure that is set in the 1890s in Victorian England, a time when science was already established but ancient beliefs and a secret organisations such as the freemasons were well known among the people. You get in touch with Jeremiah Devitt, a man in the mid-thirties who received a strange letter from his childhood friend Alexander Beechworth. Not knowing how to deal with this, Jeremiah decides to visit Alexander, unraveling the mysteries about his whereabouts and his family. But that may be only the start for a journey that will lead you to places of Jeremiah’s childhood and past that have been forgotten for some reason. It seems like an ancient evil is making its way back into your life..\n\nI can’t write any further without spoiling but you should already feel how this story will suck you in, not releasing you until finished. A man gets snatched from his everyday life right into a victorian nightmare, how much more lovecraftian could it be? This game relies solely on its mysterious plot and manages this with two main attributes: Sound and Style. When I first saw some screenshots of this game before playing the first Episode “The Letter”, I couldn’t imagine how this pixelated art would manage to give me the creeps or offer details I need to make myself comfortable. But this game did not only manage to revive my passion for retro-styled games, it simply worked out what my introductive quote should show - that fear of the unknown is the strongest one. It feels like the devs from The Game Kitchen simply built a framework from what a scene could look like and relied on the player’s imagination to make it a truly living and frightening place. Colours are not mixed up, no they are shaded differently to create a certain mood like the warmth of a living hall.\n\nCarlos Viola. After listening to “Crows over the City”, which is the main theme of The Last Door, you will likely want to know what the composer’s name is. Don’t thank me for that, thank him for creating this game’s amazing classical music. Every aspect of this game gets pushed by its clever and well written tones and also sound effects, whether its the creeping dark or a simple wave along the old English coast.\n\nOwning a mouse is key for this game since you don’t need any other instruments. You have an inventory at the bottom screen, containing everything you will find and need to interact with other objects. The puzzles are logic-based, really challenging sometimes and it gets tough if you haven’t found the right object yet. This didn’t happen often to me but it might also happen to you so I should mention that. There is no hint system and no button press will highlight any useful items but your cursor will switch from a cross to a lens if you can look, or a hand if you can take or interact with something.\n\nBig Text, Quick Facts:\nPro:\nInteresting setting of Victorian England\nStory is heavily influenced by the work of Lovecraft and Poe\nPixel Art activates and stimulates the player’s imagination\nOne of the best soundtracks I have ever listened to\nPuzzles are challenging, some are really unique (just wait for chapter 3 and you’ll see) and also well implemented without letting you feel that this is only a game\nWell dosed scares mixed with an ubiquitous sense of fear and evil\nCollector’s Edition contains Bonus Scenes that aren’t available on Game Kitchens Website, providing you with even more background knowledge\nCon:\nLove it or hate it - Pixel Art\nPuzzles start to get annoying if you can’t find the right object to interact with\nPaying 9,99 may sound expensive compared to how much you will pay on Game Kitchens website, just for getting the small extra scenes + achievements + Trading-Cards\nSummary:\nYou might have already recognised that I love this game. But besides my own opinion you can’t really go wrong with The Last Door. Its graphics and sound make up for a great journey into a story that even Lovecraft himself would call a masterpiece. If you are not sure about it, enter http://thelastdoor.com and check out the first episode “The Letter” for free. If you liked it, do yourself a favor and enjoy the enhanced textures, sounds and bonus content of the Collector`s Edition on Steam.\n\nThis game is nearly perfect in what it tries to be so my rating becomes a 9/10.\n(Personal score will always remain 10/10)","May 8, 2015","true","7.3"," 46 of 53 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","46","53","0","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/recommended/284390/","chudah","Chudah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/","1693 products in account","Who would have thought that the next great horror game would be a pixelated homage to Lovecraft and Poe? I had been following The Last Door's development since its Kickstarter roots, and as soon as it popped up on Steam the game was in my cart and my wallet $10 lighter.\n\nThe game starts off ominous enough; a suicide, a letter, and a friend vowing to uncover the truth of it all. Set in the 1880's, our protagonist Devitt embarks on a journey through forgotten memories that threaten to lead him to the depths of insanity itself. That's not exactly what I was expecting from this game, but I am certainly not complaining.\n\nI realize the graphics are a turn off for a lot of people, especially considering how the pixelated art style is used in a lot of games these days, many of which are of questionable quality. However, if you can look past them and allow yourself to delve into the atmospheric world The Game Kitchen creates, you might find that the style works to enhance the game setting rather than take away from it. The best horror stories let your imagination fill in the blanks, which is quite often much more terrifying than anything the author can show you. Here, it is almost as if The Last Door provides your mind with a canvas of outlined images and then invites your imagination to paint in the details. The result is quite effective and works much better than I would have expected for a game in this medium.\n\nWhat the graphics cannot infer is tasked to the sound design which does a phenomenal job of conveying actions that we are unable to distinguish from the low fidelity images. There is a memorable scene in which the screen goes black and we must experience events solely through audio clues. This again enhances the horror of the situation as your mind works to figure out what is happening through sound alone.\n\nMention must be made of the amazing orchestral soundtrack that helps set the time period and builds atmosphere while providing needed emotional cues as you make your way through the game.  I am not exaggerating when I say the soundtrack is worth the price tag alone. Thankfully a downloadable version will be added to the Collector's Edition very soon.\n\nAmazing atmosphere means nothing without a compelling narrative to pull it all together, and this is where The Last Door truly excels.  Each episode is created very much like a chapter in a novel with a narrative structure that leads smoothly through the story while allowing the flow of events to move back and forth through flashbacks. This serves to build the protagonist's back story while unfolding the mystery in an engaging manner. As such, it takes more than a single play through to appreciate missed details that further develop the story. Once finished, the mini-sodes only available in this Collector's Edition fill in tiny details surrounding the characters and events, further building the world and mythos. The season ends in a cliffhanger with quite a few unresolved threads that lead into the next, yet the story is well rounded despite it.  I can see the potential for this story translating into other mediums with how well it has been plotted, written and structured.\n\nHaving said all that, I have yet to mention anything about game play.  When a story is this good, sometimes it is easy to overlook flaws in the game itself, not that there are many here assuming you enjoy classic LucasArts-style adventure games.  The Last Door is your very standard point and click adventure that has you searching for items to complete tasks which opens up additional areas of exploration.  The game logic is pretty straightforward without anything overly obtuse.  Objective clues may take a bit of thought but make sense and are not too vague. Some of the game's difficulty indeed stems from the lower quality graphics making a few obtainable/clickable objects unrecognizable. However, the pointer does a good job of alerting you to areas that have actions, one just needs a little patience to thoroughly search their surroundings before moving on.\n\nI can go on and on about the many things I love about this game, but it's best for one to fully explore and experience it for oneself.  The Last Door exceeded my expectations in so many ways, I will surely follow and support these developers in their future endeavors.  It seems as if finding a truly great indie game these days is like finding a diamond in the rough. Fortunately, this diamond sparkled bright enough to draw my interest.\n\nOne final note - The Last Door can be played on Kongregate for those who may be interested in trying it out before purchasing.  Episode 4, however, is currently only available through game pledges on the developer's website and in this Collector's Edition, which also includes 4 exclusive mini-sodes and achievements.","June 2, 2014","true","11.9"," 35 of 39 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","35","39","2","7"

I never believed that a point and click game could be scary...until now.\n\nThe Last Door takes its inspiration straight from the masters of horror: H.P. Lovecraft and Edgar Allan Poe. The story and themes draw on various themes that they wrote about, and it is done in such a way that those who are familiar with their works will appreciate the homage done to them. For those who have not read their work, they will be chilled by this dark and disturbing story...and hopefully get interested and read the source material.\n\nNow, if you are willing to give the pixelated graphics a chance, I think you will be amazed at how they lend themselves to the story and the overrall tone of the game. This game takes place in the Victorian time period, and the graphics call back to an earlier time as well. The disturbing scenes, I believe, are made to be even creepier in pixelated form.\n\nI love the music in this game. It really captures the tone of a dark, gothic, Victorian, horror story. The lighting, music, and overrall atmosphere create an atmosphere of dread in which you know there will not be a happy ending.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are not difficult, but very intuitive. The gameplay is a standard point-and-click format. The episodes themselves are not that long. This game could probably be beaten in a few hours. The only negative I could find (this is a tiny nitpick) is that there are certain Easter eggs in the game, and to discover them, you really need a guide. It's not a matter of exploring everywhere, but making sure that the timing is right to unlock said Easter eggs. However, the overrall gaming experience is not hindered by this.\n\nSince this is The Last Door Season 1, the game ended on quite a cliffhanger. It wrapped up enough questions answered but left enough to ponder and anticipate for Season 2. I am really looking forward to continuing the story.","April 27","true","14.4"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","2"

I tend to chew through adventure games and spit most of them out in the process, looking for those rare gems and refusing to waste time with anything less. This one had me hooked right from the start. It hits those necessary notes perfectly and with careful deliberation.\n\n. Lots of games use pixel art to justify a low art budget, but this makes pixel art look pixelated. The resolution is something like 120x120, less than old CGA games. And as a result the art takes on this impressionistic feeling that just works in a compelling way. It's ultra low res, but it's crafted extremely well. The combination works in surprising ways.\n. The writing is good, and what isn't written is communicated visually with a similarly deft hand.\n. The orchestral soundtrack is absolutely bonkers in how good it is. A three hour long game should not have music this rich.\n. Finally, the length of the game is just right. It ends before any adventure game fatigue sets in. To be fair, if I had been waiting for this to come out episode-by-episode, I would have been less than impressed, but taken as a whole and burning through the entire game in a night, it fit.\n. It ends on a sequel which is a -1 point deduction, I can give them a pass.\n\nIt still contains your typical adventure game inventory stuff, but I never really struggled with where to go or what to do next.

It’s an homage to authors like H.P. Lovecraft. The game from the start sets the mood of the game. The first scene you see is from a guy who is going to hang himself (which you control, so you are doing it).  After that you go to the character that you are going to play in the story Jeremiah, and as you move through the story you see that things are connected and the mystery unravel.\n\n\nSo while this game is in 8 bit it does not take away from the experience you have, even so it might make it more spooky. It’s 8 bit very well done, and very easy on the eyes. Everything looks beautiful, and you immediately see what each object is supposed to be.\n\nThe horror part of the game. well i would not go as far to compare it to something like amnesia style horror. there are some “mild jump scares”. But what this game does do very good, is putting you on the edge of your seat. every step you take the music and sound effects will set the mood on it all. from dark rooms where you walk around with just a lantern to large hallways. In short the atmosphere in this game is very well done.\n\nThe game has 4 episodes included, and while the original game is free to some extend, the graphics in this version have been upgraded. It’s has an awesome soundtrack created by Carlos Voila. And the Steam edition has 4 extra mini episodes. Each episode you can complete in about 45 minutes to an hour. Depending on how long you look at things and want to discover every nook and cranny in the game.\n\nSo if you want some story driven suspense during the weekend, then i would recommend picking this one up","May 21, 2014","true","3.0"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

Add to that the lack of voice acting, and I was reluctant to try it. However, I soon discovered these are more deliberate design choices than artistic or technological shortcomings.\n\nThe game isn't particularly text heavy, but playing it very much gave me the impression of reading a classic horror novella. This is not just down to the 19th century setting and macabre style, or even its homages to Poe's short stories. It's more the de-emphasis of graphics and the old school Sierra-esque, almost poetic descriptions given when you examine your surroundings. It also occasionally employs a silent film aesthetic, cutting between captions and slides during cutscenes.\n\nI feel all these things are executed well, because they add style, imagination, drama and depth without ever throwing a wall of text at you. They successfully took all these forms of classic written media and used video game interactivity, plus the occasional well-placed sound, music or jump scare, to enhance the experience. At times I found myself creeping forward, ever so slowly, ready to bolt, as if it were going to make any difference in a point & click!\n\nThe Last Door's strong points are story, atmosphere, tension and way above average use of (stereo!) sounds. I highly recommend playing this one with headphones. I don't feel the graphics are particurly interesting, and (perhaps only because occult horror is far from my favourite genre) it's not my favourite point & click of the year or anything, but I am glad I played it and I'd recommend it if either you're into this kind of horror, or you just want to try something different.","September 9, 2014","true","5.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/recommended/284390/","drmircow","Dr. Mircow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/","677 products in account","How can a game with graphics predating Atari-era be so satisfyingly creepy?\n\nThe Last Door is a story-driven point-and-click (P&C) adventure game with a horror theme divided across four episodes set in the Victorian times which also stands as a tribute to Lovecraft fans. The story revolves around an individual by the name of Jeremiah Devitt who receives a letter from an old friend without knowing of the events that are about to happen and how his childhood plays a pivotal role in these aforementioned events. The story starts slowly without much being explained to the player, especially in the first episode, but with each new discovery (through a bit of detective work) and encounters in its subsequent episodes, the story becomes fairly twisted and, most importantly, interesting enough to keep you invested.\n\nEach episode has its own distinct vibe, locations to explore, characters to interact with (not many in some cases) and puzzles to solve to advance the plot. And each lasts about an hour if you check everything, thus making The Last Door a relatively short game of about 4 hours in length. Therefore, it is perfectly doable to finish the entire game in one sitting. Gameplay-wise, The Last Door is the most basic point-and-click game you will ever find. You click on objects and use an inventory system. That is all there is to it; nothing more, nothing less.\n\nInstinctively, the game should have been immediately put down for its “dreadful” graphics in this day and age. However, to my surprise, they in fact manage to create a very unique aesthetic to the game – dark, creepy and eerie (need more adjectives!). It is certainly a case where you have to play it first to understand the direction of pixel-art the developers chose to go for before being judgemental about it. This also brings up the question whether the game would have achieved the same “feeling” if it were done in a proper 3D engine. Surely, there are loads of games to back this up, yet I do not think any of them would have been at least as unique as The Last Door. At the end of the day, it is a matter of taste. Though, the only problem with the game’s visuals is that finding certain hotspots can occasionally be problematic due to the extremely low-resolution.\n\nThe puzzles in the game are all very easy and fairly logical to solve throughout all four episodes. This fact might upset some people who expect at least a challenge, but considering the vast history of the point-and-click genre, getting constantly stuck solving an illogical puzzle would have been detrimental to the pace of this particular story-driven experience. In truth, one of its many brilliant aspects is its pace. The game sporadically keeps the player wandering about searching for clues without much happening (to them), in the sense of being attacked at any time since dying in here is not possible, for some periods of time. This lowers your alertness (or vice-versa) and makes you a perfect target for certain “events” in the game. It may sound like something really cheap in terms of spooking you, but it is not necessarily. More significantly, the game never overdoes it. Conversely, if there is to pinpoint one problem with some of the puzzles that would be that sometimes there are no clear reasons why the player must solve them that way. For instance, how would the player know that there might an item stuck down the shower’s pipeline which would be useful for solving a puzzle later on?\n\nNaturally, a good horror game cannot be without an excellent sound design – which is present in the game. Everything from the noise of your footsteps to the spine-chilling background sounds is spot-on. On top of that, it boasts an excellent soundtrack which is easily identifiable and fits perfectly with the atmosphere it tries to achieve. The Last Door will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nFrankly, there is not much to say about The Last Door. Personally, it nails pretty much almost everything myself, and others, would like to see in a (good) horror game: an interesting story to keep you invested in the journey, authentic dark atmosphere, spot-on sound design and minimal jump-scares. On the other hand, by the end of all of it, I found it hard not to feel, oddly enough, that it was not as creepy as I wanted to be. The game definitely makes you, especially for those who played through all the four episodes in one go and enjoyed the ride, want more, and there are two main reasons for this: its short length and the cliffhanger at the end. Hopefully, Season 2 might fill that gap because there are many unanswered questions.\n\nNow, the only major flaw with the game is the lack of memorable characters. Whether that is because of the low-res character models or their dialogues, I cannot really figure it out. But aside from main character, a creepy lady and a certain stalker, I personally did not care much about the rest of the cast once I got past them. Maybe because they are all a bunch of creepy little weirdoes. Lastly, maybe a bit of variety in the puzzles would have been nice as well.\n\nConclusively, The Last Door is an interesting indie game which perfectly fits in the “Don’t judge a book by its cover” category. Whilst minimalistic in its presentation, it creates this genuine atmosphere which other horror games tend to (partially) fail. Honestly, it is not as scary as some may imply, but it is without a doubt one of the creepiest games. At its current full price tag, keeping in mind its length, it is worth buying it at least for the experience. If graphics really put you off, then do not bother getting it because the game is evidently not trying to appeal to everyone, although you will be missing out on this refreshing spin on horror games. It did enough to keep me wanting to play Season 2 when it will come out on Steam, that is for sure.","August 29, 2015","true","4.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

These episodes come together to form the first ‘season’ (the game you see here).\n\nFrom the opening moments of the very first episode you are plunged into a stylish and engaging Lovecraftian tale. I won’t spoil these moments, as they are part of what gives The Last Door its power and potency. The game draws on multiple horror staples (Poe, Lovecraft, even a touch of Chambers's 'The King in Yellow'), but whilst the game plays on these themes it builds its own universe to play in. There are no tentacled horrors patrolling corridors, the game carves out a new and creepy world, and hints at the things that may lie beyond. As a result, the story felt less like it was ticking off Lovecraftian references and a little less predictable.\n\nWhilst a few of the horror moments fell short by being expected, they hit more often than they miss and there are plenty of them. The game plays more on creeping, foreboding horror than outright frights, although there are a fair share of those too. The music adds brilliantly to both the tension and the feeling of grandeur, the pixel art adds power to your mind’s eye, whilst the sound design brings each scene to life and the writing style keeps you engaged.\n\nEach episode is interesting and engaging, moving the story forward and introducing new characters and twists. There’s a surprising amount of depth to be uncovered here. The puzzles are relatively straightforward, but the storyline gains more depth with each episode you play through. There are several side-episodes available in the ‘extras’ menu too, offering a few extra plot points and a little more intrigue to each episode.\n\nI eagerly await season two, and thoroughly recommend season one to those who enjoy adventure games and horror stories.\n\nOh, and play it with headphones on if you can, it’s an experience worth immersing yourself in, and the sounds and music do that spectacularly.","February 22, 2015","true","5.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","2"

It has an interesting plot, excellent atmosphere and smooth progression. The game uses archetypical elements of horror but never goes too far into the realm of the cliché. The writing is quite well done; you can tell the authors read up on the classics the game admires, resulting in a twisted and alluring story.\n\nThe game itself plays a lot like a Golden Age p'n'c, without obnoxious inventory management. The inventory is still there, but you're never stuck on an illogical puzzle where you need to combine random items with equally nonsensical bakdrops. (There's one item combo that does make little sense, but thankfully it's an exception to the rule.) There's a fair amount of headscratching at a few points, but the solution is always manageable. There's no backtracking or long trekking from screen to screen, since the episodic format makes it contained in chunks, and it works wonders. The sound design, both music and effects, improves with each episode. (In general, the episodes get better in scope and depth with each installment.) There are quite a few sections where headphones are a must and will give you the chills. The extras in this season release (mini episodes with supporting characters) are also a good incentive if you're thinking of supporting the devs.\n\nThe 8bit aesthetic sometimes kills the mood, particularly when it comes to characters. The backdrops are nicely done, but it can be a bit difficult to immerse yourself if the items you pick up are pixel blocks and the characters have no faces or recognisable features. Then again, the whole point is to substitute the visual with your own imagination - it's a double-edged sword.\n\nTL;DR\n+ logical puzzles\n+ great story\n+ excellent writing\n+ great music and sound effects\n+/- 8bit art style\n\nOverall, you should buy it, or at least try it if you're remotely interested in adventures. Doubly so if you're a Poe fan.","August 23, 2015","true","3.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Even though it was originally available as a free flash game on Kongregate, I had no problems purchasing the special Collector’s Edition. It was well worth the value.\n\nThe Last Door is a point-and-click adventure. I was too young to play point-and-click adventures during their peak of popularity. My puzzle solving skills might be a little weaker than other players but I was able to solve most of the puzzles. The couple of puzzles I couldn’t solve, after reading a walkthrough, I realized the puzzle was completely logical and I just wasn’t experimenting with all the inventory combinations.\n\nThe real joy of The Last Door isn’t the puzzles but the story and atmosphere. The Last Door is the best Lovecraft game I’ve played since Headfirst Productions’ 2005 Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of Earth. The story is great. It’s a great Lovecraft pastiche with a mysterious letter from an old friend setting the protagonist off on a journey that will unveil the meaning of his long-forgotten memories and disquieting dreams.\n\nThe art style, sound design, and sound track are amazing. Some might wonder if the pixelated art style supports the horror genre. It really works well. I had some legitimate jump scares from this pixel horror. Plus, the developers did some cool work with lighting and camera angle. The sound effects are great – between the physical knocks on door to the distant wails from unknown creatures. Finally, the sound track by Carlos Viola does an amazing job in matching the art design and supporting the mood.\n\nBetween the satisfying atmosphere and the puzzles, this is a game worth purchasing and playing. I also recommend buying it on Steam to help the developers rather than playing for free so that a Season 2 gets created.\n\nI hope other players experience The Last Door and enjoy it as much as I did.","May 25, 2014","true","3.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The Last Door is a point-and-click horror adventure with pixel graphics. It's a little bit like Clock Tower, but with no danger and a faster walk speed. The narrative is very intriguing and every episode leaves you wanting to play more. That being said, I am eagerly awaiting more episodes to be available in the steam store.\n\nMy only complaint would be that some of the hints based on items you pick up are incredibly vague.

The same concept can be applied to the horror genre as well. A classic work of horror needs a good story, atmosphere, and intriguing characters.\n\nSo what do I mean when I say horror is best served shaken, and not stirred? Anyone can make a "classic vodka martini", but in order to make a good cocktail one must look at the quality and quantity of the products, and how the cocktail is served. An example, the brine the olive rests in can change the overall flavor of the drink therefore cheap olives can sour the finest vodka. Most modern horror games lean on things such as jump scares or ambient sound, which can stir the player but it can also shift focus from a good story to concern about when and where the next scare might come from. A balance is needed to fully immerse the player so they can be shaken, but still enjoy the story.\n\nThe Last Door has flown under my radar for a good part of the year until it arrived on steam. I knew nothing of the devs (The Game Kitchen) and I was a bit wary of the graphics, could such simple graphics achieve a desired atmosphere needed to convey horror? With each chapter crowd funded could this hinder the quality as well? The Last Door: Collector's Edition is only the first season.\n\nAfter playing the first chapter (or Episode) "The Letter" I was hooked. The main character Jeremiah Devitt has received a letter from a childhood friend Anthony Beechworth, a simple but chilling message causes him to visit his home, seeking answers to what has happened to his childhood friend. By the end I couldn't wait to play the next chapter.\n\nCarlos Viola is beind the music for The Last Door. For such a simple looking game I admit I wasn't expecting anything but simple. Sometimes it's good to be wrong and perhaps we shouldn't expect anything but enjoy what we are given. The music is like the perfect vermouth which accompanies a premium vodka. Each track is amazing and really sets the tone for the overall story. In horror atmosphere is everything and Mr. Viola does not disappoint.\n\nI hope the second season comes soon. As I am writing this I can see the 5th chapter has been funded. Do I recommend The Last Door? Of course I do, I highly recommend it. In today's market there are many drinks on the bar menu but if you are ever in the mood for something premium with a great balance while being simple try a classic martini.\n\nI also have Ornithophobia thanks to The Last Door","July 8, 2014","true","8.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

However, this cryptic message prompts him to go to his friend's manor as he's aware that something had gone wrong. This is his first step towards madness, horror, darkness...\n\nThe Last Door is an episodic game, with four chapters. All of them is following DeWitt's fate and search for the truth. But while you're witnessing his adventure, cutscenes show also a doctor being worried for DeWitt and began to search for him. The plot is full of mystery, the more you're going forward, the less you can grasp the reality of the whole story. Well, it's still very foggy for me though I may have a general idea of what's happening. No wonder that there is a second season where you're the doctor...\n\nThe Letter\n\nThe Letter is the beginning of DeWitt's adventure. He's investigating his friend's manor. Everything seems normal but when you know where to look, it seems that this manor has seen a tragedy...\n\nMemories\n\nDeWitt, after finding his friend's body, comes back to his boarding school, now an hospice. Searching for clues to explain what's happening to his schoolmates, he begins to remember what they have done back then...\n\nThe Four Witnesses\n\nAfter being knocked down by his ancient teacher's servant and after discovering the horrifying truth, DeWitt finds himself in one of these creepy neighboorhoods of London. A man seems to appear and to disappear, like he was inviting DeWitt to follow him...\n\nAncient Shadows\n\nDeWitt found himself in a remote manor, where one of his classmates are residing. However, while investigating it, everything seems to suggest that Alexandre has gone far into his research...\n\nAs you can see, the more you're advancing in the story, the more horror you'll discover. Besides, be prepare yourself to some scares (I got one) and to people that aren't real (or are they just a fragment of DeWitt's imagination?).\n\nThe Last Door is a great example of how a plot must be delivered. Not too revealing at the beginning and then only, plant some clues and hints that will put a seed of doubt in your mind, until you're arriving at the end without too much clarity but with a general idea of what's happening.\n\nThe gameplay is a point-and-click: you have items to examine, to take, to combine and to use. You have also some puzzles, though they're a rarity in the game. Your inventory is in the bottom of your screen, making it easier for you to use objects. It's staying in place, never going down. You speak also with people: you can choose your lines, however, while some can be always asked, other ones are very important. And when you have a new piece of information, you can question again people.\n\nYou have also notes to read in all chapters, which will give you some clues on what's going on. Also, you can hunt some paranormal or strange actions, however, they're often secrets requiring to be fast or to avoid to do something or to just stay for a few minutes where you are.\n\nHowever, be prepared also to some slow passages. Indeed, when DeWitt is holding a lantern, you're walking slowy, without any fast footstep.  There is also a passage where he's kinda out of it, so, be patient.\n\nThe graphics are belonging to the retro era. I mean by that it's pixelised like a good old adventure game. You can't see any of the reactions of the characters, however, every area of interest are shown thanks to a magnifying glass with a yellow border.\n\nThe soundtrack is also captivating. It's really fitting to the story and to the atmosphere. I really like the opening.\n\nThe Last Door is really a masterpiece for the price. It's one of the best little adventure games that I've played. Everything is nearing perfection or is perfect.

Lovecraft".  During the introduction the influence was clear and as a big fan of Lovecraft, I was immediately hooked.  Fans of Lovecraftian horror should enjoy this point and click title.  Despite it not being an actual Lovecraft story, the themes are familiar; helplessness, hopelessness, the fragility or sanity and human vulnerability.\n\nAs a big fan of point and click games, I have played surprisingly few horror point and click titles.  The Last Door isn't terrifying by any means, but it succeeds in creating a creepy atmosphere through the use of pixel graphics and orchestral music.  While the pixel graphics sometimes make things more confusing (objects becoming difficult to spot), the orchestral music is definitely one of the strongest features of the game.  I would go as far as to say the score is perfect.\n\nThe graphics may not be for everyone, but for others it is probably a plus.

This episodic series is very similar to games like the Sherlock Holmes series, The Secret of Monkey Island, Loom, Maniac Mansion, etc, but has an extreme creepy feel to it--in a good way.\n\nThroughout the game, you try to uncover a dark mystery surrounding England in the 1800's after you learn about your old friend's suicide.  From here, you traverse through places of your memories, and find leads of where to go next, as you interact with objects and solve puzzles on the way to your objective, whatever that may be.\n\nThe graphics of the game do not do the game any justice, but as that look was intended, it adds to the VERY creepy feeling of the game, like you are part of an Edgar Allen Poe novel.  Meanwhile, the game's amazing soundtrack--mainly composed of classical piano--carries the game and will send chills down your spine as you slowly pick up more of the story.\n\nThe puzzles are somewhat simple in Season One, but should still throw out a decent challenge for the average gamer.  But the events that happen during the game as you are searching for clues certainly add to the level of creepiness, and doesn't make puzzle-solving seem redundant in any case.\n\nThis game is absolutely fantastic and is a must-buy for anyone who is wanting a new indie game to play, or perhaps doesn't want to invest too much time or money in one, and is most definitely one to buy if you enjoy playing murder mysteries/horror games.","October 4, 2014","true","5.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It is one of the strangest, yet most conventional horror adventure games I have ever met.\n\nGraphics are secondary in a story-driven genre, but in this case it is worth mentioning that the very old-school pixel presentation adds a strange layer to the already eerie atmosphere. Something, that may or may not work with a modern (3D) engine.\nAnd this game is all about atmosphere. It is a unique, but working mix of Lovecraftian suspense over the unknown, blended together with Amnesia-like fear of the dark (and a few mandatory jump scares). It is especially strong in the first chapter, where there is no dialogue at all.\n\nA horror is all about story and presentation, and Last Door for the most part knows its trade. The introduction of dialogues in the 2nd chapter hurt quality somewhat: a good chunk of them are clumsy exposition dumps that slowly turn the game into a weak Cthulhu rip-off. But they quickly steer away from this pit and soar into new heights in chapters 3 and 4.\nSadly it’s still one of those types where you don’t get a single answer regarding the mystery, although there is a promise of a second season.","March 20, 2015","true","6.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Sure, I got a knack for the subject matter (post-victorian horror in the vein of Lovecraft and to some degree Poe) but I am positive that Last Door is so well done it will convince pretty much anybody who is interested in excellent writing and incredible atmosphere.\n\nHow does the game achieve that? For starters, the music is unbelievably good and carries the game a fair bit. It's the kind of score that creeps up on you without you noticing at first and suddenly you feel all eerie and weird. Then there is the story (notice how the soundtrack takes the first place? Yeah, it's really THAT good) - if you enjoy "weird tales" you are in for a ride. What starts as a crime scene investigation soon turns into an incredible adventure shattering the boundaries of our percieved reality and leads to uncovering forces at work that are beyond our wildest imagination. It's quite lovecraftian, and very, very morbid at times - needless to say I loved every minute of it and was glued to my seat not wanting to miss a thing. I can't really go into any more detail here, because you need to see things unfold for yourself. Seriously!\n\nFinally, the point & click adventure-game part is very well done too. You hardly ever get stuck on puzzles, in pretty much all cases it is obvious what you need to do and the solutions are logical too. The game progresses at a good pace and keeps your options limited at any given time - it is a bit more complicated than the latest Telltale games, but it is none of the oldschool LucasArts crazy stuff.\n\nThe visuals are the only thing about The Last Door that need a moment to get used to - the super low-res look works out in the end and supports the atmosphere, especially in the more weirder scenes. But I could see this putting some people off - which would be a GRAVE MISTAKE. I am absolutely serious when I say that "The Last Door" could easily be one of the best TV shows out today, it is THAT good.

They are my absolute favorite kinds of games. It doesn't seem right to just call The Last Door a point and click though. It's so much more. A lot of people look past the point and click genre because they feel that's all there is too it. You get a scene, gotta find some item, find item, next scene. People feel like there's really nothing to these kinds of games, that they don't have any kind of gameplay whatsoever. They don't give you enough. But that's not what The Last Door does. It gives you so much more.\n\nThe Last Door is an episodic, horror point and click set in 1800s England. You might think due to it's low-res graphics you couldn't possibly be scared by playing this game. But that's exactly what makes it so creepy. I never new pixelated blood could unerve me so much. You play as Jeremiah Devitt, and he's just recieved a strange and urgent letter from an old school mate of his named Anthony. Upon entering his house, you notice that it is oddly deserted. No servants, no wife, no Anthony. The only evidence that people once lived there are scattered notes you find in different areas of the house. Each detailing the bizzare behaviors that Anthony has been exhibiting. Concerened for his friend, Devitt searches the house for clues. That's when he slowly starts to discover the disturbing story of Anthony, and his own past that all leads back to a ritual he and his friends performed at their old bording school.\n\nYou learn something new and gain more information of the story within each episode. The atmosphere is gloomy, the music is dramatic, and the story is something straight out of Edgar Allan Poe's notebook. Despite being short (you can easily finish the entire first season in one sitting) it is well worth the play. If you're a fan of good story telling and creepy pixelated crows, The Last Door is a must to satisfy that blood on the wall hunger.","June 19, 2014","true","5.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The pixel graphics may seem odd and outdated at first, but they grant exactly the form that is needed for this type of eerie Lovecraftian imagery. So let this not be your con on buying it. And while the graphics may be "basic" the sound is outstanding. Like in a radio play it gives you just the amount of vivid details that you need to be sucked up into this dark, victorian story.

I'll try to explain it on two fronts, however: as an adventure game and as a story.\n\nI'm a long time fan of adventure games since before the time I had to finally upgrade my floppy drive specifically for playing one of them. (Okay, I'm not a spring chicken, but to be fair I am not a chicken of any sort, in case you were wondering - I have ulterior motives for crossing the road.) These days they're not as common, but a good one occasionally comes along. In recent years, though, I've not come across one that I would say deserves to be listed among the best of the classics. "The Last Door" not only deserves such a distinction, I feel it surpasses a lot of my favorites.\n\nIts interface is nicely simplified without seeming to limit your options or make solutions too simple to figure out. In fact, it leaves a lot of room for the developers to play a little dirty, offering a surprising new action for an object in your inventory without expressly telling you, but without making it too maddening to figure out. The inventory itself is always visible - there aren't a bunch of keys to learn or screens to open in this game, streamlining it and letting you focus solely on what's going on in the scenes, which I was eagerly doing (more on that in a moment).\n\nSome of us adventure fans are considered masochists. If you ever played one of those old Sierra adventure games and wound up quitting the game, ranting and cursing, because of one of those stupidly ridiculous puzzles that seemed near impossible to figure out without a hint or a walkthrough, we were nearly as frustrated as you got, but for some reason we enjoyed it, maybe even for that reason. Usually. This means that a particularly devilish puzzle or lack of one can be both a turn-on and a turn-off for potential players of a game. What I've found happens in response to this is that adventure game makers either choose a side and go all the way with it - either making puzzles so routinely easy that classic adventure fans get bored or including a lot of stumpers that drives away the more casual fan - or try to ride a line in between. Those that try to ride the line tend to fail in numerous ways. Whether it was intentional or not, "The Last Door" does a really good job of finding a middle ground. There were a few times where I had to stop and rethink my actions and goals, looking for what I had ignored or dismissed or simply not put together, however they weren't so difficult that I felt like the game had stopped while I figured it out. Meanwhile, for the majority of the puzzles, there was a logical elegance to them that generally weren't so ridiculously easy and pointless that I felt impatience with them or uninterested. (You can infer from how I described it how hard it is to ride that line.)\n\nI have to address the retro graphics. This is, of course, something that you are either able to accept or not. I have no problem with them (and even smiled at the idea of it before I even played it), but I'm not one to begrudge people's preferences. I can understand if someone finds it hard to get into something with such low-res graphics as much as I can understand some folks' aversion to black and white film. However, if you're thinking of turning away from this because of the graphics, I'd like for you to stop and reconsider. While I appreciated it both for nostalgia and stylistic reasons, the game is worth playing even if you can't appreciate those reasons. Aside from its excellence as an adventure game, the story - which I'll get to in a moment - and other technical details makes this an experience I would hate for people to miss, particularly if you're a horror fan of any sort. One interesting thing to note is that while the graphics are late 80's/early 90's, the audio is fantastically beyond that and up-to-date. I would have suspected that this would clash in the area(s) of my brain related to nostalgia, but that audio is so superb and fitting that I rarely gave that a thought. The soundtrack is absolutely beautiful, with strains of haunted despair, darkness and terror thrown in for fitting moments. I would rate it higher than the soundtrack of any film in the last couple of decades. And then there's the foley. The sound effects in this game could almost tell the story by themselves. The atmosphere they create is palpable and visceral.\n\nFinally: The story. If you are a horror fan, there's a good chance you have at least a passing familiarity with H.P. Lovecraft. There's also a good chance you've been very disappointed in attempts to tap his storytelling genius/madness in both films and games, often for similar reasons. If so, you have been waiting for this game. This is it. This one right here. In fact, I brought up film specifically because this game satisfied a hankering I've had for a really, truly good horror film in a way that I had begun to suspect could not be accomplished.\n\nI think I'll leave off with that. There was more I wanted to say about the story, but I believe I've gotten across what I needed to say in that one paragraph. And besides, this has gotten to be a long review. I do definitely look forward to future chapters of this game.","June 6, 2014","true","9.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Well, I found out that all those people were right. The Last Door is a great little point & click adventure with a dark and mysterious atmosphere and a very well written story which manages to reveal enough to keep you on track but also keeps the mystery alive throughout the gameplay. While the game isn’t focused on trying to scare you as much as possible, there were quite a few situations that kept me on edge or had me jumping in my chair. A lot of that suspension is owed to the perfect soundscape and a classical-themed, melancholic soundtrack that is nothing but a masterpiece. Seriously, I’ve heard about the soundtrack being good, but I didn’t expect it to be that amazing. The controls are as simple and intuitive as it can get with point and click games and the pacing feels right. The only thing that feels a little off is the puzzle design. While it gets the job done most of the time, there are a few puzzles where wild guessing was the best I could do and when I got them solved my reaction was more like “…what?” than “great, I did it”. It should also be mentioned that the game is quite short. I only got 4 hours out of the story, but considering the low price and the fun I had in those 4 hours, I’d say it was absolutely worth it. I recommend this game to anyone who likes it dark, mysterious and enjoys classical horror themes. If the graphic style is the only thing that keeps you from buying the game, remember that a book can’t be judged by its cover and buy it anyway!","July 12, 2014","true","5.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's a fascinating and intriguing story mixed with very fun point and click mechanics, and one of the most atmospheric and engaging point and click games I've played. The pixel graphics are very effective for suggesting a simple and pleasing Victorian tone while creating a distant feeling of ambiguous disconnect which, when combined with the incredible soundtrack, heightens the sense of tension and unknown. Each of the settings in the game work extremely well as the structure on which to hang the atmosphere and mystery.\n\nThere are four episodes, as well as four 'extra' episodes that can be played upon completion of the game. Each of the episodes can be completed in about an hour or so, depending on the player's ability to solve the puzzles which can occasionally prove strangely challenging (in the one or two instances where the solutions feel contrived). Thankfully this only happens once or twice, and the territory to cover by the player isn't that large so exploration isn't too much of a problem. The four post-game, mini-episodes serve to heighten the story and take only a few minutes to complete. The real draw here, far beyond the gameplay, is the well-written story. The first half of The Last Door satisfies the weird fiction fan in me very well, and it promises to deliver in season 2. During my second playthrough I took notes on each of the four chapters to really dig into the story and I was rewarded by the layers of intrigue the writers have included, especially with the four mini-episodes. It's worth specifically mentioning the music, again, as it really does take a game that would be good, and makes it great. The subtle piano and string mixture brings the Victorian era to life.\n\nThe only negative, as suggested above, and this is a far too oft seen trait in point and click games, are the sometimes extremely contrived item uses in order to solve puzzles. It rings hollow when you are required to utilize an item in an extremely odd way that even the character in the game may consider with raised eyebrows.\n\nWith that said, The Last Door is one of my favorite Steam games, and one of the most true spirited games based on the weird fiction genre that I've played. Highly recommended for those who enjoy point and clicks as well as weird fiction - this will be one of your favorites. I enjoyed it enough to play it through a second time to prepare for the full release of the second season and have hopeful expectations that the story will have a thrilling and suitably weird fiction style ending.","April 15","true","9.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Seeing how the game was being funded by each episode, I decided to wait until it was "finished".\n\nWhen it released on Steam, for 10$, I assumed it was. After getting the game... I realized it's not finished at all. There are 4 episodes, and yet no closure. Each episode ends in a sort of "cliff hanger", and the last one follows the same principle. So, know that you are paying for only a part of the whole story.\n\nNow, there's also the fact that this is purely a homage to Edgar Allan Poe and HP Lovecraft (and other similar writers, I assume). It's far more Poe than Lovecraft in both atmosphere and scenes. It's not the scientific exploration of grander-than-life terrors and beings of ultimate power, but more about the schizophrenic perception of the world, one that is full of ravens.\n\nThe atmosphere in the game is really well achieved! And there are scenes that felt genuinely creepy and unsettling to me, which is awesome! The game, despite its very low resolution, looks good, and, for the most part, gives the player enough information. The soundtrack is my favourite part of the game, it definitely fits the theme and is very pleasant to hear.\n\n...\n\nUnfortunately, that's about it. As a game, it's a very average point n' click, with some obtuse puzzles, although it manages to be reasonable, most of the time. There are some frustrating sections, though.\nThere's no player agency.\nThe game doesn't really feel like it wants to express something, or tell a story. It just keeps going, with each episode being very disconnected from the previous, instead of building up to something.\n\nIt borrows from the mentioned authors, but that's all it does. The story revolves around the occult, but not in any meaningful way. I just felt nothing, playing through it. And, for a point n' click, it's a hard sell, to me. In a genre that relies mostly on story, it as very little going for it.\n\nI'll leave it as recommended for the single fact that its individual aspects are very well done, and the overall game is also nicely executed! It just feels rather soul-less. It borrows in atmosphere, but lacks any kind of meaning or expression, in my opinion.\n\n...\nI'm rather disappointed. Especially considering how much I loved the first episode. Then again, this feels like a product. It sells, so it keeps going. I'm not saying the developers have no love/care with what they're doing, since this clearly came from a good place. It just lost direction as the episodes kept going. Looking at them individually, they're good! But as a whole, they don't really fit.\n\nPoe and Lovecraft are mostly known for their short stories, and I feel there's a reason for that. Each story approached a different subject, or a similar subject in a different way. And, in that short moment captured, it made sense! This game is just a string of different ideas thrown together.\nThe game aspect also adds nothing to the experience (aside from using a pixelated artstyle). There's nothing that you, as the player, have to do to that you really need to think about. The puzzles are merely there to extend the whole thing, serving very little purpose, overall.\n\n... I don't know, I'm just rambling, at this point.\nI want to like it, and I do live each aspect of it. But it just feels meaningless. I finished the game without feeling like I experienced much at all.","July 27, 2015","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's quite easy and I completed it without any hints in about 5 and a half hours. Most of the puzzles are intuitive, though there were times I followed the method of trying every inventory item on anything that is interactive in the game.\n\nThe puzzles are mostly fun and progress the story very well. There are plenty of mini cut scenes to keep things flowing along.\n\nThe story itself starts out very well and in the first couple of chapters it is very easy to follow, though by the third chapter I had pretty much lost track of what was going on and I was not clear what the ending was about.\n\nThe ambient sounds in the game are done really well and the couple of jump scares are effective enough. The title musical score is a rousing piece and sets the tone of the game up very well. The characters themselves have no voiceovers, just silent text.\n\nMy opinion on the graphics is mixed. I guess they managed to keep the budget down and thus be sure to put out a game. They are actually quite effective at times and add to the atmosphere and they help to make the puzzles more challenging as it's often not clear what you are looking at until you mouse over the hotspot and click it. Still, there were many times in the game when I was wishing for much clearer and detailed graphics as I was getting eye strain quite quickly at times.\n\nSo generally I enjoyed this title and particularly appreciated the fair puzzles, being not too tough. I will purchase season 2 when it comes out and just hope the story is a little bit more coherent.","September 7, 2015","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game excels in atmosphere and style, thanks to the vibrant yet minimalistic pixel art (very few pixels, but a good deal of awesomely used colors), the Romantic-inspired orchestral soundtrack, a brilliant use of sound effects and a haunting story. With few resources, the game constantly unnerves the player, also employing some effective jumpscares. The story is not completed yet, it continues in the next season, which you'll instantly want after completing the four episodes contained in this collector's edition (for roughly 4 hours of gameplay). If you want an immersive adventure and love Poe and Lovecraft, this is an instant buy even if you aren't familiar with old school point-and-click adventures, thanks to the simple and logical puzzles which allow any player to experience this frightening tale.

It does a pretty good job with that, mostly thanks to a great atmosphere created by the moody visuals and the fantastic soundtrack. The pixel art style works well most of the time.\n\nThe game's biggest weak point is definetly the puzzles. The problem is that most of the time you'll be solving a puzzle without any clear narrative reason as to why you are doing that. For example, you read a note about someone's cat, and find its food bowl. You have to open the window and put some food in the bowl, so the cat comes back. Why are you doing this? You don't need a cat, there's no reason. But when the cat comes back, by chance it leads you to another item you need for another puzzle.\n\nYou find a darkroom for developing photos, find the chemicals needed, and some undeveloped photos. Why do you need to develop them? The only reason the game gives you is because they exist.\n\nSee a door that's locked? Well now you know you need to find a key. Not because you know what's behind the door or that you need to go there, but just because it exists. How do you find the key? By doing something completely unrelated that you had no reason to do in the first place.\n\nMany point and clicks are like this but I guess because this is more of a serious and narrative focused game it felt a lot more out of place. If you're a seasoned point and click adventure game player you'll probably find the puzzles pretty easy, but if you're not the way they often don't make logical sense might be an issue for you.\n\nThere are four episodes in total, each takes one or two hours to complete. Definetly recommended for fans of point & click adventures and horror.","June 1","true","7.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You are then going to be called upon by one of your old boarding school chums, only to discover that he has tragically passed away, but there's something strange going on, something that your mind has blocked out. That something could mean the difference between living and ultimately losing your sanity, and perhaps your life. You will need to take on this first season, four chapter, 8-bit game of twist, turns, and horrific mysteries.\n\nGraphically I have to say I was a little bit weary of trying to go back into the 8-bit realm, but I have to say that even though the graphics were not going to blow me away, the feel of the game felt just right with the presentation being in 8-bit. There were times of course where things were not as clear as I would like to be, but thanks to the ability to quickly hover over different areas in the area and find out what I can interact with, I was about to counter the lack of clarity issue. There are quite a few places that you are going to be in the game, and you can see that even with the 8-bit view you can feel and see the difference.\n\nThe music and the sound in the game were minimal, but that was done on purpose, you had enough mystery going on in the game, that when something actually did come up, and a sound was associated with it, you were that much more on the edge of your seat as you try to figure out what had just occurred. Now to keep with the whole motif of the game there was no dialogue voiced, but I did like the fact that when interacting with key characters in the game they differentiated between every character with the color the text would appear on the screen.\n\nNow lets get to it. This is only the beginning of a story that can definitely go almost anywhere from where they left the story at the end of season 1. From the credits at the end of chapter 4 it would appear that season 2 will at least start soon enough, but enough about the future, lets talk about the actual game. You are going to be utilizing items found in that specific area, be it a house, a school, foggy streets, etc. There's never going to be items crossing over between chapters. Some of the items will need to be combined to make things work. There are times where maybe not the first solution that comes to mind will get you to the next part. I do have to say that there was a bit of trial and error with items at least once per chapter, but that's not to say that this took away from the game. There was definitely a good amount of story and twists in the story to keep me coming back and seeing what would happen next. I do wish there was more to the game, but at the same time there is the promise of a season 2, so I can't complain too much. Well I can, and I'd say, "Give me all of season 2, right now, pretty please."\n\nIs everyone going to like this game? Probably not, the 8-bit barrier is sometimes enough to derail even the most hardcore of gamers, but if you are a gamer willing to take a little bit of a step back in graphics to tangle with a story that does indeed feel like it stumbled out of something by H.P. Lovecraft, you are going to want to take this game for a spin. Now I did say that the length is a problem, and the reality is that even though I stumbled a couple of times, or got lost within the game not really knowing what to do, I was still able to finish off the entire game in just a little over 3 hours. So, as I said before, there is definitely a chance that you will be left wanting to know what will happen next, or perhaps you might feel a little cheated if you try to play it all at once and you feel like you have been left hanging. What I can say is that I enjoyed my time with this game, it was something that I haven't seen in quite sometime with the style they attached to it, and that gives this game an 8.7 out of 10.","June 1, 2014","true","3.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I still believe it was quite possibly the best game ever made.  It changed my life.  I've been looking for a game that can stand up to it ever since.  I think I've found it in The Last Door. The story is incredible, every scene managed to give me chills and make me jump.  The old school format is intuitive (one thing that old point and click adventures really lacked) and paced well.  It reminds me of another old adventure horror game called Dark Seed, also inspired by Lovecraft.  This game is at once completely original and filled with nostalgia.

An almost minimalist graphical style and traditional point-and-click gameplay disguise a dark, intriguing storyline that instantly draws the player in with its Gothic undertones and grim revelations. The soundscape - from the menacing classical score to each and every creepy noise - is brilliant and the whole thing has a wonderfully cinematic feel to it. This is why adventure games are so great when done well.\nYes, this first "season" of episodes is available free online, but this Collector's Edition remasters the first few episodes, contains extra scenes and levels and ties the entire story (so far) into a stylish package. Plus, purchase funds the development of future episodes.\nClever design, great gameplay and a spooky story combine to create a truly magnificent experience.","June 7, 2014","true","3.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The sound effects are great, and the music by Carlos Viola is fantastic, I want to hear more from this guy. Writing and atmosphere are good. Very H.P Lovecraft for good and bad - nice inspiration, but you know exactly what you are going to get even before you start. The C64 retro pixel artwork is a sensible choice for the tiny Kickstarted budget, but didn't really do anything for me and probably look better on a small smartphone screen than blown up on a big monitor. The puzzles are the meat of an adventure game, and their quality vary widely. Some are good with clear goals and just enough clues to make you feel clever when you come up with a bit of lateral thinking. Some (chapter 2 was the worst I think) are examples of "use helium inflated dog on pogostick to make the dragon leave the room and reveal the final map fragment" adventure game nonsense.","June 23, 2014","true","4.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This is not the case with The Last Door, which, despite the Atari-level graphics, has a beautiful atmosphere and fairly effective story behind it.\n\nI am not very knowledgable about the Lovecraft lore or universe, but did not find that stopped me from enjoying the story of this game. The Last Door has actually made me want to research that area and check out some of Lovecraft's stories. While it's not the best writing I've ever seen in a game, it's very well done for being told through text and certainly kept me on the edge of my seat. What is expertly done is the pacing of the game, I enjoy how it is split into the different chapters, and the atmosphere.\n\nI have played some other similarly designed and toned games, such as Home, but The Last Door is the first to really interest me in the style. There were several moments that did make me start, and some of the occurances made me uneasy, but not enough to scare me into taking a break. The scares aren't over the top, but they are definitely effective, and typically made me more excited about moving forward. This was especially true for the first chapter, which I think is my favorite.\n\nI highly recommend this to anyone looking to satisfy a craving for a good story, a good scare and a bit of nostalgia. I hope it's not the last we see from this team!","June 23, 2014","true","4.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

He then embarks on a journey to said friend's house and finds, what else, scary and ominous things.  The game consists primarily of you exploring places to find the necessary objects to push forward, reading notes to gleam the story, and so on.  If you've ever played a point and click before, you'll feel right at home.\n\nThe game is a splendid experience.  The story is cleverly told, well-written, and just downright interesting.  For a game like this, the story has to be the driving force.  And The Last Door doesn't disappoint.  The Collector's Edition features four episodes, each about an hour long (for me at least).  And this is only season one, so there will be more of this in the future.  The other thing to note is the sound design.  The graphics may not look like much, but the sound is absolutely exquisite.  Creaking doors, ominous footsteps, and cawing crows are some of the things you'll hear throughout the game, and they all sound very realistic.\n\nThe only bad thing I can really say is that one or two of the puzzles fall into the "why did I just do that" category (episode four's lightbulb puzzle sticks out in my mind).  Another possible gripe for some may be the price.  At ten dollars for roughly four hours of playtime, it might be too expensive for some.  It all really depends on who you are as a person.\n\nBut hey, if you're into horror, or just a good story in general, I highly recommend this one.  It prefers to build atmosphere rather than jump out at you over and over (there are a few jumpscares, but they're well done).  So turn out the light, shut the door, and immerse yourself in The Last Door.","July 22, 2014","true","4.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Buy season 2!)\n- Cheaper to buy the standard (non-collectors edition) version directly from Game Kitchen. There are a few extras to this one and although they're interesting, they're very short. I think there's improved sound/picture quality in this version too - I haven't played the original version though, so I'm not sure how different it is\n- No voice acting.\n\nIf you like point and click adventure games even a little bit, this is a fantastic game. I appreciate the graphics may be a little off-putting for some (I know it's 'pixel art' but the pixels are *huge* - it's incredibly blocky) - but it's absolutely worth your time and money, without a shadow of a doubt, even at full price.","October 3, 2015","true","17.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Maybe the most important part as first: This is only Season 1 and serves more or less as a prelude. After chapter four there is no conclusion of the story. Only more questions which will be answered in the second season of the game.\n\nBe not averted by the graphic. Personally I think they are in a certain aspects awesome. If you are playing the game you will always recognize what is presented. Managing to do this within the resolution of the objects is an impressive work skill and surely needed a lot of effort. So, no the graphics are not a lazy design decision. The point&click puzzles are mostly on the easy side and you have rarely to rely on random clicking stuff since most of the puzzle solutions make sense. There was only one I could not solve myself.\nThe game heavily relies on its story and atmosphere and the atmosphere is where the game excels. The part of the game which surprised me the most was it's really great soundtrack which is worth to be listened alone. The story itself made me curious enough to want to play season 2 but it may depend from player to player. Especially chapter three is somehow irritating and how it leads to chapter four. It makes you wonder what is real and what is not although this is an aspect of the whole game.\nIf you want a short trip (3-4 hours with the minisodes) into an intriguing world with a great atmosphere and an even better soundtrack then I can recommand you The Last Door.\n\nPS: If you have questions just post them here and I'll try to come back at them as fast as possible.\nPPS: Nothing in the game can kill you but nonetheless there are some effective jump scares.

After a while you find out that something evil is lurking right beyond the corner.\n\nGameplay is really simple point and click adventure style gameplay.

Everything to the soundtrack and sound effects are just amazing. It adds a lot of atmosphere and tension to some situations.\n\nThe pixel art style is really good. I loved to look at the environments just because of the really well crafted pixel art.\nIt's nothing too groundbreaking but it's still very nice to look at.\n\nThe puzzles range from simple to head scratching. I never got stuck but I still needed to take some time to stop and figure out what I was supposed to do, because the game didn't make it clear. For expert Adventure game players it's gonna be pretty easy, but for new comers it's gonna be a bit difficult.\n\nEach episodes give you a different location you can explore ranging from: Gothic London streets, abandoned homes and a hospital for the very ill. Each location has very simple design so you won't get lost no matter what you do. Not to mention all locations have creepy things them, that will creep you out just a bit.\n\nEach episode is really short.

The pixel graphics work well with the tone, the indistinct quality adding to the horror/surrealness.\nWhile there is no run for your life scenarios, it does pyschological horror very well; you are always wondering what lies ahead, and sometimes behind you. Puzzles are usually fun and not overly complex.\n\nUnfortunately the chapters are rather short. expect approximately 40mins per chapter (there are 4). One or two puzzles can be annoyingly complex and can require some unorthodox thinking, but these are really rewarding once solved.","July 20, 2014","true","6.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is pretty linear and some of the puzzles are not so obvious, but that's easily overcome by the fantastic atmosphere the game creates.  This game does a fantastic job of creating a feeling of tension, largely due to the incredible soundtrack. The scares, while few in number, are really well done. It reminded me very much of reading H.P. Lovecraft's stories as I played through.  There are 4 episodes that will take you about an hour a piece, but the story appears as though it will continue in subsequent episodes.

As was said somewhere else (Penny Arcade, I believe), it certainly does seem to be a love letter to H.P. Lovecraft, with some H.G. Wells and David Lynch thrown in there. More than anything, this game is an interactive story, and seeing as how so many games seem to lack a focus on story these days, this does not bother me at all. The puzzles are clever (though admittedly not very challenging) and, most importantly, fun to work though; the characters are engaging and mysterious; the atmosphere is wonderfully elegant and horrific as can only be experienced in great literature.\n\nThe only drawbacks I'd say are present in this game are the ubiquity of the music (it's a brilliant and moving score, and most of the time it fits the mood perfectly, but sometimes it will do just the opposite and break the mood by hammering out in an intense situation that would be better suited to silence) and, as I metioned earlier, the simplicity of the puzzles. That being said, those are not dealbreakers and the game is still a great achievement.\n\nGraphically, The Last Door's pixelated visage might turn some away. I wouldn't consider it a pro OR a con. For me personally, it filled me with nostalgia for old adventure point-and-clickers; particularly the first Gabriel Knight (partly also because of the content), but for others it may separate the player from immersion.\n\nAll in all, if you fancy a great Lovecraftian mystery with disturbing imagery and some legitimate scares, check it out!","July 22, 2014","true","5.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The mood is superb, helped by a gorgeous score (the music in this game is some of the best I've heard this year) and excellent writing. The pixel art is also good, and does a great job of suggesting gruesomeness rather than showing all the gory bits.\n\nMost of the puzzles are fine and make sense, although the game relies a little bit too much on a mechanic I dislike (re-examining visited locations which will have changed since the last time you visited them). Still, the main attraction here is a great old-fashioned horror story that manages to juggle sustained dread and very effective jump scares.\nDo be warned, though, that the episodes collected here are only the first season - the game ends in a pretty big cliffhanger.","September 18, 2014","true","3.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I don't agree.  The game has a brilliantly eerie atmosphere that makes playing it unsettling, a task which is much more difficult to achieve than repeated jump-scares making it almost unbearable; though, there are one or two!\n\nDon't let the pixelated visuals put you off.

It's a beautiful bit of Lovecraftian horror presented as a pixel point and click adventure.  (Think what would've happened if classic Sierra games took a dark and terrible turn.)\nThe music is great.  The storyline is completely addicting.  I try to avoid looking up solutions to puzzles online, but I found myself stuck on this one and went and read a walkthrough just because I had to know what happened next.\nThere's also some decent jump scares in the game.  They're not cheap "things jump out at you" type ones, but they're really well timed where you get lured into a false sense of security and then wind up squealing like a litle girl.  Then you sit back and think "that wasn't too scary...I won't let it fool me again."  But it does.  Consistently.\nMy only complaint about this game involved the art.  I know pixel art is the whole point, but sometimes it was so pixely and dark I had no idea what I was looking for/at in certain scenes and finally wound up turning up the brightness on my laptop and clicking on every single thing.  The other (minor) downside is as it stands right now the game ends on a bit of a cliffhanger.  I understand from the developer's website that they're going to be continuing the story, so it sounds like we'll have more to look forward to.\nIf you like subtle, creepy games or if you're nostalgic for point and click games then this is the game for you.","September 28, 2014","true","9.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The graphics are poor...I think sort of intentionally. That being said, the game designer is a good writer, and there are a few very classy jump scares.

The story begins with you hanging yourself...(you have to set up the chair, get the rope, stand on the chair and put the noose around your neck then kick out the chair...all while it gives you vague pieces of the story).

All my developer sponsored reviews are positive because I review games that I like!\n═══════════════════════════════════\nOVERVIEW\nThe Last Door\n\nThis is a point and click horror adventure. It pushes a cerebral examination of philosphy such as Aldous Huxley's The Education of an Amphibian combined with the void chapter in A Book of Five Rings. The end result is an atmospheric horror game surrounding the darker side of what happend when you look within for an explanation of the universe around us.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/284390/\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nPROS & CONS\nPros\nAmazing soundtrack really adds to the feel of the game\nNo petty jump scares\nThe pixel art adds ambiguity further aiding to the horro by provoking your imagination\nThe puzzles make logical sense and never stall the game\nCons\nSeason 2 is a separate game altogether\nYou can check out season 2 here:\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/402530/\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nSUMMARY & FINAL RATING\nNormally I stay away from horror games. I am truly glad I gave this one a try. This is the perfect example of horror done right. The story is well thought out and is pieced together from a narrative while being supplemented by letters scattered throughout the areas. If Five Nights at Freddy's is your idea of a good horror game, move along. If you think the philosophy of the unkown is a good premise for horror, this might become your favorite game.\n\n9/10\n═══════════════════════════════════\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow  Lot's O Giveaway's  group curations  here !","May 1","true","4.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/oma4/recommended/284390/","oma4","One Man Army","http://steamcommunity.com/id/oma4/","315 products in account","When i first started playing this game, i had a good feeling about it because of the way the story started. I liked the macabre development and the 1800s english setting in low resolution. I thought this was going one of those lower budget games with a great story. I was hooked.\n\nHaving just now completed the game, I'm sorry to say that I am disappointed.  This game feels like an originally decent story has been spread over not only multiple episodes but also multiple seasons. What I mean is that the pace of this game has been slowed down to make it fit in episodes and the ending has been postponed. This kind of manipulation to a game concept is unfortunate for two reasons:\n\nFirst, when i bought the game, I thought i was buying a full game. The title does say "The Last Door - Collector's Edition".  Episodes are fine as they can also be viewed as chapters to a story, but being told at the end of the game that there's a season 2 coming up was unsettling (I wouldn't expect a collector's edition for only part of a story). I felt like a kid being the end of his bedtime story. No way i can sleep.\n\nSecond, because the game makers are trying to fit the story in a predetermined marketing plan, the story feels broken. For example, the story slowly unravels through the first three episodes only to crash with an ending on episode 4 that does not make sense at all. I felt frustrated because I had been very patient with the first episodes to try to make sense of the story and then suddenly we jump to a conclusion which cannot be explained by any of what was told prior...   Did I miss something? I'm pretty sure I didn't. It was so slow I had plenty of time to gather everything.\n\nThe Last Door had a good concept to build upon and I think it could have been a great game if the focus had been on unraveling the story and keeping the player hooked rather than building around an episode/season system.\n\nThere are also problems with the game mechanics. I had to use a walkthrough in order to progress in the game. There were quite a few instances where I didn't know what to do because the required actions didn't make much sense. Also, the story is being told through text at the bottom of the screen, but sometimes you need sound in order to understand what you have to do. I think it would have been a good thing to add text-based cues of what's going on because I personnally didn't hear the crucial sounds until I read about them in the walkthroughs and boosted the volume up.\n\nMy final verdict: i do not recommend the game and will not be playing season 2. I've lost interest in the story. Good concept, nice pixel art, though.\n","May 16","false","6.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

On top of that the story is very well done, but leaves you with a lot of questions and not that many answers.\n\nHowever, this game requires you to have more than just common sense to complete it. Constantly I found myself resorting back to a guide to figure out on what to do next which totally kills the momentum and immersion of the game (which the developers worked very hard on). Example:  There's a part where you have to collect a dying crow and put it in a cat's bowl next to a window that has to be held open by a rosemary... Like what the hell? What human in their right mind would do that? If I were in that situation I wouldn't even touch the bird in the first place as I'd be too worried about getting some weird disease or something. And why does the window need to be held open by a rosemary? Wouldn't a book just do? I don't know... Or how about when you need to get the key from the Lynx's mouth? Wouldn't any object do to pry it open?\n\nAll in all, if you don't mind a guide next to you for when you get stuck, feel free to buy this game. It has a great story and music, as mentioned early, and a jump scare here and there. Although, if you're like me, and you don't enjoy having a guide, it may not quite be the game for you. Also, it has a lot of weird things that you have to do (mentioned in the spoilers) which also annoys me. So yeah... If you're into the story I'd get it. The story if amazing. But if figuring things out for your own is something you enjoy then, well... the answer is pretty simple.\n\nI don't recommend this game simply because the gameplay isn't enjoyable. If you're into stories then have at it. I would never pay $10 for this game seeing as it doesn't even offer 10 hours of gameplay (it could be more if you didn't have the guides).","October 28, 2015","false","1.5"," 8 of 21 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","8","21","0","4"

Good animation, good soundrack, excellent writing, simple interface.  Intriguing story.  Steam achievements.  Evokes nostalgia of Alone in the Dark, Cthulhu mythos, etc.\n\nCons: Pixel art.  The developer should have taken advantage of a 5.1 or 7.1 speaker setup for more immersion with the audio.  Sorry, but I don't like wearing headphones.  Can't save on demand.  The game is broken up into chapters instead of one seamless game.  The chapters were individually developed via Kickstarter campaigns.  This would have driven me nuts if I was an initial backer -- not knowing if enough money would be raised for the developer to finish the game and conclude the story.  Even after raising enough funds for 4 chapters, the developer chose to end the game on a cliffhanger leaving us with so many unanswered questions and a longing for more.  I HATE them for doing this.\n\nSummary: Unless you want to risk falling in love with a story that may never have a conclusion, skip this one until we have confirmation of guaranteed closure from the developer.","October 8, 2014","false","7.6"," 19 of 44 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","19","44","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whiskeybun/recommended/284390/","whiskeybun","whiskeybun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whiskeybun/","40 products in account","Naming this episodic, incomplete game a 'Collector's Edition' is misleading. One may think, as I did, that they are purchasing a completed game. Generally publishers don't release Collector's Editions of incomplete games. Alas, this is four episodes of a story that has indeterminate length. Ah, another thing a casual steam purchaser may not realize unless they did a bit of research first, the first 3 episodes are free online. From their official website: "With the release of each new chapter, the previous one becomes free. [...] Pay what you want to unlock the latest chapter, and help funding the development of the next chapter in the series."\n\nAnother criticism - the art style. On their website it's called 'low-res'. It's meant to only show what's necessary and leave much to the players imagination. Part of me feels that this is an excuse, though. An excuse for lazier art. The soundtrack was great, and the story may have been praiseworthy were it complete. Honestly though any praises I may have for this game are overshadowed in my mind by the developers unethical practices. “Collector's Edition” … what a joke.","July 2, 2014","false","2.4"," 25 of 57 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","25","57","0","0"

This appears nowhere on the description. I played through all 4 chapters just to be confronted with a silly message saying "the adventure continues in season 2".\n\nFurthermore, a lot of people complain that the game requires Adobe Air to run on Linux, which is infamously unsupported. My own installation failed to start, but I found a post in the forums which solved it for me. Your mileage may vary.\n\nThirdly, as pointed out, it is not made clear to buyers that all chapters but the last one are always free, and the last one is a "pay what you want" campaign, as this is how the game developers have decided to fund their game. Steam obscures this fact; therefore you may be a bit disappointed to find this out after you've paid full price.\n\nAs for the game itself, I had mixed feelings. I think the pixel art works well. The sounds and music contribute to great atmosphere. The puzzles were a bit random at times, but straightforward enough to not need a walkthrough.\n\nBut the story is little short of a haphazard collection of new age hippy crap. The first chapter is great as an intro and reels you in with its tense atmosphere, but then the rest just seem more of an afterthought, and trying desperately to piece together a story from nowhere, while playing the pseudophilosophical pseudointellectual card along the way, and relying on the odd "jumpscare" tactic for effect instead.\n\nThe worst bit for me was chapter 2 which is basically a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ christian bashfest.\n- Tell the nun there's no god. Obviously she'll instantly agree and go kill herself because her life has no meaning.\n- Tell the head-nun a patient is in pain. Obviously she'll give you a bible and tell you to pray for him instead.\n- Try to distract the nun. Obviously place a tear on a statue of the virgin mary and she'll instantly go berserk about it being a miracle without even checking.\n- A student decides to read plato and aristotle. Obviously the priest will punish him for reading "devil books" with 50 lashes.\n- People are dying in the monastery. Obviously the culprit is the head priest who like all priests is basically a deranged lunatic murderer with no respect for human life. (and obviously he likes to pray a lot while doing his killing, and obviously he personally employs shady characters to do the rest of his dirty-work. Obviously.)\n\nI mean ... seriously? Gee! I'm surprised there were no paedophiles in the plot ffs!\nIf I didn't know better, I would guess that the developers were a bunch of neoatheist 12-year old brats, constantly patting themselves on the back.\n\nDon't waste your money.","February 13, 2015","false","4.5"," 8 of 22 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","8","22","0","0"

I only completed the first 2 of 4 Episodes / Chapters.  While I liked the dark atmosphere and tone and use of color, the incredibly low-res (160x100?) graphics were quite annoying to me anyway.  Yet I could have lived with the graphics, but the story just had too many odd, weird things continue to come up.  (See "The Eh" below)\n\nThe Pros:+ Atmosphere / Tone\n+ Good sense of mystery\n+ Use of color  (I just wish the grfx were there)\n\nThe Eh:  (Things that certainly didn't click with me...ymmv)\n~ You play briefly as someone who kills themselves...\n~ You play briefly as a nutty priest who lashes themselves...\n~ You pickup a dieing crow and walk around with it in your pocket...\n~ You give morphine to a patient to kill them...\n~ You trick a nun by making a statue look like it's crying, who then apparently kills herself...\n\nThe Bad:- Waaay too pixelated.  I understand retro graphics forcing your imagination to fill in the detail, but ~ 160x100 is just too low.  Your character is 4 pixels wide.\n- A lot of walking around to solve the puzzles.\n- A lot of dropping the inventory items onto objects in the room to make a 'connection' and move the story along.\n\n\nI wanted to like the story, but too many just "weird" things to me in this game.  I understand it's in the "horror" genre, but I don't think those things under The Eh above are needed for a good horror game.","March 8, 2015","false","2.6"," 12 of 31 people (39%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","39","12","31","0","0"

Episodes One and Two were both excellent, whereas Three and Four were quite disappointing. The storytelling started off very strong and seemed to weaken as the season progressed.\n\nThe game's art is perhaps its greatest flaw. The art style does not do much to add to the game's atmosphere, and is very distracting. It makes objects difficult to see as they are often single pixels in the game. The art simply detracts from the experience.\n\nOverall, this game is difficult to recommend, even for fans of the genre.","November 8, 2014","false","3.6"," 10 of 29 people (34%) found this review helpful","34","10","29","0","0"

A point-and-click adventure that cannot be missed.\n\nThe graphics are masterfully created pixel-art style, oozing with atmosphere and just the right palette and lighting effects. The sound and music bring tension and suspense to the package and keep your mind racing with intrugue and that want to know what's around the next corner feeling. The gameplay is standard point-and-click affair with interesting puzzles. Just enough challenge to make you think, but not to the point of frustration. But, all these things bring weight to the main spectacle which is the wonderfully crafted story of Jeremiah Dewitt, on a journey to discover why his childhood friend is requesting his immediate assistance. What strange things happened in Dewitt's past and what world-bending discoveries will he make about his childhood past and what it all means for him now in the present.\n\nI don't want to say too much as this game NEEDS to be experienced. You can see the quote from Penny Arcade below "A love letter to H.P. Lovecraft." This couldn't be any closer to the truth. I have always had a soft spot for Lovecraft's creations and settings, both in his fiction and in the table-top games and RPGs that have been crafted based on his work. If you even have a fleeting admiration for anything Lovecraft, you need to play this game.\n\nIt's avaialble for free from http://www.thelastdoor.com/, but the Steam Collector's Edition brings everything together in one nice package. I did notice there's MP3's in the steam game folder but they aren't organized in a "soundtrack" package, the "official" soundtrack is avaialble on their site for sale which is worth the cost. These guys deserve every penny of the price of the game whether it's on sale or not. If you happen to catch it on a Steam sale, there's absolutely no reason for you to hesitate. It's 5 or so hours of pure bliss.  I can't wait for the next season!\n\nThe Bird....it...it...   *gasp*","December 13, 2014","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I loved it a lot. I can't give it enough thumbs up, as I only have two and it deserves at least three. At LEAST. The music is phenomenal, the atmosphere is tense and scary despite having no enemies to fight. There are some real scares (although I am, admittedly, kind of a sissy and I startle easily, so jump scares will get me every time.) that still manage to convey real horror and dread despite the pixelated graphics. I personally like the retro styled graphics a lot, so I really appreciated the art and the attention to detail the developers managed to work in. The puzzles operate with real-world logic that makes them occasionally difficult but it's never a frustrating mash of madly combining inventory until insane troll logic, Dues Ex Machina type of solutions occur. The writing is exceptional, the main character, Devitt, is enjoyable and I cared about him and his story. The many shout-outs to Lovecraft and Poe were not always subtle, but were always appreciated.\nThe second part of this series is (at time of writing this review) currently in production, and I eagerly await it's release. I have played through the game twice now, first on my own and a second time with a friend, and still found it to be a scary and rewarding experience.\n","December 28, 2014","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The beach scene and the foggy woods are especially beautiful.  Creeping down the dark hallways, I did find myself feeling real fear and steeling myself to open up new doors.\n\nThe narrative is a bit of a hodgepodge--some elements seem more worked out than others. The framing device with the shrink felt tacked on and not worth jarring from the rest of the POV.  The birdthulu mythos seems a little arbitrary, and the relation between the veil and the real world you're wandering in seems inconsistent.  That being said, the gameplay continues to be entertaining.  The puzzles are all logical while still being fairly challenging.  I only needed to consult a walkthrough for a couple moments, most are evident once you find enough objects.\n\nDefinitely worth the regular price and a steal on sale.","November 30, 2014","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The world & story drew me in, I absolutely HAD to know what is going on and what happens next; each episode I played through in one sitting!\nThe darkness in the scenes and the classical piano-and-string music set the tone of a gothic Victorian world perfectly; the illusion is never broken for the player.\nThe 8-bit pixel graphics serve the game well: the lack of extreme detail on everything keeps things a bit vague and thus a bit mysterious.\nThe inventory item use puzzles are extremely logical, and so are the times you must re-visit a room to advance the story or get an item.\nEach episode has a few well-placed jump-scares accompanied by a crescendo in music, and they are tied in to the story and not just for a thrill. If you think a pixelated game can't scare you, you're wrong!\nAll the little details make this game a star. When you are holding just a lantern in the dark, you walk slower (cautiously).

Although I'm not a big fan of pixel graphic games, this one actually filled the gap. I recommend this game to point-and-click adventure lovers.

Although used to games from the 90's my first thought on loading the game was that the graphics were terrible (they actually grew on me after a while).  However, I knew that graphics are not what makes a game good and continued playing.  What a good decision that was.  Although short (four episodes) the game is absolutely brilliant.  As a point and click game it is well structured, fantastically written with some of the best music I have ever heard in any type of game, bringing a great atmosphere to the Victorian setting.  Although the puzzles are fairly simple it does manage to provide a good balance between being a game and ensuring that the story flows.  Sometimes, I find that similar point and click games feature overcomplicated or nonsensical puzzles which can frustrate or alternatively you are railroaded through the game too quickly with too much handholding and not enough interaction. The Last Door is also one of the few games I have played recently where I was genuinely intrigued to see what was behind each door or what the many characters in the game had to say and it was also genuinely unsettling at certain times (with a certain Lovecraftian feel).  If you are a fan of old point and click games, horror games or fancy something a little different than your mainstream games, then give this game a go.

The soundwork is impressive and helps to punctuate creepy environments and situations. The graphics are intentionally scaled down to a level that sits somewhere in the ballpark of 2-4 bit which makes it quite impressive that the game still easily immerses you into its late 19th century setting.\n\nBottom line: If you like either the mentioned inspirations or narrative focused games you will have a good time with this one.","January 8","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nekobun/recommended/284390/","nekobun","nekobun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nekobun/","1568 products in account","The Last Door is a luscious exploration of why you don't mess around with ancient, morally ambiguous powers who think of you like we think of insects. After a visit to an old friend from his schoolboy days ends with an unpleasant surprise, Jeremiah Devitt's days seem to just get worse and worse. Occult dabbling from his youth seems to have come around to bite him and several co-dabblers in the ♥♥♥♥, and it's unclear whether the dark secrets they stumbled upon are out to kill them, save them, or are merely playing with them for their own amusement.\n\nThis Victorian English-set romp is beautifully rendered in a fairly simple but effective pixel-art style, with a wonderful soundtrack to complement all the weirdness going on. The blockiness of things leaves much more to the player's imagination than clearly illustrating the frequent gore or other horrors would have, which I, for one, quite enjoyed. It also leaves a lot of the characterization of the people you meet to the mind, though even side characters who play roles in Jeremiah's quest are well-written to the point you understand their motivations and, to some extent, their own peculiar histories.\n\nRarely, if ever, does The Last Door give you a clear look at the game's overall, lurking menace, but when it does, it's a sharp contrast to the more minor threats that frequently crop up. This reinforces a constant sense of dread behind every action, leaving you wondering what might get you into trouble (especially after the second chapter). The puzzles, on the whole, strike a good balance between being complicated and being easy to find what you need; there were only one or two instances where I got stuck, and at least one was just me trying to do something earlier than possible and worrying about my chances to resolve it after proceeding further. Gameplay flows smoothly otherwise, and while there is occasional backtracking, most of the areas are condensed enough that it's not a chore to do so.\n\nJust remember to pay attention to the audio when you have to deal with the fog eventually. Maybe bring headphones. I think the subtitles reflect what you need to listen for as well in that section.\n\nBut yeah, play The Last Door. I haven't gotten my hands on the second season yet, but I imagine it's going to be just as good.","January 9","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However I believe the rest of the game was funding by Kickstarter and I can only presume the undoubtedly deserved success inflated the creators ego.\n\nEpisode 2 is the polar opposite of Episode 1. We now have the introduction of 'cutscenes' and tedious dream sequences, that force you on to rails and to simply just keep clicking through them. The common annoyances of point-and-click genre, that were so excellently avoided in episode 1, all return in episode 2. For example:\n\nSPOILERS\n\nA music box item, that upon examination doesn't even tell you can't open it or use it. The only way you would discover it's use is by doing the classic, immersion-breaking, technique of attempting to combine all your items in your inventory together.\n\nAn NPC stands by a window, blocking your progress. However at no point are you told that you need to access the window or move the NPC to progress. Furthermore, there is no clue given as to which item you use to move the NPC. The only way this puzzle is solved is by systematically using the correct item in every room. This really dragged me out of the intense claustrophobic atmosphere the first episode immersed me in.\n\nA statue requires an item placed in it, a fair point-and-click trope. However upon examination, there is no indication the statue requires something placed in it, or that it is possible to. The only way to solve this puzzle is by systematically trying all your items against the statue\n\nEND SPOILERS\n\nThe first episode flowed so well, was sensible and really drew me in. Then episode 2 threw me right back out, it's tedious gameplay stopping me from wanting to play on, despite the story starting to hook me.","May 29","false","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is presented in episodic format with four total episodes in Season One.\n\nOriginally I played the first two episodes on the developers site, in Flash format.  Eventually, I think all these free episodes were taken down and only the single prologue remains now.  Anyway, I bought this in order to play the final two episodes.  You can expect to get about 3-5 hours of gameplay out of all the episodes, and the extras.\n\nI have to say that the game starts very strong but doesn\'t end as well as I\'d like.  The first two episodes are high points.  They have a great setting, interesting dialogue, some very scary moments and some unexpected jump scares.\n\nThe third episode is the weakest.  The art is pretty bad, and it\'s very dark (in colour).  In the end the episode doesn\'t add much to the plot either.\n\nThe final episode is just ok.  I will reserve judgement on the ending itself (which is fairly unsatisfying) until I play Season Two.  I guess that tells you what I think of The Last Door in summary: it\'s a decent adventure game that could have been much better had the quality of the first two episodes been maintained.  However, the game is good enough that I am still intrigued enough to want to play Season Two and see how the plotline wraps up!","May 31","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes, it has jump scares, and I'm normally the first to call that lazy, but it does enough outside of those moments to make it worth it. The Last Door chokes you with well put together, creepy atmosphere.\n\nThe main problem is the third episode, which is easily the black sheep of season one. It's a dream sequence, more or less, and the weirdness just becomes goofy. The rest of the game, though, is really fun.","May 30","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Recently I purchased Collector's Edition and played all eight episodes again. The story ended in such a mind-crushing way that I could feel my soul trembling. Despite all the spooky experiments conducted by four (five?) witnesses, they've shown great efforts and very large extend to which human beings can possibly make. Considering that the path to the truth is sometimes terrified and always comes with sacrifices, this game can be very realistic.\n\nThe soundtrack is also a work of art, a masterpiece.  It is emotional, has strong resonance with scenes and surely brings up the horror to a new level. All thumbs up.","June 6","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
