It's similar to games like Portal, yet still unique. The game didn't hold your hand. You were told the basic controls and nothing else. Figuring out that you had to shoot a beam at the floor to create a "time portal" in order to beat the puzzles was very rewarding. I got really excited when I found that out the first time. The puzzles were quirky and fun to figure out as well. I particularly liked one where I had to rewind time to shoot a switch long enough for me to make a jump and one where I found out there was a time limit to being behind a certain door. Also, the Dubstep music was a perfect fit and pumped me up.\n\nThe Bad: The lag made this game unplayable. (I'd like to add that I have a computer that should easily be able to handle this game.) Whenever you placed a portal, it would lag the entire game for a few seconds. It also lagged when shooting, jumping, and doing anything whatsoever. I finally gave up on the game on the first, time-slowing, level I wasn't able to beat it because the game kept lagging when I shot the switches, meaning i fell down because it didn't keep the platform up. If that wasn't bad enough, there were some visual glitches as well. I was on the self-same level, standing on a platform and waiting for my "alternate-time me" to start shooting the next switch. The platform I was on then switched to it's "off" graphic despite it being on, making me jump too early. It also did the opposite where the other platform was on, yet didn't give me the graphic so I didn't know to jump.\n\nMy Rating: [2 out of 5] I would sit on this game until the developer decides to fix these issues. If they were fixed, this would be a solid game that I would love to play. I had a lot of fun, despite the lag, until it made the game unplayable. Hopefully I'll be able to come back to it.","May 23","false","1.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

I'm not gonna lie... I spent at least thirty minutes trying to figure out how to get out of the first room. And I'm not at all past that. By the time I figured out what to, 30 minutes had gone by.\n\nSo far, so okay, but I feel this game could use just a bit more in the lines instruction. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for games that are difficult and challenging, but having gotten as far as I have (so far) and it having taken so long, I'm wishing that there was a little more in terms of what to do.\n\nI guess I just wish that the game would introduce a major gameplay element, like shooting on the floor, and explain briefly how it works. Instead, what happened was me just going all willy-nilly into the game, trying different things to see what would happen. In a way, it brought me back to a time when games just had no instruction, and expected you get instructions from the manual. But at the same time, it was a little uncool having to figure out how a major gameplay element works (I still haven't figured it out, but I only just got the game). To relate this to other games that this game tries to relate to, it would be similar to learning how to open portals in Portal 1/2 but not being taught how to fling yourself. I only figured out shooting at the floor because I tried to quit the game.\n\nI'm recommending this game because I like everything about it so far, but want to warn other players that it will be confusing.","May 23","true","2.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SjoerdThaGamer/recommended/469900/","SjoerdThaGamer","Snolferd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SjoerdThaGamer/","80 products in account","Summary-ish: This game looks pretty. And the controls are pretty too. I just don't seem to grasp the "paradox" concept of it even though I am not a dimwit when it comes to timetravel and other such shenanigans.\n\nThe visuals: Lots of reflections and clean sci-fi look in combination with fluorescent lights and an upbeat track playing when time-travelling make up for ... a, uhhh ... well, good looking game.\n\nThe controls: You walk smoothly and quickly as in Portal, though shooting the laser is a little jaggy (if that makes sense) as compared to Portal. Do you see that I refer a lot to portal in this section? That is because this game reminds me quiet a lot of that game, it wouldn't surprise me if this one was inspired by it. But don't be mistaken, Paradox Paradigm is completely different from that game and in a good way. Not a shameless wanabe, just a good game inspired by an incredibly-amazing-nothing-can-beat-that game. Sorry devs, but nothing will beat Portal 2.\n\nThen there is the "timetravelling", which can create time paradoxes, makes a lot of sense. But roughly 10 minutes into the game there is a point in which I create a paradox of which I simply don't understand how it happens. This is also the reason I'm refunding the game.\n\nI can't possibly not recommend a game because of my own incompetence, and on top of that it looks and plays real good, so I recommend this game if it looks something you might enjoy or if you have enjoyed the Portal series and are up for a new and different challenge.","May 23","true","0.2"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","3"
