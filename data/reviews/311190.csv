Whether you are a casual gamer that just wants to enjoy a fun game with a good story, to a hardcore gamer who prefers roguelites and rage-quitting, this game has you in mind!\n\ntl;dr / quick reviewSuper Panda Adventures is a one of the best examples of the Metroidvania genre on Steam.  It has solid mechanics, fluid and smooth controls, an excellent soundtrack, fun shoot-slash-and-jump combat, and is genuinely funny.  Super Panda Adventures is different and really took me by surprise; so much so, that it has made my list of favourites PC games of all-time.  I am not sure if it gets the attention that it deserves, but this is truly a genre-defining game.\n\nWith a slew of RPG elements in the game, you can level up your character all the way to Level 50 with several weapon, armour, skill and spell choices to make along the way.  How you build your character ultimately affects how you play the game, and visa-versa!  Along those lines, it has a a lot of stats to explore: HP, MP, Shield, Regen for MP, Crit, Melee damage, Magic damage, random-events skills like "Chance to gain 5 Hp when you attack an enemy," and shops to spend collected coins on items and potions!\n\nverdict\nSuper Panda Adventures is simply one of the most under-rated and over-looked Metroidvanian games on Steam. If you like Metroidvania type games, you owe it to yourself to buy and play this game.\nwhat's good+ 8 to 12 hours of gameplay\n+ Full controller support\n+ Well-written and amusing dialogue\n+ Adorably cute, deceptively challenging (at higher difficulty levels)\n+ Varied, colourful and thought-out level designs that always keep it fresh\n+ Many RPG elements for levelling up your character (up to Level 50!)\n+ It's not a platformer--no platformer rage-quitting here!\n+ Good for all skill levels (from Casual to Srsly Hardcore)\n+ Level-up, gain new and significant powers, skills, magic, weapons, armour, and more\n+ Character appearance changes based on selected weapons, amour, and skills\n+ Excellent soundtrack--many  purchase it after playing this game (myself included)\n+ Hidden / secret rooms filled with treasures to find\n+ Fluid, smooth, and superb-feeling controls\n+ Suitable for all ages and skill-levels\n\nwhat's not good- Once a difficulty setting has been selected, it cannot be changed without restarting\n- Sudden difficulty spikes (see note below)\n\ngameplay tipDifficulty can be a challenge, novices should play on Cakewalk or Easy which will provide a stress-free (not challenge-free) ride through this game. Only the hardcore should attempt anything above Cakewalk or Easy.  That is to say, if you select Normal but it gets too hard 8 hours in, you will have to push through or start-over.  I suggest a better-safe-than-sorry approach to this game.  Difficulty spikes at several of the boss levels, but watching a youtbe vid can help with your strategy. :)\n\n\nPlease hit the like button if you found this review helpful.","November 11, 2015","true","34.0"," 104 of 105 people (99%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","99","104","105","0","12"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/taylort210/recommended/311190/","taylort210","Wagglesworth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/taylort210/","3054 products in account","Despite originally brushing off Super Panda Adventures as just another throwaway (and ugly) platformer when I purchased it in a bundle many months ago, once coming to Steam, I opted to boot it up and actually experience the trainwreck first hand, if only for the card drops. If there was ever a grander example of the wisdom, “never judge a book by its cover”, I’ve not found it (at least on Steam). A word to all: Ignore the obvious warning signs of a budget price and lackluster art; SPA is a surprising amount of fun, and offers a stupendous metroidvania adventure, despite a few small flaws along the way.\n\nWhat surprised me most about SPA wasn’t the notably tight controls nor the exceptionally entertaining notion of controlling a panda with a katana. No, what surprised me was the sheer size of the level layouts, and the many paths therein. Levels are typically huge, and often reach deep into the ground and high into the clouds. While there are plenty of collectibles and upgrades waiting to be discovered, the emphasis on exploration and pathfinding is based more on your abilities and equipment as you find them, rather than on hidden paths or destructible walls. Meaning, the passage to a new upgrade is usually only blocked by a wall higher than your current jump, or a door requiring a key that you can’t reach for a similar reason. Repeat exploration is encouraged, and most levels feature something new to do after each new ability is earned.\n\nCombat is also surprisingly prevalent and entertaining, but then, the prospect of a sword wielding panda is an entertainment in its own right. SPA features a leveling system, powered by hidden caches of points and killing enemies alike. Typical upgrades are standard fare, but by finding special orbs in each level, your armor and weapons can be upgraded, and changed in appearance as a result. Although I never became bored with the combat, exploring and re-exploring the same levels over again could have felt more tedious without the consistent rewards of combat or in seeking out hidden caches.\n\nNot all is well, however, and while minor, there are several notable flaws that hamper the experience. Boss encounters typically carry a massive disparity in difficulty from the rest of the adventuring, due to enormous health bars and attacks equally both powerful and annoyingly difficult to avoid. The large levels, while a joy to run around in and explore, have no map system to fall back on, and so path finding relies solely on memory. When looking for each and every collectible and upgrade, that fact becomes irritating quickly, especially on the more vertical levels. Worse, there is no “percentage complete” function, and so those missing odds and ends could literally be hidden in any level, and there’d be no solid clue as to which.\n\nRegardless of listed faults, SPA is an absolute delight. While the unenthusiastic art design would normally all but promise a similar quality of gameplay, SPA provides a metroidvania styled adventure similar to what you would expect of a higher priced title. Given the quality, this game could have been sold at a standard $10 price point. For a standard asking rate of only $4, it’s an absolute steal.","July 25, 2014","true","7.1"," 37 of 40 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","37","40","0","3"

It has a level-up system that lets you customize your hero as the game progresses. You can power up in any combination of defensive abilities, magical abilities and offensive abilities, encouraging multiple playthroughs and playstyles.\n\nThe only issue I have with this game that I have is that I wished that the second character that was cut out was actually unlockable, it would have added even more replay value. It's really not too late to release a patch to add her in IMO. Go buy this game!","July 14, 2014","true","12.0"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","33","36","0","1"

While this game (except the sound) was developed by one guy (who also did the dishes) I will not take it under consideration when recommending the game.\n\nSo what's this game all about? Well, it's a Metrovania platformer with RPG elements, the controls are tight and the Panda is naked, in the beginning. You level up and get skill points and also upgrade your weapons and armor. The story and dialogs are light and simple at first with a lot of silly humor, then the story becomes a little like "The Big Brother" without losing the humor of course. The combat mechanics are very good, you have two basic attacks (sword and shuriken) and a "magic" attack which uses your mana. The fights are challenging enough to keep you on your toes.\n\nFinal Verdict: Play only if you feel comfortable with Panda nudity!","August 22, 2015","true","19.4"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","26","28","2","0"

It's MetroVania done right with loads of unlockables that will make you revisit levels over and over again without it becoming tedious. The story is cheesy, but the characters really come to life through the dialogs. Some of the conversations made me laugh quite hard even. The soundtrack might not be for everybody, but I really enjoyed it. The levels are huge and really well designed. There's a lot to explore and the game rewards you for doing it.\n\nIt's a lot of fun for very small money :)","August 15, 2014","true","12.1"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","1"

Super Panda Adventure is an 2D action platformer with rpg elements.  Think of it as if it where a 2d translation of legend of Zelda games;  You'll find yourself revisting old levels with new abilities and accessing huge new portions of map that will advance the story and put you in contact with NPCs that will send you on quests.\n\nYou collect items that give you experience (although you do not automatically gain xp from every kill, just on item pick up.) and find special "Power Orbs" that you can use to upgrade your weapons and armor with an incresing cost per upgrade.\n\nThe rewards and upgrades are well spaced out and feel earned, making going back to take advantage of a new game mechanic that's been awarded to you that opens a huge new area of an already visited level very enjoyable.  The level design is especially well done and the way the levels are sort of "wrapped around to reconnect" is often very clever and well hidden.\n\nThe game tries it's hand at humorous and is bit campy but it's absurd enough to be enjoyable.  This is one of the best platformers I've played in qutie some time and I found myself blown away by how good this game turned out to be.  Give it a try.\n\nEDIT:  It was brought to my attention that I totally forgot to include the fact that hitting your enemies in quick succession rewards you with experience, providing you with some automatic experience when you are fighting an enemy that is seperate from item pick ups that give xp.\n\nThanks to Yamihe Kazeto for pointing this out in a friendly way.  It definitely needed to be added in order to make my review accurate and complete, so thanks :D","November 18, 2014","true","17.8"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","2"

I played the Desura version.\n\nSuper Panda Adventures is one of my favorite games of 2013. The combat is varied without becoming overly complex (and the native support feels quite good on my Xbox 360 controller). There's plenty to collect and feel empowered. The story is light and goofy.\n\nModern metroidvania standards apply and then some. Those with an aversion to open worlds should be happy that the quests provide decent direction. Meanwhile, backtracking is handled well with the ability to choose alternative areas until new mobility upgrades are found. There's generally something new to find once upgraded even if it's only a stash of experience pickups. Much of the content is optional.\n\nOne cardinal sin involves how checkpoints are placed before the scripted dialogue of boss battles. The text can be sped up with button mashing, but it still increases frustration after the umpteenth death. Autosaving would not be desired due to the game's single save slot per session. However, the ability to immediately get back into the fight would have been nice.\n\nTowards the end, I would have also appreciated knowing the maximum level was locked at 50 and having a list of upgrade orbs I'd collected. However, that's mostly the completionist in me talking as I mourn how video has replaced text walkthroughs.","July 14, 2014","true","2.4"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

Magic: up to 3 different spells to unlock.\n- Characters. Some amusing characters (ninja cat, wizard rabbit, human, aliens) with funny dialogues. The enemies are varied too (birds, robots, slimes).\n- Cool Soundtrack. Really fits in with the game.\n\nDislikes:\n\n- Boss battles. They are okay.\n- No minimap. It's frustrating to explore the world and get lost.\n- Equipments. Can be leveled up, but there are no other types of weapons/armors/shields to wear.\n\nVerdict: There aren't many complaints except some minor ones (which can be forgiven since the game is only $3.99).

Cute art style, funny dialog, fun story, great soundtrack and the gameplay is a ton of fun.\n\nSuper Panda Adventures is an action platformer. You play as a Panda called Fu... bad guys appear kidnap a princess and its your job to rescue her... sound pretty cliche right. And it is, but the story is told in such a way it felt fresh.. at least for me it did! The game plays as a beat em up with various quest giving NPC around the world. Quest that (AFAIK) can be done in any order.\nIts mostly fetching quest which have you go back and forward between levels unlocking new areas to explore within the levels. The levels are well designed and have some tricky(for me :P) to find areas in them.\nYou can gather XP from slain enemies or find them around the world. When you level up you get 2 point to spend on a variety of skills. Also you unlock skills and helpful items and upgrade your gear.\nIts plays great with controller or keyboard. Platforming feels great... combat feels amazing...yeah.. I am trying to come up with something negative to say about this game... maybe its a bit too easy for some... but that is frankly the only thing i could think off\n\nThis game has been in multiple greenlight bundles.. but that does not do this game justice. Honestly Steam should be proud to have something like this in their store!\nI haven't complete the game yet(I will!!) and from what i played the asking price is well worth it! You'll get so much content for 4 usd/eur. This game is a must own and it deserves your attention. For the bargain full price you can't go wrong, let alone when it on sale. There is no excuse not to give this a try! 10/10\n\nEDIT: Just finished the game. And i CANNOT recommend this game enough. Just a small note apparently this game has difficulty settings... i started playing and just kept hitting A ( on a controller) and did not pay much attention (was not expecting much... boy was i wrong).

Even though you can 100% complete the game in about ten hours, those ten hours feature pure entertainment. From the open world & world map (featuring two different worlds), experience gathering, levelling up and spending skill points on abilities, doing side quests for NPCs which often contain good humour, to cute graphics and light-hearted characters who actually point out some of the real-world problems and give the game great depth.\nThere, I mentioned some of the reasons I love this game, and there still remain some I haven't even touched. Upgradable weapons and armor, combo bonuses, awesome soundtrack...you name it. This game doesn't aim to be epic & humongous, but it still aims to be devilishly good in its humbleness, and it is.\nThe only negative thing I have to say about the whole thing is the fact that some of the game's bosses feature large difficulty spikes, especially the last boss. I think you'll always feel like the boss is one scale higher than the difficulty you're currently playing on (there are about five difficulties, if I'm not mistaken). But if you like to play on easy, then you should be able to beat it without any major issues.\nSo if you are still thinking about whether you should get it or not, go get it right away!

There are a total of 16 perks, though most of them need to be unlocked by finding items an spells, and each Perk can be leveled 10 times.\n\nIn addition to the Perks you can level your primary weapon (sword), secondary weapon (boomerang)  and body armor 4 times each with special orbs, but these are usually hidden.\n\nThere are also 3 spells, 8 items which will let you access previously inaccessible areas, and 8 relics, of which 7 are optional and give Perk-like boosts such as (very slow) health regeneration or doubled XP gain from combos.\n\nThe levels are filled with normal pickups like hearts (health), shields (temporary armor which also allows you to explicitly use your shield to block), XP, and coins to use at stores (to buy hearts, shields and XP :D).  However these pick ups do not respawn - once you've gotten them and saved your game, they are gone forever.  You get full health when you level up, but not armor, so plan accordingly.   Enemies do respawn, and have a chance to drop any of the common pickups.\n\nSteam lists my time in the game as 15 hours, while the game lists my last save at 10.5 hours.  Taking idling and retrying after many deaths (especially on the bosses) into account, the game probably toook me about 12-13 hours to beat  on the Hard difficulty setting (2nd hardest), but mainly because I spent some time stuck, and a lot of time exploring for hidden items.  Other people have allegedly beaten it in half the time.\n\nI personally greatly enjoyed SPA, and would recommend it to any fan of metroidvanias.","July 19, 2014","true","15.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

Nothing in the game is especially deep or overwhelming, but it does what it sets out to do well and plays out in a very satisfying way. I think the game leans more toward the Alex Kidd, Wonder boy or Commander Keen sort of platformers, and less toward what most indie games do, which was really refreshing.\n\nIt won't blow your mind but it'll get earn a smile.

For a 2D RPG Platformer it is really fun. It has a very bright and childish feel but I still enjoyed it as a young adult. There's a feel of sarcasm and hinted adult humor. So suddle you may not even notice. Which I love to see. I do recommend for young children regardless. There are a lot of puzzles and it can be very challenging. It's all about getting Fu the best gear, items and leveling up his stats to ensure he can survive. Characters are cute and fun to engage yourself with. Though the plot is pretty traditional. With the hero who goes through a huge ordeal to save a damsal. But it makes it feel classy somehow. Don't know if it's because their Panda's or because Fu is so innocent and really just wants everyone to be happy.\n\nThis is the kinda game where you unlock new abilites or items so you can gain access to new areas. So there is some back tracking involved. But I didn't really mind.

Many of the trademarks of the Metroidvania genre are missing from this exploration platformer: the game is divided into distinct levels connected on an overworld map rather than being one large area to explore and upgrades are obtained exclusively (unless my memory fails me) by progressing the plot and talking to characters. No finding items in the world naturally and, most unfortunately in my opinion, no easy sequence breaks in sight. Quite simply, Super Panda Adventures is a pretty bad Metroidvania game.\n\nBut it's a pretty awesome exploration platformer.\n\nDon't let the (intentionally) "bad" graphics and cheesy storyline/writing fool you, this game has some serious quality to it. The controls are tight, the platforming is solid, and the combat is simple-yet-fun. There is an RPG-inspired level system that allows you to choose new traits to upgrade every time you level up and your equipment can also all be upgraded through the use of certain collectables hidden throughout the world. It's an absolute blast to play and I found myself returning to different areas again and again each time I got a new ability just to see if I had missed anything.\n\nI called the art "bad" up there, but the use of scare quotes was intentional. The art is very simple and, in all honesty, could have been made in MS Paint. There's a lot of character in the simple character sprites, though. Fu, the titular Super Panda, narrows his eyes when he attacks and smiles with glee when he jumps. The enemies all have very smooth animations and are all unique and varied. The NPCs, on the other hand, are literally never seen moving. It's a shame, but walk cycles can be a pain to animate. The art was done in this style on purpose and it achieves a very specific mood. Is it the highest quality art available? Not by any means. Is it good art? Absolutely insofar as it does precisely what it should.\n\nThe plot and writing are of a similar quality as the art: seemingly bad, but done so on purpose. Super Panda Adventures plays out like a childrens' book or perhaps a Saturday morning cartoon. The world is simple, but it's supposed to be. And, honestly, if you want epic storytelling in your $4 video game about swordfighting pandas, I think you might have problems. It's cute and endearing and, after a while, I barely even noticed how simple the writing was. Much like the art, it serves a purpose and creates a mood because of its simplicity, not in spite of it.\n\nThe music is bangin' awesome. There's a reason it's for sale as DLC.\n\nThe ONLY negative thing I have to say about this game is in regards to its few boss fights. In short: they're bad. At the time of writing, I still haven't finished the game simply because the final boss fight is just too hard for all the wrong reasons. The game conditions you to make use of a semi-reckless run-n-swing fighting style, only stopping to bring up your shield briefly to block an attack before continuing to carve a swath of desctrution through the enemies in your path. The boss fights, on the other hand, are slow and methodical exercises in pattern recognition and patience. Don't expect the next Super Metroid Ridley or Symphony of the Night Dracula here. Hell, I'd take Mario 3 Bowser over some of these. Luckily, there are few boss fights in the game and they can be overcome eventually. I'm sure I won't need more than a couple more swings at the endgame before I finish up.","July 20, 2014","true","8.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The music is delicious, the art is clean and consistent, and the gameplay is quite diverse.\n\nYou go into the game getting a bit of backstory and some nice visuals which clearly portray the world you've been dropped into. You have your base abilities presented to you immediately, aaaand then you see some blocks you can't yet interact with—a glowing orb floating only a foot beyond. The exciting thought creeps into your mind, "Yep, this is a metroidvania."\n\nEvery new item you discover makes exploring and backtracking all the easier, whether the new item you've discovered required the former item in order to be obtained or not. You've got a level system, with experience pickups as well as experience gained based on your combo counter, not killing, which is definitely a quirky, fresh concept you don't really see nowadays. Leveling up is quite crucial, however collecting a certain collectible is all the more powerful. Basically what I'm boiling down to is that you are not required to collect every item to beat the game—but the nature in which the items and their collection are presented will entice you to 100% it.\n\nThere are multiple difficulties, the hardest of which, Ridonculous, doesn't really show its effects until you're fighting a boss, where it shines in hellish delight. There are some ever slight, ever rare bugs here and there, but overall it's an extremely stable game.\n\nIn order to complete the game, getting all collectibles, on Ridonculous difficulty, it took me 11 hours in game time, 19 hours real time. For $4.49 CAD, I feel Super Panda Adventures exhibits a tremendous amount of value. I'd recommend this to any platformer-brawler-exploration-delicious gamers who like the idea of a little panda with a small sword and big dreams.","February 15, 2015","true","18.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Anyone with a love of the genre, and particularly those who enjoyed early PC platformers, will find a lot to like here. Your objectives are laid out in a multi-quest fashion, and levels are not beaten but rather explored in parts to achieve these missions. The levels are not particularly numerous but they are vast, to the point that you will still find yourself on unknown paths on your 3rd or 4th visits. These replays are also enhanced by a Metroid-like collection of upgrades combined with a classic colored-key system that provides for a persisent sense of exploration alongside a growing feeling of power and mobility.\n\nThere are no inconsequential collectibles, everything that doesn't fill a meter either directly makes Fu stronger or is money which can be used to  buy additional experience. After a semi-casual 8 hour playthrough I did not hit the level cap, and expect it would take a long time to do so. I think a normal player will likely only acquire about half of the skill points it would take to fill everything out, so your choices in this regard do matter (to the game's credit). They may matter more than you expect though, as there are a few boss fights which unexpectedly and dramatically shift into a much higher difficulty than the levels themselves. 3 different bosses each required several attempts from me and forced me to adapt to a more "pro" block-oriented combat style, and while I felt a satisfying sense of achievement after each, a more casual player might find these to be too much of a challenge to proceed.\n\nThe plot and dialogue are kid-friendly but also dryly amusing for an adult, poking light fun at various game tropes and dashed with a touch of real warmth. The interface is almost perfect with tight controls (bolstered by a nice built-in joystick/gamepad mapping feature), an excellent all-in-one character inventory/menu, and a comfortably traditional HUD. My only interface complaint is that there is no way to tell from the overworld which keys or collectibles you already have in each level, leaving a bit too much to memory. The music is excellent throughout (though after repeat level visits may wear thin for some). The game's art is done in a simple but charming low-res hand-drawn style with a nice variety of theme and color. The levels are distinct and pretty, though the overworld maps are a bit crude and flat (perhaps also in homage to the oldies?).\n\nAll told, Super Panda Adventures is a great little indie platformer at a great little price. It's obvious that a lot of love and thought went into this title. It takes some of the best elements from some of the best games in the genre and smartly combines them into something familiar but fresh and, most importantly, fun.","February 16, 2015","true","8.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/x2Madda/recommended/311190/","x2Madda","x2Madda","http://steamcommunity.com/id/x2Madda/","264 products in account","This game is fantastic!\n\nOkay lets just get this out of the way; The graphics are "bad" and that is the only major flaw.\nThis is not a sarcastic review ala Bad Rats reviews, this game is pretty damn good.\n\nWith that out of the way, where to begin?\nThis is a fantastic example of gameplay over graphics if ever I've seen one. I personally don't think the graphics are bad but lets be honest here, they are not exactly 'modern' are they? They look like they were drawn in MSpaint and I have drawn assets in MSpaint for games, and they looked to be about this quality but if graphics are the only gripe then so be it because the game does so many things right!\n\nYou play as a *spoiler alert* panda named Fu. Despite the seemingly obvious route this might take, no, he does not know kung fu. Instead he has a sword and you slash badguys. See? This game is tricky as it lures you in and then sucker punches you with a fist made of awesome.\n\nAt its core the game is a platformer with plenty of combat thrown in but the combat engine isn't deep. Instead it serves to keep you entertained as you progress from point A to point B and it works really well. Killing numerous enemies in a row will perform a combo chain and the bigger the chain the more bonus exp you get which means you will often want to blaze though areas as rapidly as possible, killing everything in your path, to maximize exp.\n\nIt is a fantastic design decision because the game does feature backtracking but it never feels like a chore because killing things and making long combos is fun. Good game design at its finest.\n\nGain enough exp and you can place them inside a skill tree. In some ways this game reminds me of Alex Kidd in monsterland, featuring stores, coins, secret areas, the ability to upgrade weapons and armor all that good stuff. You also have a shield which you activate by holding down and the shield will trigger your invincibility frames making it very useful to actually use it! Whilst the game doesn't enforce its roleplaying elements down your throat with complex and confusing trees, you will apprechiate the various options as they are all actually useful and you will look forward to leveling up.\n\nThe music? Amazing. You can buy the soundtrack as additional DLC and while I leave that choice upto you, as you play through the game you will really apprechiate the music.\nSound effects? Eeeeh, something "borrowed", something blue. Those are lines from an old wedding jingle but I found it appropiate because sadly you are going to reconize some of the games sound effects and like the graphics they are 'functional' but it detracts from the game instead of enhancing it. Yes the game has coins you collect, now what sound do they make? What is a suitable coin collecting sound, from say, a well known franchaise, like Mario?! So I do have to mention little niggles like that because while I do heap praise on this game, it is by no means perfect.\n\nThen their are the tangible things like the story, the game throws memes in and usually when someone does this it is because they lack any original humour but this game is genuinely funny and on rare occassions it even manages to make dead, overused memes actually funny again whih is a feat in itself I might add! Humour is subjective and it is rare for a game that is not a visual novel to feature writing that actually makes me laugh, so very well done for not only managing to fit great writing into a platform game but in also managing to be genuinely funny too.\n\nAs for playlength, the game is deceptively long without overstaying its welcome. The game is clearly trying to tell a story and while it does pad out the gameplay length with backtracking the game is long enough on its own merits to be value for money despite the budget price.\n\nI don't have a youtube video link for this game as most of you who read reviews, actually hate links to youtube within them, but I recommend you watch a video or two and see if the graphics are a deal breaker or not for you. The gameplay the controls, the content, it is all there and it is really good! But you have to look at a game in order to play it and that may just be a deal breaker for some of you.\n\nIf you prefer gameplay over graphics though then this game belongs in your steam library and you should be playing it!\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","December 22, 2014","true","10.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

The different spells will help with is good because some games have extra abilities that do nothing. probably the worst things about Super Panda Adventures is the backtracking when playing and that you can't really play to long without getting bored.\nSound\nI don't normally play with sound so I can't really give my thoughts\nLength\nIt's a pretty long game and that could be in part because you don't really know what missions you are meant to do if you just want to finish the game without 100% the game. 100% this game is something I haven't been able to do yet but I can tell it will be a while\nConclusion\nIt's a fun game if you like the sound of this from the review, it's cheap $5 isn't asking much, and it's super fun, and something I forgot until now is that (besides the sound) it is made by one person!

Music is pretty cool, though.\nAlso, there are a few glitches, but nothing that broke the game for me. The biggest one that I ran into is that a block spawned on top of the player pushing it into the wall, but I was able to get out.\nPlay this if you have nothing else to do, otherwise, there are better games out there.","April 24","false","12.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I think it's stupid that the shield has a health bar and runs out so fast. I also don't like how when you use the shield your body flashes and sometimes I can't tell if I've lost actual health or shield health if I'm not watching closely. So basically the shield sucks haha but I'm sure it will get better as the game goes on.\n\nGreat little game! And so cheap!

The combat is very simple but enjoyable. The graphics have a wonderful cartoony style and the backgrounds have a number of layers, giving it a nice feeling of depth. The sound effects are pretty typical for this type of game and the music is decent enough. This game is very child friendly and the humar is kind of kids cartoony, but it's enjoyable. Adults shouldn't be turned off that this looks like a kids game though. I'm sure any adult who likes this type of game will find it thoroughly enjoyable. It kind of lost some points for me for mediocre level design in the last few levels and I wish it could have been longer, though the length was fine. I restarted the game once, after about 5 hours of play on a lower difficulty, after having a hard time with some of with some of the bosses. My play time was actually only about 14 or 15 hours on a single play though. Others may have a shorter run time than me. I did a lot of backtracking to make sure I had all the items I could possibly get. Definitely well worth the price though. Overall I would give this game a rating of 8/10.

Good graphics & sound. Simple but meaningful upgrade system with several styles of play. Gameplay is generally unchallenging yet fun, but the few bosses in the game are substantially more difficult. Suggested buy at $5 or less.\n\nThe Long:\n\n1) Gameplay: it's a 2d platformer with rpg elements, so you should have certain expectations going in. Levels are accessed from an overworld, and, in the mode of many games in this genre, you will find yourself returning to old levels with newly gained powers in order to access new areas and gain new items. There are a decent number of collectibles in the game, and it will probably take you 10-15 hours to find them all without use of a guide.\n\nThe general gameplay is fairly unchallenging on normal, though I have yet to try harder difficulties. There are many abilities which increase survivablity to the point where you won't even worry much about getting killed from mid-game on. There are not very many enemies in the game, either, and you will have their attack patterns memorized fairly quickly.\n\nThe very significant exceptions to the above statements are the boss battles. The bosses are few in number, but I had significant difficulty with all of them; they clearly represent a substantial increase in difficulty relative to the rest of the game. They were my main motivator for finding all of the extra powerups.\n\n2) Graphics and sound: I'm not much of a buff on either of these things, but I was happy with both. The music is very pleasing, and the graphics look clean and well-done. I am glad that this game, unlike so many other classic-style games, did not use classic-style graphics that looked like they were ripped from RPGMaker.\n\n3) RPG elements: I would classify this game as having "soft" RPG elements. While you do level up and it is important for progression, there is no pressure to pick the right skills to advance each time. You will get 2 points to spend after each level up on 1 or 2 skills of your choice. These skills can be roughly divided into melee, ranged, magic, and general, but I personally ended up using a little of each. As I said, you will not find the game becoming unbearably hard if you pick some skills before others. The bosses are going to be difficult regardless of the skills you choose, and while some some of them can make these fights easier, your reflexes and your ability to not get hit will matter a while lot more.\n\nThose are the major points I wanted to make. Overall, this is a fun little game that's defnitely worth at least a few bucks. My suggested buy price is $5 or less.","April 21, 2015","true","16.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like minimalistic pixel graphics but in this game it does come out as slightly amateurish.  2) After completing the game I would have enjoyed being able to continue playing to explore and discover more secrets.

The sound effects are pretty typical for this type of game and the music is decent enough. This game is very child friendly and the humar is kind of kids cartoony, but it's enjoyable. Adults shouldn't be turned off that this looks like a kids game though. I'm sure any adult who likes this type of game will find it thoroughly enjoyable. It kind of lost some points for me for mediocre level design in the last few levels and I wish it could have been longer, though the length was fine. I restarted the game once, after about 5 hours of play on a lower difficulty, after having a hard time with some of with some of the bosses. My play time was actually only about 14 or 15 hours on a single play though. Others may have a shorter run time than me. I did a lot of backtracking to make sure I had all the items I could possibly get. Definitely well worth the price though. Overall I would give this game a rating of 8/10.

Despite what the graphics would suggest, it's a polished experience. The controls feel right and smacking down enemies for exp and the heck of it is fun.\n\nThis game is also good at giving a feeling of progress. You gain more skills over the course of the story at a pretty steady pace. And you gain exp with which you get level ups and skill points to level up abilities of your choosing.\n\nI also find the level design in particular overall pretty great! The story requiring you to revisit almost every one of them multiple times never made me get bored of any of them. Apart from being simply very well designed, the maps also have goodies in them that you can grab once you got more skills from the story - so you have something to do on revisits. An old recipe, but it works well for this game.\nI also never had much problem navigating them despite the absence of a minimap. Every area in a level looks more or less unique and quite easily identifiable.\n\nI feel that there is one problem with this game, and that is that the bosses usually seemed pretty tough to me. They were often quite a bit harder than is actually enjoyable. They have so much health, and in my case, most of the skills that I had picked were are useless or really quite weak against them. I needed to grind level ups more than once to not have to play quite so perfect to win.\n\nI still liked practically everything else - this was a fun game to play through!","May 2, 2015","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Despite what the graphics would suggest, it's a polished experience. The controls feel right and smacking down enemies for exp and the heck of it is fun.\n\nThis game is also good at giving a feeling of progress. You gain more skills over the course of the story at a pretty steady pace. And you gain exp with which you get level ups and skill points to level up abilities of your choosing.\n\nI also find the level design in particular overall pretty great! The story requiring you to revisit almost every one of them multiple times never made me get bored of any of them. Apart from being simply very well designed, the maps also have goodies in them that you can grab once you got more skills from the story - so you have something to do on revisits. An old recipe, but it works well for this game.\nI also never had much problem navigating them despite the absence of a minimap. Every area in a level looks more or less unique and quite easily identifiable.\n\nI feel that there is one problem with this game, and that is that the bosses usually seemed pretty tough to me. They were often quite a bit harder than is actually enjoyable. They have so much health, and in my case, most of the skills that I had picked were are useless or really quite weak against them. I needed to grind level ups more than once to not have to play quite so perfect to win.\n\nI still liked practically everything else - this was a fun game to play through!","May 2, 2015","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are also many collectible items that upgrade your abilities. Many of which you can only reach after you get a new movement upgrade. So there is a lot of backtracking.\nThe boss fights are relatively difficult, but you can always come back when you have leveled up a few times. The armor and health pickups never respawn, but there are plenty around, and the enemies also drop some.\n\nOverall, it's fun if you like running around smashing robots and upgrading your panda.

So the young panda facing this threat looks for a way to rescue the princess, save his land and destroy this evil.\n\nGameplay and mechanics\nThe mechanics are quite simple and follow the classic 2D elements of gameplay, but what makes this game rich is the amount of well hidden secrets and powers we can have at hand to advance further in the storyline and into more difficult enemies to beat. During the game we should face a limited number of side quests that will lead us to gain more powers, abilities and weapons. In the beginning we are quite underpowered, but this changes shortly after doing some special side quests, enemies are quite tough to be and we must level up fast, grinding is key to the mechanics for we must develop the many skills we have.\n\nAlso, to add more fun to the gameplay, there are certain relics scattered all over the different levels, these relics will grant you individual abilities that are very helpful to achieve certain tasks, some of them are easy to find, some others are really difficult, adding more hours of gaming.\n\nWhat was a surprise on this game is the fact that we must come and go over and over again to different locations of the map, a reminder of the old school Zelda games, A Link to the Past to be precise.\n\nSoundtrack and sound\nIt is normal to expect midi elements and 8-bit music, the soundtrack is quite interesting, from high-tempo tunes to slow ones, fitting the atmosphere and aesthetics of the many places we visit.\n\nOn the other hand the sounds are very old-school like, many of the sound and effects have this vibe that reminded me of Kirby, Super Mario, Zelda, etc. classic NES and Super NES titles. It also has some sort of Super Meat Boy atmosphere at times.\n\nThe bad but not serious\nI must say I encountered not a single bug nor glitch and not even a crash, the game runs good, it is stable and smooth. But my complaint goes in the direction of the grinding, it is an important part of the game, enemies are hard to beat when you start, and it becomes easier once you gather enough powers and level up, while the grinding of enemies works this way, it tend to be repetitive and monotonous at times and it is also linked to the fact that every time the same enemies will re-spawn at the same place over and over again, this affected me at times in the beginning, not enough health, nor enough mana or shields and many deaths were part of this re-spawning system.\n\nAnother aspect that many players complained about is related to the boss fights, in my case I did not have any problems with them, but sometimes I felt that they were really hard to beat on normal difficulty, I learnt that some patches changed some aspects of this, but still, I can’t but feel some sort of drawback at some point. Nothing that serious though.\n\nFinally, my last complaint and maybe the most annoying is related to the many secrets, sometimes there is not a certain way to know if you visited x part of a level because nothing seems to indicate that you were already there, this happened to me many times. The levels tend to reset what you already did before while discovering new zones. I often found myself running around confused thinking or doubting if I already did x thing or not due to the fact that some locations must be visited many times.\n\nConclusion\nSuper Panda Adventures is a game that has more pros than cons, evidently. The game highlights the many good things that 2D games have to offer, even more today with all the AAA titles and the masses demanding state-of-the-art graphics and effects, forgetting and proving that simple and classic looking games can deliver the same amount of fun or even more sometimes. I recommend this game to any fan of 2D style that likes games with simple and dumb humor, SPA is a great game that stands out by being original and fun.\n\nI urge the developer to deliver more games like this, you have potential, my friend. I can’t wait for a sequel!","January 18","true","17.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The control is tight and the combat is satisfying.  If I had a gripe, it's that the game relies too heavily on the underground "dark everywhere but right in front of your face" mechanic.  That got irritating after a while.\n\nIf you like retro platformers in the style of Metroid, give this game a go.","February 6","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Despite its simple and generic aspect, it definitely deserves a spot in between one of the few games I could still be playing in 10 years time.\n\n\nPOSITIVE ASPECTS:\n\n+ NEVER SAY NO TO PANDA.\n+ Cute, funny and bouncy characters in every corner are there to assist your journey.\n+ Very friendly and humorous dialogue with very few sour instances will surely put you in a good mood for the day.\n+ Easy controls helped me get the hang of this game really quickly.\n+ Low system requirements. It's very easy to run fluid 60 FPS with this game even on tremendous rolling junk PCs like my laptop.\n+ I haven't tried this game out on a keyboard yet, but it sure fares well with my XBOX 360 controller. Very good gamepad support.\n+ Despite having no automatic data saving system, it has plenty of save spots available for every of your saving needs.\n+ So much to upgrade with all those level-ups, you will be craving that EXP. to get the Crits chance to maximum, and you will be wanting those power orbs for you to get the best of best of all armors.\n+ Awesome 16-bit style graphics, accompanied by proper, majestic music and booming sound effects. No real flaws on the cosmetics.\n+ Tremendous hack-and-slash mechanism, since you don't flinch when damaged, very useful while going in a frenzy.\n+ Amusing story revolving around your typical damsel-in-distress adventures. Personally, I enjoy it.\n+ Extremely vast worlds. Wow, there's so much to come back for in every level, so much to collect and so much EXP. and power orbs to gain.\n+ Accesibility to each little corner in every dungeon is drastically boosted with each power-up item you recieve in your journey. You'll see tremendous movability improvements every time you obtain one!\n+ Balanced difficulty. Hoardes of weakling overworld enemies and very challenging bosses will make you feel alive as you whopp their butts in the dozens at a time.\n+ No spam side quests. Completing each quest will be properly rewarded, and eventually you'll find out how they are all mutually chained in order to complete the main story.\n+ The creator made sure every defeated enemy individually had plenty of debris flying around in order to make sure your kill is graphically rewarded.\n+ There's a robot enemy wearing an Anonymous mask, and the final boss shows a trollface when launching one of its hardest-to-avoid attacks.\n+ This game could have had a potential SNES release back in the days, heh.\n+ Not having to do anything at all with Kung Fu Panda is up to you if this is a good thing or a bad thing, but for me it really doesn't matter much anyway.\n+ It's a good game in general, and it's perfectly suited for all the family to enjoy together, from the smallest peeps in the house to the most hardcore of all gamers.\n+ So much bang for the buck in this game. Its content/penny ratio makes it feels like they're selling a ticket for a 10-day trip to Disneyland at the price of three Snickers chocolate bars.\n+ All credit goes to a whopping team of 2 brave men: one mastermind who conceived the entire idea single-handedly and another hero who composed the awesome soundtrack. Appreciation to their efforts.\n\n\nNEGATIVE ASPECTS:\n\n- No Steam Achievements. An unexploited wonder, and this game has so much Achievement potential, it is capable of some good dozens of hundreds of challenges to accomplish... Shame, just shame.\n- No controller D-Pad support at all for some reason. Pretty much blows away every chance I had to try this game out with an SNES gamepad, for mere curiosity. :(\n- Nothing else. Basically, every second I have spent with this game, were worth even more than each little penny I spent on this game. Seriously, what a worthy tradeoff. Very rarely I end up THIS satisfied when purchasing anything. :)","January 30","true","17.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are also many collectible items that upgrade your abilities. Many of which you can only reach after you get a new movement upgrade. So there is a lot of backtracking.\nThe boss fights are relatively difficult, but you can always come back when you have leveled up a few times. The armor and health pickups never respawn, but there are plenty around, and the enemies also drop some.\n\nOverall, it's fun if you like running around smashing robots and upgrading your panda.

Definitely one of my favorite platformers. To give you an idea, another two favorites of the genre are Apotheon and Capsized, though this game is nothing like either of those other than that they are all platformers. It's hard to directly compare this to other games. Maybe a good description might be that it's a mix of like Super Mario Bros, one of the old gameboy Zelda games I use to play, and like if you were to play the Kung Fu Panda movies as a game with RPG elements. This is a terrible description, but there it is. It's a very accessible game with a lot going for it. Enough story to keep you going and entertain (easy to follow and casually quest-driven), great upbeat music (I swear I hear a little Frozen Synapse in one of the songs and it makes me wonder if the music designer isn't the same person), excellent and smooth gameplay, good level design, and a well-integrated RPG system. Definitely recommended.\n\n------- Addendum --------\n\nStuck on the last boss at 22 hours of gameplay!
