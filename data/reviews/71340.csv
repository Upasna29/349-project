The old school original Genesis 2D platformers that have you speeding through winding labyrinths. The other half has more modern Sonic games that are not only 2D platformers, but 3D platformers and straightaway running in 3D. After completing the first level as old school (classic) Sonic, you're treated to a story cut scene. The game then game opens up to the platforming hub level. The hub level lets you switch between the two versions of Sonic. Levels are full of loops, straightaways, platforms, rails to grind on, tubes to shoot down like Sonic 2's bonus round, spikes, death pits, water, red rings that will launch Sonic and many paths here and there. While Sonic can't swim, he just jumps higher underwater when he used to just move slow in previous games. The levels are throwbacks to previous Sonic games. Consider it a best of collection.\n\nThe game consists of three major chapters. Every chapter has 3 zones. Each zone has two levels (acts), the first level is that straight up 2D platformer and the second level is the more modern 3D version. You can tackle them in any order that you like. Once an act is complete, you rescue one of Sonic's many friends. After you complete the 6 levels of each chapter, then challenges become unlocked. Each zone has 5 challenges for each version of Sonic. 3 keys will also appear in each chapter and unlock when you complete one challenge from a zone. Then if you have 3 keys in one chapter, you can use them to unlock the boss for that chapter.\n\nThe challenges offer some variety with objectives. For the most part you're just running through the same levels you had to get through to unlock them. There are a few unique levels in the challenges. The challenges range from beat the clock, racing tails in a plane, racing your own doppelganger (ghost), timed drifts, enemies moving at double speed and completing a level with only one ring. Since you rescue Sonic's many friends, there are special levels that make use of them to help Sonic. Amy Rose has a hammer that if you time it correctly you can do a mega jump. Knuckles will dig up medals for levels that you need X number of medals to complete the challenge. Rogue will charm armored enemies so Sonic can defeat them. Every enemy that gets defeated in her level makes hollow blocks into solid ones. It feels like a way to make a 4 hour game into an 8 hour game.\n\nNot only does every chapter have a boss, but there are also mini bosses. Basically you walk up to them in the hub level and challenge them. Once they're defeated, you get yourself a chaos emerald since there are no bonus levels like previous Sonic games. Each boss is original and unique, since Sonic has so many characters, you'll never fight the same one twice. The main bosses are gigantic. To take them down, its not just hitting a boss, but its timing the attacks when bosses are vulnerable and the way you'll need to make them vulnerable.\n\nSince it is like two games in one, there are two sets of controls. The old school sonic that has just a jump button. Who can duck and hit the button to start a spin dash that he'll release when you let go of down. Then there's the modern sonic that has the same controls for the most part. Modern Sonic has a homing attack that will lock onto an enemy, springboard or claw and dart to them in mid air. This helps with traversing the land as its a lot quicker than loading up a spin dash. Sonic can now slide under objects as he runs, but it feels more like a quick time event than anything. There are even level specific controls like wall jumping back and forth. Sonic will even find a way to make him stick to walls and ceilings.\n\nThere is also a boost button that will send Sonic instantly dashing. The boost has a meter that decreases over time. To get boost you will need to collect rings. You can also get boost from drifting around corners when you're in a straightaway by holding the L or R when you go into turns. On top of that, you can gain boost by jumping through rainbow rings that will let you do mid air tricks by hitting the left thumbstick. Comparing the two control types feels like old school Sonic is one dimensional. This could be a subtle way of proving which character is better.\n\nThe Sonics also have skills that you can use to customize them. Things like stopping on a dime no matter how fast you're going. Getting an extra life when you run out. Not taking fall damage and so on. There are even skills just for classic Sonic and others just for modern Sonic. Each skill you unlock uses points. You have 100 points to assign the skills. So the better the skill, the less others you can assign. There are loadouts too for quick assigning.\n\nAs always rings are like Sonic's health. If you have a ring, Sonic can take a hit from an enemy or spikes. That will send the rings spraying from his body. If you don't have a ring when Sonic gets hit, he loses a life. The game's helper even announces it.  The game's helper is a big help, especially with the challenges. The helper will explain everything as you play including how to defeat the bosses. You can of course turn the helper off.\n\nSonic Generations puts a real emphasis on speed more than the original Genesis games. The boosts, the loops, the bosses chasing you, a semmi truck trying to ram you, competing against doppelgangers. It all goes to prove that Sonic is fast if not parkour with his homing attack. At the end of each level and challenge, you get graded with par times. It almost feels like a racing game disguised as a platformer.\n\nThe game is beautiful, but it feels like a beast on my system, causing me to lower resolution. Every blade of grass gets rendered and everything is colorful. The only problem is Sonic is super small on the screen. He gets dwarfed by how gigantic the world is around him and the camera never really being tight up on him. As everything blurs from the speed its easy to lose sight of him in 2D. Because of this, some of the game felt to me like it was playing itself. Even the quick time slides still made Sonic slide when I failed to push a button. Not holding the thubstick still made him move. Some of it gets relegated to timing homing attacks to get over areas. Is that a bad thing? No its visually impressive even if I don't feel like I have complete control.\n\nAnother problem in the 3D worlds is no camera control. You're stuck looking at what the game wants you to. While that's not always a bad thing, it can be problematic. Sometimes I lost sight of Sonic or couldn't see a gap between areas sending into death pits. There were plenty of times in 3D terrain I jumped to my death. Often from misjudging where I was or from Sonic's slippery turnarounds. Often times Sonic would stop in mid air to fall to his death even having full momentum into a jump. Using boost to run over water is treacherous. Even in what looks like ankle deep water can send Sonic to his doom if you get clipped by a platform and stopped.\n\nThere are plenty of extras to unlock including artwork, music that you can select to replace the current level music. It is a lot of content with 18 levels, skills, 90 challenges. For me it felt like the fun didn't last as long as the challenge. The death pits and water deaths seemed too constant. Even with a few glitches here and there, the game is by no means bad. It is just trying to be everything at once. Playing the classic Sonic feels forced when modern Sonic has so much diversity. I'd rather play one or the other.  To get to a destination, I can drive a car. Then I can flatten the tires and drive for 5 minutes. After that I can fill up the tires again. Then flatten the tires again after 10 minutes and fill up the tires again. I'll still get to my destination, but I'd rather not have flat tires from level to level. I would have appreciated if the game had two halves. If only you could complete a classic half and a modern half, without completing them both at the same time.","November 18, 2014","true","8.8"," 174 of 188 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","174","188","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathwing107/recommended/71340/","deathwing107","Deathcon 4","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathwing107/","125 products in account","Summary: Sonic Generations is a nostalgic trip with a modern gaming twist celebrating the 20th Anniversary of the Blue Blur himself, Sonic the Hedgehog. Sonic and friends are tossed into the void between time and space itself by some mysterious figure known as the time eater, with Sonic and Tails meeting up with their past selves, save their friends, and make time itself whole again. Relive new representations of the classic levels you know and love, as well as BETTER representations from less than stellar sonic installments, and celebrated the Gaming icon's 20th birthday!\n\nStory/Plot/Setting: Not much to say here in terms of the story itself. In contrast to the more serious approach to storytelling that the series was originally trying (and failing at in this writer's opinion), the story is more lighthearted and simplified. Sonic and friends are caught in the white void between space and time by a foe known as the time eater. Since I try to write without giving away spoilers, I will say that for the most part, the story works in a way simply to push the game along and I feel this does it very well. The flow of the story is never bland, but most of it is driven along just to give a point to what you're doing. Even then, things are mostly there... just because. This isn't a detriment at all to the game itself, though, but if you're expecting a magnificent narrative meant to make you think, you may want to look elsewhere. Regardless, what is there has a great flow to it, so you never feel lost as to what is going on. You may shake your head a couple of times when the characters try to figure out what exactly is happening when you've figured it out practically from the start, but other than that I don't have anything to complain about.\n\nGameplay/Content/Controls: Gameplay is where this game shines. The gameplay of Classic Sonic will bring you a nice nostalgia trip if you've played the Sonic games from the Sega Genesis/Megadrive era. I'm even amazed that his physics feel so familiar to that era as well. Since I've been a fan of Sonic since his first release on the Genesis, I was happy to see how well he was handled. The level design for classic sonic, though in a 3D style, are still handled like a 2D side scroller. This is in contrast to modern sonic level design, which share 2D and 3D segments. Modern Sonic's gameplay will feel familiar and probably much more comfortable than before if you've played Sonic Unleashed or Sonic Colors (I've only played Unleashed, but I'm aware that the basic gameplay of Colors is similar), as the concept is the same. It feels the most solid in this installment. Speed is handled incredibly well, never feeling completely on rails. With both sonics you'll find branching paths, threatening enemies, and several ways you can easily screw up if you aren't paying attention. There's challenge, but it never feels difficult to finish a level. The only time I felt frustrated was with the Modern version of the Sonic 2006 level, Crisis City.\n\nSpeaking of the levels, each is one taken from a major installment of the sonic franchise, with the exception of Sonic CD, which was represented by the Metal Sonic Rival Battle in Stardust Speedway bad future. In addition to the levels themselves, you have a multitude of challenges that you can do as both Classic and Modern sonic. While you're only required to do one challenge for each stage represented to get keys to unlock the boss fight, it would worth your while as a sonic fan to do the others, as you can unlock more songs as well as artwork from the series as a whole. Plus most of the challenges are pretty fun, so you'd be doing yourself a disservice just simply skipping over them. If you do, however, it won't take you long before you beat the game. You could easily finish Generations within about four or five hours depending on quickly you get comfortable with the gameplay. The challenges can add on a few more hours of gameplay, as classic and modern sonic have twenty seven challenges each, making that a total of fifty four challenges you can do if you'd like. Since this was a 2011 release, the price now might entice you to buy it. But I would still recommend this is worth it at its original retail price if you've been a big fan of the Sonic series as I have been.\n\nAlthough I have praised the controls for the most part, there are two problems I need to point out. On the PC version of Generations, I noticed a weird but occasional issue with button response while using a controller. Quite a few times I noticed that Sonic would refuse to jump or do his homing attack. What's even weirder is that I could not emulate the issue, so it has nothing to do with character animations negating button presses. My controller has also had no such issues with bad response when I used it on other games as well, so I don't believe my controller to be malfunctioning. I don't remember having this issue when I originally played this game on the XBox 360, so if this issue turns you off to the game, consider looking for it on console.\n\nMy other issue with regards to controls is the final boss fight, as well as segments where Sonic is either flying or falling. These segments have incredibly floaty mechanics, requiring you to negate your inertia in one direction in order to start going into the direction you want. While these segments are rare, it makes the final boss incredibly frustrating and almost killed my enjoyment of the game. Thankfully it didn't, as my experience with the rest of the game was just too good.\n\nSound and Music: I can safely say this is a shining put of this game. All sound effects are impactful, make sense, and truly immerse you in the experience. And the music. Oh wow the music. Each stage contains remixed versions of their music, which they took very seriously to still fit the mood of the stage while at the same time feeling familiar to their original iteration. You can also unlock more songs through the challenges, which you can use to replace music in any stage, boss fight, or challenge you'd like. My only gripe is that you can't do this with the default stage songs as well.\n\nGraphics: On PC, you won't find the game to play any better at max settings than you would on the Console versions, but the game still looks very nice. As a 2011 release, the game still looks very aesthetically pleasing even today in 2015. I feel that this is due in large part to the art style, which has also stood the test of time. So if you want a pretty looking game, then look no further.\n\nConclusion: Though a short game with a few control issues and a simple story, Sonic Generations proves to be a great game in and of itself. You can tell that the development team wanted this to be a Sonic game that was remembered in a good light, considering the unfortunate flops that the series has and continues to endure to this day. Though Console might be your best bet for this title, the PC version is still good enough to recommend if you don't have one.\n\n[Correction: There's actually 90 challenges total, not 54 like I originally stated.]","October 25, 2015","true","12.5"," 80 of 85 people (94%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","94","80","85","8","4"

Much better than recent Lost World. Seemingly just typical PC version platformer, this game has everything that made console ports awesome: satisfying gameplay, great visuals, cool atmosphere, catchy music and some of the very best level design franchise had ever had. On top of that, replay value is top notch, and game constantly rewards players after every collectible and bonus level.\n\nThough, all of those bonus levels aren't fun, and bosses are sort of letdown too, weakest area of the game being the story... i mean... bunch of cutscenes. Extra levels have their moments, some of them being equal to main levels, but many also turn out frustrating, gimmicky and boring. Bosses have moments too, but they are mostly just simple gimmicks. Cutscenes are, however, total missopportunity. Also, take note on length, which depends on how much you want to come back to replay game, or beat friends records online. Also, incredibly weak pinball DLC.\n\nWhat makes this version best, is the fact that good computer runs it on amazing framerate. Mod support deserves big note here, good ones already existing, new amazing ones still coming. And never have mods been so user friendly or safe to use. That alone adresses lenght issue.\n\nSonic Generations is not just good Sonic game, this is worthy purchase for all those in need of satisfying, arcade-ish platformer. No other series has seen such an significant step-up for sake of anniversary game.","October 20, 2013","true","38.7"," 86 of 94 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","86","94","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/riomhaire/recommended/71340/","riomhaire","Oakreef","http://steamcommunity.com/id/riomhaire/","563 products in account","HowLongToBeat.com lists this game as taking five and a half hours to beat. Compare that to my playtime. I've gotten to the point where I can beat most levels in two or three minutes and I still keep going back to them. It's not a hugely challenging game but the experience of just running through the levels is delightful and relaxing while still demanding your attention to successfully complete. Shaving off seconds of your best time or just messing around and exploring the alternate paths makes for a fun distraction of an evening.\n\nI generally go back and replay Sonic 3 & Knuckles at least once a year. I love that game and it was by far my favourite in the franchise. I say was because Generations is now a very, very close second. Only the final boss - which, in contrast to the rest of the game, is a trainwreck - holds it back from the top spot.\n\nThe nine levels from the game are taken from previous games. Revisiting some favourites from the old games is lovely, but these levels are great by themselves apart from the nostalgia factor. Each level is split into two acts, in the first you play as "Classic Sonic" who is styled after Sonic's sprites from the very first game. He handles very much like the Mega Drive games with only minor differences in physics (though his spin dash has been upgraded to the point of being almost hilariously powerful and fast) and really captures the old feel in a way that Sonic 4 absolutely did not.\n\nAlso unlike Sonic 4 the game makes full use of its 3D environment while still playing entirely in 2D. The background scenery is gorgeous and used in ways that would not be possible in a fully 2D game.\n\nThe 3D levels play like an amazing mix of standard 3D platformer, racing game and rhythm game. It moves much faster than the 2D sections but the forward facing camera allows you to see what's coming up ahead and react accordingly. This half of the game is much more dynamic with far more buttons on the controller being used as Sonic runs, jumps, boosts, slides, stomps, sidesteps and drifts through the levels.\n\nThe levels, both 2D and 3D, are much more designed than those of the Mega Drive games. There is less general exploration and open areas than in the old games. This is not necessarily a bad thing. The rule of high route = fast and low route = slow is enforced strongly throughout the game. Failure to hit a jump correctly does not (usually) lead straight to a bottomless pit but instead to a lower path. These diverging paths periodically meet back up for the levels set pieces which provide some spectacle for the player before allows them to try and get to the top route again. It's a clear system that gives the player a goal on replays: Learn the top paths and get them down to a tee.\n\nThere's also a variety of side missions for each level. Only 9 out of 90 need to be completed in order to beat the game, making them a nice mostly optional challenge for those who want to get a bit more out of it.\n\nThe game features 7 boss battles which are all quite varied but all, apart from the atrocious final boss, are great fun.\n\nAs for the story, there's thankfully not much of one.\n\nThere's also some nice extra level mods for this game both released and on the horizon.\n\nI foresee myself replaying this game for a long time to come.","November 25, 2013","true","87.9"," 57 of 61 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","57","61","0","0"

It's a real nostalgia filled treat as you travel to iconic zones from previous games in completely new levels that reimagine the classics with crisp visuals, an amazing soundtrack and faithful gameplay.\n\nThere's a little something for all of Sonic's fans here, whether you started with the classics or are a newcomer to the series. The game features the blisteringly fast paced (but never uncontrollably so) sidescrolling platforming the series is known for, refined 3D levels that certainly feel better than previous games attempts, a multitude of ways to reach the goal that can keep replayabilty high, a new soundtrack that echo's the themes of previous games and a great deal of content to keep you busy for hours.\n\nAs always, Dr Eggman (or Dr Robotnik to some) is up to his old tricks and in his attempts to stop Sonic once and for all, has brought chaos to the timelines bringing old and new together. You'll play as both the cute classic Sonic and the more lean modern Sonic in their attempts to stop him and restore the correct timeline. As well as the 9 main acts (18 levels) there are around 90 'challenges' that shake things up a bit, such as collecting a specific number of rings before you reach the goal or even calling on the aid of some familiar faces to help you out.\n\nWhile the sidescrolling platforming is among the best the series has to offer, the 3D platforming, while not bad, isn't quite up to the same quality. This is in part due to controls that can sometimes cause frustration and the overall lack of platforming as you simply slide from side to side as you hurtle forwards. Also of slight disappointment are some of the boss battles, most notably the final boss, which feel a bit out of place and are certainly not as fun as the old classics.\n\nSonic Generations is quite the anniversary present that I'm sure will not only delight old fans but will likely create some new ones as well! While the game has a couple of missteps, it never falls flat on its face and remains an enjoyable experience from start to end - well recommended!","April 7, 2014","true","21.1"," 51 of 56 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","51","56","0","1"

SEGA proves that Sonic the Hedgehog can still remain relevant in the platforming genre that has been mostly dominated by fat Italian plumbers. With decade’s worth of nostalgia and fan service being crammed inside the title of “Generations” is truly fitting. The game focuses on playing as both a side scrolling “Classic” Sonic that plays like Sonic from the Sega Genesis and then 2D/3D style “Modern” Sonic which plays like Sonic Colors or Sonic Unleashed. The game offers some of the finest platforming (both 2D and 3D) that you’ll be able to find on the PC.\n\nMany often criticize sonic games by complaining about the “speed” of Sonic the Hedgehog and that when playing he doesn’t feel fast enough, or that they make him too fast and the platforming isn’t enjoyable, Sonic Generations finds that perfectly happy medium between speed and platforming, It is incredibly fast paced but it doesn’t force you to go insanely fast if you don’t want to, if you want to take your time and try to gather all the collectibles it gives you the option to do so. If you’ve ever played any of the games from either era of Sonic then you will be right at home with the combat system, either jumping on heads or using a spin attack as “Classic” Sonic, or flying through the air using homing attacks as “Modern” Sonic. Both the combat and platforming controls feel tight, fast, and fluid, it handles just the way a sonic game should. The game also periodically shakes things up by adding in fairly interesting boss battles that are each centered on a different type of combat component that you haven’t previously experienced in the game prior.\n\nSonic Generations is quite the visually stunning game, the game looks absolutely gorgeous, especially the redesigned HD versions of classic Sonic levels. And the 60 FPS of the PC version makes the game feel and run buttery smooth, which is an absolute must for game that revolves around moving at such a high level of speed. The game also boasts an impressive soundtrack featuring a plethora of some of the greatest hits from Sonic games.\n\nThe main story sadly only takes around 5-6 hours to complete, However despite the fairly short campaign, Sonic Generations is crammed to the brim with unlockables, collectibles, game modes and challenges that will easily put your play time into the double digits if you tried to 100%. Don’t let the short campaign scare you off, even if you’re the type of gamer who likes to do a single play through and be “one and done” ,Sonic Generations is a high enough quality game to warrant spending at that type of price to gameplay hours ratio\n\nOverall the game shows that Sonic still has what it takes to be a powerhouse of the platforming genre, offering fast fluid controls, amazing level design, beautiful visuals, an incredible soundtrack and enough fan service to make any devote Sonic worshipper cry tears of joy. The only downside of the game is that by the time you beat it you’ll still want more.\n\n\nhttp://noobsthatplaygames.com/","January 15, 2015","true","6.4"," 36 of 39 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","36","39","5","0"

Hear the new Escape From the City remixes it's a holy sound to everybody's ears, highlighting Modern Rooftop Run, my favorite from the entire soundtrack.\n\nThe modding community just turns the PC version even better, with new stages, other Sonic series characters, even characters that are not from the series. Dario ff/Samothethief and the Team Unleashed made a flawless job with the "Unleashed Project" a mod that adds all the main day stages from Sonic Unleashed, this mod it's just perfect for the people who played Sonic Unleashed and liked it.\n\nAnd now... for the thing:\n\nPros:\n-Awesome graphics\n-Easy controls for both Sonics\n-Nostalgia bomb\n-Flawless soundtrack\n-Well done stages\n-Easter eggs  (Most of them are on the Adventure Era)\n-The price.\n\nCons:\n-Almost no challenge.\n-Easy stages and bosses, if you're an expert in Sonic games, don't do normal mode, go on Hard mode.\n-Very short game, you can finish it in 2-4 hours.\n-Just Classic and Modern Sonic as playable characters.\n\n"Sonic Generations is a epic game, it is an awesome game on it's own, with mods, it's even better, i am a huge Sonic The Hedgehog fan, and i'm proud that i bought this game"[/h1][/b]\n\n9.0/10 - Rick The Hedgehog","October 14, 2014","true","107.9"," 44 of 53 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","44","53","0","3"

Get a controller for this game, really makes everything more easy to play.\n\nThe real great thing of this game is the soundtrack: all styled as the old and fantastic Sonic's soundtracks, they know how to bring you back. Also, if you move around really fast in the main zone where you have to choose the stage, you can hear how they timed them to make an infinite song with all the background ones.

Each level is split between a traditional 2d platformer and a more modern 3d platformer giving you a total of 18 levels. The levels are chosen from the sonic universe.\n\n+ Every level is designed with multiple pathways providing replayability\n\n+ Achievements are easy to obtain although some can be a bit time consuming.\n\n+ Plenty of mods\n\nThe Average\n\nThe game really requires a controller\n\nAfter completing levels, challenges become available allowing you to replay certain sections of the level with certain requirements i.e. finish the race before the npc does, collect a certain amount of rings etc. The problem is these are not very challenging and does very little to change up the gameplay in any meaningful way. These challenges feel repetitive, however they are also completely optional unless you want the achievement.\n\nThe game is very short and easy, if you stick to the main content of the game you are looking at about 4-6 hours of gameplay depending on skill level. Going for achievements will extend your gameplay time\n\nThe camera angles and controls for the modern levels can be a bit frustrating at times.\n\nAs you complete levels/defeat bosses and collect red coins throughout the levels, you unlock skills that can be purchased from a shop. You can then equip different skills that fit your playstyle. These skills are optional and didn't  have a  major impact on gameplay. You could just as easily complete the game with no skills as you could with some of the more useful ones. Certain skills are nice to have but didn't have a big impact on gameplay.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\n-The game crashed a lot especially when you play online.\n\n-The story is pretty terrible but can easily be skipped. Regardless, you are not playing this game for the story anyways.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is my first modern sonic game I've played and from what I've been told it is also the best. This game is really well made and a lot of fun if you are a fan of platformers. I really loved the diversity in the levels as well as the design. Going through the levels again but taking a different path really highlighted how well designed some of these levels are. I recommend this game if you are a fan of platformers.","May 21, 2015","true","17.6"," 25 of 25 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","25","25","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nblastmax/recommended/71340/","nblastmax","NBlast","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nblastmax/","245 products in account","How do you define a good Sonic game?\n\nThe series was struggling with the right answer for this question. The Sonic Generations attempt was one of the last possible calls for SEGA to do things right and... they succeeded! This game single handedly revived the franchise for me and gave me the kick to check out the old classics for the first time (I'm the Dreamcast Kid). This game is really this good!\n\nImagine that the famous band tries to set up "The Best of..." album. They take one best song from each previous album. Some of the releases of this band were horrible and you think: "Remaking this track is a bad idea! This was a dark age for this band!". You are relieved when you notice that the "that one" dreaded song sounds so new and fresh! Even more... you notice that every song has one version for the original vocalist and second for the new one that came into band recently. This is Sonic Generations in nutshell. They took a level from every single game in the main series and remade them to fit for both: the old and cute Classic Sonic with 2D gameplay and the Modern Sonic with the boost mechanic. Fear Sonic '06 no more! Crisis City in this game better than ever! And you can cure your PTSD from the Silver boss fight here! Don't like him? IT'S NO USE! He will suffer and you will be satisfied!\n\nI think that the good Sonic game is the one with the good controls and clever level design. While the controls of the Modern Sonic aren't still at the level of Sonic Adventure's one they are still acceptable. Classic Sonic rolls and hops nearly just like in the Genesis era, only with few inconsistencies.\n\nThe level design in this game is near GORGEOUS. They look extremely well and they are designed around the idea of the multiple paths in the single level. There is still one start point and one goal post, but there are many routes for the run through the stage. The exploration is highly rewarded by the Red Star Rings that are layed on the different pathway in the level. You may find yourself replaying the level multiple times to finally reach the highest, fastest and the most skillful pathway. Even when the Modern Sonic still has the Boost Button, the levels have more platforming this time around and it is not bad implemented. This level design single handedly makes up for the all replayability of the game - just look at my playtime.\n\nThe graphics are... oh my... they are outstanding. The Surreal Realism fits the series like a glove. There are pretty water effects, plants and locations and yet still the game have a incredible, cartoony artstyle. Unfortunely this game really needs a good computer to run smoothly, but if you have a nice power PC, the 60 FPS in this game and the art style will make you ♥♥♥♥ on the nice visually but weak artistically games like Crysis.\n\nSoundtrack of this game is a pack of music all well known to the fans of the series handled with the nice remixes. "Escape from the City"? "Live and Learn"? Crisis City Stage music? Chemical Plant? Awesome disco remix for the "Classic" Speed Highway? Do want!\n\nController is a must here... Sorry keyboard-exclusive guys. Story is kinda weak too. Don't buy this game for the SA2-like story. You won't find it here. The nods to the previous games are fun, but the writing and plot is nearly non-existent. The online mode is very buggy and may crash your game when you are attempting to unlock the achievement. Final boss fight is not well designed and Side-missions are hit or miss, but still, I was happily to finish this game on 100%. 4 times.\n\nThis is a extremely solid 3D platformer. This is one of the few Sonic games that I would easly recommend to the people who are not fond with the series yet. This is really a high note in the franchise and you are really missing out if you put a fold on it. It is definitely not perfect with various bugs, weak story and the short playthrough, but the replayability, level design and the presentation is top notch.\n\nSide note: kids REALLY like this game! Tested on several individuals during the babysitting. It may be too hard for the less skilled, but with supervising parent this will be a really good time!","December 19, 2013","true","116.1"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","29","32","0","1"

I literally almost cried a couple times, to see Green Hill Zone Act 1 recreated with Pixar graphics, it made me really think to myself, is this how I thought the game looked like when I was a kid? You know how when you're a kid and your imagination is much more apparent so 16-bit games look much better to a kid than say an adult. To revisit this level in this way was a dream.\n\nOne of my favorite things about this game is that you can change the music of each level/act. I replayed Green Hill Zone Act 1 with the original music and then the hit song "Sonic Boom" and it just gives the game a different feeling every time.\n\nThis is a love letter to Sonic fans around the world, a celebration of one of the most iconic and classic video game characters and companies ever to grace the industry. When you've finished this game, be sure to find and install a mod called Super Sonic Revolution. This makes the do that you can play as Super Sonic and yes, Hyper Sonic. It totally revamps the game so it's like you will be playing it for the first time.\n\nPros Play as classic Sonic (Sonic The Hedgehog series)\nPlay as new-gen Sonic (from Sonic Adventure and newer games)\nFan favorite levels are recreated and remastered looking better than ever\nRelive the most iconic boss fights in Sonic history\nTons of side-quests\nYons of collectables\nHard Mode\nMods\nCons  Only 2 playable characters\nNothing really new in terms of innovation and/or originality\nControls are stiff sometimes\nShort Storyline\nSide-quests re-use the same maps slightly changed to fit each objective\nFinal Thoughts:\nSonic Generations is a treat and a testament to any Sonic fan or anyone who played the old Sonic games since the early 90's and dared to keep up with the franchise despite the negativity from the mass of critics.\n\nRating (7.9 out of 10)\n\nThis review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.","March 15","true","9.3"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","9"

No native support for the PS4-controller and setting it up so it actually works has to be done with third party software as far as I know. I used the program TocaEdit X360 Controller Emulator.\nOn several occations the game didn't register jump presses which is a big thing in a game that is supposed to "go fast".

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/71340/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","213 products in account","Sonic the Hedgehog has not had the most celebrated of careers. While his early games are regarded as iconic and influential, an amazing run of mostly bad games in latter years reduced SEGA's mascot to little more than an irrelevant joke. At that point, there's only one thing to do -- release a "best of" compilation!\n\nSonic Generations takes a number of the very best stages from across Sonic's 20-year history, as well as a few of the not-so-good, and completely remakes them with new content. Furthermore, a second hedgehog is along for the ride, but it's not some horrible silver one from the future!\n\nWhat could go wrong with any of that?\n\nSonic Generations (PC [reviewed])\nDeveloper: Sonic Team\nPublisher: SEGA\nReleased: November 1, 2011\nMSRP: $49.99. Now $29.99\n\nSonic Generations teams Sonic the Hedgehog up with none other than Sonic the Hedgehog -- the long-legged Sonic of recent years comes face to face with his pot-bellied past self. When a grinning monster called the Time Eater starts ripping through reality, elements of Sonic's past become erased and the two hedgehogs cross paths. Naturally, it's up to our furry duo to save the day. By racing through famous Sonic stages at top speed, "Modern" and "Classic" Sonic are able to put time back on track and end the Time Eater's mysterious plans. It's not exactly the most sensible of stories, but it's certainly no worse than what we've seen in recent Sonic titles. Packing plenty of self-referential jokes and a glorious "twist" at the end, it's at least an entertaining little adventure.\n\nThere are nine main chapters, each based on well-known stages in Sonic history. From Green Hill Zone all the way to Planet Wisp, every console era has been represented quite nicely. Every chapter has a "Classic" and "Modern" variant, with Classic Sonic dashing across sidescrolling platform levels and Modern Sonic racing through 3D-oriented stages. To progress through the game, you'll need to play each stage with both Sonics, making for 18 stages in total.\n\nClassic Sonic is presented almost exactly as he was in his Genesis heyday. The spin dash is back as well as Sonic's inability to home in on enemies -- he'll need to manually bounce on their heads. His stages, slower-paced than the Modern levels, focus on intricate, old-school platforming. The only modern concession is the ability to automatically spin dash with the press of a button, something the purists may hate but that I find aids the flow of the game. If it's a big deal, one can easily spin dash the old-fashioned way by ducking and hammering the jump button.\n\nFor nostalgic fans, Classic Sonic is a pleasant return to form. However, there seems to be a problem with his jumping as many of the platforms are far-flung, making crossing wider gaps feel unnecessarily tricky. Either Sonic Team needed to make him able to jump further or these platforms should have been brought closer together. It's not like any of the jumps are completely impossible, but they can get exasperating if one doesn't nail a running leap absolutely perfectly.\n\nIt also doesn't help that the game has a habit of placing enemies just far enough across from gaps that Sonic will land on the ground and uncurl a split-second before he touches them, consequently taking damage. These instances feel like real cheap shots that, while not severely damaging to progress, grow increasingly annoying, especially in the latter stages where this issue becomes more rampant.\n\nIn truth, I have to admit that the Modern Sonic levels are actually more fun. While there are some truly enjoyable 2D stages, the contemporary variants are almost always more exhilarating thanks to their sheer intensity. Such highlights include an explosive new take on the Chemical Plant Zone and an utterly gorgeous Speed Highway level. All told, there are surprisingly few duds compared to the overwhelming majority of bad levels seen in most of the recent titles.\n\nThat isn't to say that duds aren't there, of course. Seaside Hill is a sloppy mess of awfully designed platforming and Planet Wisp is repetitive and slow. As for Crisis City? The fact that it was allegedly a highly demanded level only seems to prove just how demented the Sonic fanbase has become, since it's still the same sprawling mass of ill-placed chasms and confused homing targets that it always was. Still, I remain shocked by the fact that the ratio of good to bad stages is stacked in favor of the positive, marking a revolutionary step forward for Sonic's retail outings.\n\nAs well as the main stages, our two heroes will need to undertake "Rival" battles against some famous Sonic characters -- Metal Sonic, Shadow the Hedgehog, and Silver the Hedgehog. These are part-combat, part-racing engagements, with a designated Sonic running to avoid the enemy's attacks before hitting him when he's vulnerable. Each Rival challenge is surprisingly intense and represents some of the more gratifying moments in the game -- especially when giving Silver his well-deserved beatdown.\n\nEvery main stage also has a series of challenge courses to complete, and while most of them are optional, Sonic Team couldn't resist making the completion of at least a few of them compulsory. Fortunately, players will only ever need to complete one challenge from each stage in order to progress through the game, and they can choose whatever one they want using whichever Sonic they're most comfortable with.\n\nChallenges come in many flavors. Some of them are races against doppelgangers, others require a certain amount of rings to be collected, and others make use of Sonic's furry friends to complete obstacle courses. Although based on the main stages, many of these challenges are fully realized levels in their own right, some managing to be exceedingly inventive. There's even a stage where you can summon Tails and use him to fly around a 2D Chemical Plant, just like in the Genesis days!\n\nSkill Points are earned via successful completion of a stage or challenge, then they can be spent on minor enhancements to the hedgehogs. These include increased speed, improved ability to collect lost rings, and even power-ups based on classic Sonic abilities, such as the bubble shield seen in Sonic the Hedgehog 3. A wide variety of music can be unlocked and used in any stage -- you've not truly experienced the game until you've played a level with "Sonic Boom" blasting in the background!\n\nRounding out the package, there are four bosses, each positioned after three levels and pertinent to a certain "era" of the franchise -- Death Egg Robot for Genesis, Perfect Chaos for Dreamcast, and Egg Dragoon for this generation. They feature new twists on famous fights and can be pretty damn epic in scale, though sometimes vague on what you're actually supposed to do.\n\nAs a cohesive package, fans tired of bad Sonic games can't help but be impressed by what's on offer. The only consistent issue is that it can be hard to recalibrate one's brain when switching between Sonics, as the two distinct gameplay styles can become a little jarring. It's not uncommon to wonder why Classic Sonic isn't homing onto anything, or why Modern Sonic's jumps feel so unusual. After a few stages, the confusion abates, but instances of crossed wires may crop up now and then.\n\nSonic Generations isn't a very long game -- it can be beaten in around five hours or so. Still, there's significant replay value not just in the optional challenges but also in simply replaying the main chapters. Quite a few of the levels are so much fun that they're worth multiple revisits, and I've found myself spending up to an hour at a time just beating stuff I've already played. Finding hidden stars to unlock music and artwork and attempting to gain an "S" rank in each stage provide lots of extra incentive as well.\n\nNevertheless, it would have been nice to have had less optional challenges and more real chapters","May 16","true","1.9"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","1"

The game is composed entirely of levels and music from 1991's Sonic the Hedgehog, to 2010's Sonic Colors, all redone and beautifully recreated. It's both a 2D and 3D platformer, and that's the gimmick here. You can play as "Classic Sonic" in Act 1 who's play style is exactly like a traditional 2D Platformer, and as "Modern Sonic" who's levels are 3D. Modern also has the boosting feature from Sonic Rush, and the Homing Attack, whilst Classic can just utilize the Spin Dash.\n\nAs stated, all stages and music are completely re-done from the ground up to make up pretty interesting levels. But it's not just an HD makeover, every one of the levels have been edited to where it's different from the original game, while it still has those familiar bits here and there.\n\nThe soundtrack is also beautiful. Every piece (Save 2 or 3 exceptions) is remixed Sonic music from the past, fitting with the old stages you play. Actually, it's remixed twice. Classic has more retro sounding music, and Modern has, well, you can put two and two together.\n\nNow where the problems lie, there are a couple. This one is pretty obvious, but if you're not the biggest fan of Sonic, this game might be pretty average to you. Don't get me wrong, the game is still a spectacular platformer, but the entire purpose was to celebrate Sonic's 20th anniversary, therefore it was made for the fans. Another issue is the game is really easy compared to most Sonic games, and platformers in general, and it doesn't take much effort to get an S rank on every mission, so that could also be a problem.\n\nIn short, Generations is a wonderfully crafted Sonic game for the fans. If you love the hedgehog, definitely get this game, you won't regret it. If you're not a Sonic fan, it's still a good platformer for what it is, I think you'll still like it.","November 1, 2014","true","54.3"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","15","22","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/71340/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","I don’t consider myself a Sonic fan and I really don’t have any nostalgia for the series as a whole.  Most of my good memories come from Sonic and Knuckles, so it has been a long time since I played a Sonic game for any real length of time.   I discovered a nostalgia and love for Sonic through this game that I didn’t know existed. Its gameplay is simple but effective and its graphics and art charming.  No matter your level of respect or disdain for that little blue rodent this is a game worth exploring.\n\nThe story starts off as Sonic celebrates his twentieth birthday, with a monster known as the Time Eater crashing the party and dispersing Sonic's friends to various stages in history. Sonic is knocked out after futily taking on the monster. He wakes up in the White Space dimension and encounters Tails, as well as his plumper, black-pupiled younger self. The two Sonics have to free their friends in two different versions of levels that have emerged over the years, and eventually defeat the monster summoned by Dr. Eggman. Modern Sonic utilises the game mechanics used in 3D games like Heroes and Colours. His homing attack allows him to lock-on to an enemy when he jumps at them and can boost through levels for additional speed. Classic Sonic handles the traditional side-scrolling levels, sporting the ability to spin-dash. Levels run at a slower pace as they require some more caution, and he also can’t auto aim at enemies or jump as far.\n\nGenerations is something of a healthy montage of what comprised the first twenty years of Sonic games. The nine stages are all throwbacks from three console eras. Three zones from the heights of the ‘Classic Era’ have been lovingly reimagined, including the signature Green Hill. The ‘Dreamcast Era’ touches up Adventure’s Speed Highway and City Escape plus Sunside Beach from the later Heroes. The ‘Modern Era’ even revitalises Crisis City from the disastrous 2006 reboot, as well as Rooftop Run and Planet Wisp from Unleashed and Colours. Boss fights are dispersed between each era, but can only be unlocked upon completion of three side missions. These are usually comprised of another objective within a level, such as a ghost race or collecting items. Some are fun and others are less so, but aren’t a necessity to reach the end. Similarly to secret special stages in the originals, hidden stars encourage exploration of the multiple paths in each level. There are also the Red Rings hidden in the main stages to encourage players to explore every nook and cranny as both Sonics to find them. Ample rewards await players who take up all of these challenges in the form of new powers, which can be added to either Sonic's play mechanics to make old stages new again. These powers are hardly throwaway, but they're also hand-picked from Sonic's rich game history. Prepare to relive the fun of using the special elemental shields from Sonic 3, give Classic Sonic the Homing Attack, give Modern Sonic unlimited boost meter in exchange for one-hit death (one of my favorites), allow either Sonic to stop on a dime, or even endow the time-slowing skill from Secret Rings. There are dozens of these, and they're great for playing around in stages, exploration, or for finding the best combination for the fastest times.\n\nBottom line: If you are or have ever been a fan of Sonic the Hedgehog during the series' two-decade history, then this is your game. Sega made this for us. If you've been away from Sonic for a while or have been wondering what he's all about, then this is actually a great game to start with, as it features the two best-playing versions of Sonic in the series, along with his greatest stages, all in one place. Play it however you can, even if you rent it, but whatever you do, don't call it "short" or "over quickly." There's enough game here to last potentially ages.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=392348455\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","February 14, 2015","true","14.7"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","16","26","2","1"

When I got to the first boss, just sitting in the white space zone listening to the music, I instantley told myself that this was the Death Egg Robot from Sonic 2, when I finally got to the cutscene showing it was in fact the Death Egg Robot, nothing but chills in my body. Just thinking back to when I used to play Sonic 2 when I was little and when I finally beat the game, just seeing that boss be back again, with the music remade and everything, I had the biggest chills ever and I will admit that it brought a tear of enjoyment to me knowing that one of the hardest bosses I ever played against as a kid was back. I throughly enjoyed this game, the nostalgia from the levels, enemies, bosses and music remakes. The first 2 bosses, first 2 mini bosses and the first 6 levels were what really hit me with the nostalgia, playing through the levels I grew up on as a kid, fighting the bosses all over again, loved this whole game. Let me also say, the boss battle against Shadow, was amazing, I played the living hell out of Sonic Adventure 2 Battle on the GameCube and getting to play on City Escape and fighting Shadow in a slight change, really made me want to go back and play SA2B again. 3 years later when I have switched over to PC gaming, it was the same enjoyment for me again. I without a doubt, hands down recommend this game. Yes some of the bosses were easier than they were in their past games (Death Egg Robot, Perfect Chaos and Metal Sonic were the easiest for me) but still, basically going back and playing through the levels that were there when playing other Sonic games, was simply amazing for me. This game was very easily one of the best games I have played, there were times it was a little frustrating (only when going for achievements) but other than that, very enjoyable and will very easily go back and play it again in the near future.\n\n11/10 will play again\n\nSega, good job on the game!","March 22, 2014","true","237.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

And what kind of game is it?\n\nThe game allows you to play with 2 Sonics. One from the good old genesis days and one from the modern Sonic days. Sounds confusing? Well, time travel is always confusing so don't point at me. The two Sonics are on their way to save their friends, speeding through stages of the past and fix the timeline.\n\nThe gameplay is fun for everyone, either an old skool Sonic fan or a new one, or even someone who has never been part of this franchise. Like playing old platformers with speed added, classic Sonic is your friend! More of a 3d speed section fan, modern Sonic is the guy you want! You'll have to play with both of them to complete the game but don't worry, you'll enjoy it.\n\nThe music consists mainly of older Sonic themes being remixed. For example, when you go through a stage you will hear two versions, a classic version and a modern version of the original stage theme. And they are absolutely a joy to listen to.\n\nOther things also make a return or are brand new. There are mission gates which allows you to go through stages with an other goal than reach the finish, and there's a skill shop in which you can adjust Sonic's gameplay style to your own. Want more speed? Buy the blast off skill. Want more grip? The acceleration skill is something you want.\n\nThere are only two negative points that I have to mention with this game, which are the length and the story. The length of this game is only 4 hours long, not counting the missions and collecting red rings or achievements, so that's a bit of a let down. The story is pretty akward. There are barely any cutscenes, and making a story including time travel tends to fail easy if done wrong.\n\nI would advice this game to any fan, wether old skool, modern lover or not a fan of Sonic overall.","November 30, 2013","true","13.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

You enjoyed the game concept of the Unleashed Day Stages and Colours? You love everything about Sonic the Hedgehog?\n\nNo? Well you will love this game anyway.\n\nSonic Generations is hands-down the absolute greatest 3D Sonic game EVER. Yep, it beats SA(DX), SA2(BHD), and Sonic Colours! This game might just be even BETTER than Sonic 3 & Knuckles! You can play as the Classic Sonic of the early 90's, or you can play as the Modern Sonic of 2008 and onward. The level design is fantastic, the music is amazing, the graphics are mind-boggling...but you MAY need a good PC to run it well, or just lower the settings.\n\nIf you want more graphical power, buy a console version if you have a normal PC. I own both the PC version AND the PS3 version, so I have the best of both worlds. But, overall, the PC version wins if you have a great computer. 60FPS and amazing graphics, plus you have UNLIMITED modding power! I have already downloaded about 5-7 different major mods, such as the Unleashed Project, the Adabat Adventure Pack, and Sonic Generations: Episode Metal.\n\nBasically, even if you don't like Sonic, buy this game. It completely sums up the beauty of the Blue Blur, and creates an amazing experience. It goes for pretty cheap now, so if you say you can't afford it, then you have no soul.\n\nNot to mention you can play pretty much any level from Sonic Unleashed (and every now and then Sonic Colours) in this game, modded in, for FREE. Even the DLC levels! I mean, come on, don't bite the hand that feeds you!","December 6, 2013","true","51.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There's also plenty of collectathons, if you like that kind of thing.\n\nRecommended if you like fast-paced platformers!","May 29, 2014","true","9.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

After release in November, the fans went CRAZY for Generations, the game broght back so many memorial moments in the Sonic universe, from the classic Green Hill, to the "City-Boarding" of City Escape. The people loved this game, not just because it's a 20th Anniversery title, as a reminder why we play Sonic the Hedgehog, a reminder of all the fun times we had with him. The music is memorable and great, the levels, handpicked by us, are fun and great to play in, and the story? Oh, who cares about the stroy! The story's bland as heck!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maderschramm/recommended/71340/","maderschramm","Shotime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maderschramm/","1157 products in account","Sonic Generations is a hidden "gem" among the other pretty terrible Sonic games out there. After beating the game I found it to be fun, but lackluster, nothing that stood out as a reason to recommend it; however, once I figured out that there was a huge modding community out there for the game my outlook on the game changed and I felt I had to mention it, if only briefly.\n\nTeam Sonic has been doing some bad and some good in their games. The epitome of this mindset has to be Sonic Unleashed - there's a really cool part of the game where you go flying around through well designed levels at breakneck speeds collecting coints and almost getting dizzy from the camera movement while you race against time to reach the finish line. Those levels were amazing and fun. Then there were the "God of War"-esque levels coupled on there as well, which were slow, boring, and, sadly, mandatory. I bought that game on PS3 and hated it - not so much because the Were-Sonic sections were terrible (which they were) but because of the lost potential the game had. Well, Sonic Generations takes it in the right direction, utilizing those same awesome level types where you fly around at lightspeed but instead of a Were-Sonic you are granted an Oldschool-Sonic for Type B levels. This would be fine if that Sonic didn't handle like a 12-Ton dump truck. The physics seemed to work fine but the stopping and starting of the character were just awful, and I found myself using my trademark "spin" while accidentally moving so I'd be going at about 2 miles/hour while the time keeps ticking away and I keep getting more aggravated. Those levels weren't nearly as much fun as the other levels, and normally I wouldn't recommend half a game, but Sonic Generations on PC is unique in that the modding community allows you to turn the game into what you want to play. Want more of the good levels? Download the Sonic Generations Unleashed Project. Want to change the physics up to more of a "classic" Sonic feel? Go ahead, there's a mod for that too. The ability to swap in and out parts of the game that you don't like or want to experience more of really turns Sonic Generations into a hidden gem that can provide hours of fun for any level of Sonic fan.\n\nPros:\n\nMods (see above)\nFull Controller Support\nGreat Level Design (for the most part - Modern Sonic levels shine)\nGood Music\n\nCons:\n\nHandling/Controls (especially Classic Sonic)\nFixed Camera (makes some platforming awkward)\nUnnecessary RPG-esque Upgrade System\nLeaderboards are a fun idea, but it's rampant with cheaters - first hundred or so entries on all boards are 0 second runs\n\nAs I said, I wouldn't recommend the game without the modding community backing me up. That said, even if you're only going to play vanilla, the game isn't terrible, and the Modern Sonic sections shine and show the level design genius Team Sonic has. With mods Sonic Generations squaks by with a B+","April 3, 2013","true","12.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Sonic The Hedgehog at it's finest in this amazing blend of old and new. This is what modern Sonic The Hedgehog is supposed to be, Sonic Generations does everything it has set out to do beautifully and more than makes up for the disappointment that Sonic The Hedgehog (2006) turned out to be.\n\nIn this mixture of old and new, Sonic Generations brings back an iconic level from each of the most popular Sonic The Hedgehog titles (such as Green Hill, Chemical Plant, City Escape etc.) with an act for both the retro Sonic 2D scroller style that we all grew up with and the more modern 3D Sonic Adventure style, both of which have their own unique features making them similar and familiar, but different enough to keep them interesting and fresh. The game also includes a museum of sorts and a nifty skills/perks feature for both the old and new Sonic. Plenty of mini-games, unlockables, achievements and side-stages that accompany the main game structure bring lots of replay value to the Sonic Generations too, there is quite a lot to do.\nWith that being said, the only real problem with this game is that the story feels very short, it definitely could have benefited from some additional stages, but that doesn't make this any less of a great title.\n\nSonic Generations is the modern version of Sonic The Hedgehog[/b that we've been waiting for, this is what we wanted and sega delivered. if they remade all of the retro [b]Sonic The Hedgehog games in the style of the Act 1 Sonic Generations levels, it would be perfect.\nThis is a must have for Sonic The Hedgehog fans, and even one to grab if you're new to the franchise, this game brings the best features from all the eras of sonic games together to make one fantastic game.

This game offers a set of nine individual levels from three eras of the Sonic franchise, ranging from the Sega Genesis to Nintendo Wii.\n\nThe gameplay is a combination of Sonic Colors and Sonic The Hedgehog (Genesis Titles). Throughout Classic Sonic's stages, you'll be doing a lot of platforming in a 2D realm, whereas Modern Sonic you'll be doing a lot of boosting. The game offers two acts with every level- one for each Sonic.\n\nThe graphics are simply superb. Playing this on the consoles doesn't do it justice. The console version runs at 30 FPS where the PC port runs at 60 FPS. The attention to detail in the levels are stunning as well. Green Hill Zone looks fantastic, and City Escape is absolutely beautiful. You can really see where San Francisco was the inspiration for that level.\n\nHowever, before purchasing this title, do realize that this game can get be very heavy on your PC at times. While I never experienced problems, my friends reported having some slowdown during some areas such as Chemical Plant and Planet Whisp. Also, it's recommended that you use an Xbox 360 and/or PC controller for this game.\n\nThe game is worth the price, and it's a must have for any Sonic The Hedgehog fan. I suggest giving it a purchase and playing it now! If you're not sure, how about you click that "Download Demo" button up there at the top and give it a try. I gurantee you that it'll change your mind. ;)","December 1, 2013","true","87.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

Dr.Eggman is obviously also involved in the story.\n\nGameplayThe game is devided into two part: The Modern Sonic Gameplay and the Classic Sonic Gameplay.\nThe levels with Modern Sonic are 3D and 2D similar to Sonic Unleashed or Sonic Colors and also play similar to these games. Classic Sonics levels on the other hand are all in 2.5D and are much more similar to the classic Sonic games (Sonic the Hedgehog 1, 2 and 3&K) and not like Sonic 4.\n\nAfter you have beaten Act 1 & 2 of an era (each era consists or 3 Zones, there are 3 eras) you have to beat three challenge levels. There are alot of challenge levels to choose from and they are mostly rather easy so that shouldn't be a problem. Beating challenge levels can also unlock news skills that you can then use in Act 1 & 2 and you also unlock music from older Sonic games that you can then listen to or select as the music to play in a level.\nThen there also are the Rival Battles and the Boss Battles, there is one Rival and one Boss Battle in each era and each of the are similar how you originally fought the boss but they are different enough to feel completely new.There are also 5 Red Rings to collect (only in Act 1 & 2) that also unlock new music and skills.\n\nSoundtrackThe Soundtrack is as good as always and since this is an anniversary game it consists of a lot of (great) remixes.\nAnd like I already said, you can unlock new,old music that can be used in levels and challenges.Summarized, the soundtrack is great.\n\nPC PortThe PC port is functional. It does everything it has to. I haven't had that much problems with it. Sad thing is that the Online Mode doesn't really work in the PC Version and you can't play Sonic the Hedgehog 1 like you could on consoles (but we can buy the pre-order DLC, which they can't :P )\nAlso,each time you change your PC set-up (like for example the monitor) you have to go the the files,delete all .cfg files, then re-start the Conig Tool and then you can play the game.This is rather annoying but when you don't change your set-up this shouldn't affect you.\nThe game only shows you the Xbox 360 controller icons but you can change the key-bindings so that shouldn't be a big problem, controller is still recommented.\n\n\n\nSo yes, I recommend this game but not for 30€\nAlso,this game has some great mods which you can have fun with like for example play the Act 1 level of Sonic Unleashed or change the character model to Shadow.\nI made a list for that here:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=159333239","May 15, 2015","true","136.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

After a few piles of ♥♥♥♥ they decided to label games (most notabley Sonic the Hedgehog for the Xbox 360) the franchise looked like it was on its last legs. But out of nowhere games like this came out and honestly it blows my mind how much a company does care about the quality of their products, particularly their flagship franchise (unlike Activision and COD). The music is really good, the controls (playing with a gamepad) are pretty solid, the story didn't make me want to kill myself (again I'm looking at you Sonic the Hedgehog for the Xbox 360), and for the most part the game runs flawless.\n\nI have encountered a memory leak issue which I easily fixed by launching the game directly from the steamapps folder, and also a noticable fps drop on certain parts of Chemical Plant but in all honesty those things are so small and forgivable because of how good this game is.\n\nSEGA, please keep up the quality. I don't care if the game has to be delayed a couple more years because of it, I am willing to wait if the end product is anywhere near as good as this.","December 29, 2013","true","89.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

To elaborate but keep it short, I'll boil it down to the basics. This game is the best possible outcome from a decision to re-tread the adventures of the blue blur over the last ~20 years. Several levels are reborn here from the various titles in Sonic's past. So here's a short synopsis:\n\nVisuals:\nThis is a nicely polished Sonic game. The colors a vibrant, the graphics are worth of any HD release of its generation, and everything in Sonic's world is rendered with loving care to the source material. Every level looks loving remade in this game.\n\nSound:\nEverything in this game is well executed in the main game. While There's a slight lack of voice acting with some characters, the game easily makes up for it with a mixture of excellent tracks, building new arrangements, so that each level in the game has a Classic and Modern Sonic variation of the original track of the game it came from. Along with the classic sonic sound-effects, this game is a joy to listen to for any long time Sonic Fan.\n\nGame-play:\nStarting it up, the menu and title screen is very simple. The main navigation through levels is done with whichever incarnation of Sonic (Classis side scrolling or Modern 3D plat forming) you have at the time. while there, you play through 2 acts (one for each sonic play style), either plat forming through a 2.5D environment like Sonics 1-3, or on a plat forming speed rollercoaster, Sonic Adventure style. After a few of these, you unlock a sub-boss (Metal Sonic, Shadow, Silver), then a main boss (Various Robotnic Mechs). This continues for 3 sets of levels and bosses, until you reach the final boss. All of these wonderfully put together in what just reeks of love and effort. Sonic controls a little floaty in his classic incarnation, but I quickly got acclaimed to it, while modern sonic is embed with a boost ability, easily facilitating the needed momentum to blast through the, again, speed rollercoaster segments.\n\nStory:\nThis is the part where I say there's nothing to talk about here and then move on to the conclusion. I'll elaborate though. This game isn't much for story to go off. To not spoil anything other than the premise, Modern Sonic is sucked into a time warp by Doctor Rootnik (Eggman) who harnessed a creature called a Time Eater, to try and defeat Sonic, by correcting his past blunders. So now it up to our hero to free these time periods, maintain the time stream and reuse his friends, while defeating past enemies and Eggman in the process.\n\nIn conclusion, sets out to pay homage to Sonic games of the past. While not all of the material they're drawing from aren't exactly outings we'd like to revisit (Sonic the Hedgehog [2006]) but they manage to do what few sonic games have been able to put together, and that's a fun platformer, that is a loving re-treading of a franchise that has had better days. The stages are solid, the music is amazing, and sonic looks fantastic. While this game isn't for everyone, i would recommend it to any long time fans of Sonic, or anyone who wants to get into Sonic, but wants something more recent to reinforce their faith in this time-weathered hedgehog.","June 26, 2014","true","7.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","4"

You'll need a gamepad to actually enjoy it, so make sure you have one before you get it(or alternatively get the Hits collection and play some other sonic games while you're waiting). The game is also rather short with just 9 stages with 2 acts and 10 missions each. Some of the bosses, especially the final boss, are disappointingly easy and/or frustrating Now that we have everything negative out of the way...\n\nThe gameplay is solid 2d/3d Sonic action which lets you switch between modern and classic Sonic. The stages are all rather open which adds a ton to the replay value, and each level is unique and has something special. All the stages are taken from previous games, but add something new to the originals. The graphics are beautiful and the music is excellent as always. The story is just there to link the game together.\n\nThe game also has great mod support and is a good PC port, with the exception of the previously mentioned ♥♥♥♥ controls. Overall, a good experience that I'd say is overpriced. Get the Hits Collection, seriously.","April 6, 2014","true","40.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I have to say that if you are a Sonic fan, this is a must buy. I would say it's much better than Unleashed and a nice improvement over Colors. In this game, Sonic still has the boost feature from Unleashed and Colors as well as quick step, grind rail switching, and even some color powers from Colors. But the main feature of this Sonic game is that you have two Sonics now. The modern Sonic with all the tricks he's had from Adventure, Unleashed, etc. And the classic Sonic we've all known since the original trilogy. Story wise, it's ok. It's nothing too special. It does have a twist which I won't spoil, but this story pretty much only exists as an excuse to let us use classic Sonic in a newer game which is fine. Sonic's friends like Amy, Tails, Cream, Knuckles, etc are all there. But there only purpose is to be side characters. This is only about Sonic, but you can play as other characters with mods if you want. Moving on, this Sonic game is an anniversary type of game and it includes remastered versions of classic stages like the very first Green Hill, Sky Sanctuary, and others like Speed Highway. And you can fight past game bosses like Death Egg and Metal Sonic in HD and 3D for the first time! There's some others which I won't spoil, but just know that there aren't too many bosses. So you might end up disappoined if you were expecting a ton of bosses from the classic games or something. There's also missions for you to do after you beat the normal stages. But they're mostly optional so you can move on if you're not interested in all of them. I have to say that even if you have never played a Sonic game before that you should still give it a try. It's good, however, it isn't flawless. The game is pretty short and if you've played previous games like Unleashed and already know how to play, it's gonna take you a few hours at most to beat it. I beat it on my first playthrough. The upside though is that there's PLENTY of extra mods for you to play. The amount of hours I've put in are mainly due to mods like the Project Unleashed mod. Which is pretty much all of Sonic Unleashed's first day stages but with Generation's play style which is excellent. And there's even a mod for Sonic Colors' Tropical Resort stages which is also nice. Overall, I totally recommend it and I'd say that after beating the main game you should definitely add a lot of mods. But, if you don't plan on modding, just pick this game up on sale. 9/10","January 18","true","152.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I find it odd that this style of game isn't treated as the new standard for Sonic games instead more of a "one off" title. The mix of older and newer style Sonic gameplay (Act 1 & Act 2) works wonderfully. The achievements in this game are fairly balanced. There are a lot of cumulative achievements to work toward and even a few hidden achievements to uncover (or look up).\n\nPitfalls\nWhen you think "Sonic" speed tends to come to mind pretty quickly. I often found that the speed aspect of this game feels much less important than precision and taking higher routes. I sometimes observed minor control issues in the Act 2 sections using a wireless Xbox360 controller. Although the control issues were slightly annoying they didn't seem like a consistent issue. With a little persistence they just presented a minor annoyance to the task(s) at hand.\nI mentioned achievements earlier, currently the "Time Attacker" achievement is still a bit buggy and doesn't show your times on the top layer of the "ranking attack" mode. You can just make sure you do each one to completion. If you forget if you've finished one or not, ranked attack > leaderboards > friends will show your username with a time if you've completed that level.\n\nSpoilerific Short\nThe final boss is a bit of a wash. There's an achievement related to not getting hit during the final boss fight that is decently hard. There's supposed to be a need to switch between the two the 3D and 2D planes during this fight. You can just stay in the 3D plane (just to the left\right of the middle of the screen) to farm rings and when the boss switches to the 2D plane ignore everything but the homing missiles (they somehow bridge the dimensions).\n\nI really enjoyed this game.\n85\100","November 1, 2015","true","38.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So, yeah... After beating the act 1, I figured out that I should do it again, but now in 3d. And so I did and still nothig, so... I beat the game and finished most of the challanges in 2d and 3d, looking for the mistical Sonic 1 all around and couldn't find it anywhere. So, after spending several hours in my noble quest to be able to play Sonic 1 in PC without some sort of simulator, I gave up on my own logic and I went to consult with the oracle (Google), looking for clues of how to get to this point of the game where you'll be able to play Sonic 1... To find out, that you actually can't. Not on PC version, at least. So, yeah... That was pretty dissapointing.\n\nAnd the game itself is allright, though there are just like... 9 levels and 3 bosses. 18 levels, if you take in count the 3d version of those and 4 bosses, if you count the final one. So, after you beat those, welcome to the challenges and stuff. But it's enjoyable to replay some of the levels, so it's allright. Not a big fan of 3d Sonic, though.\n\n7/10.","April 4","true","32.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sweatbandz/recommended/71340/","Sweatbandz","A_Sweatband","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sweatbandz/","254 products in account","Sonic Generations is the best way to acknowledge good Sonic games that doesn't involve playing the older good Sonic games. The PC version of Sonic Generations is a very solid port, with high framerate support, modding support and decent fast visuals. However, running mods such as the Unleashed Project require a decent modern CPU due to the relatively poor CPU porting. This also means that people with slower or less powerful processors may have some problems running busier levels, due to the games poor handling of multiple CPU threads. I did not encounter any framerate problems, but there is always going to be users who do encounter these issues, and my warning is simply ensure that you have a decent CPU. The gameplay itself blends the best of older Sonic, with modern stages built around the best ideas of Unleashed and Colours.\n\nI've only played it with a controller, so I can't judge the PC controls. I can point out that there is sometimes some delay between the pressing of the button, and Sonic actually doing it sometimes. Besides these occasional problems, the game controls very solidly and I have no actual complaints involving the controls beside this small problem. Sonic also has some problems with precise movements in some levels due to speed and sometimes eratic camera movements. The game also sadly lacks in the number of main courses, which is a shame because everything that they've put in, both modern and classic are brilliant. Game length is instead lengthened by short challenges that are required for progression, or unlock bonus tracks on the soundtrack for use in the game levels. Sadly, these challenges aren't really that interesting to play compared to the actual main games levels, and even with this, the game comes out on the short side.\n\nVisuals and port wise, graphical options are limited, but with mod support and game support for high resolution textures and shadows, the port works well most of the time. For the speed that Sonic moves at, the visuals are acceptable (and improvable with mods), and run at 60 FPS, something not available on the console versions.\n\nSound-wise, the game for the most part shines. It features many tracks from older Sonic games, most of them are remixed and sound really good. Voice acting is a bit strange, minor characters such as those from Sonic Heroes, or ones like Shadow sound really stupid, but the main characters are voiced fine. There are some issues with audio sychronisation that I've encountered and have been unable to ever replicate, such as out of sync audio or no sound in the cutscenes at all, then again, the only thing you miss in this case is cheesy writing. No gameplay affecting issues though in terms of sound. The soundtrack, although consisting mostly of remixes, is still a great soundtrack, probably being one of my favourites for the series.\n\nOverall, its a good Sonic game in an age of disappointing Sonic games, probably my favourite in the series. It ends up being a bit too short, which is sad because awful Sonic games like Sonic 06 are many times longer than this for the average player. Despite that, I'd say it is worth getting, unless you really hate Sonic. This game does almost everything right, fast colourful visuals, a story that doesn't get in the way of the game and a good varied soundtrack.\n\nAnd then there's mods, which help almost every game they exist for.","February 8, 2015","true","16.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Levyne/recommended/71340/","Levyne","Levyne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Levyne/","141 products in account","This is probably my favorite Sonic game of the last 15 years. It's not something I plan to go back to and doesn't get visited near annually like 3&Knuckles, but I still enjoyed it a lot. It improved on the few things I liked about Unleashed and Colors and the added PC benefits of a rock solid framerate and higher resolution makes it more of a spectacle to play.\n\nI don't have the metrics or straight comparisons to validate this, but Generations felt a bit slower to me compared to Unleashed in the 3D sections. Either that or the zones were designed with Sonic's movement in mind more. While Unleashed felt like a game that rewards rote memorization and simply has too much "speed" for the sake of speed, Generations felt like a game that rewarded good reaction time and doesn't punish as harshly. It seems like windows for finding the alternate paths, ducking the obstacle, etc, are more lax. This sounds like the game was simplified a bit, and that's maybe true; however it just felt more balanced, and more fun to fail and more rewarding to succeed (and more likely without commiting the map to memory.)\n\n2D gameplay is great. And while I feel it is also slowed down a bit, it manages to hold my interest compared to other platformers which haven't. Wisp powers change things up without being too abundant.\n\nThe story and dialogue and everything outside of gameplay is garbage. Or, extremely silly and simple. Which I suppose is a direction I don't mind compared to melodrama or whatever you want to call what was vomited out of the mid-2000s games. If you've played Colors it's mostly more of the same here.\n\nThe various challenges are hit or miss. Many require playing the game in an extremely unituitive manner with questionable gameplay, Espio challenges are especially bad. However, the time-trial esqe challenges were extremely fun to undertake. The act 2 Planet Wisp challenge offered a great deal of enjoyable frustration as it required me to really learn the stage in order to succeed.\n\nBasically, I feel Generations is a platformer worth playing, even if it still has the stink of modern-day Sonic on and in it. Hearing both original and remixed tracks of various sonic themes is quite the trip down memory lane, even if the songs get a little less familiar once you get past the Genesis era games.","December 30, 2013","true","32.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Sonic Generations is an extremely fast-paced platformer that definitely pleases fans that had awaited for this release. Both modern Sonic and classic, original Sonic team up in hopes to save the world from an evil shadow-thing. At least that's what I have gathered so far.\n\nGameplay mechanics change throughout the game frequently between Acts. In the first Act of any stage you play as classic, mute Sonic along with the classic gameplay seen in the original. In Act 2 stages you play as modern Sonic.\n\nMuch can be said about this game so I'll sum it up: This has to be the best Sonic game I've played ever alongside Sonic and All Stars Racing: Transformed. I'm not far yet in Sonic Generations however. After I had seen the epic trailer for the game I knew I would have to pick it up.

In this wonderful game you play as both Classic Sonic and Modern Sonic, racing through stages from the blue hedgehog's past thanks to time travel, yeah the plot isn't really that great or isn't suspensful in anyway possible it's just an excuse to have 2 Sonic's on screen and give SEGA, the chance to revisted old worlds such as Green Hill Zone, Chemical Plant including some of the modern stages that have been completely remade, some for the better i'm looking at you Crisis City.\n\nThere is a lot of music in the game and it's fantastic the stage music is great both different for Modern and Classic Sonic, they also included various theme songs from different games and give you the choice to choose which song you want playing on a stage, once you've unlocked the tracks via getting red rings which I highly recommend you collect there is a lot of extra unlockables, though it's a shame you can't play as other characters but that can be done with mods on the PC version this game has a very active modding community so it's worth purchasing on PC and if your a really big fan of Sonic the Hedgehog, if you are then you'll get a kick out of this!.","January 14, 2014","true","75.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

How fun! Chilli dogs, drinks, and music galore! Everything starts out just dandy as our favorite hedgehog reflects on his past triumphs in the good old days. You can't help but gush over how much fun is in the air. You were there! You remember how great things were back in the day!\n\nAs Sonic goes on, you note several inconsistencies in his retellings of what went on in the 2000s. He's a little buzzed. You were there, and you know those things didn't happen as cool as he's making it seem but he tells it so well that you can't help but be entertained! Eventually you notice our hero's speech get slurrier and harder to understand by the time he's talking about the latter half of the decade, and then all hell breaks loose. Sonic's become heavily inebriated and is thrashing about violently, screaming "SPIKE! ROCKEEEET!" at the top of his lungs.\n\nYou're trying your best to placate him, but he won't let up, and his friends are about as helpless as you are at stopping him. Sonic suddenly stops what he's doing and takes a seat, beckoning you all towards him. He begins to talk about the time he and his past self faced off against Dr. Robotnik and HIS past self while they were piloting some weird time monster. Chills run down your spine as he describes horrors of which you'd never wish upon even the most obnoxious of talking animals.\n\nAfter an eerie silence sets in, Sonic erupts from his seat in a drunken stupor and defecates on the floor. He turns to look at you with his tearful, bloodshot eyes and yells "they said my future was gonna be great!" before jumping out of the window and sprinting off into the wilderness, shrieking. After witnessing this horror, you can't help but to mutter to yourself that he wasn't always like this, and that one day, one day he'll be having great adventures once again just like the good old days. Like the good old days...\n\n\n\nIn the meantime hey this game is wonderful fun until you get to the Colors stages and final boss which are total crap 8/10 would spindash again make sure you get the good mods for it too","November 25, 2015","true","12.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","5","8","3","0"

I can simply summarize this game as a vision of nostalgia reflecting on where Sonic came from and how far Sonic has come.\n\nWhat I think is awesome is the ability to play through stages that are reminiscent of the games of yester-year as Modern Sonic, yet being able to play through the games of today as Classic Sonic.  Really nice experience.   However, the final battle is truly lacking....\n\nDownsides?  I've experienced slowdown during cutscenes which ruins the voice synchronization of Sonic and Tails.  There are also some moments during the game where the controls will be unresponsive during a few critical moments.  Pits Ahoy!!!!\n\n\nThis made me remember how good Sonic used to be.

I thought they were amazing, but I never really played the old ones so I wasn't that much of a Sonic fan. Just recently I got this and played this, and HOLY ♥♥♥♥.\n\nI thought this was more than anything Just a lot of fan service disguised of a game. And yes, maybe it is, but I have to say this game is AMAZING. I didn't even play the classic Sonic games, so I can't really say the nostalgia applies to me. Even so, the 2D levels, which I was kinda afraid of at first, are extremely fun and work wonderfully with the playstyle. They blend with some 3D sections, which are also great. Controlling Sonic in those feels tighter than in any other Sonic game I played.\n\nGameplay aside, the presentation in this game is mind blowing, both music wise and visually. The visuals are stunning, everything is moving, changing; it feels great. The music is also really good. The song of City Escape is still on my mind.\n\nAnd, for the story, well, don't expect one. Is really simple. Is mostly an excuse for remastering levels and having the two Sonics. But it works wonders, so hey, this is not a problem in my book.\n\nAnother bad thing I could say, is that the game is short. I played only 3 hours (didn't finish it yet), and you can blaze through the stages. However there are a lot of side missions and stuff to do. Also, I heard that there are mods. So I'm not really worried for that.\n\n\nAnyway, in conclusion, this game is Just great. There's a lot of Sonic games I didn't play, but I think it'll be hard to top this one.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RetroChaos/recommended/71340/","RetroChaos","Bob Ross","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RetroChaos/","122 products in account","So my first proper review, and what way to start it off with one of the best Sonic games ever, even if it is simply a load of past stages recreated.\nThe cutscenes are greatly improved from the Xbox 360 version, no longer looking pixilated, well for me anyway. It also runs at a very nice and plesent 60 FPS, making Sonic and his vibrant surroundings look georgous no matter what. The game as a whole looks fantasic as it is, from the cheerful rolling hills of Green Hill Zone, to the gritty and action-packed Crysis City.\nThe stages are so much fun. Each course is littered with secrets and alternate routes that I am still discovering every time I go back to shave precious milliseconds off your high scores. They really are a blast to play and feel unique from one another but not too gimmicky, which Sonic games have felt like in the past. As well as stages we each fight a classic boss at the end of the Era, either being the final boss of a previous game or a rival character (wait, how is Silver here?). The rivals are cool and interesting ideas, and well executed, along with the other bosses. I would have to say my favourite rival is Shadow, it feels just so... right, and it's an amazing update to fight in Sonic Adventure 2. I also love the Death Egg Robo as one of the bosses, all it's phases are just awesome and mix up the battle.\nBut obviously, the highlight of this game is the music, as expected. I love every single one of the remixes (errr... minus Planet Wisp and another Open Your Heart remix, they got butchered) and is my favourite soundtrack next to Sonic 3 & Knuckles and Sonic Adventure 2. From the incredible violins in Rooftop Run to the tears of manliness I cry when I hear City Escape for the 7 billionth time.  Just take some time to listen to it, you'll love it.\nHowever, having said that, there are some minor complaints. The game as a whole is a bit short, it'll take you roughly 2-3 hours to complete and even less if your a veteran of the series. The Red Rings add a little more time to 7-9 hours and are a nice reward and incentive for you to discover and explore the stages and it's many routes. Also, the game is very easy. For me anyway, I got most S-Ranks first time. I also find myself going back to Modern Sonic more than Classic Sonic, despite so many people yarning for his return.\nOverall, this game is amazing, for what there is of it. It may be short, and easy, but if your just looking for some high-speed-nostalgia-trippin'-rocking-beats-blue-burred blast, this is the game for you. A great way to celebrate Sonic's 20th anniversary and a perfect example that the hedgehog is still on top.\n9/10","December 3, 2013","true","14.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Very rarely has a game met my expectations as well as this game has. The gameplay is basically right out of Sonic Colors and the day time levels of Unleashed, so basically, the best 3D gameplay the franchise has had, with the sidescrolling gameplay being excellent as well. Wrap that up with two versions of one fan favorite level from nine Sonic games, as well as two new versions of each stages song, and I'm a happy camper. The levels retain all the energy and life they started with, with their own new additional twists, and the remixed songs are great. Even better is that cool little surprises where things outside of the original stages being redone will be referenced, such as the Sonic Adventure 1 hotel making an appearance in that game's given stage. This is a must buy for Sonic fans, and I'd even suggest it for people that are just curious about the franchise.","December 10, 2014","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sadly they were incredibly frustrating, incredibly buggy or just plain painful to play, Sonic generations is the first attempt to fix this.\n\nThe game can be broken up into Act1 (Classic Sonic), Act2 (Modern Sonic), Boss battles (each boss fight has a particular Sonic mandatory) and finally challenges for each Sonic. Let's go over each of them:\n\nClassic Sonic (Act1 of each stage): Classic Sonic is the sonic of our past with a bit of a modern twist on it. The levels are straight forward, simple to play and good fun. If you have played any Sonic game from the 90's then you will have no worries here. The only thing that will grab you is the occasional 3D feel it gives off.\n\nModern Sonic (Act2 of each stage): Modern Sonic is the character most associated with the bad Sonic games in a 3D world. Sonic generations gives modern Sonic high speed levels to play in at the start and it's a lot of fun seeing how fast you can clear a level. The later stages though are annoying and painful to say the least, it's at this point I started wished I could play the full game with just classic Sonic.\n\nBoss fights: The bosses are a really strong point to this game, they are fun to play, the tactics aren't too hard and both Sonics feel really good to play as.\n\nChallenges: Here is where the game really free falls to a large extent. At the beginning the challenges are really fun to play be it trying to out race a doppelganger or just use your skate/snow board to finish a level is great fun. Once those are done though it feels like the developers ran out of ideas and just made stuff up, the later challenges have you trying to collect rings in a fixed time (2 things I hate, collection duty with a time trial). Another one is hitting the level end sign to the end of the level or depending on side characters to help you, these are annoying and frustrating to say the least.\n\nIf you are a Sonic fan you should give it a go, for everyone else wait for 50% or more off.\n","December 29, 2014","true","15.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrmMchn/recommended/71340/","DrmMchn","Aesthetic Kool Aid Man","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrmMchn/","49 products in account","After some flops in the Sonic franchise (Sonic '06, Secret Rings, etc.), this game gets the series back on it's feet, and then it does a backflip and wins the World Cup. In other words, it's really great.\n\nStory: Sonic from the past and present, along with their friends, get sucked into a limbo of sorts. After playing through a few areas, the two meet up. Then they decide they need to help save his friends and return the locations back to the real world- erm, the games real world, the sonic world, Mobius. It's a really good plot. it engrosses the player, it does take a bit to start up however. It's still, nontheless, a great storyline. [Score: 8.5/10]\n\nPresentation: The graphics for this game are amazing. I originally bought it for the PS3, then recently bought it on Steam as part of a Collection of Sonic games. The PC graphics are undoubtedly better, although you can't hate the PS3's graphics on this game either. The game looks great. [Score 10/10]\n\nGameplay: There are 2 Styles of gameplay, Classic Sonic, and Modern Sonic. Classic Sonic goes back to the roots of the series. Sidescrolling bliss. Modern Sonic goes with the style of playthrough from daytime Unleashed and all of Colors (save for the double jump). Not too much to say about it. Tight controls, high-speed gameplay, it's all really great. [Score 10/10]\n\nLevel Design: This game was released for Sonic's 20th Anniversary. This is probably why it remixes old stages from other games. The only new stage is the final boss. However, this isn't a bad thing, far from it! This is one of the many reasons this game was so successful. There are 5 stage types, Regular Stage Act 1, Regular Stage Act 2, Mini-Bosses, Bosses, and the final boss. The Regular Stages are for Classic, and Modern, respectively. The Minibosses are unlocked halfway through 3 of the 4 areas of the main hub. They are just reimaginings of older versions of bosses from older games. We have Metal Sonic from Sonic CD, Shadow from Sonic Adventure 2, and Silver from Sonic '06 (but acctually playable). The Boss fights, with the exception of the last one, are throwbacks to other final (or close to final) bosses from other games. These include: Death Egg Robot from Sonic 2, Perfect Chaos from Sonic Adventure, and Egg Dragoon from Sonic Unleashed. Each fight is really solid. The Final boss is Time Eater, in which Modern and Classic sonic both go super and you take them out in a way similar to The True Final Boss in Sonic 3 & Knuckles' The Doomsday Zone. My only real gripe is that Time Eater is a little bit unforgiving, it took me a few tries to beat it. That or I just suck. [Score 9.5/10]\n\nMusic: Along with the stages, the music is remixed from their respected stages (again, with the exception of the final boss), they are all really good. Some of my favorites include Death Egg Robot, Chemical Plant Zone Act 1, Metal Sonic, and my personal favorite, Time Eater. [Score 10/10 (although I wish it could be higher)]\n\nTotal Score: 48/50\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this, and Good Night.","July 14, 2014","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It seems Sega can still produce a Sonic game these days that I'd actually come back to several times and have fun. Though harldy perfect, the usual game ruining bugs are largely absent and controlling Sonic and Classic Sonic is surprisingly easy. Occasionally you seem to fall out of the world due to some bizzare glitch in the matixs sending you careening left off a upwards vertical path plus the odd falling through the earth glitch as well. Despite obvious flaws, it's well polished, fun and a great buy for anyone looking to feel a bit nostaligic.\n\nSonic Generations offers two modes, Modern and Classic where you control the respective hendgehog. Modern Sonic is a blend of super sonic running sections a-la Sonic Adventure and 2D platforming sections based off of the last few titles. Classic Sonic however goes back the series roots on the Genesis and focuses striclty on 2D momentum based platforming.\n\nMissions, a Pinball minigame and hidden red rings offer a good amount of replayablity. Sadly no Chao Garden.","November 27, 2013","true","24.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was a big Sonic fan as a kid, so this game has a huge nostalgia value for me. The 2D Sonic levels feel great, the 3D levels are usually pretty good, and hearing a lot of the classic music from the games being remixed is fantastic.\n\nBut I was a little disappointed in this game, too. I wasn't expecting to finish the game in 6 hours. That feels REALLY short to me, particularly since the game's currently selling for $30 at full price. (I, luckily, got it on sale.) There are a lot of optional challenges which I mostly haven't done, but I didn't feel like the gameplay was compelling enough to make me want to.\n\nAnd in the 3D levels I stumbled across some of the flaws that have plagued the series since the switch to 3D--glitches (one time I fell through the floor and died), a wonky camera (which is REALLY frustrating when you go fast) and occasionally frustrating controls (a lot of times I didn't home in on an enemy with my homing attack when I thought for sure that it should've worked--I'm not sure if it was a glitch or if I was just unclear on how it should work but either way, it was frustrating).\n\nI ended up feeling pretty luckwarm on this game, which was really disappointing considering all the praise I've been hearing about it. It DID tickle my nostalgia so I'm giving it a rec for that--the game sets out what it wants to do, pay homage to the Sonic series. If you're a fan and that's what you're wanting, pick it up. Otherwise I find this hard to recommend--there's a lot of better platformers out there on Steam nowadays. At the very least, I'd wait for this game to go on sale rather than paying full-price.","February 15, 2014","true","8.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's so much fun to just play through these levels; hearing the amazing soundtrack and some of the best level design I've seen in a Sonic game for around ten years. Tied in with the fact that you can play as two Sonics! So if you don't like the modern gameplay, you can play as classic and visa versa. Another thing about this game is the amazing modding community for it. Most of my gametime in Generations is from playing mods alone. These mods can range from character mods to porting older levels from other Sonic games. Anyway, to make it short, buy this game if you still haven't. It's my favorite Sonic game along with Sonic Adventure. If you're still even somewhat of a Sonic fan, get it.","February 18, 2014","true","213.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It seamlessly blends classic platforming for the old school gamers with the high speed action of the modern games. If you're new to the classic or modern gaming styles or new to Sonic altogether, buy this game immediately (Along with the Sonic bundle so you can test your new skills)!\n\nOn the other hand, this game does not include all the levels from all the Sonic games. It simply looks over Sonic's biggest games and says "Look how far we've come." So, for all of those who expect all of their favourite games to be re-designed and re-imagined, you should probably lower your expectations...but not too much.\n\nNevertheless, Sonic Generations is a superb game that anyone interested in Sonic should play.","February 21, 2014","true","45.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Voice acting is well done, Graphics are beautiful for the time, story is decent. It really shows what's possible with 3D Sonic games. The modern stages are wonderful and feel all around excellent to play, and are built well around how modern Sonic controls. Classic Sonic stages are...well classic! They give a good vibe and a bit of nostalgia to those, like myself, who've played the original Sonic games, Even the levels that were exclusive to modern Sonic felt right. This game however, is really short. Like, beat it in under 3 hours kinda short. I've beaten this on xbox, ps3 and PC and never felt happy with the length. Luckily, PC has mods. Some are still WIP, but level mods, character mods, and some goofy mods keep this game alive and well. Seriously, grab this game.

You get a good mix of Sonic the Hedgehog's best levels from past games, playing in the perspective of both 2D Genesis Sonic, and 3D Dreamcast and Modern Sonic. Although the game is very short, there is still a lot of replay value. There are multiple mini games for each level, collectables, and of course, replaying levels to beat your best time and score. Another great aspect of this game is the mod community. Suprisingly enough, this game has built a fairly decent mod community.

But I might as well convince you to buy the game anyway.\nSonic Genrations takes Sonic and Co. on an adventure through Sonic's past. Classic stages such as Sonic 1's Green Hill Zone and Sonic Adventure 2's City Escape re-imagined for both modern Sonic, and classic Sonic. Modern Soinc plays the same as he does in the Unleashed Daytime Stages, and in Sonic Colours, sans wisps. (There is actually a mod called the Unleashed Project that brings stages from Unleashed onto PC). Classic Sonic plays like he does in Sonic 2, 3, and Sonic & Knuckles.\nBoth Sonics control very well. Controls can be a little sensitive at times but it's not a major problem.\nThe story is good, not great. But Sonic isnt as story-centrc as other games, so it's no big deal. A monster called the Time eater rips apart space and tme and Sonic saves the day with his past self.\nThe game has a surprisingly large modding community. There's  stage mods (The Unleashed Project, the STH2006 Project), and mods to replace sonic with Metal Sonic, Shadow, Silver, Blaze.... The list goes on and on.\nThere however a few problems I've had with the game, mainly being fps drops down as far as 10-15 at some times, however that may just be my hardware. (Intel HD 4000)\nOverall I highly recommend this game to new and old Sonic fans alike. A blast of nostalgia for old fans and a Greatest Hits/Quickstart for new fans.\nSonic Generations gets a solid 8/10","August 29, 2014","true","22.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Personally, I loved that I could actually change the music for all of the stages and bosses to put in an epic song. While the game may seem great, it still comes with its fair share of bugs. One major issue is the Rouge Seaside Hill mission bug where the game will most likely crash. This can be avoided however using only the boost, and destroying only necessary robots. Sometimes the frame rate of the game may get slow at times, but that comes with most games anyway. Overall, I enjoy the game and I'm pretty sure most other people with a decent computer will too.","January 31, 2014","true","44.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Good about this game is that there are so many levels to play in the game, so whenever you feel like playing a level, you got A LOT too choose from! There are also many characters from Sonic to Silver to Knuckles! Of course there are also many more such as Tails, Amy, Blaze, and Shadow, + More!\nEven though u got some characters that are not playable such as Omacho, you still can download mods to play some characters that never made it to the game as well as characters that aren't even in the Sonic Franchise! The Bad about this game is that there is a major amount of difficulties in the levels and they start to put you in RAGE MODE! Also, Sonic's character glitches a lot  when he's speed boosting and it could take a long time too get use to the controls! In all, I think this is a great way to celebrate the 20th year of Sonic and this game would get a rating of 8 out of 10 stars in my opinion!-NickTendo69","March 14, 2014","true","54.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Very rarely has a game met my expectations as well as this game has. The gameplay is basically right out of Sonic Colors and the day time levels of Unleashed, so basically, the best 3D gameplay the franchise has had, with the sidescrolling gameplay being excellent as well. Wrap that up with two versions of one fan favorite level from nine Sonic games, as well as two new versions of each stages song, and I'm a happy camper. The levels retain all the energy and life they started with, with their own new additional twists, and the remixed songs are great. Even better is that cool little surprises where things outside of the original stages being redone will be referenced, such as the Sonic Adventure 1 hotel making an appearance in that game's given stage. This is a must buy for Sonic fans, and I'd even suggest it for people that are just curious about the franchise.","December 10, 2014","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But I might as well convince you to buy the game anyway.\nSonic Genrations takes Sonic and Co. on an adventure through Sonic's past. Classic stages such as Sonic 1's Green Hill Zone and Sonic Adventure 2's City Escape re-imagined for both modern Sonic, and classic Sonic. Modern Soinc plays the same as he does in the Unleashed Daytime Stages, and in Sonic Colours, sans wisps. (There is actually a mod called the Unleashed Project that brings stages from Unleashed onto PC). Classic Sonic plays like he does in Sonic 2, 3, and Sonic & Knuckles.\nBoth Sonics control very well. Controls can be a little sensitive at times but it's not a major problem.\nThe story is good, not great. But Sonic isnt as story-centrc as other games, so it's no big deal. A monster called the Time eater rips apart space and tme and Sonic saves the day with his past self.\nThe game has a surprisingly large modding community. There's  stage mods (The Unleashed Project, the STH2006 Project), and mods to replace sonic with Metal Sonic, Shadow, Silver, Blaze.... The list goes on and on.\nThere however a few problems I've had with the game, mainly being fps drops down as far as 10-15 at some times, however that may just be my hardware. (Intel HD 4000)\nOverall I highly recommend this game to new and old Sonic fans alike. A blast of nostalgia for old fans and a Greatest Hits/Quickstart for new fans.\nSonic Generations gets a solid 8/10","August 29, 2014","true","22.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That last statement will probably mean I am extremely biased but man, this game is incredibly good.\nFirstly the levels when you play in 2D or 3D (depending on the era) shows a really faithful remake that makes you fall in love with many levels all over again, and when you play the other act, taking your favourite 3D stages into 2D and vice versa it ends up putting a new feel to the levels which most of the time ends up being really fun to play. Admittedly I did have some issues with some later stages as sometimes the level design messed up the smooth flow the game had before, but overall the levels are incredibly good (And hey, they made Crisis city playable. Not necessarily good, but playable.)\nThe visuals are also really great, many levels in their remade form look lovingly crafted and really do make some stages (Like Green Hill Zone and City Escape) look brand new, hell I'd buy a Sonic 1 HD remake if they made it look like generations (Well I'd probably buy it anyway but still.).\nNow I would recommend when you play this game that you use a controller, as a keyboard admittedly feels awkward when controlling Sonic in 3D. In 2D I didn't really have the same problems.\nOverall this game is easily one of the best recent Sonic games and a must have for Sonic fans.\nP.S. Wouldnt it be awesome if Sega added bonus DLC levels (not like the Casino Night pinball) where you get to play stages like Mystic Ruin and Ice Cap zone? Just imagine the levels remade in HD with redone music. You're welcome.","January 17, 2015","true","17.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AncientPancakes/recommended/71340/","AncientPancakes","AncientPancakes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AncientPancakes/","61 products in account","Wow, there's a whole lotta gravy in this game. If you are a fan of sonic games in general, you may want to pick this up.\n\nFirst of all, let me mention that the gameplay itself is very swell.  The controls are pretty tight and while it doesn't reach the responsiveness of the Genesis games, it controls just dandy. Classic Sonic stages all take place in 2-D and they offer a great mix of speed and platforming just like the Genesis titles. Great work was done on the Classic stages.\n\nThe Modern Stages are also very godlike. They remind me very much of Sonic Unleashed and Sonic Colors and, for me at least, this was very sauce.  These stages have a great sense of speed and at times I even feel like a wild ape rampaging through the amazon rainforest.  Both gameplay styles are very fun and very sauce.\n\nPerhaps the biggest selling point is the way this game caters to established fans of the series.  All of the stages in this game are remastered versions of stages from past Sonic games.  Stages like Chemical Plant Zone from Sonic 2, City Escape from Sonic Adventure 2, and Planet Wisp from Sonic Colors will be immediately recognizable to fans who have played them in past games but with the Classic/Modern gameplay split they feel new and as delicious as a barbequed almond roast.\n\nThe nostalgia in this game is huge and longtime Sonic fans will love it. But this is also where some people may not enjoy Sonic Generations.  For those of you who are not familiar with the series, a lot of Sonic Generations' appeal will be lost on you.  By itself the game is still very solid, but I imagine it is best to be played when you are more familiar with what the series has already done.\n\nSpeaking as a Sonic fan, however, I very much enjoyed this game. When I finished playing all the levels in the game I said "Holy poopoo banana pants that was a good time". Any Sonic fan should definitely consider picking this game up.  If you haven't played Sonic games in the past this just might not be the best purchase, but i'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy this game more than eating a medium-rare sauce steak.\n\nSonic Generations has been granted a rating of "Supreme Slam, Extreme Jam".  Thank you for reading.","July 2, 2013","true","40.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sadly they were incredibly frustrating, incredibly buggy or just plain painful to play, Sonic generations is the first attempt to fix this.\n\nThe game can be broken up into Act1 (Classic Sonic), Act2 (Modern Sonic), Boss battles (each boss fight has a particular Sonic mandatory) and finally challenges for each Sonic. Let's go over each of them:\n\nClassic Sonic (Act1 of each stage): Classic Sonic is the sonic of our past with a bit of a modern twist on it. The levels are straight forward, simple to play and good fun. If you have played any Sonic game from the 90's then you will have no worries here. The only thing that will grab you is the occasional 3D feel it gives off.\n\nModern Sonic (Act2 of each stage): Modern Sonic is the character most associated with the bad Sonic games in a 3D world. Sonic generations gives modern Sonic high speed levels to play in at the start and it's a lot of fun seeing how fast you can clear a level. The later stages though are annoying and painful to say the least, it's at this point I started wished I could play the full game with just classic Sonic.\n\nBoss fights: The bosses are a really strong point to this game, they are fun to play, the tactics aren't too hard and both Sonics feel really good to play as.\n\nChallenges: Here is where the game really free falls to a large extent. At the beginning the challenges are really fun to play be it trying to out race a doppelganger or just use your skate/snow board to finish a level is great fun. Once those are done though it feels like the developers ran out of ideas and just made stuff up, the later challenges have you trying to collect rings in a fixed time (2 things I hate, collection duty with a time trial). Another one is hitting the level end sign to the end of the level or depending on side characters to help you, these are annoying and frustrating to say the least.\n\nIf you are a Sonic fan you should give it a go, for everyone else wait for 50% or more off.\n","December 29, 2014","true","15.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That last statement will probably mean I am extremely biased but man, this game is incredibly good.\nFirstly the levels when you play in 2D or 3D (depending on the era) shows a really faithful remake that makes you fall in love with many levels all over again, and when you play the other act, taking your favourite 3D stages into 2D and vice versa it ends up putting a new feel to the levels which most of the time ends up being really fun to play. Admittedly I did have some issues with some later stages as sometimes the level design messed up the smooth flow the game had before, but overall the levels are incredibly good (And hey, they made Crisis city playable. Not necessarily good, but playable.)\nThe visuals are also really great, many levels in their remade form look lovingly crafted and really do make some stages (Like Green Hill Zone and City Escape) look brand new, hell I'd buy a Sonic 1 HD remake if they made it look like generations (Well I'd probably buy it anyway but still.).\nNow I would recommend when you play this game that you use a controller, as a keyboard admittedly feels awkward when controlling Sonic in 3D. In 2D I didn't really have the same problems.\nOverall this game is easily one of the best recent Sonic games and a must have for Sonic fans.\nP.S. Wouldnt it be awesome if Sega added bonus DLC levels (not like the Casino Night pinball) where you get to play stages like Mystic Ruin and Ice Cap zone? Just imagine the levels remade in HD with redone music. You're welcome.","January 17, 2015","true","17.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dunnace/recommended/71340/","dunnace","Carnage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dunnace/","343 products in account","It’s been 20 years since Sonic rolled into the realm of games, and with him he’s brought us speed, clever level design and wonderfully imaginative set pieces. He has, however, also brought with him hideous 3d cameras, piles of buggy messes and a hedgehog who drives a jeep and carries a gun. Mixed legacy? You bet it is, and nowhere is the schizophrenic nature of the series better displayed than in the historically minded “Sonic Generations”. Is the blue blur back to his best, or is this simply another false start?\n\nSonic Generations begins optimistically, blasting through Green Hill Zone before being introduced to a charmingly “nod-nod wink-wink” opening cutscene that hints at a more light hearted Sonic adventure than other games have attempted. This reassuringly fun opening is cemented when, after finishing the first level with modern sonic, you think that you’re safe. Modern Sonic played fine, Classic Sonic was great, maybe we’re going to make the long haul here, maybe we can see the game through and not hit any major speed bumps. This goes on throughout the first third of the game, the level design is charming, the cutscenes are small and for the most part amusing, and the music is great. Then something happens, and a cold sweat sits in.\n\nChallenges? There are challenges between the levels? The pulse quickens and blood drains from the face. Oh no. They surely didn’t mess this up, they were doing so well! Please don’t make me replay the same level to pad out gameplay please don’t... then the first genuine surprise happens. The challenges are not only really fun; they’re entirely different levels, for the most part! New power-ups are dished out in the form of Sonic’s friends and the level design shifts entirely. OK so these levels are much shorter, but they’re good, they’re fun, and best of all they take about 5 minutes at their most extravagant.\nThen the first boss fight happens. It’s a mess; spotty controls, frustrating design and uninteresting music leads to the first true lull in the game. You can forgive it though, it isn’t too bad and it ended quickly once you figure out how to hurt the boss. But then you open up the Dreamcast era, and like Sonic does when he needs to go quicker, it goes downhill from there.\n\nIt’s incredible how Sonic Generations manages to pinpoint the exact moment Sonic jumped the shark but the history lesson is well taught. The level they chose from Sonic Adventure is a city level. The level they chose from Sonic Adventure 2 is a city level. The level they choose for Sonic 2006 is a city level. Suddenly it becomes very apparent that Sonic stopped existing in a sort of fantasy realm and started becoming an urbanite. All of the charm starts to drain, the level design gets, not exactly harder but more finicky, there’s more awkward jumps and bad precision platforming. Even worse are the glitches which suddenly pop up in Modern Sonic; blasting through walls, clipping on the edge of a platform and falling your death. Throw in more unexpected and unfair traps and it all gets a bit frustrating. Classic Sonic seems lost and bewildered in these later levels, outside his 3 games he has to wade through 6 modern titles and in almost every single one of them he is chased by something. I know Sonic being chased is a fun idea, but my god the poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ must be magnetic or something.\n\nThis is Sonic Generations biggest problem, while it’s great to celebrate Sonic’s past, it’s his present that is the true villain of the piece. What’s baffling is how the designers missed a trick in doing as little of the bad Sonic games as possible. They chose to include Sonic Heroes and Sonic 2006, and both of the “new levels” for those games are horrible. Why on earth recognise these infamously bad titles when you could have had a proper Sonic 3 level (the one in the PC version is Sky Sanctuary, a fine level but from Sonic and Knuckles) and brought in Sonic CD for a real nostalgia trip. Instead we get a bad beach level and a third (third!) city level. A terrible decision was made in development, but it could have been worse, we at least didn’t get a Shadow the Hedgehog level.\n\nTowards the end the game feels like it might be getting a little stale, so it stops. With only 9 levels, and only 2 Sonics to play them with, Sonic Generations is short, but rightly so. The challenges become a little more cumbersome and tricky towards the end, and the final bosses are a teeth gnashing nightmare, but they are at least beatable. With 90 challenges to play and time trial modes to master some players will get tons out of the end game, but most users will be satisfied to put down the game after the final foe is foiled. I certainly am, and it’s an amicable separation, for £20 I felt I got what I paid for, and the game seems to breathe a sigh of relief that I’m asking no more of it.\n\nAs Sonic games go, Generations is a fun tribute. It remixes its ancestry but adds little to the series other than a recognition of when to bow out. Classic Sonic was fun to see again, but I doubt he’ll be back and it’s perhaps better that way, he’s had his day and now it’s his older, more jaded self that has to prove his worth. Modern Sonic is not redeemed by this title, and the later levels remind you that he still has his fair share of issues. But maybe he can move on, maybe someday we’ll get that 9/10 Sonic game that blows us away. This, though, is not that game, but it seems it was never meant to be. Short, silly and satisfying, Sonic Generations is a snacky game, not an epic event, and it’s nice to see something that knows its limitations. No melodrama, no over the top score, a fun run through the past of one of gaming’s most contentious icons and then off home with a smile on your face.

The Hedgehog Engine's port to Windows is clearly not optimized, and probably there are still lots of room for improvement on lower-end systems. Still, it's a marvel to look: from expressive and cartoony character animations to colorful scenery, it shines and glides through a beefy system.\nGameplay-wise, it's good for classic Sonic, and great for modern Sonic! The missions are a bit distractive and boring, but no serious flaw. The low number of bosses is also a let down.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty enjoyable game, for both long-date Sonic fans and newbies alike, albeit a bit short.","December 20, 2013","true","10.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's also good to see Sonic's friends return after they'd been absent for a while, even if they aren't a major part of the game.\nThe strangest thing about Generations is that even though it is a super short game that could probably be beaten within a couple of hours, it is extremely replayable (even without mods).\n\nIf there are any complaints I have, well... the final boss is awful, some of the voice performances I'm not really keen on and the game does very occasionally freeze up to the point where the only way I can close it down is by restarting my PC.

What I love most about the game is the fact that it unites gamers of all ages to celebrate Sonic and his friends, in all their forms, both old and new. The single player campaign alone is worth playing by itself. The mini-games, however, will keep you more than preoccupied once the campaign is finished. I've played the game countless times on multiple platforms and I'll keep playing it for as long as I can.

That one game along with just passable entries released on down the line saw a lot of fans turn away from the franchise but I can tell you that this game is without a doubt the best Sonic game since Adventure 2.\n\nThroughout the game you take on the role of classic sonic, who is played more like the original games in the style of 2D side scrolling but in more of a 2.5D type of style.\n\nAnd of course you take control of modern Sonic who controls in more or less the same way as in Unleashed with some  side scrooling sections thrown in as well.\n\nAs a long time fan of the series it is really great to see that Sega can still make good Sonic games though the furure of the series is still up for debate with Nintendo now helping out for the next few games which probably means that we are going to see a rapid decline in fast paced gameplay and too much 'family friendly' content as shown by lost world and colours.\n\nBut overall if you are a fan of the series than you should definately think about buying  the game because it is filled with nostalgia, great gameplay and loads of replayability.\n\nThough there are some bad points about the game, these points being that the game is only about 4 to 5 hours and all of the voice actors (with the exception of Eggman as his voice actor was the only one that didn't change after unleashed) are really bad even though some of them have done better in other performances.\n\nClosing score: 97/100","March 20, 2014","true","27.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Classic Sonic and classic Robotnik are bawss, and all of the levels for classic Sonic play very nicely.\n\nModern Sonic, on the other hand, brought the entire cast and crew of his games - each one fresh out of whatever paintchip factory they had lunch at for the day. The last boss is a miserable experience because the colorful crew of critters ends up shouting advice into your ears the entire time.\n\nTL;DR - Worth it for classic Sonic alone if you enjoyed the Sega Genesis games.

If you ask me, it's the perfect way to celebrate Sonic the Hedgehog's 20th anniversary. Why? Not only do you get to play as Modern Sonic, but also Classic Sonic (he introduced me to videogames, believe it or not). So, needless to say, it can appeal to you whether you're a fan of the 2D, Genesis classics, or even the modern, 3D games. Every level has been taken from previous games in the series, all of which were voted to be in the game by the fans. One cool feature within the game is the ability to choose what music plays in the background of a level. You can unlock music through collecting red rings (returning from my favorite Sonic game, Sonic Colors) and completing challenges (a lot of which are a major pain in the neck to complete, let alone get an S-rank on). Oh, and if you were to ask me, I think people complain about the final boss fight WAY too much. It's not perfect, but it's not terrible, either (especially once you learn its attack-patterns and can collect rings efficiently). In conclusion, Sonic Generations doesn't quite have everything I expect to see from a Sonic game, but it is a masterpiece and it should be in every Sonic fan's collection.","December 19, 2015","true","90.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dsantor9/recommended/71340/","dsantor9","dsantor9","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dsantor9/","27 products in account","Where do I start with this game?\nIt's amazing. That's where I start.\nSonic Generations is Sonic's 20th anniversary celebration, incorporating ideas, gimmicks, and, most importantly, levels from earlier games in the series. But, we'll get back to that later. For now, let's talk about the story.\n\nThis game's story is probably the worst thing about the game. It's not that the story is bad, but just the lack of story is disappointing. The Sonic series has had a lot of, um... "low" moments, and I which that Generations's writers would have poked some fun at the series, as a game like this would have been the perfect opportunity to do so. Plus, the story is just generally very simple and one-sided, especially for a modern Sonic game.\n\nThe story goes as follows: One day, Classic Sonic was running through Green Hill Zone when suddenly, a giant purple demon thing comes out of nowhere and starts to attack. Meanwhile, in the present, Sonic and co. are celebrating Sonic's birthday (even though they never say how old he is, 16 or 20), when the same monster appears, kidnapps all of Sonic's friends and FREAKING BACKHANDS Sonic to knock him out. When he wakes up, he finds himself in a white limbo. Sonic decides to go explore his surroundings and discovers a colourless Green Hill (which he doesn't recognize for some reason) and ends up unfreezing Tails who was frozen in the white limbo. Later, he unites with Classic Sonic to take down the creature (which we later learn is the "Time Eater"), restore colour to all the game's locations, save the rest of Sonic's friends, and find all 7 Chaos Emeralds. And really, that's about it. Sure, there are some minor sub-plots, such as Eggman being captured as well, but mostly, that's about it. There is a small plot twist at the end though, but I don't want to spoil it for you. Also that scene has one of my favourite lines in the game; "Dr. Robotnik!" "No body calls me that anymore." Damn.\n\nBut, the game more than makes up for it in the gameplay. In this game, there are two versions of Sonic, Classic Sonic from the Genesis, who looks and feels like the original (yet pudgy) Sonic from the Genesis era, and Modern Sonic, ripped straight out of Sonic Colours and Unleashed. Each level in the game is a level from a different Sonic game. You must play both the Classic and Modern acts in the stage to restore it. The classic acts feature Classic Sonic spin-dashing his way through a 2-D stage, while Modern's uses the newer "Boost-To-Win" formula. Every three stages, you must fight a boss, so you can move on to the next era. There are 3 eras in all: the Classic era (Sonic 1, 2 and 3), the Dreamcast era (Adventure 1, 2 and Heroes), and Modern (Sonic 06 [gross], Unleashed and Colours). There are also 3 rival fights: Metal Sonic, Shadow, and Silver, and 3 boss fights: Death Egg Robot, Perfect Chaos and Egg Dragoon (not counting the final boss). Without getting into the specifics, each of the 9 levels, rival fights, and boss fights, brings something new to the table, and are all a blast to play.\n\nBut, without a doubt, the best thing about this game is the modding community. Ever wanted to play as Mario or Pikachu in a Sonic game? Maybe play Sonic 06 with enhanced gameplay and graphics? Sonic GMI's got you covered. It's a blast to play around with fan creations like these. Thanks to the modding community, there are endless possibilities (see what I did there?)\n\nThis game is amazing, the music is top-notch as usual, it's well worth the hefty $32 CAD price, and it reminds us why we've stuck with Sonic through and through in the first place.\n\n9.5/10\n\nEven though the story may not be all there, the gameplay more than makes up for it, and the mods that people in the Sonic community create make the game the gift that keeps on giving.\n\n...Or the hedgehog that keeps on... running? You know what I mean.\n\nJust remember: Gotta go fast.\n\n░░░░░░░░░▄▄▄▄▄\n░░░░░░░░▀▀▀██████▄▄▄\n░░░░░░▄▄▄▄▄░░█████████▄\n░░░░░▀▀▀▀█████▌░▀▐▄░▀▐█\n░░░▀▀█████▄▄░▀██████▄██\n░░░▀▄▄▄▄▄░░▀▀█▄▀█════█▀\n░░░░░░░░▀▀▀▄░░▀▀███░▀░░░░░░▄▄\n░░░░░▄███▀▀██▄████████▄░▄▀▀▀██▌\n░░░██▀▄▄▄██▀▄███▀░▀▀████░░░░░▀█▄\n▄▀▀▀▄██▄▀▀▌████▒▒▒▒▒▒███░░░░▌▄▄▀\n▌░░░░▐▀████▐███▒▒▒▒▒▐██▌\n▀▄░░▄▀░░░▀▀████▒▒▒▒▄██▀\n░░▀▀░░░░░░▀▀█████████▀\n░░░░░░░░▄▄██▀██████▀█\n░░░░░░▄██▀░░░░░▀▀▀░░█\n░░░░░▄█░░░░░░░░░░░░░▐▌\n░▄▄▄▄█▌░░░░░░░░░░░░░░▀█▄▄▄▄▀▀▄\n▌░░░░░▐░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░▀▀▄▄▄▀\n\nSonicGMI Download: https://forums.sonicretro.org/?showtopic=26974","December 10, 2015","true","43.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

SEGA's Sonic team has struggled to make Sonic work in the 3D space. But Generations handles it very well. Having both classic and modern Sonic help to facilitate two very different forms of gameplay. Classic Sonic's levels have a greater emphasis on platforming in 2-d esque stages. Modern Sonic has the bigger 3-D levels. A lot of these levels have sections that are on rails but these help lend a sense of speed. Modern Sonic also has some of his more recent tricks like his homing attack.\n\nThis contrast between the two gives the game variety. As you complete levels you progress through a simple but entertaining story. Like Mario; Sonic stories generally never get too deep or overly complex. The game avoids many of the errors Sonic games have had in the past; like shoehorning in new characters. In my time with the game I haven't met any new characters. Old familiar faces like Tails, Knuckles and Amy are present. Visually the game looks very nice indeed which is further helped by a mostly consistent framerate. I did have a few drops here and there however.\n\nHaving played Lost World I felt the level design was fantastic and the parkour system was an interesting new mechanic. If they could find a way to take the foundation of Lost World and marry that with the speed found in Generations I think it would make for quite a Sonic game. If you are a Sonic fan and have not played this game. This is definitely one you want to check out.","August 23, 2015","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That last statement will probably mean I am extremely biased but man, this game is incredibly good.\nFirstly the levels when you play in 2D or 3D (depending on the era) shows a really faithful remake that makes you fall in love with many levels all over again, and when you play the other act, taking your favourite 3D stages into 2D and vice versa it ends up putting a new feel to the levels which most of the time ends up being really fun to play. Admittedly I did have some issues with some later stages as sometimes the level design messed up the smooth flow the game had before, but overall the levels are incredibly good (And hey, they made Crisis city playable. Not necessarily good, but playable.)\nThe visuals are also really great, many levels in their remade form look lovingly crafted and really do make some stages (Like Green Hill Zone and City Escape) look brand new, hell I'd buy a Sonic 1 HD remake if they made it look like generations (Well I'd probably buy it anyway but still.).\nNow I would recommend when you play this game that you use a controller, as a keyboard admittedly feels awkward when controlling Sonic in 3D. In 2D I didn't really have the same problems.\nOverall this game is easily one of the best recent Sonic games and a must have for Sonic fans.\nP.S. Wouldnt it be awesome if Sega added bonus DLC levels (not like the Casino Night pinball) where you get to play stages like Mystic Ruin and Ice Cap zone? Just imagine the levels remade in HD with redone music. You're welcome.","January 17, 2015","true","17.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No nonsense with shadow, silver, etc\nPowered up/new abilities with modern sonic makes game interesting\nClassic sonic stages feel classic yet great, and some of my favorite stages\nBosses are fun, albeit a little easy outside of the end boss\nColors everywhere!\n\nCons\nStory is a little simple, but it's a sonic game, so it makes sense\nA little on the short side\nThis port isn't the best. Constant issues with configurations\nNot many graphical options\nThe short missions that are required for you to do to get chaos emeralds are a little dull and kinda over extend the game\n\nOverall, Sonic Generations is amazing. One of the best sonic games I've played. Me and my little nephew play this game all the time and we love it. I hope Sega goes back to this style of sonic games.\n8.5 out of 10.","August 19, 2015","true","14.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you like sonic, or even just platforming in general, get this game. Period.\n\nIt runs at an amazing 60 fps on my PC at high settings on a 32" hdtv, and looks absolutely gorgeous. Like, really. This is the best a sonic game has ever looked. It has full controller support that's as easy as plugging in a wired xbox 360 controller, going into this game's settings, choosing to use the xbox controller, and starting the game. And unlike other games designed for a keyboard/mouse that are just compatible with a controller, this game is truly designed for a controller and is 70 times better with one. So, if you have a wired xbox 360 or ps3 controller hanging around, use that.\n\nThis is a perfect combination of classic and modern sonic. It literally has a remade version of levels from nearly every one of the main console sonic games for both classic sonic (who makes an amazing return in HD), and modern sonic (who is even better then before!).\n\nIf you're a sonic fan, get this. There's so many references to sonic games from all eras that even if you've only played one sonic game you'll probably understand a lot of them.\n\nBut that makes you think "Oh. Well, I have to be a sonic fan to enjoy this." No. Not at all! Even if you're not a sonic fan and/or have never even played a sonic game, I still say get this. You may not understand all the references, so it won't be AS enjoyable, but it's still the best sonic's ever been in 3D (in my opinion) and it really isn't complicated. It's a platformer, after all. It's still built off of the basic platforming base. Just run and jump. There's just more stuff added on top of that.\n\nMy only complaint is that this game is too short. They put a lot of effort into it, which is great, but they took so much time on making sure it was enjoyable that in the end they had to make a huge amount of rehashed missions for each stage just so they could actually sell this as a game with enough content to keep you going for more then a day.\n\nHowever, there is an online mode. That's right, this game has a mode in which you can race to the end of a stage as fast as possible and put your best time on the leaderboards. It's great fun replaying a stage 100 times just to try and beat that one record. It also has a "30 second trial", in which you have 30 seconds to try and see how far you can get in one stage. Once your time runs out, the length you traveled in the level is posted to the leaderboards.\n\nThe best part, though, is that the PC version solves the "too short" problem entirely because of mods. There are so many mods for this game you'll never run out of stages to play. One mod ports all the levels from sonic unleashed on xbox 360/ps3, one ports stages from Sonic 06, one ports stages from sonic adventure, there are even mods that have entirely new stages in them, such as "Meponterations". And with new mods being made every day, you'll never get bored.\n\nIn brief, this is an amazing piece of art and probably the best sonic's ever been in 3D. Well, maybe not the best, but at least the best in the last decade. Overall I recommend this. 9/10.\n\n...Yes, I'm bad at reviewing games. xD","May 26, 2014","true","170.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Go figure since it relies heavily on nostaliga and classic mechanics. You can choose between the classic 2D type Sonic and the new 3D type for every act and level. It works surprisingly well and while both 2D and 3D leave some poor level design in its wake, it's still a lot of fun - nostalgia or not.\n\nIt also looks fantastic on PC.

It's also good to see Sonic's friends return after they'd been absent for a while, even if they aren't a major part of the game.\nThe strangest thing about Generations is that even though it is a super short game that could probably be beaten within a couple of hours, it is extremely replayable (even without mods).\n\nIf there are any complaints I have, well... the final boss is awful, some of the voice performances I'm not really keen on and the game does very occasionally freeze up to the point where the only way I can close it down is by restarting my PC.

That's where I start.\nSonic Generations is Sonic's 20th anniversary celebration, incorporating ideas, gimmicks, and, most importantly, levels from earlier games in the series. But, we'll get back to that later. For now, let's talk about the story.\n\nThis game's story is probably the worst thing about the game. It's not that the story is bad, but just the lack of story is disappointing. The Sonic series has had a lot of, um... "low" moments, and I which that Generations's writers would have poked some fun at the series, as a game like this would have been the perfect opportunity to do so. Plus, the story is just generally very simple and one-sided, especially for a modern Sonic game.\n\nThe story goes as follows: One day, Classic Sonic was running through Green Hill Zone when suddenly, a giant purple demon thing comes out of nowhere and starts to attack. Meanwhile, in the present, Sonic and co. are celebrating Sonic's birthday (even though they never say how old he is, 16 or 20), when the same monster appears, kidnapps all of Sonic's friends and FREAKING BACKHANDS Sonic to knock him out. When he wakes up, he finds himself in a white limbo. Sonic decides to go explore his surroundings and discovers a colourless Green Hill (which he doesn't recognize for some reason) and ends up unfreezing Tails who was frozen in the white limbo. Later, he unites with Classic Sonic to take down the creature (which we later learn is the "Time Eater"), restore colour to all the game's locations, save the rest of Sonic's friends, and find all 7 Chaos Emeralds. And really, that's about it. Sure, there are some minor sub-plots, such as Eggman being captured as well, but mostly, that's about it. There is a small plot twist at the end though, but I don't want to spoil it for you. Also that scene has one of my favourite lines in the game; "Dr. Robotnik!" "No body calls me that anymore." Damn.\n\nBut, the game more than makes up for it in the gameplay. In this game, there are two versions of Sonic, Classic Sonic from the Genesis, who looks and feels like the original (yet pudgy) Sonic from the Genesis era, and Modern Sonic, ripped straight out of Sonic Colours and Unleashed. Each level in the game is a level from a different Sonic game. You must play both the Classic and Modern acts in the stage to restore it. The classic acts feature Classic Sonic spin-dashing his way through a 2-D stage, while Modern's uses the newer "Boost-To-Win" formula. Every three stages, you must fight a boss, so you can move on to the next era. There are 3 eras in all: the Classic era (Sonic 1, 2 and 3), the Dreamcast era (Adventure 1, 2 and Heroes), and Modern (Sonic 06 [gross], Unleashed and Colours). There are also 3 rival fights: Metal Sonic, Shadow, and Silver, and 3 boss fights: Death Egg Robot, Perfect Chaos and Egg Dragoon (not counting the final boss). Without getting into the specifics, each of the 9 levels, rival fights, and boss fights, brings something new to the table, and are all a blast to play.\n\nBut, without a doubt, the best thing about this game is the modding community. Ever wanted to play as Mario or Pikachu in a Sonic game? Maybe play Sonic 06 with enhanced gameplay and graphics? Sonic GMI's got you covered. It's a blast to play around with fan creations like these. Thanks to the modding community, there are endless possibilities (see what I did there?)\n\nThis game is amazing, the music is top-notch as usual, it's well worth the hefty $32 CAD price, and it reminds us why we've stuck with Sonic through and through in the first place.\n\n9.5/10\n\nEven though the story may not be all there, the gameplay more than makes up for it, and the mods that people in the Sonic community create make the game the gift that keeps on giving.\n\n...Or the hedgehog that keeps on... running? You know what I mean.\n\nJust remember: Gotta go fast.\n\n░░░░░░░░░▄▄▄▄▄\n░░░░░░░░▀▀▀██████▄▄▄\n░░░░░░▄▄▄▄▄░░█████████▄\n░░░░░▀▀▀▀█████▌░▀▐▄░▀▐█\n░░░▀▀█████▄▄░▀██████▄██\n░░░▀▄▄▄▄▄░░▀▀█▄▀█════█▀\n░░░░░░░░▀▀▀▄░░▀▀███░▀░░░░░░▄▄\n░░░░░▄███▀▀██▄████████▄░▄▀▀▀██▌\n░░░██▀▄▄▄██▀▄███▀░▀▀████░░░░░▀█▄\n▄▀▀▀▄██▄▀▀▌████▒▒▒▒▒▒███░░░░▌▄▄▀\n▌░░░░▐▀████▐███▒▒▒▒▒▐██▌\n▀▄░░▄▀░░░▀▀████▒▒▒▒▄██▀\n░░▀▀░░░░░░▀▀█████████▀\n░░░░░░░░▄▄██▀██████▀█\n░░░░░░▄██▀░░░░░▀▀▀░░█\n░░░░░▄█░░░░░░░░░░░░░▐▌\n░▄▄▄▄█▌░░░░░░░░░░░░░░▀█▄▄▄▄▀▀▄\n▌░░░░░▐░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░▀▀▄▄▄▀\n\nSonicGMI Download: https://forums.sonicretro.org/?showtopic=26974","December 10, 2015","true","43.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emcitement/recommended/71340/","emcitement","emcitement","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emcitement/","181 products in account","MY DREAM SONIC GAME.\nwell, close to it lol.\n\nThe Sonic series has had a lot of falls like turning him into a were'hog',\nthrowing him on hoverboards, sticking him on a rail track, giving him a sword. It hasn't been too great..\nSonic 4 was alright. I recognize its flaws, but overall the games were pretty good. Sonic Colours was fun to play through, but not perfect. Sonic Unleashed's day stages were great fun to play through, but were very linear. The two racing games were pretty good too.\n\nAnd finally, this game gets everything right. There's a great blend of sidescrolling and full 3d platforming. The stages are very well designed and its just what you'd want out of a modern Sonic game. Like the old classic games, there are so many alternate routes and paths. The linear level format of Unleashed is long gone and its done so much better. This really feels like a great modern take on the classic Sonic series and really what else should an anniversary remake be? The speed here is fast like Unleashed and the platforming isn't blocky like it was in Colours. There's a great blend of both\ntoo - platforming and speed, that is.The choice of levels included is great and there's a classic and modern act for each. There's lots of gimmicky variations of the levels you can play as well, but that's mostly optional.\n\nThe visuals in this game are fantastic. The textures might not be the highest and it could use a little more AA, but it looks soooo good. One of my favourite artstyles I've ever seen in a game.\n\nThe music is really great too. It includes a bunch of remixes of tracks in the series as well as complete remakes of them. On top of that, you can unlock a bunch of different music and even change what plays in each level. Definitely a nice feature to have.\n\nThe story.. umm. yeah, the story isn't good. its just there. don't expect a good story in this one.\n\nAlso, the game is one of Sega's better ports and I'm glad to see them improving on that aspect. It runs quite well and I had very few issues with it. Though there was one problem with controllers. If you're using a controller other than a 360 pad, you might get a problem with Sonic automatically running to the side. Using a 360 controller or using x360ce (what I use) will fix it.\n\nAnd of course there's mods. While there isn't tons of crazy mods out there, there are things like your normal character swaps, music changes, and even custom levels.\nOne really cool pack out there that adds a lot of value to this game is the Unleashed project. All (but one) of the day stages from Sonic Unleashed have been ported into this game and are fully playable on its engine.. and on PC. Awesome.\n\nOverall this game is my favourite Sonic game ever. I may of spent tons of time with SA2 and Mega Collection's library of games many years back, but this game is just done so well.\nI really loved playing through it and can't recommend it enough. Its not something that'll get you hundreds of hours unless you're mega hardcore with speed runs, but I really think its like the best Sonic game ever.\nBuy it.","January 21, 2015","true","30.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","1","1","2","0"

It's one of the best 3D Sonic platformers ever made! And it made it to PC!\nTo be honest, when I bought this, I was expecting an easy game, with little to bo challenge, that I would be able to beat in a couple of hours (I'm looking at you Sonic Colors on the DS). Turns out I was wrong, and gladly wrong, because this game offers a great degree of challenge latter on. The levels are awesome and reminiscent of past Sonic levels, from the recognizable Green Hill Zone to the cloudy Sky Sanctuary Zone. The story is a hit or miss, way too childish and simple, I wish that Sonic games weren't targeted for a younger audience as they are now.\nOverall a great experience, and one of the best platformers on Steam. You don't need to be a Sonic fan to apreciate the game, but it sure helps!\n\nEdit: After playing the game a bit more to achieve 100% completion, I must add that while the controls are fine, I found myself struggling to make certain jumps (god, the frustration) and also found some glitches related to the camera - the camera stays on the side, when it should be centered, makes it hard to platform, when drifting the camera decides to wander off, that sort of thing. Also, the game often crashed when trying to play ranked time attack online, not to mention that the leaderboards are completely hacked, with people having completion times of 00m00s!\nOther than that, I still recomend this game.","June 24, 2014","true","23.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That's where I start.\nSonic Generations is Sonic's 20th anniversary celebration, incorporating ideas, gimmicks, and, most importantly, levels from earlier games in the series. But, we'll get back to that later. For now, let's talk about the story.\n\nThis game's story is probably the worst thing about the game. It's not that the story is bad, but just the lack of story is disappointing. The Sonic series has had a lot of, um... "low" moments, and I which that Generations's writers would have poked some fun at the series, as a game like this would have been the perfect opportunity to do so. Plus, the story is just generally very simple and one-sided, especially for a modern Sonic game.\n\nThe story goes as follows: One day, Classic Sonic was running through Green Hill Zone when suddenly, a giant purple demon thing comes out of nowhere and starts to attack. Meanwhile, in the present, Sonic and co. are celebrating Sonic's birthday (even though they never say how old he is, 16 or 20), when the same monster appears, kidnapps all of Sonic's friends and FREAKING BACKHANDS Sonic to knock him out. When he wakes up, he finds himself in a white limbo. Sonic decides to go explore his surroundings and discovers a colourless Green Hill (which he doesn't recognize for some reason) and ends up unfreezing Tails who was frozen in the white limbo. Later, he unites with Classic Sonic to take down the creature (which we later learn is the "Time Eater"), restore colour to all the game's locations, save the rest of Sonic's friends, and find all 7 Chaos Emeralds. And really, that's about it. Sure, there are some minor sub-plots, such as Eggman being captured as well, but mostly, that's about it.

The modern sonic levels can be buggy sometimes, but notthing game breaking. The game gives you that sense of speed that every sonic game should.\nIts always nice to have a game that is conscious of how rediculous it is, so it doesn't try being serious like some past entries. The perfect example is theres is a part where a giant semi truck is driving on the side of a building with rocket boosters and robotic saw arms chasing you.\nMy main complaint is that most of the boss fights are pretty lame, especially the final boss.\nOverall though, this is a fantastic game and possibly the only good Sonic game we'll see in a long, long time.","September 27, 2014","true","19.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can unlock new songs and listen to any song you've ever unlocked while play through any stage or mission. That and a few remixes in this game are just amazing. Favorite remixes are probably the Shadow's battle theme remixed, Super Sonic Racing (Generations mix), and Speed Highway (Modern remix.) But every stage has two remixes it to it (sans boss battles and side missions) that bring back lots of good and bad memories (that damn tornado, ughhhhhh.)\n\nLevels - The stages are great and some have achievements are nice little cameo appearances of one time characters appearing here and there in the background somewhere (Fang, Bean, and Polar for example appear on some posters in City Escape.) The levels have entirely nice design although I feel a few of them could have been much better done to either be harder or less of a pain to complete.\n\nStory - Same old, same old, Dr. Robotnik(s) up to their old shenanigans as per usual. Nice trip down memory lane regardless.\n\nBonus - The hidden trophy room, good luck figuring out ALL the codes for the trophies (most likely will use a guide like I did since there's no real indication the room exist or how to find and get the codes.) The content room has the FMVs, concept art, character info, and music for enjoyment.\n\nGame play - Modern and Classic Sonic vary in play style (although you can eventually unlock Homing Attack for Classic Sonic which takes forever to do.) Classic Sonic is side scrolling and using older game style controls, Modern Sonic uses newer playing styles and can't spin dash sadly but can go into Boost Mode and pick up really nice speed.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game, whether it be part of the bundle, stand alone, or on discount. :)","December 27, 2014","true","11.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Its a mix of the old games (Sonic the Hedgehog) with the new ones (Unleashed), and has a great value not only for the Sonic lovers, but specially for nostaligic gamers. Most of the levels played with the "old" sonic will imediatelly be identified by those who used to played Mega Drive's Sonic games! The graphics are beautiful, and the musics, like the rest of the game, its a mix of old (but eternal) tunes but also new ones! The only negative point in this game is its really weak graphic optimization. You better have a really good computer, or your game will run full of crashes and low frame-rates.\nAnyway, it's a really good game, really worth the price!","November 30, 2013","true","8.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

That said, things have been looking good for Sonic ever since Colors came out and Generations does to some extent build on that momentum and even fix many of the problems with the previous 3D Sonic games. Of course much like Sonic's career, Generations has numerous flaws that keep it from reaching the peak of platforming bliss that old Jumpman set.\n\nLet's start off with the good: Generations looks and sounds great with crisp graphics, beautiful environments and some of the series best tunes in one package. Both the 2D and 3D levels are mostly fun (with a few disappointing exceptions) and in some cases even fix what weren't really fun levels before (such as '06's Crisis City). The controls are spot on and it seems they have almost perfected 3D Sonic's move set (almost, one of the missions proves that the Homing Attack is still a bit tricky) while 2D Sonic feels just like he did in the old games, which is funny given how odd Sonic 4 felt. The Story is nothing special, but it's not contrived and stupid like in Adventure 2 and '06, plus there are some funny lines here and there. Also the new not-4KIDS cast is great (even though Robotnik is still played by the same actor) and they fit the roles well without any weird ear bleeding voices making you reach for the mute button.\n\nAs I said though, the game does have flaws that keep it from being a proper classic. For one thing, the game just feels padded. There are 9 levels (3 from each era: the Genesis Era, the Adventure Era and the Modern Era) with 2 acts each, 4 boss fights and 3 rival bosses. Given the general brevity of a standard Sonic level, this makes the game sound a bit short, even compared to other Sonic games. This is where the missions come in. In order to gain access to a boss of a given era, you have to get a key from each of the 3 levels. You get a key by completing missions (there are 5 for each level for both old and new Sonic), which you really only have to beat 1 of in each level. This is thing though; if you are only expected to do 1 per level, then why not just add a 3rd act? Reusing the existing level's assets for random missions just feels like they were tacked on at last minute or added to save money and really they just feel like filler. Franky, adding a 3rd act and just having the missions be completely optional would have been the better option.\n\nThe other issue is that the missions them selves are mostly not fun. In fact a few are what I'd call "anti-fun" (the Vector music note one is one of the worst things I've ever played in my life). I can think of several that were no fun at all, but can't think of one that was fun off the top of my head. I'm sure there were a few, but they just don't leave an impression on you. The other issue is that while they fixed many levels that weren't fun in old games, they actually ruined one that was fun, that being Planet Wisp. I personally love Sonic Color, so I was excited to see what this level was like, but I was saddened to see that they didn't use any actual level from the game. I can understand for the 2D act (which was even less fun), but not the 3D one. How could they keep the '06 level mostly intact and then just ignore all the levels in Colors? What a waste.\n\nThose problems aside, Generations is still a fun game overall and well worth any Sonic fan's time. I'm not sure if I'd recommend it for new fans, maybe check out Colors or even Unleashed first or hell, just buy the Steam bundle that comes with 12 games for free and play the old games in order. There is really no reason not to.\n\nI give Sonic Generations an 8.0 out of 10.","January 23, 2014","true","17.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Just throwing some difficulties and stuff in there in which you would normally not do.\n\nHowever I wish each stage had its own boss like in the classic games and then a final boss although that might be overkill I guess?

The only times that the 3d stages fall apart are when the game no longer has you pinned to a 2d plane.\n\nThe story is hokey but, you know what, that's actually kind of what I want out of a Sonic game.\n\nIt's hard to say much else about Generations because when the stages aren't entirely cut and pasted from other games, they're very VERY inspired from stages in previous iterations.  Unfortunately you can also gauge how entertaining they'll be based on where they came from (Hint: the sonic colors stages are awful, as are the Sonic Heroes stages).\n\nI may have said some negative things but I had an amazing time with this game and I'm very glad it existed.

Can seem that are not many maps, but you can play also over 90 challenges.\n\nClassic Sonic mode: is the classic platform mode, when you clear the challenges you can use the Electric, Fire, Bubble and Sonic 1 shields.\nModern Sonic mode: is a third person mode, in which sonic can lock and hit targets and use Turbo, the third person perspective switches with a platform in several part of each map.\n\nThe only thing i hate was the final boss fight, i didn't get anthing that was going on.. to much effects weird angles.. and also for me there was several maps in modern sonic that were tricky and confusing but if you play Sonic Adventure previously, this probably won't be an issue.\n\nThe difficulty of the game is up to you, you can try to get S in all the stages, and make all the challenges, or simply pass the story, but all the boss fights are very easy.. like in every Sonic games the boss has simple patterns.\n\nI took me 29 hours to unlock all the Achievements, because of a bug took me some hours to figure it out.\nJust plaing the story with cinematics can be done in 5, you are forced to play some challenges to unlock the new stages.\n\nGraphics 9/10\nThe graphics are pretty descent the only problem is playing using Steam Streaming, i tried but for some reason the image capture of Steam was too slow and couldn't play it that way. And the 2d to 3d charater transformation were great.\n\nSound & Music 9/10\nThe music and sounds are from the previous Sonic games but with a loot of more quality, brings my childhood back each time i hear the Sonic spins, hits fire shield sounds etc. I think the sound work is awesome.\n\nBugs & stability 5/10\nSeveral times i found bugs, like the Ranked Attack maps crashes every time... i could find how to "skip" the bug but also has a lot of work and very frustrating...\nSome scenarios had a few parts with bad collision but almost never caused me getting kill.\n\nTotal 7/10\nI totally recommend you this game if you love classics Sega Genesis Sonic i guarantee that you will enjoy it and bring your childhood back a couple of hours.

The only bad things i can say about it are these:\n1. The game has no default bindings, and you have to bind your keys based off of an XBox 360 controller, so if you've never used that controller and you don't know what the buttons mean, you're screwed. Also, to change your key bindings, you have to exit the game and launch a seperate program to change it.\n2. Remember those stupid platformers like Bubsy? Where the camera is zoomed in so much you can barely see what's ahead of  you? this game does that, at least only in the classic style levels.\n3. Modern sonic is confusing, it goes from on rail dodging to 3D platforming to 2D platforming all in the same level, and it also uses the sholder buttons for the XB360 controller, so if you bound those to a button out of basic reach, you're screwed.\nOther than that, the game is great on it's own merit. And THANK GOD you can turn omochau off,  He dosen't bother me at all, but i guess that's because i've never played sonic adventure.\nWhat else? uhhh, that's it. It just re-uses all of the classic sonic stages from your childhood, or later, to try and leech your nostalgia, and it's good.\n8/10.","February 15, 2014","true","34.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Thankfully, Sonic Generations makes the neccesity for the latter obsolete as it is exactly that. Sonic Generations takes me back to my gaming genesis (pun intended). The music, the level design, the atmosphere, everything breathes old-school super Sonic. And guess what, the new sections are also really good. I paid full price for this gem when it came out and money well spent. So any chance to get it cheap is a godsend. Generations gives you control of 2 different sonics. Not just in appearence, but also in gameplay. Speed is core in this game and it leaves nearly all Sonic's recent outings in the dust.

The first one is to see attend the first public screening of the Empire Strikes Back. The second thing is to buy the original three Sonic games for the Megadrive and play the hell out of them again. Thankfully, Sonic Generations makes the neccesity for the latter obsolete as it is exactly that. Sonic Generations takes me back to my gaming genesis (pun intended). The music, the level design, the atmosphere, everything breathes old-school super Sonic. And guess what, the new sections are also really good. I paid full price for this gem when it came out and money well spent. So any chance to get it cheap is a godsend. Generations gives you control of 2 different sonics. Not just in appearence, but also in gameplay. Speed is core in this game and it leaves nearly all Sonic's recent outings in the dust. Generations is a must-buy for sonic fans and a great purchase for those looking for great fun, whether classic or modern.","December 27, 2011","true","14.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

The story, I can't say that it will be the most understandable but at least it's simple and only has one story this time unlike 2006's Sonic the Hedgehog.\n\nThe Music:\nWhen it's good damn it's good; only a few tracks are off in this title, notably Sonic 2's chemical plant act2 and Sonic Adventures City Escape act2.\n\nSonic Generations is a buggy mess of a game, but at least it can be fun, even if there are a lot of flaws that I think could have been worked out with a little more testing and feedback from longterm fans of the sonic the hedgehog franchise.\n\nI could only think they Sonic Rushed it out the doors of there offices before even testing it for last minute bug fixes, the 3d engine camera is very broken and can even be broken from normal game play, this seems to be the case for all version of the game so if you think it’s just the PC version.\n\n\nPC port specific errors:\n\nOnline mode crashes:\nEven with a normal everyday Internet connection, this makes very little sense, the only thing it should be doing it downloading the scores and uploading the fastest time you have set in online time attack.

While it isn't too great on its story aspects, it delivers amazingly on what Sonic fans care the most about - Gameplay. The Classic Sonic gameplay found in the game appeals to even those who weren't very fond of the classic games, since it's easier to get the gist of and is required for less than half of the game. Modern Sonic's gameplay in this game is basically what it was in Unleashed, except with 90% of the issues fixed. And, with no night time stages to hold you back, the only disappointing thing about Modern Sonic is the lack of levels, since you only get nine levels with four boss fights, and some(lame) modified layouts of those levels. This is where the modding community comes in, though. Thanks to modding, this game's faults can all be fixed with additional content, and even content from the previous games. As someone who enjoys Sonic, you really would owe it to yourself to buy this game, especially during a sale.","January 5, 2014","true","174.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

For better or for worse, the Sonic franchise has carved out a long timeline with a lot of changes over the years. Generations is a look at both the old and the new.\n\nSonic Generations is split into Classic and Modern levels, Classic as the 2D Genesis-era sidescroller era and Modern as the 2D/3D platforming speedways. Classic levels play pretty much how one would expect. The physics and momentum aren't quite as tight as the old Genesis games, but they're quite good, and it's a blessing to have the Spindash keyed to one button.\n\nModern levels are a bit more mixed. On one hand, it's clear that this is the evolution of what we saw in Sonic Unleashed and Sonic Colors: a crazy blitz through lush environments, relying on reflexes and intuition to keep the flow from action to action. While it's an absolute joy to punch through a successful speedrun, it's easy to break out of the flow, and find yourself wrestling awkwardly to get yourself back to speed. Seems that you're either super fast or awkwardly trying to speed back up. Old 3D Sonic problems rear their head, sometimes awkward turning and immediate stops and the like. Que sera.\n\nNostalgia runs rampant. Fans of the series will be really pleased with the details. Sonic Heroes era Badniks still do the little detection jump before they attack, the snowboard from City Escape returns, the stages use the classic camera angles for the stage openers. I found myself smiling at the little things. Props to the composers for a fantastic OST.\n\nThe game is a bit short. 9 levels with a Classic and modern version, some old favorite boss battles and padded challenges round the game out, but I can't help but want much more.\n\nGenerations is quite flawed, but the sheer spectacle of the speed and adrenaline can't be beat. It's fun.","December 3, 2014","true","25.5"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BasilZero/recommended/71340/","BasilZero","Basilicious","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BasilZero/","900 products in account","Game: Sonic Generations\nGenre: Adventure\nDeveloper: Sonic Team/SEGA\nSystem: Steam/PC\nTotal Score: 96/100\nValue Score: 9.6/10\n\n• Story: 9/10\no Sonic the Hedgehog was having a birthday party with all the friends he has made in over the past couple of years. However something off in the distance a dark ominous being appeared and sucked everyone up and leaving both Sonic and Tails confused at what happened in a unknown mysterious space void. There they find themselves in a familiar location and as they traveled around they managed to find younger form of themselves. Now both Sonics and Tails will be going on a new journey to save their friends and their own respected times and worlds.\n\n• Characters: 10/10\no Almost every single Sonic series hero and villain appear in this game. There are some ones who do not make an appearance but all of the major characters from the past few generations do appear. You have characters like Sonic and Tails from both the past and present, Dr. Eggman of the past and present, Amy, Shadow the hedgehog, Rouge, Knuckles and the rest from Colors, Unleashed and etc. The enemies are also the same depending on the level of which game it reflects off from. Some of the notable bosses as well from the past games also make an appearance. Sonic Generations is pretty much like a reunion for the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise.\n\n• GamePlay: 9/10\no Sonic Generations plays differently from the older Sonic games. For one thing levels and stages are divided into different areas from past Sonic games and you can access them through as Classic Sonic or Modern sonic in a world map like sidescroller style. Playing as either sonic will alter the gameplay and changes the whole design of a level/stage. Classic Sonic's gameplay style is more old school 2D view while Modern Sonic's is mostly 3D view like recent Sonic games. There are three levels with each area having a mini boss and a boss at the end of the three levels. Defeating each mini boss and boss earns you a chaos emerald which is used to fight the last boss at the end of the game. Each level consists stages from different eras of Sonic - in the PC version which is the same as the home console versions, the levels and stages are included as : Classic Era - Green Hill from Sonic the Hedgehog, Chemical Plant from Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and Sky Sanctuary from Sonic the Hedgehog 3 & Knuckles. The Dreamcast era includes Speed highway from Sonic Adventure 1, City Escape from Sonic Adventure 2 and Seaside hill from Sonic Heroes. The Modern era which is the last era has Crisis City from Sonic the Hedgehog 2006, Rooftop Run from Sonic Unleashed and Planet Wisp from Sonic Colors. The usual gameplay rules apply to both modern and classic sonic - collecting rings and racing your way towards the exit marker at the end of the stage after avoiding all sorts of enemies and obstacles. For Modern sonic you can super speed dash upon a limitation bar which can be increased by collecting rings while classic sonic mainly plays like the old Sonic games with little to no difference. The level designs for each type is completely different even though it may be in the same stage. You have the usual power ups such as invincibility, shields which range from the regular green shield, the electric shield which absorbs rings, the fire ring which can make Sonic shoot like a fireball and the water shield which Sonic can use to breathe underwater or to have a extra bounce. Upon completing stages you will get access to additional missions which base around the level of where these missions are located (which is above each level entrance). These missions also vary depending on which Sonic you play as and will have a different requirement or goal as well which can range from completing a level, fighting/competing with a rival, collecting certain number of rings or simply surviving amongst other things. Completing these missions will earn you a point towards the achievement of completing all the missions and allows you to unlock a artwork or a music track which can be used optionally on other stages. Red stars also make an appearance in which goes towards your achievement scoring and is counted towards the completion of the game. A new feature introduced to the Generations game is the ability to buy power ups or abilities which can be equipped upon purchase with a limitation on how many you can equip by the number of points it requires compared to how many you have in total. Abilities and power ups range from simple power ups depending on certain situations happening automatically, the inclusion of new speed abilities or the ability to protect yourself with some bonuses such as keeping a few rings even after taking a hit instead of losing all your rings. There's also a special room where you can go and check on character profiles, listen to the game's OST or to even look at some promotional artwork designed for the game. The online feature of the game introduces you to a competitive circuit where you are forced to do a level and are ranked by the time and score upon completion which then gets displayed in a leader boards for bragging rights.\n\n• Graphics: 10/10\no Sonic Generations use a new style of visual design and fluidity for its cutscenes however the in gameplay seems to be similar to what you would expect see in a HD version of Sonic Colors and of Sonic the Hedgehog 4. The new cutscenes seem reminiscent of a typical western influenced platformer which isnt a bad thing. The visual designs for the characters look great especially on the older versions of characters. The environments re-done from past Sonic games look incredible with the new style and brings a whole new depth to whatever the player had imagined beforehand in the past games. There are some slow down and FPS drops but that is only because you would need a stronger CPU than what is recommended but by not that much and not very noticeable.\n\n• Sound: 10/10\no Sonic Generations have managed to keep majority of the voice overs for their characters from all eras including the eras without voice overs are nicely done and you can tell the difference in the quality/type of voice. However even though Sonic doesnt talk might be a bad thing - what was worse is the fact that Shadow and Rouge's voice actors were changed but it isnt bad to the extent where they sound completely off. The sound effects which were made famous in the older sonic games and all of the other games make a complete return.\n\n• Music: 10/10\no Sonic Generations consists of a mixture of old classic tracks, original tracks from modern games and remixes of all of the songs with a bit of new tracks exclusive to the game. The remixes are actually quite well made and some of them are even BETTER than the originals. Another nice thing that they added is the ability to change the music when you play in a stage. Simply upon clicking to start on a stage change the music to whatever you have unlocked via playing missions.\n\n• Length: 9/10\no Sonic Generations although might seem a bit short but it takes a lot of time and dedication to get all the red stars, perfect score points upon completion and to get every single music/artwork unlocked. At the most you will complete at least 12-15 hours on a straight way playthrough with minimal missions completed. For a platformer that is a pretty decent amount since most platformers are usually done within 7-10 hours.\n\n• Replay Value: 10/10\no Sonic Generations most powerful aspect is possibly its replay value aspect. With the ability to play in over 50 different stages over the choice of 7+ maps that seems to be a pretty hefty amount considering if you add the mini bosses and the bosses you fight along the way along with some of the things you need to collect such as Red stars which will eventually make you play through the levels multiple times.","December 30, 2013","true","13.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

Sonic Generations brings back that part and should be considered the franchise's future. However, not sure where and when Sega will continue to use this engine to bring back more classic gameplay perhaps even remake Sonic 1-3 with this engine would suffice in bringing back more Modders to take a challenge.\n\nIf you have not thought about playing the Classics, and atleast going through time to all the Games that really were a hit aside from the last three levels, you just might enjoy this game. Although, the last 3 sets died to me in the original useage, they really made it fun in this version so the Levels are a bonus.\n\nDLC? Not interested, but, hey! Check out the Unleashed Project which is completely free, and replaces all the levels in the game with the levels from Sonic Unleashed! Go get it...\n\nThe game overall is a 9/10, a few things could be removed, and others added...\n\nOne last thing, I should Thank a Special Friend who gifted this game.

A title that is really good, and has a lot of replay value, but it really... understates its welcome? It has a (slightly) diverse range of remade levels from past games, and both Sonics control beautifully, but it's pretty damn short, and $50 is honestly just overpriced. But when I say replay value, I MEAN IT. It has lots of stuff to collect, including concept art for Sonic games from the past, and even MUSIC from Sonic games from the past! The levels always leave something new for every playthrough, first or not, and keep you playing over and over again. The remixes used for levels are downright AWESOME, and the bosses provide a fair challenge while not being too overly frustrating- very rarely do I ever rage-quit because of a boss. Overall, it makes its place well in the Sonic franchise, and it's an amazing 20th anniversary title. However, the story is so simplistic that it's almost bland, and it just screams missed opportunities. But it does have, yep, a modding community! You can download and play a diverse range of mods that can have new stages, characters, bosses... anything, really! Overall, it's a good game, but a bit overpriced. I recommend it to Sonic fans old and new. Heck, even if you're not a fan of Sonic, just give this game a go.

I love how it caters to both classic and modern Sonic fans with its two styles of gameplay. Although I prefer modern Sonic's levels, classic Sonic's levels give me a nostalgic feeling because of how similar they are to the Sega Genesis style of controlling Sonic. The modern remakes of certain levels and songs also get me nostalgic as well. And I can't forget to mention the graphics are fantastic in comparision to the Gamecube era of Sonic games. After I had beaten the storyline, the game left me with wanting more modern remakes of levels from Sonic's past.

Though they played like old Sonic games, they didn't feel like old Sonic games. In short, the games expects you to use the physics instead of letting you do things your way. For example, I had a habit in older games to quickly halt myself while in a loop so I could backtrack. In this game, if you hit the brakes and try to turn around, Sonic will glitch through the loop and you'll lose a life. It's hard to express, but I hope you see my point.\nBut the game was still fun.

Modern Sonic is incredibly cringe. So cringe. The cutscenes are almost unbearable. THAT SAID, I did have fun playing this game, both classic and modern levels. Not using a gamepad is going to cost you patience, though, as this port was very obviously developed for the 360. Nothing terrible.\n\n\nPros:\n- Mostly fun.\n- Racing Metal Sonic again is pretty sweet.\n- It's almost worth the whole game's price to play a new Sky Sanctuary.\n- You're able to choose what song you want to play for which level <-- Best Feature Award\n\nCons:\n- All dialogue.\n- All voice acting.\n- All cutscenes.\n- Buggy.\n- ♥♥♥♥ physics. Classic Sonic games were fun because it was challenging to master the tough-as-nuts physics <-- Worst Feature Award\n- It still ain't no Sonic 3.\n\nBuy this game when it's on sale if you love old Sonic games.","December 31, 2013","true","18.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The graphics are amazing.  The nostalgia from the remixes all my favorite songs is great (Chemical plant zone, and City escape).  The game is short if you ignore all the extras though.  All of the bosses except the last one are top notch.  The death Egg Robot fight was good nostalgias, Shadow was fun (they put the space battle in) and the Silver Boss fight is no use.  The last one isn't bad or not fun, I just didn't like it as much as the others.  Maybe it's just because I've never been good at Super Sonic Sections.  The only 2 levels that gave me trouble were the last one and crysis city.  The last level is just too long for my taste.  This is really a problem in some of the bonus missions.  And crysis city must have been infused with the power of Sonic 06.  That level is very faithful to source material.  I got stuck on platforms, got many gameovers, had trouble locking onto enemies, had some slow down, and even got stuck on a loop once.  You can tell they really put a lot of effort into recreating crysis city.  Overall,  I would say buy this game.  Amazing music, good throwbacks to source material, plenty of nostalgia, and overall solid gameplay make this a must own for any sonic fan.  I would say you have to be good at video games to enjoy this as if you are not you will constantly run into stuff.  8.5/10.","May 23, 2014","true","60.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Though they played like old Sonic games, they didn't feel like old Sonic games. In short, the games expects you to use the physics instead of letting you do things your way. For example, I had a habit in older games to quickly halt myself while in a loop so I could backtrack. In this game, if you hit the brakes and try to turn around, Sonic will glitch through the loop and you'll lose a life. It's hard to express, but I hope you see my point.\nBut the game was still fun. The music was really good, and nothing beats listening to awesome songs, old and new, while dashing through stages.","November 10, 2014","true","27.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Sonic Generations brings back that part and should be considered the franchise's future. However, not sure where and when Sega will continue to use this engine to bring back more classic gameplay perhaps even remake Sonic 1-3 with this engine would suffice in bringing back more Modders to take a challenge.\n\nIf you have not thought about playing the Classics, and atleast going through time to all the Games that really were a hit aside from the last three levels, you just might enjoy this game. Although, the last 3 sets died to me in the original useage, they really made it fun in this version so the Levels are a bonus.\n\nDLC? Not interested, but, hey! Check out the Unleashed Project which is completely free, and replaces all the levels in the game with the levels from Sonic Unleashed! Go get it...\n\nThe game overall is a 9/10, a few things could be removed, and others added...\n\nOne last thing, I should Thank a Special Friend who gifted this game.

A title that is really good, and has a lot of replay value, but it really... understates its welcome? It has a (slightly) diverse range of remade levels from past games, and both Sonics control beautifully, but it's pretty damn short, and $50 is honestly just overpriced. But when I say replay value, I MEAN IT. It has lots of stuff to collect, including concept art for Sonic games from the past, and even MUSIC from Sonic games from the past! The levels always leave something new for every playthrough, first or not, and keep you playing over and over again. The remixes used for levels are downright AWESOME, and the bosses provide a fair challenge while not being too overly frustrating- very rarely do I ever rage-quit because of a boss. Overall, it makes its place well in the Sonic franchise, and it's an amazing 20th anniversary title. However, the story is so simplistic that it's almost bland, and it just screams missed opportunities. But it does have, yep, a modding community! You can download and play a diverse range of mods that can have new stages, characters, bosses... anything, really! Overall, it's a good game, but a bit overpriced. I recommend it to Sonic fans old and new. Heck, even if you're not a fan of Sonic, just give this game a go.

May be mediocre by normal standards.\n\n-Visuals are both pretty and nostalgic\n-Music has a bunch of remixes/rehashes of old songs (many of the songs werent even good to begin with)\n-Voice acting is terrible as usual\n-Settings and controller support arent great, kinda porty\n-Gameplay is OK but has typical Sonic stuff that stops gameplay unless you have the level memorized.  And of course there is a bunch of pointless animation where you aren't actually playing.  There's also a ton of random mechanics in levels that can be both unintuitive and frustrating.  The classic version of Sonic isnt captured perfectly but it's still fun enough (I guess I could say that about the new Sonic as well).\n-There's challenges that are, for the most part, not fun.\n-There's skills you can buy/equip which are kinda fun I guess.\n\nI only recommend this game if you already like Sonic.\n\nPS:\nIn my opinion the pinball dlc is better realized than the whole game.

After Sonic 1 through 3 the nostalgia factor is basically eliminated from the game with stages from some of the more forgettable titles in Sonic History. Of course it is Sonic "generations" So these are necessities, but some more reimagined levels from the glory days of Sonic the hedgehog would have made this a much more satisfying experience. I still recommend it for die hard Sonic fans. The gameplay is fun and there's a lot of challenges to enjoy after beating the regular stages.","December 27, 2014","true","16.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I also experienced a weird issue with the controls of Classic Sonic: attempting the ground roll sometimes just randomly stops your momentum (instead of enhancing it) and some other times just... doesn't work.\n\nI surprisingly found myself enjoying way more the Modern levels: overall they are fine, but I think SA2 is probably the better choice if you want that kind of gameplay (disclaimer: I'm saying this but I don't know if the PC port's any good, I played it on Dreamcast several years ago).\n\nThe extra "Challenge" levels are ridiculously repetitive, every single one I tried basically was "repeat a portion of the level you just played with no challenge whatsoever, but oh wait here's a totally irrelevant gimmick that'll make you think you're doing something different". Spoiler alert: you won't be doing anything different.\n\n\nIt's just really mediocre overall and not worth its full price, although I'd recommend it on a sale if you're a diehard Sonic fan.","December 20, 2015","false","5.9"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","1"

I also used a XBOX 360 controller, so I don't know how the keyboard plays. I've played this in the past and have good knowledge about this community and past games, with that out of the way, lets get to the review!\n==WARNING==\n\nGood homage to all past sonic games, great music (as usual), brilliant level design, and great boss and rival battles, basically and argueably, the best sonic game since Ye ole days.\n\nI've been a big fan of sonic's games, weither it would be the OG trilogy, the Storybook saga, the wii and wii u games (colours, unleashed, lost world), and even (some) the spin-offs. and I can safely say this game can hold up to the standards of the prestigous sonic installments.\n\nThe gameplay is silky smooth with eye candy graphics, Classic Sonic takes a blast to the past with ol' fashioned controls and mechanics, while Modern Sonic offers a Z-axis for all of you fancy people (me included), and new mechanics such as the lovely Boost that everyone can't keep their thumb off of your choice of key binding. Lovely gameplay just lovely.\n\nThe Music is extremely well done as always so I won't dabble a lot in this part of the review, even the remixes are enjoyable! (proceeds to sing Escape From the City WOOOO).\n\nThe Levels are well done complete with alternate paths, well placed traps and enemies, and those lovely red rings. yaaaaaaaay. With redesigns of popular places from the sonic universe such as the iconic Green Hill Zone, my only complaint is the devil stage that somehow came from the dreaded '06, (cringes) Crisis City, personally to me the hardest acts in the game, atleast it has good music! (everyone and their ears cheer!). Bosses are great, my favorite being Perfect Chaos. (I LOVE Sonic Adventure, except Big the Cat, why was he even created?!) Anyways, the bosses are great, but I can see why some people complain about them being too easy, The rival battles are one of the most enjoyable parts about this game, especially the battle with Shadow, LIVE AND LEARN. To sum it up Level design is pretty good.\n\nThe cutscenes are also well done, seeing both Sonics and the Eggmans interacting was both humorous and enjoyable. ( I need a loop of Classic Sonic trying to do the homing attack, don't ask why).\n\nHeres a quick check list\n\nPros\n- levels are good and well thought out (Bosses and Rivals included)\n- gameplay is silky smooth\n- Music is amazing as always\n- graphics are eye candy, along with memorable and vibrant enviornments\n- oh and a great modding community\n- Get this, Side missions (Especially Modern Sonic's) ARE ACTUALLY FUN THIS TIME AROUND!\n- the Collectibles are well-worth getting if you love sonic music.\n\nCons\n- I can see why people don't like the bosses\n- Crisis City\n- (for me) the red rings, but they're optional\n- Classic Sonic is over-SHADOWed by Modern Sonic In my opinion\n\nI'm not giving a numeric rating so I'm ending with this\n\nI really enjoyed this game! \m/(>.<)\m/ Rock on, or should I say, Run on!","August 4, 2014","true","19.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

But as the modern Sonic, it was the best experience playing free-run Sonic game for me, the camera changes all the time with buttons appear at the screen, test your reflect skill to the limit :))\nHowever, the buttons of the game isn't the keyboard, still the button of a console hand, maybe this game isn't 100% optimized for PC (doesn't bother me at all)\n=> Gameplay still great.\nThe game has the "Online Mode" but still haven't tried it yet, 'cause i buy the game just to enjoy the singleplayer with Sonic and his friend.\nWill be playing this game more often, if you are a Sonic fan or have an interest of Sonic, i suggest you should buy this game, recommended","January 7, 2015","true","18.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"
