Installed and played figuring one and done.  No!  An overhead twin stick shooter centered on an upgradeable tank complimented with earned custom loadouts.  Enemy engagement of Nazi war machines whose destruction results in frequent gold and occasional weapon drops.  24 levels of varied primary and secondary objectives make iBomber Attack a great value.

Plenty of destruction, weapon upgrades and has a few different types of scenarios.  I got about 5 hours of gameplay out of it.  You'll probably get more if you want to master every level.  Graphically it is to be expected at this price range.  Not a ton of replay value, as soon as I beat it I was good, but fun temporary time killer.","December 28, 2013","true","30.2"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

I can't believe how one game can get me to invest so many hours in one sitting. This rarely occurs for me due to health reasons. Sitting that long. The gameplay is outstanding, graphics, sound, music, everything. And this is a port? I'm surprised. I believe I've reached level 14 and there's much more to go and it just gets better with every completed level. Don't pass this one up if you like destroying everything. Worth a play for sure. UPDATE: I forgot to include the tip, to make sure you use a controller because it's so much easier on your hands and switching between weapons. And it never crashed on me once after completing the single player campaign, unlike some AAA titles out there. If you're running Linux? Check the forums for the game starting properly too.","December 6, 2014","true","6.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Get in your tank, blow Wehrmacht up, upgrade your tank, blow more Wehrmacht up - missions do have various primary and secondary objectives, but it all boils down to "victory through superior firepower" (which is A-okay by me).\n\nThe warzones are rendered in a nice 2D style (with some nice attention to detail too) and accompanied by lots of gun- and explosion-sfx which have a decent oomph to them. Probably runs on a Toaster and works very well with a controller.\n\nOnce you upgraded your tank enough, you are like a force of nature laying waste to entire cities which is stupidly fun. Not really a clever game by any stretch of the imagination otherwise (and pretty much on the "not challenging"-end of the difficulty-spectrum), but very entertaining if you crave some good old top-down destruction with a twinstick-shooter twist (pretty much everything in a level can be destroyed, rammed, crushed, set on fire... you get the idea!).","December 30, 2013","true","6.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Probably won't play it again, but you never know. The game is quite enjoyable. The level sizes are decent although unless you're going for achievements you don't really go all over the map in most levels.  I never used a controller for this game, as it's far more smooth driving then say Renegade Ops, but I could see it being nice so I leave that to personal preference.\n\nThe power-ups and upgrades are definitely cool, as I found out you will probably use most of them a couple times depending on the level. The side missions are a nice touch as well.\n\nThe simplicity of this game is great, it's a straight forward game and really easy to pick up. The only flaw I see with this is long term replay value.\n\n7.5/10 due to no long term replay value but very much worth it especially on sale","February 9, 2015","true","8.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game doesn't take that long to beat, but it's good fun while it lasts.  You drive a tank through many missions, killing nazi troops, vehicles, buildings, choosing different upgrades/purchases after each mission.\n\nOne small issue is that progress isn't saved until you exit the game (and syncs to the cloud), so if you experience a game crash (which I did once) you can lose quite a bit of progress.","February 22, 2013","true","10.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

This alone is not the reason I am leaving a negative review, as even great games can have a hiccup from time to time. The problem is that after each crash I have lost a lot of progress - missions that I had completed were no longer complete and money / skill points I had earned were gone.  The game does not have a manual save feature as far as I know, and if autosave is the only option then it should autosave after each mission attempt. The crashes were not frequent, but for me that isn't the point. This is a sloppy game design and programming choice in a game that is otherwise well crafted.  If this problem were to be addressed I would certainly reccomend this game, but as it stands I don't think the game is worth putting in time that can be too easily lost.","March 1, 2015","false","25.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Points are given for blowing up all the stuff, completing secondary objectives and collcting stuff. These points can be used to upgrade the tank and alternate weapons can be obtained. There isn't much variety in the enemies. As levels progress there are slight variations on the same thing and they take more shots to kill. The graphics style is high-resolution rendering of very basic models. This game would've been just fine on the NES. It even reminds me of Jakyl (but not as good). There was an annoying bug I encountered that hurts my opinion of the game. In level 20 there is a timed objective that I failed. When failure occurs the game crashed. When I loaded it back up it erased all my progress from level 13 up to that point and I had to replay it all again. So, after every level, I'd quit the game and restart. The bug happened again on level 20, but thankfully when I reloaded it, I only had to replay level 20 again. Overall, this game is average for a budget title. It's also on phones so that should give you a good idea as to the quality of it.","February 6, 2013","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although iBomber Attack is developed by the same company, this is completely a different game from iBomber defense (and iBomber defense pacific). iBomber attack is a shooting game, in which you control a small tank to eliminate an entire Nazi army. Some of the graphical and acoustic materials are inspired by iBomber defense, and the overall performances of graphic and sound are just so so. Surprisingly, the game is actually additive with its well balanced numeral value design, which makes the difficulty increases at a comfortable slope and encourages you to continue completing missions (as well as secondary objectives and collectibles) and strengthen your vehicle.\nAbout 8 hours are needed to accomplish all achievements and there are still time challanges (not counting towards any achievement) that demand quite a skill and planning even if your tank is nearly fully equipped.\n\nRecommended for anyone who does not hate shooting games.","May 8, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Specifically, it involves tanks blowing up lots and lots of stuff from a top-down point  of view.\n\nThis is not a game with revolutionary graphics. It does not have an engaging storyline. There is no music and most sound effects consist of explosions.\n\nAnd yet, it is fun.\n\nThere's just something addictive about systematically blasting a building to pieces to get at an enemy on the other side. Or blasting anything to pieces really, since almost anything you encounter can be destroyed. You may start out in a pristine rural village with cobblestone streets and majestic fountains. Rest assured, by the time you've finished the level the whole place will be a smoking ruin - hells yeah!\n\nThe controls are easy to master. You do get the ability to buy various upgrades and weapons for your tank as you complete missions.\n\nThe game is single-player only, with both a campaign and a survival mode. You're looking at several solid hours worth of mindless entertainment for a reasonable price (I bought the game for one dollar).","August 1, 2013","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a top-down one-hero-against-the-whole-German-army shooter with very intuitive controls (it's very easy to steer the tank in any direction, drive forward and backwards, all while pointing the turret right at the target), varied missions, primary and secondary objectives, optional hidden objectives, reasonable upgrade system and most imporantly - loads of fun! All that for a very decent price which tends to go unreasonably low on occassions. If you remember the golden age of top-down shooters, you'll love it!","November 29, 2014","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was pleasantly surprised.  It's simple enough not to even need any instructions (which is good since there aren't any) and pretty much just mindless fun running over entire towns with your tank and shooting everything in sight.  Given this isn't my usual genre and I usually don't get that far in these types of games, I wouldn't exactly say there's much challenge to the game, especially for people who are better at games than I am, but if that doesn't bother you, you should definitely check it out!","February 15, 2013","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
