Similar to a tower defense game minus the towers. Replaced with disposable units to counter an attacking army that you battle on top of a pizza.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLHuu5DXje0\nEarlier levels don't last long but quickly increased in difficulty, perhaps even needing some tweaks. Got a little frustrated due to the perfection required for stopping the onslaught at times. Other then enemy units, the other challenge faced is the moisture level, energy used for spawning units and using their special abilities. While limited and slow to regenerate, it can be increased through completion of levels and spending acquired funds on passive boosts or unit upgrades.\n\nNo screen resolutions available instead scaling to fullscreen or running in a 720p window. Sliders were available for music and sound. Mouse or gamepad worked fine but could not be remapped and worth nothing was pad needed to be unplugged otherwise game suffered from odd menu behavior. Reasonable amount of content and didn't touch the pvp or co-op modes, believe the later may only be supported locally. Nice artstyle though graphics don't stay as crisp as I would like running fullscreen. Phone port but a good one, without any micro-transactions. Huzzah.","September 26, 2015","true","5.3"," 34 of 41 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","34","41","2","2"

You could replace mold with fantasy monster and the enemies with knights, but that would be only have as funny. 2 hours in I got a variety of tanks, archers and suicide bombers and according to the screenshots, there is a lot more to go around. Also, how many TOW games have coop?\n\nTruly deserves a lot more attention. Very challenging. Too challenging at times.\n\nOn the bad side, I miss the option to rebind keys, or did I just "miss" that?","September 25, 2015","true","8.0"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","15","18","3","0"

The molds are so cute, as are the preservatives, the controls are simple to understand (once you get used to them) and I already want to waste away my life with this game. I found myself repeatedly playing 1-10 as I kept wanting to beat my score. I just can't seem to last even a minute. I haven't had a chance to play with a controler, but I think the keyboard and set-up is my preference. (To me, the controller looks harder to use.)\n\nEdit: Learned the 1-7 hotkeys on the keyboard without realizing they were shown on screen. I'd suggest when you start to take a good look at the screen and then restart the level. That's how I got my head round some of the levels.\n\n10/10 would yell at friends to get it so we can PVP\n10/10 would cuddle mold\n10/10 would host a pizza party with this as entertainment","February 25","true","5.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Unit types have pretty varied so far and allow both you and your enemy to have some interesting combinations and formations.\n\nGame has been challanging a few times for me so far, and there is also a level rating system for you to attempt for a perfect 3 star score if the levels are too easy. Game also contains upgrades and customization that allow you to tweak your stats for just the advantage you need.","February 22","true","25.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is about as far from it as it gets.  It is a spam clickfest that is mildly not painful for 20 minutes then sucks.
