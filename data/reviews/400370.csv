Normal sound, normal gameplay, normal graphics, normal puzzles, normal retro feeling.\n\nNo seriously, even if you didn't play it back in 1996, if you like 3d first person perspective adventure games with graphics like duke nukem 3d, then you have have a big reason to buy this pearl. It is funny, crazy, challenging (a bit of the old unfair vibe is also there, but now we have the internet :-D), nice looking and it has plenty of cut scenes.\n\nThe Publisher KISS ldt listened to feedback and will try to bring the other language packs back, that seems to be the only complains from people that played it back than. Personally, I played the game in German so any english version is fresh for me and I can't complain so far.\n\nSome glitched are DosBox issues so far, but it's only a short reinitializing of the resolution which makes me wait 1 few seconds longer till I can get into the menue or an item, but I can life with that, after all, I spend time playing a 20 year old game, what are a few seconds for me :-D.","October 9, 2015","true","5.5"," 50 of 58 people (86%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","86","50","58","14","2"

With this release I feel lied to. Sadly, the trailer that steam has playing IS the American version of the game with Corey's voice acting, however what you get when you purchase it is the very dull British version where all of the Norm guards have very thick cockney accents and the main characters voice is some random guy who sounds about as interesting as your history teacher that hates his job. I would request a refund but from what I understand Steam works kind of like Spiderman, you only get one. So this time around I will eat that whopping $4 I spent and be sad and save that refund for another day. I wont dog on them too much though, I LOVE steam to death, just wish they would have been a little more clear on which version they were selling.

It is still just as funny and fun to play as it was back then. Thanks to the guides available, you can make the game widescreen and if you have access to the old Normality CD you can get the original voice acting brought over to this version. That would be the only thing that would make this better if the USA voice acting was already a part of this game. I would put the price a bit too high but not enough to say I wouldn't get it. Wait for a steam sale and you will have spent your money wisely...at least according to me.","January 17","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sounds odd? Yeah it is. There are some minor issues with that presentation but I'll mention it when I'll go on...\nNormality is a Orwell served with a heavy rock/punk sauce. The titular normality is complete subjection to the ruling government, that means... yeah. No TV other than the boring NORMTV(TM)which runs normal (read: boring) programs for normal (read: boring) people, no rock music, normal books only (anything that isn't normal is of course either censored or disposed off). Hell you can't live in a NORM world eh? Take control of Kent - a young rebellious (or just wanting to have fun) chap and overthrow the boring government! That's pretty much the story of the game.\nAs for the actual substance - the game requires scanning the environment carefully (Not too careful though, thankfully it isn't a pixel hunt), pick up the puzzle pieces, use them, converse - the usual adventure game stuff. One thing though: the puzzles are HARD. Play on words, tongue in cheek humor or just sheer surrealism is the basis of this game. So watch the conversations! Throwing a spanner in the works might have to be taken literally.\nThe 3D interface works out... so-so. It's weird and the voodoo doll interface needs to get some using to. Buuuuuttttttttttt... it works.\nThat's pretty much the best summary: The game works - the dry and quirky humor, the weird control scheme and the revolutionist storyline all goes well together.\n5 stars and must get for any adventure game fan. If you're a new to the genre though, reconsider the purchase for it might leave you clutching your head for days, trying to solve a particularly hard puzzles.","April 3","true","9.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

You can actually move and look around freely with the mouse although the controls take some getting used to (e.g. press both left and right mouse buttons to enable free mouse look). Given its age (released in 1996) that is to be expected but how far ahead of its time it is in general even extends to an autosave feature - yes those were extremely unusual even after almost a decade after the release of this game! The animated textures and level of geometry detail is quite something and while there are sprites for many of the objects and people there are many 3D cutscenes peppered throughout the game.\n\nSo, enough about how retro cutting edge it was, the game itself has an interesting story, funny characters and conversations and mostly logical, if at times hair pulling puzzles due to having to find an object in another location to advance, The latter is softened a bit by a fast travel option available from the beginning of the game. The music is quite so-so in general but not really bad per se (we are talking 1996 DOS here). The length is fairly decent clocking in at around 10 hours and it comes with Steam trading cards too. The setting is quite interesting being somewhat a critique of consumer society wrapped in humour.\n\nWould I recommend this game? Of course!","April 10","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
