The driving feel is awesome, the cars react how they should. The stages are simply amazing, they can be difficult and tight but that's what I love of rally racing. Multiplayer is great fun, I can only hope it keeps a good healthy community.\n\nComparing this to Codemasters rally titles:\n\nHandling: WRC 4\nStages: WRC 4\nSound: DiRT 2/3\nGraphics: DiRT 2/3\n\nCodemasters take the sound and graphics department by far but gameplay is definitely better in WRC 4. I'm happy the official WRC titles made it to steam, totally worth the day 1 purchase.","October 25, 2013","true","56.3"," 139 of 175 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","139","175","2","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maxld/recommended/256330/","maxld","MAXLD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maxld/","238 products in account","Is it the best rally game ever? No. Is it a decent rally game? Yes. Is it better than previous WRC games? It is, specially than "WRC 3" which had an insulting "Career" mode. This one has a proper WRC career from WRC3 (2WD) to WRC main class, is way more realistic in that department than previous ones...\n\nCar choices are limited to the WRC3, WRC2 and WRC classes, there's no GroupB this time, no classic GroupA/90's WRC and no classics. But that's not a big disappointment, because in previous WRC games their driving was not that great, and the choices/licenses were also very limited.\n\nSome of the Rallys are much improved in my opinion (Germany specially), although others are exactly the same as the previous game. Each one has six stages, but no closed loop super specials this time.\nOne thing that still annoys quite a bit is the design of some stages, specially the ones with extremely slow and tight hairpins chained one after another. I mean, one or two of them I think I wouldn't be even able to do them in real life without backing up. And since the WRC cars have such high torque/acceleration they tend to lag a lot in 1st gear with considerable wheelspin there, it's quite annoying. I've cricticise previous WRC games (specially the first 2) for having very long turns and not much hairpins, but now it's the opposite, they are ridiculously tight and too close from each other.\n\nGameplay: (my opinion is based on keyboard use only, with outside camera view) it's more of an arcade, this is far from a sim. That said, it's "attack friendly", quite arcadish and a bit to the loose/quick steering, which helps a lot to recover from near-crash situations, but it's a bit too much to feel in perfect control and sometimes it actually turns too much to the inside when you want to slide to the corners. You can adjust the steering lock a bit on the car setup though, but it doesn't solve the situation completely and it still feels a bit too fast. WRC 1 I think it had quite more precision and you could antecipate and attack against the clock with more confidence. That said, this one adds a bit more need to re-adjust and to fine tune your input, so it's more unpredictable. 2WD cars are much more nicer to drive, though, much less catastrophic understeer than before, and are much more worth the time spent on them (Career mode).\n\nGraphics: they get better with every game, but this is a console port (old gen), and not a very great one. Mediocre motion blur, occasional sluggish/stutter and fps drops kind of spoil the visual flow/pacing, and textures aren't great, since it's a simple port. I recommend using SweetFX tweak tool to make the graphics sharper and to boost the colour levels, it helps a bit.\n\nSound: not great, but less annoying than the previous ones in my opinion (specially the Fiesta reving on red line). Biggest problem at the moment is a major bug that makes the game sound to turn off (normally after 3, 4 or 5 stages and before starting the next stage), requesting a game restart to fix it. You can still complete the rally/next stages but there's no sound at all.\n\nOther bugs: a few of them. Online doesn't work for a lot of people (doesn't connect), cinematics are bugged (half screen is black, some don't even seem to appear (after winning a championship, for example). Haven't seen much game braking invisible walls but some of the vegetation will certainly behave like a massive metal pole and destroy part the car in a heartbeat. It's not likely it will be all fixed soon and improved by the developer, considering the previous games, but fingers crossed.\n\nDetails: well, the "Career" office looks decent but the email system is just the same every time (even when you win a rally), so it's 100% useless unless you haven't seen a single rally event in your entire life or haven't played a rally game before. One thing it has is the Service Park only every 2 stages which is nice and more close to reality. It also has Power Stage system like the real WRC. Flashbacks system is there but it's better and more fun to just avoid it and ramp up the AI difficulty level to have a decent challenge.\n\n\nConclusion: It's a game with a limited budget and team, and it's clearly aimed for consoles first, PC later. So it has the usual drawbacks of a port. Does it make a better job than other rally games out there? Well, there's no other decent rally games out there that deserve your attention if you're a rally fan. And I mean proper rally / WRC, not "gymkhana stuff". Let's say it's a bit close to "Colin McRae" games back in the day, although it's debatable.\n\nThat's why I do Recommend this game. It's the only proper Rally game out there and it's a game I enjoy playing even though it's not perfect. Just pick it up depending on the price you're willing to risk.","December 1, 2013","true","45.7"," 75 of 90 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","75","90","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnrahn/recommended/256330/","johnrahn","john","http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnrahn/","1159 products in account","If feels like somehow a few developers who learned to code from YouTube coding lessons managed to cut and paste their way into something that resembles a game. I’ve tried to like this game for 3 months but its been a horrible experience overall. This is a mediocre game at best. Further, they insist on degrading the user experience further by forcing secondary logins & game registrations.  You have to create an account with them, verify you are who you say you are, and all that junk. This stuff never works right and is especially true with this game. Oh, and get this, you must use a gmail account for registration.  What?? I have gmail but still what kind of flaky spaghetti code are they writing that can only handle registrations from gmail? None of this has anything to do with the game either its just some kind of old school foolishness. They don’t even maintain multiplayer game servers (see below) which would at least be a valid excuse for this account registration nonsense. Aside from registering the game and perhaps being forced to do so multiple times because they have an inadequate registration system that forgets who you are and loses all of your game info you’ll have an even more difficult time trying to do anything that requires hitting their servers like saving race results and getting anything to do with multiplayer to work.  Even the achievements seem straight up bugged presumably because their own system doesn't remember who you are and refuses to pass on the achievement information to Steam.   Even the most mundane of achievements are hit or miss to ever get to pop.  Some basic achievement as simple as opening the car repair menu may never pop and likely a more significant one like a well earned victory achievement will never be realized.  Achievements are not that big of a deal but if you’re going to advertise them as a feature then you know what? They better work.\n\nAll this developer imposed nonsense aside, the game itself is average for a 10 year old racing game. The graphics are lackluster but passable.  On the highest settings performance is almost decent BUT it looks so dated. The controls are fine using an XBOX wireless wheel or just a regular XBOX wireless game pad.  What is an issue, however, is once you do any remapping of controls the game menus do not properly represent your remappings. It uses the default prompts in the game even after you change the mappings. It’s also really easy to get stuck in the simplest of menus and the prompts just don’t make sense sometimes. Come on, at least get the MENU system right.  Then it’ll read something along the lines of press A for OK, B for Accept, etc.  So you have multiple options that would appear to do the same thing, but of course they don’t and good luck trying to figure out what the devs were thinking with that.  You can’t tell half of the time if you’re continuing to the next level or about to forfeit a race. Once in a while a button just stops working in the menus. You might have to abandon a race if, for example, you’re on the race stage info menu but the right dpad stops working so you cant navigate back to start the race or tune and repair your car. No other key or button will help either and you’re only choice is to quit which hurts your overall standings which in turn hurts your ability to advance in the campaign. Magically the button starts working again once you've done exactly the opposite of what you wanted to do. Sometimes the sound cuts out entirely. Not just the car sounds, but everything in the game including music, the crowd, etc. Silence. Then it’ll suddenly start working again 30 seconds later. These things have been complained about on the forums for months to no avail.\n\nI’ve never been able to start a multiplayer game.  The system insists I need to create an account and verify it which has been done.  I did it when I first started playing in November 2013 and have done it again since. Doesn't matter I don’t exist apparently.  None of my race results get uploaded and after every single stage of a single player race I face “an error occurred during upload” message.\n\nSupport doesn't seem to exist.  They haven’t replied to any emails, facebook, or in the Steam forums. In fact I think some of my posts were wiped away instead of being replied to. The attitude feels like, “thanks for the cash, now leave us alone.”  Also I’d take whatever they put on the store page with a grain of salt. “78 courses in 13 different countries,” they say?  Well maybe if you count that ½ are just reversed courses or slight variations on the other courses. There are nowhere near 78 ORIGINAL courses. Also from the store page, “Online multiplayer mode for up to 16 people” but this is from their own readme: “ARC 4 FIA World Rally Championship has no dedicated servers for multiplayer.” Huh?  So it’s peer to peer? How do you even establish a peer to peer connection if you can’t even start multiplayer mode at all?\n\nThere are plenty of great racing games out there with a lower price tag. This game is a bit specialized but not terribly so that its a must have. I guess I could go on about how much I don’t like this game but if you made it this far there is no sense in beating a dead horse. Even though I got it at a big discount I don’t think I’d buy it for $1 if I knew then what I know now.  Since it will be in my Steam library for eternity I guess I’ll just rage play it whenever I’m debating buying another game that I’m on the fence about to remind me to stop buying terrible games.","January 28, 2014","false","7.7"," 132 of 180 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","132","180","2","3"

The physics are almost wooden, the visuals fall way short of what a game of this age should live up to, the track design is boring, and on many stages the devs have just receycled a lot of the road sections because of the circuit (lazy) design of each event, the sounds are horrid and contained, and the whole experience is just flat.\n\nThe career mode has been improved, and it's the mode I have played the most. However, if you're looking for longevity then the multiplayer won't give you much of that, because it's likely to not even work for a lot of people. You can create an account for it, but after a week, the chances are that the game will tell you that you don't have an account any more, and that you'll have to create a new one.\n\nI've created a new account 5 times now, and I got hit with the same message this morning, so no more for me.\n\nTerrible effort of a game.

The car set up option is also good and fairly thorough.\nThe handling of the cars (I use a controller) is, although, a bit sloppy and I would've liked the kind of percision evident in games like the DiRT series.\n\nMy biggest problem and the most frustrating thing about this game is the pace notes. If you arent very familiar with rally outside the gaming world, perhaps this wouldn't seem like a big thing. The pace notes in game are HORRIFICALLY inaccurate and vague. The developers clearly gave little thought to individual stages and instead recorded all the notes and threw them in haphazardly into the rallys with little thought. Many of the corners in game tighten and are rarely mentioned, to get out of recording specific stage notes, there is a chicane (left/right or right/left) note and a very vague Turn Left/ Turn Right junction note with no specific severity of bend. Without a course map it becomes extremely difficult to successfully navigate a stage as crests and tightening corners are never mentioned and its largely left to guess work.\n\nI could go on about the various problems with this game but the fact of the matter is if youre looking for a decent rally simulator with good gameplay, great graphics, and decent gaming experience, buy DiRT.\nThis game has a long way to come before it can compete.","October 30, 2014","false","3.9"," 76 of 104 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","76","104","4","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/astronomas/recommended/256330/","astronomas","astronomas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/astronomas/","1010 products in account","I feel somewhat torn about this game. On the one hand it is a competent rally game we had not since Colin McRae Rally 2005 and Richard Burns Rally. On the other hand it has some serious flaws. The game has quite arcady driving physics, and if it is good or not for you, it depends on your personal preferences. This is a proper rally game, so it does not have any Ghymkhana, rallycross or baja nonsense. It contains 4 classes (WRC, WRC 2, WRC 3 and Junior WRC) and 13 rallies with 6 special stages each.\n\nOn the other hand the amount of roads is quite limited. Each rally has 6 stages, but there are driven mostly through the same pieces of road, so there are only about 2 unique special stages per rally. The fact that kept us playing old rally games was great amount of special stages and vehicles, there just is not enough of that. The game is capped to 30 frames per second, what is unacceptable for a PC driving game nowadays, but there are some methods to remove this cap. The game still has some bugs, which are not game braking, but still can be annoying for some people.\n\nThe bottom line is that if you are into rally games, get it on sale. It has too much flaws to be recommended at full price, but if you can get it cheaper, it is worth playing.\n","May 8, 2015","true","18.0"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","25","28","0","2"

The co-driver is terrible. Is often quite inconsistent with the labelling (i.e a left 3 can be several different angles and speeds even though all of them are in the same stage)\nHe will mention stuff thats irrelevant, one corner saying 'past trees' whe the tree in question is on top of an 8 foot wall, which you should also avoid but is NOT mentioned.\nHe NEVER says anything about camber which is a little odd, he will call jumps bumps, bumps jumps and jumps as crests, with no real consistency between any of the three, and will often not mention bumps and crests that can end up with race destroying crashes.\nHe appears to have very little idea what opens or tightens means, and will say them when not needed, and not say when he really really should have done.\nRolling the car on corners that should be 'Don't cut' is quite common place, and i'm pretty sure (i've checked it twice) there is a Hairpin labelled left when its right.\nThis can get insanely annoying after a while, when it is well known good rallying is all about good pace notes.\nBasically he is quite inconsistent, and you will find youself simply learning the courses by doing them, and having your own pace notes in your head for the ones he doesn't mention.\nThere are no also no options for altering him other than timing and volume.\n\n2.The number of tracks mentioned is somewhat of a false hood, there seems to be around 3 stages for each country, that get 'combined together' into different tracks, (so the first half of one track is the last part, ot the middlle of another), and just having the reverse stage as another track (so driving the same course backwards). While the 'weather' changes, it is just a difference of colour, not sunny to raining, just midday to evening and only seems to affect lighting comditions.\n\n3. Someone else has said this aswell, this is a hairpin fest like no other, I beleive there are 2  maybe 3 courses. where the car gets to really high speeds, aside from those you will never see 5 or 6th gear. Every single course has a bucket of hairpins, and very few fast sections even in Germany, Finland, Australia and Sweden, which are kind of renowned for being very high speed events.\n\nAside from these points the game handles quite alot better than other WRC games,  the car physics are very good and you can feel the road and behaviour of the car quite nicely.\nBasically this game plays quite nicley but has some not major but very irritating flaws.\n\n\n","January 22, 2015","true","8.4"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","24","27","0","0"

Narrow roads were you need to be carefull not to fall on a ditch. I only reached top speed on Montecarlo and Finland.\n\nThe only feature I would like to see is night stages, or more dynamic weather.\n\n---------------------------\nI've been playing this game for an hour, I was curious about it but due to some negative reviews I wait until I was sure. Finally I bought it last weekend in a sale and it hooked me sonce the 1st stage.\n\nI think is one of the best rally games I have played in years since my PS1 days, I have played Dirt but it never hooked me, it was good but I felt it like an arcade more than a simulator. In WRC4 I felt a great change, an licensed FIA WRC game with the official 2013 season and drivers list, WRC schedule and several car settings. A very accurate copilot comunication and real damages.\n\nSince the first minutes of the game I felt like I was playing Colin Mcrae Rally 2.0 from my PS1 days, but not in terms of graphics, but in terms of gameplay, it had that exceptional rally atmosphere I remember from when I was a kid in front of the tv.\n\nGraphically I can't complain, I play in a laptop with intel hd4000 and even in low/medium settings looks great, but as I said previously the best part is gameplay.","October 7, 2015","true","18.6"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","14","19","2","0"

Kudos to Autodesk Beast.\n+ Very easy career to folow: Win the 6 Special Stages and ascend in the rangings. Easy, simple and effective to achieve fun.\n+ Not powerhouse PC requiremends in order to play. Good for people with mid-range PCs who want 1080p resolution.\n+ Good variety of cars to choose while you unlock better rep.\n+ Online leaderboards that sync with an account IF you want to create one (GFWL sucks, no way around it).\n+ Nice voice acting. You can hear really good the instructions from your partner.\n+ Loads fast (again port, so on a HDD the load is way quicker)\n\nCons\nThe cons are mostly revolve around the fact that this is a port and a quorky one at that.\n\n- Very VERY sensitive controls, don't try keyboard even if your life was depended on it. With controller things get better but still if you are low tempered you will surely throw the controller out the window. That's because PS Vita analog sticks have very small area of reaction, 1o in PS Vita corresponds to 10o in controllers so you have to somehow amend to that and the solution is to make the controlls very sensitive. Don't try to change the sensivity, you will make things worse.\n- Repetitive gameplay. Same tracks 80% of the time and no other modes like 1vs1 race or something else.\n- No team pros and cons. It would give the game a bit depth to the team you choose but only car power (also uninteresting) matters.\n- Weird way classes of WRC are shown. Junior I get, but what's the difference between WRC 1,2 or 3 ?\n- If the game crashes for no reason, you might be welcomed later with a message saying "Your save game is corrupted", also for no reason.\n- If you get stuck while trying to upload your times inbetween races you either lose the race or your save game, again, for no reason.\n- Way to pricy for a bare bone experience. 30 dollars ? You mad son ? DIRT 3 costs 25 and since yesterday the GFWLess version with all the DLC included just got released for 22.5 dollars. Pick it up only for 50% sale and above only.\n- Did I mention the save games get corrupt easy ?\n\nThe only reason I give it thumps up is because I bought it on sale both in PS VIta and for my traveling PC, otherwise I prefer DIRT 3.","April 3, 2015","true","1.9"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

I'll leave Sweden on "maybe, maybe not" category, but it does look awfully similar than the last one. Germany was the only one which seemed to have changed, although I'm not sure if it was for the better. The faster speed of the old one fit better.\n\nThe game also looks surprisingly bad. It somehow looks even worse than WRC 3. It's a shame, since WRC 3 showed some potential and with a bit better graphics it could have been one of the top rallying games.\n\nOne of the biggest issues is the pace notes. Which leave a lot to be desired. Sometimes they are late, sometimes they come too soon. The pacing is bad, some corners have totally derpy notes. hand brake on a "crossing", that would equal to a 5 level of difficulty, some corners noted 2 levels wrong in difficulty, some totally omitted from notation. And then the notes sometimes just disappear from the screen...\n\nI haven't driven the proper 4wd cars, since I'm still in WRC3 so I can't say if the physics and drivability have changed, but based on WRC3, that side should be pretty good. And I haven't driven Greece yet, but if they haven't changed that one, that's a set of some of the best rallying stages I've driven in games.","April 16, 2015","false","18.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

The physics are very, very far away from being a true simulation. Front wheel drive cars do not actually behave like they are front wheel drive. You have to try to actually make them understeer. The different road surfaces do not always feel all that different either, the cars never seem to lack grip no matter what surface you are on. There are occasional issues with physics that make you spin in weird directions too ( like turning right and grabbing the handbrake and the car suddenly spins left).\n\nCar tuning is very basic and does not save between stages. Big changes to the setup of a car don't effect it that much. No choice of tires, no varible weather. I feel that even with steering lock at maximum the car always seems to react slowly to my input (xbox 360 controller). The car just turns to slowly even when you move to full travel of the stick you wait for the car to catch up.\n\nTracks are generic, all of the stages are the previous stage reversed or pieces of the other stages combined ( apparently they all take place in the same 3-5 mile stretch of road) which is an issue I had noticed in the previous WRC games. The stages are a great deal longer than those in Dirt 3. In Dirt 3 the stages are over far to fast and never really felt like a rally, this does improve on that at least. Co-driver is not always synced with the track and can be telling you about the corner you are currently in not the next one even with maximum delay. Some of the co-driver notes are wrong also ( saying left for a right turn, hairpins when its really a 2 or 3 etc.)\n\nThe Career is far to easy IMO. I have played on the hardest settings from day 1 and never really had an issue winning any stage. I was able to skip WRC3 completely and even when driving a "lower performing" car in the same class I had no problem beating the other cars by 10secs or more per stage.\n\nThe game is not all bad, but is definitely not a great game either. There have been far better in the past, in fact I think WRC 2 was a bit better. It does trump Dirt 3 in the track length department, though I feel Dirt 3 stages are apallingly short. I wouldn't pay full price for it by any means. I think you would get a better more real experience picking up an old Colin Macrae game for Xbox than this.\n\nPros:\nDecent gameplay, though not realistic\nnice to see actual sponsors in all divisions\nStages are of decent length\n\nCons:\nphysics are flakey\nCo-driver is flakey\nTracks seem copy pasted\ncareer mode feels to easy\nbugs you about not connecting to the internet after every stage\ndoes not keep car setup between stages","May 8, 2014","false","30.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

To be able to introduce enough new ideas on an annual basis to warrant such a yearly purchase is hard, but not impossible.\n\nSadly the WRC series is not such a series. It was made extremely clear to me by WRC 2 (2011) that recycling content was a normal thing. Now, 4 years since the first of the WRC games I still feel the effects. But fear not, as this year’s game feels fresher than ever. Whether or not this is acceptable however, is up for debate.\n\nWRC 4 starts right out of the gate with a few very welcome changes. Gone is the boring dreary campaign that forces you to slowly crawl up the ranks. In WRC 4 you can get to the top level of the WRC in only a few hours, but also allows you to go down to the lower levels if you wish. This gives you a bit of freedom in your style of play. Like the real series, the higher the division of the WRC you compete in the more events are played out before seasons end. So by the time you compete in the top level you will be running the whole official calendar before one of these seasons is over.\n\nThis year the developers went with authenticity; something that is always welcome in an official racing game. Everything from the main menu (which shuffles real slow motion shots of rallies past) to the 3 day breakdown of each rally makes the game feel more realistic then it ever has.  The stages themselves too feel far more varied. Most rallies have a unique flavour to them. Finland is flying with many blind crests, and the UK has deep mud and rain. Gone is the mirrored feeling of many of the stages in previous games. Instead you are fought with tight hairpins, and Cliffside falls. This gives the game a sharper feel of power and control; allowing the player to truly push as hard as he dares.\n\nEven though the new stages are impressive, many issues around come into focus. Some of which has never been addressed since the very first game. The main issue is replicating certain turns. Although not as bad as previous games or the horridly copied game that was WRC 2, there are still many segments that have either been seen before in previous game or are blatantly taken from other rallies! I found a perfect example with an uphill double hairpin that was in Sweden and then again in Australia. I have never had a problem with reusing the same stages in different configurations to create multiple runs of one rally, but to copy the same turns and then paste them elsewhere in a supposed other country is just irritating. It creates a heavy sense of déjà vu, creating fast player fatigue.\n\nThe audio in game also creates a step forward for the series. Gone are the horrible electronic songs that felt wildly out of place and instead you hear more of a smooth sounding beat. The problem here however is that there is only one song. You think they could have added a few more. Worse than the single song soundtrack is the horrible co-driver which makes a shocking 4th straight appearance in this series. They have not changed the horrible sounding co-driver… EVER. This being a rally game your co-driver is essentially to the game. You have to listen to him to know what is coming up. The problem here is he sounds so mechanical that it is hard to get into a groove. He says turns in such a choppy fashion I am dumb founded that the developers have not made a better sounding co-driver after 4 flipping games! He also has a tendency to call notes too late causing you to miss a turn.  I guess they never expected people to drive faster than the co-driver.\nOn a positive side for the audio is not all bad. The engine sounds are a big plus. All WRC cars sound very unique from one other making them a joy to listen to. From the smooth gear shift of the DS3 to the harsh pop shift of the Polo, it’s a real treat to listen to the vehicles in action.\n\nThis year’s game has also taken a huge step up graphically. Even though it is still not even close to the level that which was set by Codemasters DiRT games, it is still a hefty step up from last year’s visuals. The damage model however is still lacking and the water effects are still pathetic but other than that the game looks great.\n\nThe problem with the game is: it clearly is not ready to be sold. The game is littered with broken content; the main one of which is multiplayer. To enter multiplayer you first must register for their online service. This pointless step forces people to register their username and emails before entering. This also complicates things as they do not tell you this in any shape or form upon attempting to get online. Instead upon entering multiplayer they will notify you that your “nickname” is incorrect. It wasn’t until I used help forums that I realized I had to register prior to entering online. You would think that once registered that would be that, but it gets better: once I registered I was able to play online for only 3 days at which point again they told me my nickname was incorrect. I am not interested in re-authenticating my email 2 times a week for their stupid system. What little time I was in online events I would frequently encounter game crashes and disconnections. What little I played online told me that the online structure is a very basic model. With up to 16 playera and offering only ghost vs game play it is not worth the pain of entry. Online simply doesn’t work; sufficed to say, I have given up on it. These issues continue in other modes however. My final straw was when the game erased my career for seemingly no reason.\n\nNow I did start this by stating the series is NOT a good contender for the yearly model which might seem odd as most I have said so far was positive apart from some broken content. The game is a step up for the most part and the game (when it runs) is really fun and tight, but you don’t buy an apple for a few bites and that’s what this game is: a few bites and nothing more. A game that struggles this much to bring working content and not requiring constant recycled content should not need to release a game on a yearly basis.\n\nI would recommend this game ONLY if it is not listed for full price. What the game offers is amazing, but losing my career and not being able to play online is enough for me to not recommend it to people who want the complete experience. A series like this needs to take a year off and rethink its strategy.\n\nI give this game a 6/10. It is really fun and the game play is really enjoyable but with only half the content working it’s hard to recommend it to everyone.\n","March 9, 2014","true","29.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

If your looking for a serious hardcore Rally sim try Dirt Rally or find an oldschool copy of RBR. I like both casual and sim but this is definetley more casual.\n\nWhat a fantastic arcade game!! Good graphics, fun gamplay and a career mode that plays just like I like it. I find it almost mind numbing to read reviews when people compare this game to Dirt 3. Dirt 3 is more like a racing game with some rally in it. Dirt 3 does not focus on rally souly and the career mode is disjointed bouncing you between rally, gymkhana etc. WRC however is a RALLY game! Its kinda like when anyone compares any other shooter to COD (annoying) The career mode is one of the best I have ever played and is very similar to the old V-Rally 3 career mode. While V-rally wasnt wonderful the career setup was the nuts. In WRC you start at the bottom in Junior WRC depening on how your season goes you will be offered the chance to move up to WRC3, WRC2 and finaly WRC. You get rivals and objectives along the way. I highly recommend this game to any RALLY fan and I am already hoping and looking forward to the next one.\n\nEdit, I see milestone games getting a lot of stick recently. The only issue I have had with this game and other titles is some instability on the online servers and engine sounds are bland (standard milestone problem). Other than that its a solid title.","August 30, 2014","true","31.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The car handling is fine for my tastes (which run towards the arcade more than the sim as I play with a keyboard) and there are different classes represented, making for a good career mode. The rallies are characterful and distinct and sometimes beautiful, and the stages are good fun to drive, and generally quite twisty and narrow - which is good in a rally game.\n\nThere are some things that could be improved. The game feels clunky on my computer, which is up to the task of running Bioshock Infinite but lags sometimes in this game with the lighting effects. The menu systems are clumsy. I like the fact that stages are run as pairs between services, as this somewhat replicates the WRC experience, but the damage system is too generous. In games like Colin McRae Rally 4, choosing parts to repair became quite a strategic decision, especially when the car was fairly easily damaged in stages with jumps. The pacenotes are vague as well, but that's not a problem unique to this game.\n\nMy biggest frustration is one that might not concern a casual gamer too much, but it concerns the design of rallies. Although the individual stages themselves are good, the developers are not true to the WRC experience when they take names that in real life belong to entirely different stretches of road and use them to label a stage that is a minor variation of a previous one. And that is how the rallies are organised - different permutations of the same little patchwork of roads, with each section reused over and over again. Of course, WRC events often repeat stages - so why doesn't the game do it in the same way, if the developers must reuse stages? Instead of doing something like using the Col de Turini and St. Bonnet names for very similar stages (when in real life they refer to stages hundreds of kms apart), just have Col de Turini 1 and Col de Turini 2. And make the second pass over the stage different - different weather and a surface that reflects the passage of the rally route. For me, this annoyance reduces the replay value of the game, but I would still recommend it to anybody with an interest in motorsport.","December 30, 2013","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is not a good place to look for any accuracy in how the cars perform or react to different conditions.\n\nPros:\nCareer Mode is nice, relatively fleshed out.\nTrack variation; it doesn't re-use the same level with different portions cut out for a 'different' track layout.\nNeither Good/Bad:\nGraphics are dated, but it's a rally game. They have looked quite good for a while now.\nSlowdowns in the menu whenever the menu overlay is visible. The in-race performance is quite a bit better than this.\nNo different weather conditions on tracks, or night. You're stuck with Dawn, Noon, Dusk and whatever weather they decided to stick on the track.\nCons:\nPhysics feel like you're driving on vaseline, huge lack of feedback from the track(if there's a ditch you'll notice though) and slapstick-like reactions to any sort of collision without any semblance of weight. This lack of semblance of weight carries through to handling as even heavy cars feel like they are merely gliding across the track's surfaces. There is no fighting at the edge of what a car can do.\nSounds seem to be very short samples that noticeably loop. This, along with a lack of differentiation between the bonnet view and driver view's sound levels makes it a chore to listen to. The co-drivers' voices are muffled and distorted on top of this, making them hard to hear at the default levels.\nWhat the Co-driver says does not always match up to the track, or the visual representation of what they're saying. This visual representation is also often wrong, especially for chicanes.\nThere has been no post-release support, and longstanding issues have not been fixed in a patch. Do not expect this to change for anything you experience in-game that is detrimental to your enjoyment of this product.\nThis is my view from having played it. I'd like to like it, but the lack of physicality regarding the cars just makes me cringe.","September 18, 2014","false","1.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

In some respects I think I prefer the original's graphics which aren't quite as colourful perhaps, but look more realistic as a result.\n\nThere is still no weather to speak of, most stages are dry with clear skies - no heavy downpours or snowstorms here, something which the Colin McRae Rally games had since the late 1990s!  I would say that Colin McRae Rally 2005, in fact even Colin McRae Rally 3, had better graphics than this game as well despite being much older.  Unfortunately Codemasters stopped making semi-realistic rally games like that, and went full arcade.  Dirt 1 was still somewhat realistic but by Dirt 3 it dropped any pretense of realism and lost me entirely.  If you hanker after old school rally games like the Colin McRae series then WRC is all that's on offer today.  I would say it's better than Dirt 3 (except graphically) but inferior to the others.\n\nThe car handling seems to have taken a step back since the first WRC game and the cars are now much harder to drift without using the handbrake - even full throttle while steering on ice it is very hard to get the car to drift, perhaps this was dumbed down to make the game 'easier' and more casual but it makes the cars less satisfying to drive for me.  (I did make sure stability assist was turned off.)\n\nThere are 6 stages per country but in my view this is very misleading because essentially, and I'm not exaggerating unfortunately, all stages look and play the same.  You don't have the feeling of progressing across a country but of driving the same tiny part of it, 6 times!  It's really very lazy I'm afraid.  Also the stages have FAR too many corners and not enough straights - the first WRC game and indeed real life WRC isn't like this.  So you are constantly bombarded with corner after corner after corner which becomes monotonous and tiring, and there are none of the exhilarating exciting super fast sections of the first game.\n\nWRC 4 lacks the group B cars of WRC 1, like the RS200 which is disappointing.\n\nOverall the game feels like a budget release, despite its full price tag and I would only recommend getting it when heavily discounted, and even then you probably won't be fully satisfied with it.\n\nI gather that WRC 5 is coming out this year but by new developers.  Hopefully they will put a lot more effort, polish and love into their game than this has had.","April 13, 2015","false","6.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I guess its biggest competitor is DiRT 3, so let's get to it.\n\nWRC 4 is exactly what you'd expect it to be: a game that closely and faithfully follows the workings of the World Rally Championship 2013 season. The tracks are diverse and aplenty and the cars and teams are all in the WRC. They're limited to the 2013 season, which is kind of a bummer, but unlike DiRT 3, you get all of the 2013 cars with all of the liveries, as opposed to just a couple cars per class with a couple more that you have to pay for.\n\nNow you might be thinking, "this all seems very serious, does this mean the cars are super-realistic and hard to control?" And that's just the thing: the driving physics are realistic but easy to control, and you can change around the options to make it even easier. Due to being designed for the console market, it's been made very accessible to be played by everyone; it's like the Forza of rally games. Whereas DiRT 1 - the most realistic modern rally game I've played - is a total buzzkill with its constant grip and lack of a sense of speed, WRC 4 makes it feel like you're going really fast and barely in control, and at any point it can throw in a chicane and hairpin out of nowhere to make you spin even a front-wheel-drive car.\n\nAnd that's not even the best part. The best part is that this game makes you try hard not to crash. In DiRT 3, it doesn't really matter if you crash, because it takes a lot to do any mechanical damage and the weekends are so short that it'll be auto-repaired before long anyway. The first time you skid into a wall in WRC 4, on the other hand, you'll swear to yourself not to let it happen again. Crashing has more consequences in this, and you'll find yourself repairing even the most minor damage in the service park at the end of each day, and--\n\n...Okay, I'm gushing, so I should wrap this up. WRC 4 is a freaking great game and you should buy it if you think DiRT 3 wasn't as good as it could have been, or if you just want something a little exciting.","December 27, 2013","true","10.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ikoopa/recommended/256330/","ikoopa","Iggy Koopa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ikoopa/","86 products in account","It's difficult to really compare WRC 4 to anything; it's so much more realistic than DiRT 3, it's so much more exciting than DiRT 1, it's so much newer than Colin McRae Rally, and, well, I don't have any experience rallying in real life. I guess its biggest competitor is DiRT 3, so let's get to it.\n\nWRC 4 is exactly what you'd expect it to be: a game that closely and faithfully follows the workings of the World Rally Championship 2013 season. The tracks are diverse and aplenty and the cars and teams are all in the WRC. They're limited to the 2013 season, which is kind of a bummer, but unlike DiRT 3, you get all of the 2013 cars with all of the liveries, as opposed to just a couple cars per class with a couple more that you have to pay for.\n\nNow you might be thinking, "this all seems very serious, does this mean the cars are super-realistic and hard to control?" And that's just the thing: the driving physics are realistic but easy to control, and you can change around the options to make it even easier. Due to being designed for the console market, it's been made very accessible to be played by everyone; it's like the Forza of rally games. Whereas DiRT 1 - the most realistic modern rally game I've played - is a total buzzkill with its constant grip and lack of a sense of speed, WRC 4 makes it feel like you're going really fast and barely in control, and at any point it can throw in a chicane and hairpin out of nowhere to make you spin even a front-wheel-drive car.\n\nAnd that's not even the best part. The best part is that this game makes you try hard not to crash. In DiRT 3, it doesn't really matter if you crash, because it takes a lot to do any mechanical damage and the weekends are so short that it'll be auto-repaired before long anyway. The first time you skid into a wall in WRC 4, on the other hand, you'll swear to yourself not to let it happen again. Crashing has more consequences in this, and you'll find yourself repairing even the most minor damage in the service park at the end of each day, and--\n\n...Okay, I'm gushing, so I should wrap this up. WRC 4 is a freaking great game and you should buy it if you think DiRT 3 wasn't as good as it could have been, or if you just want something a little exciting.","December 27, 2013","true","10.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Why? Because it is the only modern WRC game available.\n\nThere is a TON that could be improved in the game, but it is a decent rally game. By far the worst thing is the wheel issues. I have gotten my DF GT working OK, but there are major issues.\n\nI have to disagree with people who don't think the handling is realistic. It is actually a very good balance between realsim and arcade handling. The different road surfaces are very noticeable giving each rally it's unique challenges.\n\nSo if you love the WRC then you probably already own this game. It is only worth about 20$ because it isn't a super polished AAA title, while it is also not a 5$ bin budget title.","April 24, 2014","true","8.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Well I changed the amount of voices and the problem has not happened since. Anyway the game itself is not bad, but not amazing.\nIt has good but not great graphics, the presentation feels a little sparse and a little odd but thats my opinion and does not detract from the game. The car handling is the area I'm not absolutely sure about. For instance, driving on Swedens snow covered and narrow routes, I never felt like the car was out of control, or was likely to be. I won the first 3 rallies in my career and never once crashed seriously or had any retirements or wrecks. At the same time the game plays well and some of the torturous routes leave you feeling satisfied when you cross the line intact.\nSo it gives me mixed feelings overall, its fun to play and can be a challenge, at the same time perhaps the car handling makes the game a little easy.","June 7, 2014","true","20.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Its not your flashy dirt 3 game which is good because i thought those games were overrated with there 3 level rally modes.... it has all newer model rally cars which is awesome to drive those, The only complaint i have is i wish they added more rally vehicles focus, old mini, wrx, honda, old skoda years stuff like that. The stages and countries are visual better with rain/mud/dust/snow/water/grass/tarmac effect, now the crowd has horns and takes pictures as you drive by and the engine sounds like its running 300 horses with the backfiring and turbo spooling affect.

I'd just come from DiRT 3 wanting longer tracks to keep me playing rather than navigating menu's every 5 minutes. I love DiRT 3 don't get me wrong, it's one of my favourite racing games on the PC. In my opinion it does few things better than this game. Car choice, out of car camera (specifically sense of speed using this camera) and sounds. The reason I didn't enjoy this game to start was the animation of the car seems off. There is no sense of speed when using an out of car camera, this really put me off wanting to play. I decided to push through though and experiment with the different cameras. Cockpit view has saved this game for me. The sense of speed is there and it has immediately become fun to play. The handling feels semi-realistic at most, but is certainly more so than the DiRT titles.\n\nGraphics -4/5\nSound - 4/5\nGameplay - 4.5/5\n\nTL:DR - If you love the out of car camera, then this game may not be for you.","February 13, 2014","true","4.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It doesn't. At all. It's passable for 2005, but in 2013 I expected a little more, and considering how dull and uninteresting the game appears visually, my PC kicks out volumes of heat when playing it - perhaps that's due to not using the game's v-sync option which locks the frame-rate at an absurd and choppy 30FPS. It's that, screen-tearing or using a third-party tool to force v-sync. Again, 2013 - £24.99.\n\nAt least the game works, until it hangs on menu screens, or until upon loading a stage it goes deadly silent unless you're willing to exit out and start it up again. A couple of bugs, we can look past those.\n\nThe gameplay, though, is where it counts, and for WRC 4, where it fails further. There is no satisfaction to be found here. In a rally we have six stages, most of which are the same stage, just with different start/finish lines, and all of which are drab and unappealing. The driving gives no palpable sensation of the road you're on, the jumps are floaty, the layouts are packed with hairpins (I hope you like the sound of the rev-limiter), your co-driver bleats monotonous directions at you, and irritatingly, loves to comment when you can't pick the road texture out from the not-road texture and drive into things: "whoa, careful". 2013. £24.99.\n\nBut, perhaps you really love the WRC and your options are limited to pretty much this or, at a leap, Dirt 3. This is better than nothing, right? It isn't. It isn't at all. Go sit in a puddle and I guarantee you'll have a better time. I know Dirt 3 has "Gymkhana" which is as detestable as forcing "drifting" into racing games, but the Trail Blazing events make up for it. Whilst Dirt 3 isn't a good game, it has a few really enjoyable moments, whereas WRC 4 is a frustration throughout.","July 30, 2014","false","3.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I had quite a lot of fun with WRC2 a few years ago, hoping that this would continue on it. Well, and that is exactly what it does, and not in a positive way. It is common that wen developers get the hang of a license, they improve on it, but not with Milestone!\n\nGraphics are pretty bad, they would be doable in 2007-2008, but we are quite a few years past that. The game literally has no graphic settings apart from V-Sync, FXAA and resolution and there are very few settings outside of that as well. To make matters worse this game is performing like absolute crap and is capped at 30FPS.\nI also had borders on my 1680x1050 resolution, I mean, seriously? I can understand it in videos because of the way they are rendered but i was having those borders in the actual game itself.\n\nThe menus look rather cheap and with me the background videos werent playing properly. Could be my graphics card, but still, the first time I actually had issues with videos not playing properly.\n\nAnd then we get to setting up a driver. I don't know what they are thinking over at Milestone but it is very common to have a last name of more than 9 letters. It's sad that in 2013, game devs(only Milestone, apparently) are still not adapting to longer text boxes. Seriously, even old games had text boxes to 16 characters, but not with Milestone! This small thing just shows the abysmal quality of the game engine.\n\nDriving physics are doable and there is enough in terms of setup.\n\nSounds is bad, but better than the average game. I don't know what they did with the Co-Driver, though, but I wouldn't call it good.\n\nThe stages seem okay, although I seem to be getting a lot of the same parts. It seems like they have just reused the same parts over and over again.\n\nThe pacenotes are pretty bad and are hardly ever correct, I've come across so many errors and inconsistencies in the pacenotes that there is very little point in actually listening to them.\n\nAnd if you are thinking of making an error and rolling down a cliff, something that is always a danger in real world WRC, don't worry, the game will reset you before you're actually falling down!\n\nThis game is pretty abbysmal and way, way behind in tech.

You can't use your mouse despite the curser being presented ingame.\nThe keys you need in the menus are at times awkward (enter to select and space to activate? the opposite of most games). Sometimes you need to press odd, nonconfigurable buttons to do things. Most things work with arrow keys, but then you need to find F2 all of a sudden etc.\nThere's damage in the game, but it doesn't properly work. Sometimes you can race into a wall at 100km/h and just drive on without damage. Also damage doesn't seem very pronounced while driving.\nYou have to select your manager, but whom you take seem not to matter, and they're not voice acted and just leave standard template messages without emotion. So basically you just pick the name to fill into the templates.\nSpeaking of templates - during loadscreens there are 'interviews' with other players. However they have very few lines to say, and these are even shared between different opponents, so you get bored of em before you've completed your second rally.\nThere's also a reputation system in place to manage which things you've got access to, but even when you win all stages you're being sent along a very linear path without any true freedom of choice.\nAfter a rally you're presented with a newspaper detailing what's going on in the four different classes available. However sometimes when you're looking at a class other than the one you're in, the template will beep up and just display something like %%S01_AI2_Points%% Points ahead of %%S01_AI3_Name%% etc.\nThe text describing the teams doesn't seem to have been proofread or using templates that make it obsolete. I noticed one of the WRC2 teams was described as driving a Subaru, but the car depicted was a Mitsubishi.\nThe steam achievements seem to have been an afterthought. You get an achievement for doing the most mundane things, like opening your repair screen. But you don't get any for doing extraordinary things. I tried to drive the Spain WRC Junior rally without using repairs or rewinds, and won. But nothing popped up other than the one for completing the rally.\nSpeaking of rewind. There's that in the game, as expected in this day and age. But if you rewind and keep the brake button down, you'll not brake, you'll actually reverse. I'm assuming that's a bug.\nAnd now we're at bugs, I don't think they've cared about any that didn't crash the game. The water animation for water patches, at least in mexico, are sometimes running the wrong way, making water seem to go uphill. According to Newton, this isn't meant to be.\nEvery time you complete a special stage (which seems to be the only part of rally being in the lackluster career mode), you get an error message about uploading your stats. I haven't found a way for it to stop trying to upload my data somewhere I haven't given consent to yet.\nI'm sure with a little bit of tweaking, this could've been a good game, but considering it came up last year and I still find all those errors, they can't be bothered doing so. If the game's sold at 2€ or so, try it out, but expect an indie game, not a professional release by a well funded publisher.\n\nThe game isn't terrible, but if this was a codemasters product, it'd not have been released.","July 26, 2014","false","7.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

If you wanted to play a proper rally simulation, then you'd look no further than Richard Burns Rally which will test your ability to even drive along a straight line for more than a couple of seconds.\n\nSo where does that leave WRC 4 exactly?\n\nWell Codemasters have had years of experience creating games that hit the right balance between gameplay/playability and realism (including the likes of TOCA and even Micro Machines), however WRC 4 seems to want to accelerate in a direction that facilitates neither of these core features; obviously content in the hopes that the WRC license alone would be enough to carry it through. Well it doesn't work I'm afraid.\n\nAlso throw into the mix the weird sound effects which sound 'tinny' due to its poor quality and implementation, and what you're left with is a game that couldn't possibly be recommended to anyone.","August 8, 2014","false","8.6"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","3"

Cannot fault anything with this game yet I expected the graphics to be better. The quality in the photos on the store page are as high as they would be as you cannot adjust the quality to low or high. This isn't an issue anyway, for me at least.\n\nThe gameplay is great. I personally play this game with a pad and the controls are excellent. The cars reacts like it should, in different types of environments and elements.\n\nThere is five different levels of AI (1 to 5) such as 1 as really dumb AI to 5 as Pro - Professional. (I'm playing with 2nd level at the moment which seem to be "normal" difficulty but I kept winning in the first place so it is getting boring however after this season I'm doing is finished, I will increase it to 3).\n\nThere is no support for this game if there happen to be an issue but luckily for me, there's no issues for me with my pc SO FAR.\n\nOverall, I'd say 9/10.","December 29, 2013","true","6.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Works straight away with Xbox 360 controller, and the car handles exactly as you'd expect it to.   So in my opinion, this is a real fun pleasurable game to play.  The car models acquire damage nicely and are very well detalied.  After a few hours play I've noticed a few definite co-driver instruction errors, although this is nothing major and almost adds to the reality, in that co-drivers probably do make the occasional mistake!  Overall I can't fault this game, as the career mode isn't full of time-consuming cringe-worthy cut-scenes.  Continous rallying over many stages straight away :-)  If you want a Rally game, this is without a doubt the one to buy!\n\n*edit: forgot to mention the stages are real axcellent also - great variations on terrain and surfaces...","June 25, 2014","true","17.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

My impressions at this time:\nThe graphics is great in most parts / tracks of the game that I went along, although, they seem to look very similar, perhaps this is meant to be that way.\nHandling, (I hate to admit, I drive with a lot of driving support) is decent and I want to keep on going, unlike with other racing simulator that are so difficult to get used to initially and really wants you to throw the towel early, since you are mostly off the track than on it. This is not the case with the setting I am using right now.  I still have to try other, more realistic settings. Lets face it, we all need a little sense of achievement first.\nThe sound is a little on the weak side, in particular the engine sound. No matter which way I look (listen) to it, it reminds me (with all cars), a bit of the same lawnmower motor. In the 60's, 70's and 80's there was a small dutch car the "DAF". It had the constant torque automatic belt transmission. That's what the cars in this game sound like. The only time it sounds somewhat different is when you get off the accellerator or the engine idles.\nDespite the fact, that the sound (engine) sorry to say, sucks, the game still has quite a few capitivating features.","December 20, 2014","true","20.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Despite the mixed reviews its a solid game, esp if u can get a sale. Its prob not quite as good as Dirt 3, but with my gamepad (i don't go all out with a wheel lol) that and GRID (street racing) seem like DRUNK Driving Simulators of just trying to stay straight and not bounce off walls like ping pong with-every tap of direction on the controller sending them flying and hard to not oversteer, despite option adjustments!  Its a good mix or realistic (of course can't go full throttle all the time) and playable. Dirt - I can drive a real car way better or at least keep it stright. I like the handling and all the tight turns-rather than just trying to fight to stay straight as I may have mentioned. The graphics are decent, some recycled parts of tracks and would be good to have the option for some more cars to race against, rather than feel like just racing the track. 7/10, hardcore race fans may disagree\n\nVegan for Animals\nMeatvideo.com - MUST SEE factory-farms","April 14, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PsychicParrot/recommended/256330/","PsychicParrot","PsychicParrot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PsychicParrot/","721 products in account","I'm changing my review. I've been playing WRC5 (on xbox) and after playing that, I really appreciate this game a lot more. WRC4 is way better than the all new WRC5!\n\nFirst up, this isn't Dirt Rally. If you want a super-realistic rally experience go and buy that and don't look back. If you're looking for arcade rally, this is the best you'll find. It's got a lot of stages, plenty of official cars and drivers and nicer looking environments than WRC5.\n\nIt's got real 'one more go' appeal.. you may, if you're anything like me, aim to stop playing at 9pm and not notice as 1am rolls by and you're still rallying. It's fun, addictive and fast.\n\nBUT.. there is a but. The bugs...\n\nNow that we have refunds on Steam, if you're after an arcadey rally game you should try this regardless of its biggest bug, the sound problem. That is, myself and quite a few others experienced a sound problem where the sound only worked for one rally stage, then it broke and you have to restart the game.. but if you find that this sound issue happens to you, you can just refund it and be no worse off. You'll know before the 2 hours are up whether or not your system is affected by it. Play a few stages and see if it breaks. If not, you're good.\n\nIt's disappointing that the devs don't communicate with anyone, or that they didn't patch this game (I think we only got 1 or 2 patches at the most despite bugs) but it's such a good game that it really is a struggle for me to know whether to recommend it or not. I love playing it.\n\nIt's also disappointing that the online leaderboards don't work at all. You just get an error at the end of every stage telling you the game can't access scores or something. This should have been fixed. In fact, why aren't they using the Steam API like everyone else!???!!\n\nI believe this is still the best arcadey pure rally game we have (second would be probably have to be Dirt 3, of course, but you have to put up with all that other rubbish to get to the rally stuff).. I'd say it's even better than Seb Loeb, for arcade rally fun. This doesn't have rallycross, though. If you want that, get Seb Loeb or Dirt Rally instead.\n\nI've played this game mostly with an xbox controller, but my Logitech G27 works great with it and it's a fun drive in 3rd person or 1st person views. If you have a different wheel to the G27, though, it's hard to know whether or not it will work. Give it a shot and see but remember the refund policy because this game won't be seeing any patches in the future.\n\nThe downside is that the publishers don't seem to care about its customers and there are bugs that should have been fixed. BUT I've loved playing it.. so give it a go but be sure not to play more than 2 hours if that sound problem occurs because it will never get fixed. Just refund it if you hit this problem. If not, enjoy a great arcade rally game that's wayy better than the big mess that is WRC5.","August 16, 2014","true","33.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not simulation you will expect from Richard Burns Rally or DiRT: Rally, but this game can be very enjoyable if you're just willing to play a rally game.\n\nI will admit this though, Milestone isn't my favorite game developer when it comes to WRC but that being said I still like what they do though it isn't up to that level of simulation though this game was not approached to simulation but more of that casual feel to it. Would I recommend it though? Hard to say. I like their WRC games I wouldn't say I love them though, they're just simply a good game. No more no less.
