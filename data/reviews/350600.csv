The game is punishing, yet fair and has nearly flawless level design.  You're forced to make choices like "Do I run through the lazers to save time, sacrificing half my health in the process?" or "Do I slowly clear this room of turrets, or do I make a break for it, hoping none of them finish me off?".  The game is even fair when you die, there's no annoying death animation, you just get a game over screen and a slow-mo first person view of your death so you can see exactly how you screwed up, and it only takes 3 seconds to go from death to retrying the level.   The levels don't have any BS like hidden turrets or enemies that can hit you but not vice versa, it's designed for you to go as fast as possible while killing as fast as possible.  Currently, there's only about a dozen or so people on the leaderboards on the harder levels, which is a shame.  The amount of content already available for such an early in development game is astonishing, and the music is fantastic.  The best way for me to describe this game is as if Super Meat Boy were an FPS.","July 22, 2015","true","5.9"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","33","36","3","0"

Throw the player into maps or "courses" and let them race to the finish all why eliminating targets and keeping their health bar above 0. The real BIOS expereince begins when you attempt to perfect any given course. It becomes a mashocistic effort, one that will see coutnless retries and tweaks to your strategy. You're ranked after every match based on your score and completion time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/russianlot/recommended/350600/","russianlot","Sir Russianlot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/russianlot/","768 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI usually don't buy Early Access games. Reasons are plenty and some of you have probably exprerienced some of them yourself, so I'm not going to go deep into that.\nThis game however (I'm happy to admit), proved me wrong.\nAs always, for those who like their reviews short - TL;DR is at the bottom\n\nLet's dive in to positives:  1.  BIOS is as simple as a brick yet very deep at the same time. It tries to be a 90's old school hardcore no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t shooter and it plays and feels like one. It's very easy to pick up and play but quite hard to really master.\n2.  There is no story to speak of, just you, Finish line, enemies in between and a timer. Based on your success, you'll be rewarded with one of the 4 possible medals be it bronze or platinum. Devs are talking about implementing some kind of narrative elements to it, so some kind of story could be available later. #storymodeconfirmed (ha ha)\n3.  There are 21 challenges and 3 anomalies spread across 8 different environments to run & gun through. Environments vary from industrial complex, training facility, subway tunnels, ports and parking spots. Maps are short in length but highly replayable, well made and balanced.\nEnemy placement is great. You actually have to learn and memorize their placements and attacks to succeed, so when you die, it's usually your own fault and not some cheap enemy spawn behind your back.\n4.  To counter this, BIOS needs tight and responsible controls, and they are. Mouse controls felt weird to begin with, but some fiddling in settings helped. Keys are few, and completely rebindable to your preference.\n5.  Graphics are nothing groundbreaking but they do their job pretty well. Lighting and explosions looks great and some environments are destructible, even though I can honestly say that you'll probably be too busy to notice since game is so fast paced. I know I was. There is a lot of graphic settings you can fiddle with to make it work.\n6.  Sounds and music are superb. Guns sounds really great and punchy, while music is kickass and fits the setting and theme well in my opinion.\n7.  BIOS is also surprisingly very well optimized and runs smooth as butter on my relatively old PC. I have played it for a few hours and except for a few FPS drops on 1 anomaly map, haven't experienced any bugs or glitches.\n\nNow with the negatives, but remember, this is Early Access, so things could be changed in the next update:  1.  There are only 3 guns (SCAR, M4 and AK with some variations) in this game and they feel completely the same (except SCAR have 20 round mag while M4/AK has 30). At least they did for me.\nYou also can't change your loadout since guns are tied to specific maps. Like this M4? Can't have it, since this map only spawn you with AK!\n2.  Animations are simple and feels a bit unfinished.\n3.  As said before, maps are small, short and can be completed in 2- max 10 min each, with heavy emphasis on replayability.\nIf you're not into that kind of thing, you'll run through it in 1 hour flat and be disappointed.\n4.  This game is also pretty challenging, as in you die really fast if you stay in one place for more than 2 seconds. To be honest, this game is built for mostly hardcore players, so it's not for everyone.\nYet I personally think that some enemies need few damage tweaks, since some places are extremely hard, because enemies melt you before you even can react to their presence.\n\nTL;DR and/or conclusion: BIOS is a very fun and addictive game, and I'm having a blast playing it.\nIt's fast, it's challenging and it runs extremely well for an Early Access title. It is at the moment a little bit low on features but, developers seem dedicated and more content is in the works, like progression system, guns, maps, coop etc.\n\nHopefully, full release will be even better, more action packed and even more enjoyable. I almost can't wait :)","December 23, 2015","true","2.2"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","17","21","0","2"

I was hesitant because of it being EA even with the sale price of $12, but I'm definitly glad I picked it up.\n\nPros\n+ Solid Gunplay. In the way they handle, sound, and the shots feel like they've got a good amount of weight to them.\n+ Graphics are really well done and I would say look to be fairly on par with most AAA shooters.\n+ Music fits the frantic nature of the game style.\n+ Quick reset when you complete a match or die is great when you're powering through trying to get the fastest time.\n+ The levels are very well designed and thought out. Also, the variety of the level themes is very nice and makes each one very distinct and have its own feel.\n\nCons (with this being EA, most of these are suggestions that could be fixed before the actual release)\n- The name... BIOS? More like, "hardest to Google game title EVER!" Searching for this online is near impossible and brings up almost entirely unrelated results. Obiviously they can't change it at this point, but geez, whose idea was this?\n- The menu. I don't know, it just looks ugly to me. Having all of the options up at the top is something I've mostly only seen in F2P games. Needs to be rearranged and polished.\n- No option to change the color of your crosshair. Seeing how it's white and all the enemies are white as well, it's a bit hard to keep track of sometimes.\n- Your character sometimes slides when you're trying to stop or change direction, usually when strafing. I've noticed this only seems to happen in some levels, like the one with all the freight containers.\n\nThere are other things I could mention (would be nice to have a rewards/progression system, story, extra content, etc...)but from what I've heard they're working on it. Overall though, great job guys! I look forward to playing more and seeing what is in the future for this refreshing twist to a genre that really needed something new.","July 25, 2015","true","2.8"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

There are currently three gamemodes, Strike, Anamoly, and Coop. The game is a test of speed and skill as you try to complete each level as fast as you can to earn higher medals. The levels aren't a walk in the park either, they are all very challenging, and if you don't have the patience to repeatedly play levels over and over to get the highest medal, don't buy this.\n\nThe graphics are very nice. They are above average for a game like this, and compliment it nicely. The game has many graphics options which affect the performance. On a mid-range machine on high settings, I get around 50-60 fps. No complaints there.\n\nThe level designs are very cool and are part of the reason the game is so challenging. The levels are a decent size, but usually very narrow, or make you go in a narrow path. The constrictive environment makes the game more difficult, and I personally really like this idea.\n\nStrike involves levels with robotic-looking enemies with guns and turrets. You have to run through the level as quick as you can without dying. Pretty straightforward, but can be difficult.\n\nAnamoly is my personal favorite, but unfortunately doesn't have nearly as many levels as Strike. You have to run through the constrictive environments as quick as you can while trying to fight through a horde of zombies. Difficult, but fun, and the zombies are very cool.\n\nI have not been able to test Coop due to the lack of players. Will update when I try it.\n\nThe developers seem devoted to the game, and I have no problem giving them 15 bucks for this game, it's worth it. They are committed to making the game the best it can be, and appreciate feedback. Updates aren't too far apart from each other, and add a decent amount of content. This game has a lot of potential, and the developers know that.\n\nThings that I think would be great for this game:\nA co-op zombie mode, where you fight waves of zombies until your team dies. I would personally love to see this.\nSteam Workshop to allow people can share levels.\nMap editor, a tool to create and share custom levels via Steam Workshop.\nCustom gamemodes, it'd be cool for this game to be able to have user-created gamemodes like Garry's Mod.\nCampaign? Not sure if there are plans for this or not, but it would be cool to have a story driven campaign mode for this game.\nWeapon customization, weapon and health pickups on maps, and explosive weapons (RPGs, grenades).\n\nOverall this game is great, and if you want to support it in its alpha stage, then buy it.","January 15","true","1.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Its kick ♥♥♥!\n+ Well put together visuals. With both style and purpose.\n+ Gameplay. Its fast, its furious, its frantic, its 90s arena shooter in modern clothes.\n+ A fun challenge.\n\nThe bad parts are:\n- Some distracting visual elements. Such as the gun being way to big. And hazards blend too much in with the more organic maps, making it hard to spot dangers and avoid them.\n- Bullets are either hitscan or very fast, dodging them is impossible (rockets and grenades are dodgable).\n\n\nIt has plenty of options in the options menu, but theres no clear indication to what does what.\nSome options should not be clumped together, and some should have a "x2", "x4" and what not, instead of "low", "medium" and "high" option (such as the AntiAliasing option). And no Anisotropic filtering option? What?\nTheres also no way of removing keybindings. But they allow alternative keybindings, so thats good.\n\nAll in all its on a good path, I think.\nRecommended.\nCheers.\n\n***\nHad to edit a few errors ;)","August 1, 2015","true","0.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Seems it pays off supporting you guys with ReROLL!\n\nAbout BIOS... harsh, many trys and retrys until you are fast enough to complete a level. It's not really my kind of game usually but I do find the concept quite interesting. I do say the game is quite punishing and it's all a matter of proper balance between running, shooting and taking cover, in a timely fashion... and knowing the level layout! Or maybe I need more beers to shoot straight?\n\nAs a game still in development, the visuals are quite impressive. Unreal Engine 4 really shines and for an Early Access game, BIOS has some good potential and will surely find a proper market for it's demanding gameplay. The game feels like a Mirror's Edge meet Portal setting (evil turrets!), minus the parkour and "portal gun". You do have an assault rifle and the way you go through levels reminds me of some map challenge in Mirror's Edge.\n\nI recommend this title for anyone looking up for a challenge!\nAlthough, I am more interested in PIXYUL's other title in development (ReROLL) but this is a cool game to improve your skills for every challenge seekers! Oh and by the way, awesome gesture you did here developers with the free gift; I truly appreciate it!\n\nAs for ReROLL, take your time! It seems so promising that I can truly wait some more before playing your sweet game!\n\nSIDENOTE:I kept experiencing "game crashes" each time I tried to launch the game. After running a diagnostig from Daylight game, Unreal Engine 4 tool, I got to find intriguing results. It turned out that culprit, the application "TEAMVIEWER" was causing this shady issue but that seem to happen on every Unreal Engine 4 games.

This game forces you to make quick decisions in tough spots, while moving nonstop through the level as fast as possible. The objective of each level is to complete the level as fast as possible, you need to run fast while also destroying fast. The level deisgn is amazing and the quality is simply remarkable. The music really gets you hyped which allows you to perform better, there are no hidden turrets or enemies that are impossibler to destroy which allows for an even more exciting experience. There are no annoying cutscenes when beginning a level, or time consuming death animations you are forced to watch, it's just a simple screen that pops up after your health reaches zero and everything goes into slo-mo in the background, which allows you to see where you messed up. It literally takes one click to restart the level without delay.

Beautiful with UE4 engine, but brutal. The whole goal and idea behind this is to get pass the hard develop strategi maps and get to the finish line in a short amount of time. We have from normal to extreme mode, where the maps are different with different weapons. It gives a decent challenge to the player to remember the AI's spot in the maps while running with a different weapon the moste of the time.\n\nI have to admit, that this is not my cup of tea because i miss the shoot-a-player feeling, but comparing it to other time-based games, then it's just different with a FPS mode. So if you like singleplayer time-based fps games, AI's and machines on walls with either machineguns, laser, rockets, with the hardcore UE4 engine that makes the game beautiful, then this game is for you.\n\nHere is a demo:\nhttp://www.twitch.tv/theearlyaccess/v/8603902","July 26, 2015","true","1.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/enixe/recommended/350600/","enixe","Enix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/enixe/","174 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBIOS is a first person shooter (FPS) with racing elements. Complete a course from start to finish as fast as possible by dodging lasers, obstacles and multiple stationary and mobile enemies. The game is currently in early access (EA) and may be subject to change, I will give a report of my experience only at the current time (25th December, 2015).\n\nDesign & ArtDesign of the game is solid. Menu is clear, graphics are above average. Weapons and emenies are detailed enough. If you take a closer look though, you'll start noticing bland environments (container levels... really?) plus washed-out textures. Fortunatly, BIOS is not here to be a graphical masterpiece, you are set in a virtual reality setting, visuals do not need to be highly appealing. For what the games main focus is (its gameplay), BIOS is doing its deeds in terms of graphics.\n\nControlsThe game is controlled by input via keyboard and mouse. If you played any FPS in the last century, you will have no problems whatsoever. Sadly, no controller support exists until the day of writing this review.\n\nSound and MusicBIOS features a nice electronic soundtrack which makes you feel engaged and pumped for its gameplay. Musical backdrop has been selected wisely and never sounds enervating at a time.\n\nGuns, enemies and environmental sound effects seem standard and solid. Overall, the sound of BIOS feels fitting for its virtual reality setting (techy and electronic).\n\nGameplayThe game revolves around one simple goal: Reach the end of the course as fast as possible. Shoot your way through or dodge and run, it is your choice.\n\nBIOS lives through its trial-and-error principle, you need to try courses multiple times in order to find the fastest way to the exit. 'Do I really need to shoot this enemy? Can't I just go around him? Is he doing too much damage? Am I too exposed if I take this way?' The game wants you to remember its courses, it wants your muscle memory to work. Remember where chokepoints and enemies are, build patterns to move and remember them. Find pauses where reloading will not hinder your advancement. Leaderboards to compare your times on different courses are included. Trials are sorted by difficulty.\n\nClassic zero to hundred healthbar with a slight autoheal included (probably one health per second). You can take a fair share of damage but not heal so fast, stopping you from simple run & dodge. Nice!\n\nNext to the standard time-trial courses, you can also choose to do a zombie-course. Clear an area full of zombies and reach the end of the course as fast as possible.\n\nWeakpointsWith the premise of fastest completion time comes great limitation: Tubular levels. Now I understand, that these need to be in order to make it fair for everyone (shortcuts would help those who played longer) but with tubular environments and multiple tries to complete said designed courses eventually comes boredom, at least in my opinion.\n\nBIOS makes one thing right in terms of animations: Sprinting. It feels good and realistic. Unfortunatly, and everything following is what ultimately ruined the game for me, all other movements feel off, weird or outright wrong, strafing being the worst.  I cannot turn my character precisely at a hairpin curve. Mouse accelerration seems to be missing, since upping my sensitivity did not make the problem go away. Jumping feels lifeless, I cannot tell if I made it over a floor laser safely by guessing my position. Aiming is just the same, thanks to the weird mouse behaviour. I crashed into walls more often then I would have liked to (don't get me wrong, I played multiple FPS before and they had great movement controls).\n\nNo tutorial. This is a BIG letdown. In a genre, which I never played before, yet is not that new, I need to have the option to get adjusted to the controls, because the controls are a BIG PART of how fast I can complete a course. Simply throwing me into the first normal difficulty mission will NOT do. I cannot figure, why a 'Zombiemode' had made it into the game even BEFORE a tutorial was added in. Completely unbelievable.\n\nOh yeah, also: Zombies. I hate them. They are overused and old. I do not want them in this game, and I think the game does not need them, they feel like they just need to be there, because... zombies.\n\nConcluding ThoughtsI gave BIOS a hard time and I'm sorry for that, because I liked the games core idea.\n\nThe premise is completely awesome, I was drawn in the second I saw the trailer: 'Cool, a FPS that doesn't focus on multiplayer gameplay. Count me in!' But I figured I may have bought this game out of the wrong intentions, thinking that BIOS focuses less on multiplayer FPS aspects, yet I came to the conclusion, that the game is in its core a racing game with shooting elements. Like I said, the controls are the aspect that ruined the experience for me. If there is no precise aiming and comprehensible movement, I can't have fun with BIOS, which ultimately relies on exactly these functions. No recommendation at the current time, even if it is early access. I expect controls to be comprehensible, even in early access. Don't forget: EA means, the games CORE FUNCTIONS stand completed! Just wait for some development, better input and controller support and you may have my recommendation.","December 29, 2015","false","0.3"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","0"

Also the reason I bought it was because of it said FPS & Competitive which I love when they are put together properly but this is just something strange like it seems like a weird idea they had (Their thoughts): Hey let's make a "Competitive" game where they play for spaces in the leaderboard! ffs what where they thinking as soon as there comes hacks for this then it would be a nightmare! A f*cking nightmare! Like then people couldn't tell which one is real and which one is faked which defeats the purpose of having it in the first place! and then when their only game mode is gone then there is nothing else to play and who wants to spend 10+ hours competing against their friend in a game where they can only see each others stats and names but nothing else! But I see where they are coming from but they are trying to take something from Trials and putting it into the FPS genre or taking Harm's Way or whatever that 360 game was called by Doritos but without the multiplayer! Also the feel of having to run till you have to turn makes it feel like a racing game! Also the running which I just mentioned doesn't feel like running since there is no head bob at all like try playing for example Minecraft without it because to me it just doesn't feel like running though (though) the gun play feels solid and the movement seems standard but just not put into the proper environment but in conclusion it feels very lonely since you have not the smallest amount of sign of multiplayer currently\nBut yeah that is my feelings about the game though I am going to play some more when they add some but till then... Adios BIOS\n\nPros:\nAlright soundtrack\nGreat graphics\nFeels responsive\nEarly access (Great for this because lacking in content)\nCons:\nNo modding\nNo multiplayer\nNo customization\nNo support for the workshop\netc.","January 1","true","1.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I regret it.\n\nEven discounted to $8 there isn't enough content here to call it a wise investment. Two guns, a handful of identical levels, and two modes, neither of which are very fun.\n\nAnd really that's it: the core mechanic is . . . boring. The run, shoot, run, die repeat system is tedious to play. And really, it was all there in the trailers. Watch the videos on loop, and its the exact same sensation as playing the game.  I feel like an idiot for spending my money on this.","November 26, 2015","false","0.6"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","2"

But devs still haven't even decided which direction to take. The game is very (VERY) shallow experience - you shoot things with red light or humanoid (nothing has AI, they just shoot at you), and press 'sprint' in between. In the end it's a memory game: you run again and again trying to memorise where to shoot.\nI bought the game because devs go into high risk territory of trying something relatively fresh. I wish it will evolve in something good, but right now it isn't promising and my hopes are very low - devs doesn't seem to have any idea what they are trying to actually do. They should either focus on racing part and take hints from racing games, or focus on actual scoring system and fps mechanics and take hints from fps games. Score-attack shooter sounds better to me than time-attack runner with guns though.\n\nWant real high octane shooter with speed? Buy The Club and thank me later. And developers should too.","July 26, 2015","false","3.5"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","6","15","0","2"

Movement is kinda slowish especailly for a game that  is a "racing first person shooter", you have to have patience and remember where all the turrets and a good aim if you want to complete a map in a decent time, but I can not be bothered to do so, since there is no motivation in doing so or satisfaction since the game is dull any how. I'am hoping to get a refund, I was hoping for some fast adrenaline pumping action in short busts, but all I found is a dull hollow generic fps that you will have to have a great amount of patience with.","June 5, 2015","false","0.4"," 19 of 49 people (39%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","39","19","49","0","6"

There are no interesting mechanics, it is literally just run and shoot (jump over a barrier sometimes!) where the shooting aspect completely kills any momentum in the racing part of the game.\nI know! FPS games ARE just running and shooting, but they usually have more to them than this. MAYBE I'm just bad at it, but I really like fast paced FPS games (Q3A, inMomentum etc) and this isn't doing it for me. Will be the first game I get a refund on, I may return to it if it looks drastically different out of Early Access.\n\nYes I am aware that I've not played this much, but maybe there's a reason for that. :^)","June 4, 2015","false","0.7"," 23 of 68 people (34%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","34","23","68","2","17"
