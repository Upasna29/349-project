However, unlike Puzzle Quest, Legend of Fae is...well, easy. I seem to be done with the tutorial parts and have entered the actual meat of the game. You're given an option between two difficulties, easy and hard. I picked hard. Thus far, everything has been an absolute pushover. Each level has an "expert" bonus target for completing it in a certain time and with a certain score, and I've been able to amply reach both goals on every level, often doubling the score and halving the time.\n\nNot to say it hasn't been fun. It has. I'm just also waiting for my HP bar to dip below 90%, so that I actually need to heal myself.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThird impression: First impression still holds.\n\nThe game's difficulty has started noticably ramping up. It's still nowhere near "too hard", though I have begun to miss score and/or time goals by smallish margins. Perhaps I spoke too soon on the too easy part.\n\nThere's also a bonus boss I unlocked a while back.

The artstyle is appealing, you might even call it cute, and a match 3 game with combat sounds like it might be a fun time.\n\nAs it turns out, Legend of Fae is pretty good!\nIt is a match 3 game with combat, as I mentioned earlier, where you match gems(orbs?) of an element (Fire, Water, Wind and Earth) to defeat enemies. The enemies can also have elemental affinities so you can't just cast whatever at an enemy and get by. There's also an upgrade system where you can choose from better elemental attacks, combo spells and summons. You can also respec your skill tree if you want to try something different. There's a surprising amount of depth and different ways to play, which is nice.\n\nI played the game on Hard and it's worth noting that near the end of the game it gets HARD. If you aren't in total control of what's going on in the combat in the later levels you will drop so quickly that it's kind of frustrating. I also ran into a couple of points where I had to respec several times because it felt like the skills I had just weren't enough. It is a puzzle game (kind of) so you can "figure it out" in a sense.\n\nThe story is also pretty interesting, it definitely goes some places over the course of the game that I didn't really expect it to. If there were somehow a sequel that was a continuation of the events of this game (as unlikely as that may be) I'd be on it from day one.\n\nSo yeah, if you want a little lite-RPG in your gem matching escapades then you should probably pick this up. Maybe stick to casual mode if you don't want to have too hard of a time in the combat.","July 9, 2015","true","13.6"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

This can remind of bejeweled or any games using the same gameplay, but with more options. You also have to fight monsters using the attacks you gain by putting elements together (a line or goup of 3 or more tiles). Perfect for when you have just a short period of time to play (Most of the chapters are between 8 and 12 minutes). Cute graphics and story. Easy to understand and play. I have played about 20 chapters so far and intend to finish the game.\n\nYou get to travel with 4 elemental spirits that will help you fight along the way. For each chapter you complete, you gain a puzzle piece which you can use to buy upgrades for the spirits/elementals that fights with you. This gives you options to help you win the further chapters and fight more ennemies. You're also free to upgrade the spirits you want (there is no obligation so you can upgrade only one of them if you want).\n\nThere are some records to beat and level of difficulty as well, which is interesting.","December 2, 2013","true","8.4"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

I thought it was original in its design. It has rpg, puzzle, and strategy game elements at the very least. The story and battle mechanics are very interesting. At first, you think the game is going to be easy, but it can also surprise you at how challenging it can get. It definitely makes you think on your feet and try to plan ahead.\n\nProbably, the one thing that I did not like about the game is that whenever an enemy casts a spell, it interrupts what you are doing to tell you about it. I understand it is to help draw your awareness, but usually I am concentrating on what I need to do next and it is very jarring to be suddenly pulled away from what I'm doing. Enemys cast a variety of spells, such as barriers and holds on your abilities. I do not need to be pulled away every, single time. However, in light of the whole, this is just a small annoyence.

The story is cute, the characters are cute -- even the monsters are cute! But cuteness does not detract from the plot and gameplay. This game actually has an engaging storyline, which one may not expect from what appears to be a basic "match three" puzzle game. While the puzzle aspects of the game can occasionally become tedious, the story and RPG elements keep you coming back after you die. And I actually do like the RPG elements and the ability to upgrade your various elements in order to perform special attacks when you do "match" the correct jems together.

Only a game like 10,000,000 really tries to do the same thing.\n\nStill, compared to a game like 10,000,000, it's a little more forgiving, colorful, and generally fun.\n\nThe game plays on a split screen.  You need to fill up your little power jars by matching blocks in a match-three game similar to Bejewelled. (However, you can make swaps that are not matches.  You just get a power bonus if you keep chains of consecutive matches going.)  When you need to launch an attack, you tap the top half of the screen, and can start tapping your elemental buddies to have them throw down attacks and heals and shields.  Otherwise, you keep your head down in the gems you need to match as rapidly as possible.  At least for me, I'm often so focused on making a big chain I totally forget to look up and realize the heroine has stopped walking, and there's a monster about to eat her face...\n\nIt sometimes gets a little hectic, especially against the optional bosses, where you're setting up some big chain you think will help you and in the last two seconds, you took half a dozen attacks that just quartered your health bar, but if things go that fast, you're probably fighting something out of your league, anyway...\n\nThe RPG mechanics are quite interesting, as well.  Special piece rewards for good times in a mission (go back to a difficult one with more powerups if you need more power to score a perfect run) are spent instead of gaining XP.  You get offered a path of specializing in elements or going for a broad generalist path with a few special bonuses.\n\nAll-in-all, it's a fun game for someone who enjoys the occasional puzzle game, RPGs, and has the ability to multitask a bit, and I'd recommend it to anyone who lies upon the intersecction of those three pools.","December 20, 2014","true","12.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Matching up the colors has the corresponding element use an attack, heal, etc.  Sounds simple enough and it is, but the game has a good difficulty curve and a few interesting gameplay mechanics.\n\nOn the downside, the wind elemental seems a bit too important since he's the only character than can knock flying enemies to the ground, and it's necessary to do so to damage them.  Felt like at least one of the other characters should have been able to do something similar.  Makes the tactical aspect of fighting a bit repetitive since there are a lot of flying enemies in the game.  If you ever find yourself wanting to do so, the game does let you respec your level-ups easily enough.  The last boss is also stupid hard and I was one or two attempts from searching for a youtube clip of the ending.  It's just an incredibly frustrating, long fight.\n\nI don't play match-3 anything, so take this review of a match-3 game with a grain of salt.  Picked it up on a whim and because the main character wears a leg brace and that seemed interesting enough.  A solid, little puzzler, though the story/character aspects are extremely generic and disposable.","June 26, 2014","true","13.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

There isn't a ton of depth to them, but they're thought out well enough to give some focus and direction to what you're doing on the puzzle side of the game and break it up a bit. The story is nothing to write home about, but it moves the game along.\n\nI might've kept playing it on and off despite some annoyances (e.g. fighting multiple enemies at once that spam status effects effectively forcing you down an upgrade path that gives you an easy way to clear things like blind/poison), but my inability to see what was going on really started to get in the way after a while. This is one of the few games where my partial color blindness has been a significant problem (especially with the blue/purple gems), and it could've been avoided without even adding a color blind mode. Just making the different gems different shapes would've made an enormous difference. It also really, really doesn't help that things like the poison symbol cover up most of the colored area of the gems, which makes it a lot harder at a glance to tell what you need to match them with to clear them.","December 19, 2013","false","4.4"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","15","25","0","0"

You find an alternative.\n\nLegend of Fae is one alternative, though this actually was released well befored Marvel Puzzel Quest, but I have just learned of this thanks to an Indie Royale Bundle. While I'm not generally into match three games, match three hybrids always catch my attention (self Note, need to play more Gyromancer)\n\nDespite Valve's tendency to improperly label games, this is also an RPG of sorts, due the battle system and skill tree.\n\nThe game is about a girl named Claudia, with a disease that caused her to loose her leg, and now due to a replacement leg she gained, caused her to walk with a limp. Since she isn't able to farm like her parents, she ends up staying with her Uncle who is an engineer and has a magical latern that we later learn that only Claudia is able to figure out. This latern, for some reason allows her to match color gems and gain mana "Puzzle Quest style" for spells (this may have been explained somehow and I may have just missed it). Though, gems are switched with a horizontal cursor like Tetris Attack, which unfortunately can put you in a position where you can't match the gems you needs for half a minute or longer, which is awful admist battle. While the story isn't going to win any awards, it's certainly a much more interesting start than "The world is under attack from the Big Bad" (which isn't to say that won't happen later in the game).\n\nThe game overworld is a linear path that does appear to have some forks/deviations later in the road. Each level involves moving Claudia to the other end of the level, encountering battles along the way. Movement is performed by matching a total of 4 purple gems to move her to the next section, which could be another walk point or battle. Battles are fought by clicking the enemy you want to target and ordering an elemental Fae friend to attack it, provided you have enough mana from matching corresponding gems. You eventually encounter varying enemy types, such as defensive lizard type enemies that cast barrier spells to protect the enemy party and flying enemies that can only be attacked once they are knocked down by your wind elemental. This adds a interesting layer of strategy, requiring you attack certain enemies before others and do so quicky, but this also means they are pratically invincible if you don't have wind gems in the proper place to line up. The flying enemies are rather annoying since you are sometimes in scenarios of matching random gems for lengthy segments, causing you to potentially lose at the target time and be attacked in the process. (This is a decent challenge actually, but iritating when all your enemies are flying). The fact that attacking is so dependent on elements (and there's no alternative means of attack) means that you will often run into situations where you don't have the gems you need to attack, dodge, or heal yourself in time, and the best strategy is to constantly spam gem switches just to get new gems. This goes against the games spellpower mechanic, which rewards you with extra damage for only swapping gems that cause chains.\n\nYou can also succumb to status effects such as poison (which causes damage and corrupts certain gems) or blindness, which makes all but the grey focus gems black, requring you to use any mind gems you already have on the field (From previously matched focus gems), constantly match random gems until you can match focus gems, or wait until the blindness fades. Another reviewer mentioned that the difficulty of the later game essentially forces you down a specific skill path, which, if true, essentially defeats the purpose for a custom skill tree. I have somewhat witnessed the fact that you are so often bombared with status effects, that it can be impossible to match the gems you need to survive, or at least you may be able to survive, but you certainly won't beat the expert time limit. Thankfully, you can easily respec at the cost of one spare part (which unfortunately, is costly since you only get one per completed level).\n\nThe art style is pretty, and evokes memories of well animated 2D adventure games. Unfortunately, that art only looks so good at it's native windowed resolution, as fullscreen stretches the game to pixelization, and there are NO resolution options. Other bad design choices including the annoying poison effect, which makes affected gems partially purple (as shown in the first Steam screenshot), which is very confusing in combat and makes it harder than needed to remove the effect and the total lack of colorblind mode or different gem shapes to make the game more accessible (thankfully, this isn't a direct problem for me, and at least different gems have different colors). The soundtrack, while fitting for this game and servicable for a budget title like this, is largely forgettable right down to the battle music, which sounds like they were going for something exciting, but doesn't get there. It's not remotely bad, just meh.\n\nI played the game on hard, which may have been a mistake, as when I got to level 18, I reached a point where my speed wasn't able to keep up with the constant bombardment of status effects and attacks - no amount of healing spells could save me, especially when the cannons from the gremlin cave took 3/4ths of my health, and the only way to mitigate this is through matching purple gems to dodge their attacks, which of course, the game was stingy to provide them to me when I need them most. Considering I can only swap gems left and right, and can't do so in every direction like other similar games, this is cruel when your survival depends on it. This makes me wonder if the dev playtested the viability of all the skill tree setups - as it seemed impossible to complete, and I was matching gems very quickly. This is the part where I'm unsure to give this game a Yes or a No, as it is pretty good, but this major drawback makes it too hard. Normal difficulty is likely more bearable and you may need to find a guide on the best built (I'm thinking it's going to be the earth tree) .\n\nI think I have to lean towards no based on my experience with the hard difficulty - playing it made me feel that the developer didn't properly make sure that any skill path is viable to complete the game.","December 29, 2013","false","5.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It's a puzzle RPG with real-time combat. If Bejeweled and Puzzle Quest had a baby this would be it.\n\nThe story is okay but the writing itself is a little rough. It also takes a bit to get off the ground and by the end of the game I was very ready for it to end.\n\nThe real meat of the game is its surprisingly deep gameplay. The difficulty takes a while to ramp up but becomes a real challenge by the end. If you do play it then do so on HARD because otherwise it robs you of the real ending.

You use the gather mode to match gems for resources, and then use those in the battle mode on the upper part of the screen. The game's a bit on the easy side for the first leg of the journey as you have little in your repetoire, but once it gets going it's challenging in a pretty fun way. There does exist the problem of unlucky drops meaning you can't get the mana you need, but it's not common enough to be a major complaint.\n\nGetting expert scores in later levels requires gaming the system a bit, but short of one of the more annoying enemy types in one level, it's usually a case of survival against a pretty tough enemy. If anything, I wish the optional bosses had been more difficult, but the endboss is pretty brutal and an excellent fight to end the game on.\n\nAll in all, getting 20 solid hours of gameplay out of some puzzle game I picked up for $10 just because it had pretty pictures is an excellent deal. Buy this game. Bonus points: the story's not bad either, taking the pretty grim idea of the fae rather than friendly faeries.","April 20, 2013","true","21.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
