I just finished the game and it was an awesome experience!\nWithout words, the story is told visually of 2 dragon flies in a world of fantasy, magic, danger and sadness as you click onto and drag key objects in sync with the awesome soundtrack to make the story progress. It's pretty much a rhythm game.\nThough the game is short, about 50 minutes to complete, it was worth every minute.\nThe devs at SuperChop Games really blew me away with this game and I look forward to seeing what else they will bring in the future.\nMy girl is gonna love this game.

A musical adventure where you follow a pair of mayflies (or butterflies...something like that) as they try to keep each other alive and express the joy of their love for one another. Along the way, they find allies in beetles and bees, and fight off a gigantic boombox (yes, the stereo type) carrying spider.\n\nVisually, this game is stunning. The nature of the gameplay means there will be a ton of actual fireworks and such, with a lot of cool imagery that comes with that, along with flowers, and a ton of other great stuff to look at. I suppose you also go through the seasons as well although this is a bit more ambiguous.\n\nThere is no dialogue. The music conveys all the meaning in this one. Speaking of the music, as a game based around a musical journey, you would expect the tunes to be stellar, and they in fact are that and more. This is the type of soundtrack you could easily jam often. Really great sounding music. The way this game is presented musically reminds me a lot of Karmaflow, so I wonder if it is the same people, although at first glance, it doesnt appear to be.\n\nSo, what is the game itself? Baically, it is a speedrun click fest. The music and the clicking start out slow and manageable, but as the music picks up tempo, so to does the clicking. Where it isnt clicking, it is click and drag. I'm not very good at this personally, so I didnt manage anything even resembling a perfect sequence, lol. It isnt required for the story progression, but some of the achievements seem to be tied to this. Also, there is apparently a secret level, but I havent found it yet. So, after your first playthrough, it definitely becomes a game of skill and speed.\n\nSo, anyway, all told, I think this game warrants 9 bad ♥♥♥ riffs as a pair of butterfly dragons swirl and fly through the air while fireworks explode around them, out of 10.\n\nAdditionally, I would definitely assign this must own status for pretty much everybody. I cant imagine somebody playing this and not enjoying it.","August 11, 2015","true","3.7"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"

It's part rhythm game, part point & click and well, part rock opera (I guess). It is kinda lackluster in all three, though, but it's still worth it IMO.\n\nIt's a pretty game, but I'd say that it's not as much of a game as it is a visual experience. Graphics and story are really pretty. It kept me interested all the way through and I finished it in one go (it's short).\n\nMy only problem with the game is that I think this was clearly meant to be played with a touchscreen, so if you want to get it and it's available for tablets or ipad, then I'd highly suggest you get it on those platforms instead.\n\nThe game itself is kinda short, but it's lovely. I got the same feeling I get with "Cirque du soleil".  I mean shows like Varekai, where you get a story told through music and performances.\n\nMy only complaint aside from the touchscreen issue, is that the music itself is kinda lackluster. It's low budget and loaded with electric guitars that didn't really make sense to me. It matched the feel of the game at some points, but most of the time it felt off.\n\nI had a good time, but... I've had better for the same price, and if I could go back in time and get it on my iPad, I would.\n\nIf you have a kid, I think they would enjoy it a lot on an iPad or something similar, mostly because you can't win or lose... you just follow the story, and you can replay levels afterwards.\n\nI'd give it a 6/10 for what it is.","February 3, 2015","true","0.7"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

It might not be a AAA title, but it's probably the best music game I've heard or seen, and it's got one of the best indie soundtracks in the business.\n\nAlso, who can resist getting this after hearing Jared and Jesse's renditions of the songs with their actual lyrics?\n\nWell made and put together, well worth getting both the game and the soundtrack!","February 14, 2015","true","2.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

The gamepley consist on moving your mouse, clicking and draging in the right time, mostly in the rythmic beat of a song, with a lot of visual clues. For the most of the game, you have are not punished for missing a click, or even all the clicks. You could just sit back, listen to the great soundtrack (worth buying it!) and watch the story unfolds in front of you, all with a great artwork of paper cuts and lights. If you like a challenge, there's a secret level almost impossible to beat, and achievements that will make you do the entire game without any miss.\nI had one major bug that stopped the game from working during a few days, but after the creator identifying the problem, everything was solved and I could play this masterpiece once again. The step by step for the problem solution, if you happen to stumble by the same bug as I did, is in the forums.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nEphemerid é mais uma experiência muscial do que um jogo. O gameplay consite em mover seu mouse, clicar e arrastar, quase que sempre ao ritmo da batida de uma música, com muitas dicas visuais que auxiliam a executar os movimentos no momento certo. Durante a maior parte do jogo, não há punição para errar um click, ou mesmo errar todos os clicks de uma fase. Você pode apenas sentar, escutar a ótima trilha sonora (vale a pena comprar!) e assistir o desenrolar da estória, construída com um impressionante trabalho artístco de cortes e dobraduras de papel e luzes. Se você gosta de um desafio, existe uma fase secreta quase impossível de terminar, e conquistas que exigem que você refaça cada fase sem errar nenhuma nota.\nEu só tive um bug que me impediu de jogar por alguns dias, mas depois que o criador identificou o problema, tudo foi resolvido e eu pude voltar a jogar essa obra de arte. O passo a passo para a solução do problema, se você por acaso esbarrar no mesmo bug que eu, se encontra nas discussões, em inglês; mas ficarei feliz de ajudar alguém que precise de tradução.","November 21, 2015","true","4.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

But it's cute with good music.\n\nI can't justify paying full price for a game which is less than an hour in gameplay. Sure, you can spend hours and hours getting 'perfect scores' and unlocking the secret stage, but the rhythm game itself is not challenging and boring. Some stages can get really frustrating if you're going for a perfect run because the game is designed for touch-screen panels and not the mouse.\n\nThere are other $6 indie games on Steam which will give you more bang for the buck.","February 25, 2015","false","2.7"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","0"

It tells its story about small, fragile creatures through cutscenes and minigames devoid of text. In this way, it's very reminiscent of Botanicula. Almost all of the gameplay involves rhythm or incorporates music in some other way. The minigames themselves are almost beside the point; it's the way they are presented to you that makes this game something wonderful: beautiful music, a papercraft world, and a touching story. This journey takes under an hour, and honestly, it didn't need to be any longer than that.

Ephemerid: A Music Adventure is self-described as a rock opera that is more of an experience, than a game. This sounded like something I would enjoy, but it turned out to be much more of a click fest that was anything but synchronized with the music.\n\nWhat I think it is trying to be is some sort of interactive Fantasia which is a super cool idea. It failed pretty miserably in the execution, unfortunately.\n\nMany 'scenes' just went on forever on a kind of loop with spam clicking. Don't even get me started on the biology here (and yes, that is a legitimate argument since it is directly referencing ephemeridae (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeridae)). Nothing really made sense as far as the life cycle of the mayfly that you are controlling, and I'll just leave it at that.\n\nPros:\n+Awesome idea that would be super cool if pulled off correctly.\n\nCons:\n-Most importantly - music is real 'meh'\n-Spam clicking ruins it. My wife and I spent a disproportionate amount of time trying to figure out if the clicking is in rhythym (or in synch) with the music. Pretty sure its not.\n-Artwork is fairly bland.\n\nI refunded. It just wasn't worth the money, in the state its in.","November 18, 2015","false","0.2"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","8","16","3","2"

Then I missed a note and I noticed the music didn’t stop, nor did the game, nor did anything; then I just let the game run by itself without touching the mouse and while it kept going  without any input I said to myself “This is going to be one of those days isn’t it?”.\n\nOk, fine, whatever I decided to play along and honestly I found it to be extremely disappointing in almost every aspect “BUT YOU ONLY PLAYED HALF AN HOUR!” you say, BUT THAT’S HOW MUCH THIS GAME LASTS! I answer,  and that’s just the tip of the iceberg with this game.\n\nOk first let’s talk about the positives, the visuals are pretty and the story is told without a single word of dialog and even though it’s a pretty simple story line about two dragonflies falling in love but it’s still told in a well-done matter. The tempo is also spot-on and the notes are very easy to tell apart from the background, even though they take different shapes and forms with each stage.\n\nAnd now for the negatives: Everything else. As I said in the beginning you can’t really die or lose, ever, and as such the game has limited replay value. You can only get an extra stage if you get every single note without missing a beat, that’s all the replay value this game has and I can’t be bothered.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the game is quite obviously a poorly done Ipad/Tablet port, there’s only one resolution and the mouse controllers are incredibly wonky, in other words, if you don’t have a touch screen don’t buy this game. This makes it very hard for me to replay the game as I don’t have a touchscreen monitor, nor am I planning on buying one sometime in the future and I really despise the mouse implementation in this game, I REALLY do.\n\nThe music isn’t something that I would write home about either, to me it felt like an amateur composer made the entire score much like I did scores when I started playing piano “Check it out mom I can play from C# to B and back!”. There was only one song that I liked from the soundtrack, ONE, which is not something I usually say about rhythm games.\n\nFinally there’s the stages, I can sum them up like this: one stage is recycled three times and one of them is… Do you remember that mind-numbingly boring lawn mowing game where you do nothing but mow the lawn? That mini-game is in this game as a stage, yes, really.\n\nCan I recommend this game to anyone?\nActually, yes, I can. The whole time I was playing I was thinking that I would’ve enjoyed this game a lot if I was about 15 or 17 years younger,  so if you’re a parent looking for a game without any violence for his kid I can fully recommend this one.\n\nI get the feeling with the overall positive reception of this game I’m going to end up receiving some very… interesting mail in the near future but I don’t care, this game is clearly not for me and I don't think it was worth the three dollars I paid for it.","May 26, 2015","false","0.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","44","4","9","3","0"

Everything looks like papercraft, but moves very smoothly, and some of the rhythm elements are pretty clever.\nIt is on the short side, though. I finished in about 45 minutes. Maybe grab it on sale if you can.\nI also teared up at the end, but that is totally subjective and I am a complete sap.","August 28, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I began to realise by the third track that it was not just a melodious flutter amongst foliages; an actual story was being told to me. Despite its child-like exterior of a papercrafted environment, I somehow related closely to it and the many symbolisms of friendship, courage, struggles, and sacrifice. The ending was unexpected, yet bittersweet.\n\nAfter all, it's but a mayfly...\n\n--\n\nIn case I was a tad too poetic and you didn't understand whatever I just said:\n\nThe game is simple but interactively unique, has a beautiful soundtrack, an interesting environment, good story, and overall, I am satisfied and will play it over again. I cried at the end.","September 2, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Buy the game, if not for the game itself than for its soundtrack. The music in this game practically drips with the passion and effort the artist put into it. Gameplaywise it is a little hard at times to click and drag the mouse fast enough and get into the rhythm based on the various things the game wants you to, but in my opinon it just adds to the fun and challange.\n\nIf you're used to playing rhythm games you might find this to be a little easier (if not different) than the standard but there's an option to let you control the speed of the music if it turns out to be easier than you like. Also it shouldn't take you more than an hour, hour-and-a-half to complete the first time around but there is some replay value with the achievements and finding the secret level.\n\nFor the story it's a little open to interpetation especially when you play it a second time. I won't spoil anything major but basically after (you, the player) discovering another mayfly, the pair is split up when one is captured in a net and taken away. What follows is a small adventure through the world to an awesome soundtrack with an ending similar to Journey in the sense it manages to loop the story in a plausable way so it feels like a complete story.\n\nTLDR: PRETTY GAME + AWESOME SOUNDTRACK = MY RECOMENDATION TO GET IT","August 4, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then its papercraft concept. Music tends to be quite repetitive and overwhelming to people who don't appreciate tons of guitars. It was fine to me, though some were a bit cheesy (but that point is related to one's musical taste).\nArtwork is simple but it's enough for this game.\nA game like this has a lot of possibilities to offer in terms of game design and interactivity, I confess that I was expecting more variety.\n\nBuuuut.. in my humble opinion, it's a beautiful little, interactive, magical experience and it deserves more recognition.\nNot only because it's reasonably cheap, also because it will make your day better *tends to return from time to time*\n\nIf you like guitars, point and clicking rhythm and narrative altogether, it's a must!\nIf not..\n..you'll love it for its story.\n\nfeels. feels everywhere\n\n(Note that this is just my opinion and nothing more than the experience I've had while playing this game)","January 25","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
