I will add a TL;DR at the end.\n\nGameplay\nYou start off with a single worker and must build a Hive (your primary building) which allows you to construct more workers, a hive queen and eventually a medic. You will need to gather food to allow you to build more units. You must then construct a barracks to get your first fighting units; one melee, and one ranged. The melee unit comes in a pack of 6 while the ranged comes in a pack of 4. Resources are what allow you to build these building however food is vital. The game is nice but the camera controls seems off to me. The RPG aspect that the developer has added is fun but still unrefined along with the DNA aspect as we are never formally introduced with the features as of yet. On Act 4 the difficulty curve is immense right now and It is hard to beat as your enemies clearly outnumber you and are quick to strike in force. However, from what I know the developer is planning to add a turret type building and I can see the potential for this game.\n\nGraphics/Sound\nThe graphics are nice and I do like how the Hive and the units are designed and displayed. I do wish that the enemies exact attack or amount of health would be displayed if possible. The scenery is nice to look at and the music is well-done.\n\nPros/Cons\nPros\n\n+ shows potential\n+ story is well-written and fun to play through\n+ scenery is amazing\n+ units are well designed\n+ music is enjoyable\n+ in discussions developer is happy to listen and reply to you\n\nCons\n**Note that since this game is currently in early access that most of these issues will be fixed when the game is done**\n\n- options are locked down (cant click on them)\n- camera controls are a bit slow\n- huge difficulty curve currently existing in Act 4 (as more items will be added this level will of course become easier but as of now huge curve)\n- RPG and DNA are not explained early on even though they are available from Act 1\n- Intro still does not make sense and instead of introducing the insectoids we find out about humans (currently not in the game but will be added later)\n\nSuggestions\nI would like to suggest something I personally would think would improve the game.\n\n- quick selection of units\n- an random map generator where you can just fight\n- expansion and mention in-game on the RPG and DNA systems\n- ability to change the color of your hive and units once you complete story mode\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThe Hive is an amazing game and I cannot wait to see it finished. I hope the developer takes their time and polishes it. Currently, as you would expect from an early access title (V 0.071) there are going to be difficulties and problems, but this game shows potential and I believe it can be reached. I will be happy to redo my review once the game is done or a major update arrives. The game is currently unrefined and I hope to see it progress into a great refined game.\n\nTL;DR\nThe Hive is a fun strategy game with a good story. The scenery is nice along with the music, however two of the game mechanics are not mentioned (RPG and DNA). There is currently a huge difficulty curve existing within the game but the developer is planning to add more content which should help even that curve out. The developer is in the discussions and will be happy to reply to you. I suggest getting this game if you like the trailers, but I suggest doing your research to see what has been added/ going to be added. Currently the game is unrefined but its future seems bright.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","July 7, 2015","true","17.6"," 132 of 141 people (94%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","94","132","141","12","11"

Besides that you have options for "continue", "new game", "load game" (you can´t save games atm, so nothing to load), "credits" and "exit". Continuing a game, you can choose the first and second map (a third to be expected soon), it also says "Page 1 of 5".\n\nThere is a countdown timer until the next big release is scheduled.\n\nStarting a new game, the intro sets you in Earth´s +100ish years future. One day meteors literally start falling out of the sky. This comes as a total suprise to its inhabitants. (If you plan on becoming an astronomist, don´t, there obviously is no market for it in the future.)\nHumanity then goes on to build one (1) spaceship.\nAfter three years of meteor rain, the ship is launched just as earth is destroyed, and mankind boldly goes where no one has gone before.\nAfter some time of travel a planet is discovered. The planet seems to be inhabited by monsters, living in a harsh environment. Oh, and there are underground ruins.\n\n\nGameplayDespite being a nice intro, it has nothing to do with the actual gameplay. Like, at all.\nAfter an intro showing earth´s destruction and humanity escaping into space, you would think that you actually play a human civilisation, right?\nWRONG!\nObviously you will play bug-like aliens, who have to kill lizard-like aliens to satisfy fire demons.\nTrue, the title says "Hive", but still. Well, maybe it´s just me.\n\nYou start your civilisation with one worker, being able to build 3 buildings: Hive, Barracks, and Worker Den (storage building).\nYou can build Workers (building and ressource gathering), Legionnaires (light melee), Hunters (light range), Hive Queen (heavy melee).\nOn the first mission, you have to build up your base, an army, an then venture out to kill some mobs and some more mobs. You´re finished after killing the boss, which a fire demon tells you to do.\nOn the second mission (which I´m currently playing), you have additionally a puzzle to solve.\n\n\nPro´s and Con´sThis is an early access review, so I will not bother to list any con´s or complain about missing content until the game is actually released. From the actual content it seems to be more like a pre-alpha, but still, by far not the worst early access I´ve seen.\n\nOn the positive side, the game sets the ground for a lot of nice things and has lots of potential. Despite being labeled as adventure/indie/strategy it is more a strategy/scifi/rpg.\n\nStrategy\nCould be compared with Age of Empires. You can collect ressources, at the moment food and ressource, and have a population cap. You can build different units in different buildings. I´d like more buildings, units, hopefully research.\n\nRPG\nThe fact that your units have the slots for items (Weapon, Shield, Helmet, Armor, 2 Rings), even though you can´t build items yet, gives me great hope for the final release. Units have attack and defense values, and the ability to level, even though you don´t see any xp values so far. Looking forward to this.\n\nScifi\nThe fact that you´re playing alien bugs on a different planet is just awesome, right?\nI´d like to see more races, maybe some humans mentioned in the intro could venture out into the game.\n\nFeatures\nBesides your UI on the bottom you also have a minimap. The view can be rotated 360° horizontally and about 30° vertically (meaning almost birds-view to almost overseeing the entire map). The game has decent graphic and atmospheric voice acting.\nI personally am really hoping for a crossover between Age of Empires and Heroes of Might and Magic. Also, multiplayer would be appreciated.\n\n\nSummaryIf you happen to come across this game and like the genre, but don´t want to buy an early access game, it´s at least worth putting on your watchlist.\n\n***********************************************************************************************************\n\nUpdateI did some reading about the game, it seems that humans will be introduced into the story later, so the intro actually WILL make sense at some point of the game release.\nReally looking forward to the finished game.","March 9, 2015","true","2.4"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","27","33","4","0"

Complaints that are no longer relevant have been crossed out and new comments added to explain what exactly changed.\n**NOTE**\n\nThe Hive is a stylish, narrative driven, single player real time strategy game with some RPG elements mixed in. It is currently in Early Access and as such many features are unfinished, unpolished or simply missing so take everything I say with a grain of salt as it might change in the coming months.\n\nAs of right now though, The Hive is an interesting blend between genres that does many things right but is unfortunately hampered by a complete lack of difficulty but still needs a bit more work when it comes to mission variety.\n\nPositives:\nVisual Design\nDespite coming from an indie studio The Hive looks on par with many of the modern "big" RTS games out there and is full of nice looking enviroment that have plenty of little details to them. My favorite example of this is how busy your base looks with your worker drones catching fish & butchering meat while small pill-bugs run around and collect materials only to pile it in neat heaps next to the main Hive. These are small touches that don't matter on first glance but actually go a long way towards making the game a better experience.\n\nBase Building\nIts hard to explain why but a combination of the sleek visuals, very zerg-like audio and some creative unit design makes building up your bases in The Hive very enjoyable. Since there are only a couple of buildings the majority of the complexity comes from positioning your hive in order to optimally harvest resources, spawning the right type and amount of units before being attacked and so on. In other words, its a simple system but a fun one.\n\nRPG mechanics\nKilling enemies, bosses and looting chests can result in some shiny loot for you to equip your insectoid warriors with. The amount of items you get it seemingly numerous but you will only ever have enough to make a couple of your units in to badass killing machines which I do like. When everyone is special, no one is so only having a few powerful veteran units makes them feel unique and worth taking care of.\n\nUnit ablities\nThe abillities your units have don't seem relevant at first glance but after playing through the entire campaign I've come to realize that every single one of them actually has a role to play. Most importantly, they are very satisfying to use due to the visual feedback you get. For example, using a medic's heal will bathe the targeted area in green light which makes all of your units slightly shimmer green, a nifty looking effect.\n\nNegatives:\nExtremely easy\nOutside of mission 4 where you get bum-rushed by 20 enemy units before you've had time to build up your base you will never, ever be threatened in The Hive. This really is a shame because there are so many cool mechanics you can play around with but won't since just attack-moving across the map is equally viable.\nAfter the recent patch the enemies are much tougher and require tactics beyond press attack move on map which is a very welcome change. Turrets still remain as strong as ever but overall The Hive is a fair bit more challenging and a lot more interesting as a result.\n\nPoor AI\nOutside of never attacking you The AI is rather bad at defending itself. When attacking enemy bases filled with hordes of units you don't have to worry about fighting all of them at once, no, no. Instead the AI will send only a couple of the closest units at you while the rest twiddle their thumbs and wait to be eaten like good little baddies.\n\nNo fog of war\nWhile the RPG system encourages you to explore the map in search of fancy loot the lack of a fog of war (the dark ares of the map that only go away when you explore them) means you can pinpoint where exactly the chest is and then just go there, completely ignoring 80% of the map in the process. Its also a bit cheap that when attacking your opponents you can tell exactly how many units they have and where they're positioned so once again you're almost never threatened.\n\nSlow start\nEvery single mission starts with exactly one drone from which you need to build up your entire empire. As I said before I don't mind building my base, its quite fun, but when you have to do this for every single mission without any threat to you then it start to get annoying. The way I would address this issue is by providing a more diverse starting point, so one mission begins will an entire base, another with a bunch of units that need to conquer a food-rich area in order to start building and so on.\nAfter the recent patch you now start with varying amounts of resources but I'd say this area still requires some work because even after the change every start feels very similar.\n\nMy recommendation:\nThe Hive is buzzing with good ideas and real potential but as of right now it is still somewhat unfinished and lacking in mission variety. However, after the recent patch that added tougher enemies and minibosses it has become a lot more fun since you now have a reason to use all of the abilities and tactics at your disposal.\n\nGiven how willing the developers were to work with criticism I can't help but recommend you The Hive if you're up for playing a short but sweet RTS/RPG hybrid.\n\nThe video below was made before the most recent patch so a few things aren't relevant anymore but it should still give you a good overview of The Hive:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFO5GIxkqc","February 17","true","4.5"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","20","21","0","3"

This game is real good. While lacking the polish of a finished title (still early access and all that) there is no doubt in my mind that The Hive is a game I'm glad I've had the opportunity to try out. The Hive is a RTS that is very heavy on the story elements. Basically, you'll be exploring this world as much as you will be smashing your foes and managing resources.\n\nThe story is your usual, "we had to escape Earth because it got screwed" storyline except instead of taking on the predictable role of the Human Race, you actually play as a mysterious Insectoid race known as The Hive. You'll solve puzzles while also killing animals for food and amassing hordes of insects to kill Lizardmen, skeletons and all manner of bad guys. You'll meet old gods, titan-like creatures and you'll have to bring down some seriously over powered enemies.\n\nIn terms of sound, artwork, and level design, this game exceeds on levels that very much remind me of Warcraft 3. Truly, the game actually feels very similar to WC3, except if you had a whole race devoted to large number horde tactics and passive buffs that make the horde even more powerful (Sort of like the beetle guys the undead had in FT). I love all the little details in this game as well. Like when your workers are harvesting resources, they create a little pile that actually gets bigger the more they gather and a tiny beetle creature comes and transports the resources back to the base. It's so insignificant but it's just an extra piece of world building that helps immerse one in the game. Mechanically, the game is just as sound, there are a few tactics that seem more effective than others and I'll refrain from spoiling anything for now but I'm sure as time goes on, it will be ironed out.\n\nIn summation, this game is pretty solid and I can't help but look optimistically towards it's final release.\n\nGameplay Footage:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO4qhEw0Sy4","March 6","true","9.8"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","17","18","4","0"

As far as game mechanics go, there is nothing groundbreaking but it holds with the tried and true mechanics in most RTS games.\n\nIf you don't want to read a (somewhat) detailed review, here's a first impression video of the first ~15 minutes of the game: https://youtu.be/i8V94XbAthg\n\nThe controls are extremely intuitive especially if you've ever played an RTS before. 9/10\n\nThe artwork is amazing. It's all relatively low poly with surprisingly detailed textures. At one point I spent a full minute just staring at a leaf because I was so impressed with it. While the lifeforms in the water are very good, there aren't many  bugs or animals roaming other than the turtles you kill for food. 8/10\n\nAs for mechanics it's like any other RTS game. It functions almost the same as Age of Mythology which came out 10+ years ago. 8/10\n\nThe story has some cool and interesting possibilities to it but I still don't know how the opening trailer relates in any way to the game so far. It's just too early to tell. ?/10\n\nOverall this is a fun game, with good artwork and an intriguing story but it is too soon to give a real rating for it.

I have posted some screenshots of curiosities in play that may represent known or unknown bugs.\n\nFor the prospective player, I would suggest considering this game if you if you like your RTS with lots of story. If you're looking for constant explosions and AAA graphics interlaced with hyper-masculine robo-marines, I think you know where to go. This is an indie title in development, not a finished game, and not THAT sort of game to begin with.\n\nFor the player/developer, like me, this is a great game for several reasons, not the least of which actually is the state that it's currently in. We can see that the game engine works fine, it may be Unity based on a number of observable factors but there are other things it *could* be, and as each act is released we see the gameplay mature.\n\nFor the developer of this game, I do have some notes.\n\nStory - The introductory movie actually strongly implies that we are playing the humans, which was confusing, and then we are not playing the humans, and then three levels into the game there are human-like things but they don't seem to be the humans. The levels we move through appear to be sunlit but there is reference to "the surface," and there are trees and such, which again imply that we are not in catacombs or underground, but are on a surface of some kind. This is confusing. While story in RTS is usually very linear, it would be nice to see player agency used to some degree. We appear to be playing the villains of the story, and the Insectoid Advisor character, having voice acting that comes out similar to a cartoon villain, frequently commands you to kill things that could have been talked to. Also, from the science fiction beginnings of the 'ark in space' we are immediately then fighting undead and summoning golems and performing rituals to contact the underworld. Some preparation for that would have been nice. It makes this a Fantasy game, or a Science Fantasy game, rather than a Science Fiction game.\n\nArt Assets and Theme - The Hive we are controlling is frequently referred to as 'insectoid' but it appears to be more like crustaceans and snails. Particularly the Hive Queen who has a beautiful shell. These features are not typical of insects or hive creatures, but of animals we are familiar with for being individual, though small and often found repellant. Obviously it's far too late in development to change the art assets themselves, but some explanation and description of the animals hierarchy, their anatomy, how they work as a hive, these things would be interesting and would add a lot to the game. The strength of this game is all in the name, people come here for the bugs, it's good that they're beautiful, I think they should be diverse as they have been made so far, and I think they should probably be linked at a psychic or magical level (whatever fits your mythology better) and differ from what we have previously understood as insects or hive creatures. This should probably get some discussion in game, but perhaps not directly as instruction. The hive might absorb a new creature type (consider the highly successful mechanic from Endless Legend in having secondary kingdoms provide new units) and get a chance to have the advisor discuss how "These two species are both compatible with our hive psyche, but we lack the strength to absorb both of them! Choose one, and destroy the other!" And then you pick, say, whether you take over the lizard people from the first couple levels as scouts or the mega-turtles as heavies. The assets change to match your color scheme and after a couple levels have tentacles or bug armor and their name has changed. They've gone from "lizard thrall" to "Lizardoid Scout" without any ceremony.\n\nTerrain - I like the terrain for the most part, but it could really benefit from normal maps and shadows. If the game is in Unity, consider the Relief Terrain Pack and Advanced Foliage Shader assets. It might be a bit of a job integrating them into your project, but I think you would find at least some use of the shaders beneficial. The terrain stands out as less animated and lower quality than your other art assets. I'd recommend introducing wind and weather. If the game is intended to be underground, that needs to come across in the terrain. You've clearly got a good grasp of particles and smoke, use those skills to do shafts of light reaching down, dust sifting through huge caverns, that kind of thing. It shouldn't be so sunny if it's underground.\n\nRTS Mechanics - The Hive has a squad cap apparently equal to 1 + (11x(The Number of Hives you build), but each unit type has a hidden cap as well. I discovered this by accident when I built a second hive in the second mission in order put a healing station next to the ritual so my army would not face any attrition during the time attack sequence. After building the second main base building, I had a squad cap of 23, but I could really only build to about 15 units including 5 or 6 workers. This number of workers made resource gathering easy, and they are combat capable. In the third act adding the Medic brought the total squad cap to 16, even though building a second main base building brought it to 23 again. I have some screen shots on my profile documenting this. Also, perhaps before the enemies get any smarter or numerous, we need an "attack move" command, really a staple of the modern RTS, in which units are commanded to move and attack anything in their pathway.\n\nGameplay - The biggest area for improvement for this game is the way it feels. The Hive really feels very much unlike a hive. The units build and fight pretty much like any other army in any other basic RTS I've played. The game is in the early stages of development, and the story is really what shines here, but I think there is huge potential here that is being overlooked.\n\nMake the Hive into a hive.\n\nIt may sound impossible to go back and change these fundamentals. If it is, sorry for saying negative things and providing solutions you can't use. However, I'm going to suggest these things because, as a developer myself, I can see a way that these solutions could be made a reality and how they could really make this title pop.\n\nA unit should be a swarm of units, rather than a group of 3 to 5. The Queen should be the first unit out, and should be able to start producing drones. Rather than specific commands and individual orders, worker drones should be given targets, and since they should be particles under Boid logic rather than individual units, they should be commanded from the Queen unit or a fundamental menu. So, you can still have the workers build buildings and fish fish pools and kill turtles, but there should be a whole lot more of them doing it at once. Then the Queen builds the hive and moves into it, gaining an upgrade to Squad cap and uses it as a protective measure. The same really goes for the other unit types, though honestly, they should be promoted up from worker drones. The drones should always be doing something, and they should be crawling around all over everything. There needs to be tons of them.\n\nThe reason I think this is doable is that, for example if the game is in Unity which I develop in, it's a change in game mechanics which is mostly a secondary scripting issue, and it's a change from using prefabs of individual assets to using prefabs of particle emitters which emit particles that are prefabs of those assets. The particle density would actually be controlled by the capacity of the machine the game was running on. So your squad cap is 12 *swarms* each of which is automatically created as blank drones that just run around, and those swarms might be dozens of bugs.\n\nI think it would be fantastic.","April 24, 2015","true","2.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

I will rewrite this review next time I play it.\n\ntl;dr: As it stands now, I cannot recommend this game. There are some minor to moderate bugs, and a complete lack of an options menu, but the biggest point is the amount of content relative to the current price.\n\nI bought this game while it was on sale, for $10. It looked neat, had good reviews, all the works. However, as it is now, do not spend $19 on this game.\n\nThe Hive is an RTS, but it does a couple things differently. There are (albeit very simple) puzzles in the maps, and it handles resource gathering in an unconventional way (workers gather the stuff, make a pile behind them, little guys automatically come out of the main building or a resource drop off point and unload the goods). It is, as others have said, a very pretty game. However, I am not one to be swayed by graphics alone. The game also has a great atmosphere though, I can't quite explain it, but it has a little bit of mystery and wonder built in, and the highly manuverable camera helps out with that.\n\nBut, like I said, I can't recommend it for $19. I beat the entire game in an hour, including me leaving the game on as I went to go do something (took like 15 minutes). There are 2 medium sized maps, and that is it. There are a total of 4 units you can produce, and although the resource drop off point promises upgrades, there are none to be found. There is also no strategy, just make a bunch of units and fling them at the enemy. There is one unit that supposedly buffs other units, but it currently is just a big queen thing with a bunch of health. There is a level up mechanic (which sometimes breaks) for the units, and what appears to be slots for items, but the items are not implemented yet. There is some basic RTS commands missing (most notably double clicking on a unit does not select all the units of that type on the screen), and at one point the camera broke so I couldn't look around using the mouse, I had to use WASD. Also, if you build a building where units are, they won't move. The worker just builds the building right on top of the units, and even if you destroy the building you can't move the units any more. Given that this happened in a "survive for x amount of time" objective, this was a major problem.\n\nGiven the current rate of development (seems to be one small-medium update a month) I would say this game needs over a year to be reasonably priced at $19. As it stands now, it's worth, maybe, 3-5 bucks.","April 1, 2015","false","1.1"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","18","28","0","3"

You never know how the final product will turn out. What's the roadmap? What's your vision for the finished game? From what I read here in the "Discussions" the devs plan to release The Hive in 2016 with three races, skirmish mode, and other standard RTS features. So I can only comment on the state of the game as it is right now. It gets updated regularly, at least once a month.\n\nRight now the The Hive only has the insect campaign. I like the art style, the music, the voice acting. It feels very polished in some places and, well, very Early Access in other places. You only have three buildings and one tower and that's simply not enough for me. I like base building. Especially with an insectoid race in a game called "The Hive" there should be more "buildings" to cover and conquer the map. There's a cool research and upgrade system where you have to decide whether you want to equip your units with special weapons and armor, or convert those items into DNA to spend on research.\n\nThe regular enemies are no challenge. The boss battles at the end of some missions can be pretty tough, they can do some major area damage if you don't dodge. You also have to solve some puzzles like arranging symbols or digging for key items. It's a fun thing to do but I feel the devs should focus their attention on building a solid RTS foundation. More buildings, more units, better enemy AI. I also hope that the different races will offer different playstyles and mechanics.\n\nThe main reason why I recommend it is because I see a committed team of devs who communicate and update regularly. My gut feeling says that The Hive could be great when it's time for the release version. But again, the devs should absolutely focus more on the gameplay and combat to reach that level of polish that you can already see in the design and music. The campaign in its current state is not challenging at all and the same build order/strategy works for every mission. My favorite mission was the one where you inspect a crashed spaceship.","February 20","true","5.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

I wrote this review in the early access verision of the game. The developers might improve this game, but as it is i would        ------ Not reccomend this game ------\n\nSo far, the game is too simple. You have four units in total: a worker, a basic melee unit, basic ranged unit and a tanky "queen". The queen, despite her stature, serves no purpose but fighting. Neither does the other units exept workers.\nResources are immensly inbalanced.\nBy killing only a tortoise you can feel yourself for most of the game, whilst a mineral pile depletes nearly instantly. The puzzls does not require thinking, only time as you have to look for things in small piles etc. You can look stuff without having a unit near it, which in my oppinion seems wierd. You should at least have to have a unit loot the items around the map.\n\nI miss more than just two structures, and i miss more units. I would like it to have a more tactical and resource-managing view, but its just get food -> Make units - > Rampage everything.\nI even killed a boss before the cutscene of him talking was over, without actually intending to kill him.\n\nThis game has a few cool elements, but most of it is too easy and too simple. Its honestly a game that would be most suitable a phone.\n\nThe concept is great, and if you can catch it on a sale it might be worth it for some. If you, on the other hand, like challenging games then this is not for you.","June 12, 2015","false","10.6"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SquidofLuvPlays/recommended/325730/","SquidofLuvPlays","SquidofLove","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SquidofLuvPlays/","122 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe Hive is a RTS title, very representative of the genre. Like with similar games, you need to collect resources, build your base and gather enough troops to overcome the challenges of each level. What sets The Hive apart though, is the fact that is adding some really interesting RPG elements to the mix, elements that make this game a trully enjoyable experience.\n\nAs the leader of your insectoid race, you must complete the objectives that are given to you by your advisor and guide your race through the underworld of this alien world. Each level is beautiful and exotic and adds to the unique atmosphere of the game. As the story unfolds you also get info about the history of this world and the events that led to the current situation.\n\nAt the beginning the enemies are not very hard and quite passive, but as you unlock more maps they become stronger and more aggressive. Building your defenses fast will be necessary to survive. Once you learn how to deal with them, the game becomes easier. Boss fights are a whole other thing though. Bosses in The Hive have their own unique abilities and you need to follow a strategy to win against them. Just standing still, hitting them, waiting for their health to go down, wont work. This is why Boss fights in the game are so much fun.\n\nBy defeating enemies or simply by exploring the map you may get items as loot, items you can equip on your units and make them stronger, or dissolve and gain DNA. DNA is one of the resources in the game and you could say that it is the most important one. This is because with DNA you can unlock new skills and upgrade them or unlock new units, essential for your success. These two features make The Hive a great game. Also the fact that the skills you unlock and upgrade are permanent, make the experience a lot better.\n\nSomething i should mention is the lack of Fog of War on the levels. This means that the entire map is visible to the player and you can see when the enemies are preparing for an attack to your base. Although not a big deal for me, some might find this weird for a RTS title.\n\nOverall, The Hive is a very enjoyable game worth taking a look at.\n\n===================================================================\n\nIf you enjoyed this review and found it helpful, then please consider following my curator page.

In one hour I was able to complete the first mission (the tutorial?) and quite enjoyed the RPG and RTS aspects this game employs. The atmosphere is quite unique, with the game largely taking place in beautifully detailed subterranean caverns on an alien world. The water effects are rendered quite well, and the graphics are definitely impressive for an indie developer's foray into Steam early access games.\n\nThe goal of the game is quite simple: build a hive to support your alien insects and produce units (or defensive turrets) to destroy the hostile creatures that litter the in game world. You must support your hive by producing workers that can supply food, minerals, and produce buildings using in game resources. Although the first level is understandably quite easy, I have heard that the other missions are quite challenging. As of this review, there are five missions in total.\n\nUnderstandably, as this is an early access game, there are a few bugs but nothing game breaking. When fighting enemy units, for example, sometimes only half of the enemy group will engage your army. The game also lacks some staple RTS features, like multiplayer or custom games. Once this game is released I'm sure more features will be added, so this is nothing major. I look forward to completing the remaining missions.\n\nIf you would like to watch some gameplay footage of this game, I have included an Early Access Preview video below:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILtUuQ9Cuc","March 10","true","1.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm very glad that I did.\n\nI'm a fan of older real time strategy games, like Age of Empires. I've found a lot of the more modern RTS games concentrate more on combat. This game looks like it's shaping up to be more like an adventure/RTS game, with possible role play elements.\n\nDespite being in early development, the team have created a beautiful and fascinating game world and have a great concept. The game levels are full of detail and really show the potential that this alien Eden has. It also has an interesting back story, although that hasn't been explored fully yet. How do the Human colonists in the game intro fit into the tale of the emerging Hive? What happened to the ancients who built the ruins in the caverns below the surface.\n\nThe game concept and setting make this RTS game stand out. I'm very keen to see this game develop. Although there is a lot of work still to do, the developers have made an excellent and promising start. Definitely an RTS/adventure game to keep your eye on, or support in early access. With what is available to play so far, The Hive looks like it will be an interesting, relaxing and enjoyable RTS/adventure title, rather than a frenzied 'Zerg-Rush' style battle game. That really appeals to me.\n\n+ Original game concept with the emerging insect hive, and much potential for the story.\n+ Beautifully realised game levels and settings so far. The games concept artists have done an amazing job.\n+ A mix of older style RTS gameplay, like Age of Empires, and newer RTS innovations, such as building squads instead of individual units.\n\n- Still very early in development. Very stable game, seems well put together, but has limited content at time of writing.\n\nIf you like to support promising early access titles which promise something different, I'd encourage you to give this game a careful look.\n\nIf you're not so sure about paying for a title which is still in fairly early stages of development, I'd say keep your eye on this game. It has Cult Classic written all over it, at the very least. If it lives up to it's early promise, The Hive could easily end up being something very special.","March 28, 2015","true","2.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

But does it work?\nDisclaimer: Before you read further, even though I gave this game "thumbs up", I am only 50/50 on this one right now. My assessment is about whether it is worth your money or not, in Early Access. Keep that in mind.\n\nFor $20 you currently gain access to the Hive race (crab/crustacean creatures) with 3 buildings and few soldiers (about 4 types in total + workers). They can only be played in campaign (currently only 3 missions) with moderate enemy variety. I don't think this is currently worth $20 UNLESS you like the concept of [RTS + Puzzle game] combination and you want to support the developers as they add more content.\n\nOn the plus side, the developers are very passionate and dedicated about their work, and they respond to the players relatively well. If they maintain this level of commitment, The Hive has good potential. The are adding new features and content on a monthly basis. If you buy the game, you can see a TIMER that indicates exactly when the next update will be.\n\nGraphics: The Hive race reminds me of the Zerg but more like sea creatures than insects. The environment looks cute and grabs your attention with lots of details. Enemy monster design is very creative. I haven't seen anything like them in other games. The interface is very basic, but they are planning to add more tooltips and improvements with player feedback.\n\nSound: Music is repetitive, but the ambiant sounds are perfect for the environment. The voices that your fighters make are just ADORABLE! Overall, the sound is solid for early access.\n\nGameplay:\nBesides the standard (and very basic) RTS elements like building your base with workers, gathering resource and training fighters, you can also collect treasures (resources) and quest items (for puzzles) by clicking on them directly. Just like point-and-click games, you gotta zoom in and pay attention to details. Objects that "sparkle" indicate that you can interact with them.\nPuzzle solving is fun, but they need to add some random variables so that the solutions are different for the same puzzle in every playthrough. Otherwise, there will be little replayability and you will feel less motivated to play through it again (unless they add Multiplayer or Skirmish mode)\nYour workers can dig through the rubble in some areas to uncover minerals, but these locations are rare right now... and not very rewarding. They might contain hidden treasures with future patches.\n\nThere are some odd bugs and/or poor coding (such as your soldiers attacking themselves if you right click on them while they are selected OR units clipping through terrain and, rarely, getting stuck). But I am confident that they will be fixed soon.\n\nEarly Access rating: 6/10\nYou can finish the campaign in about 2 hours, so content is little compared to the price. Right now, I only recommend buying it if you like the concept and wish to support the developers.\n\nCheck out my campaign playthrough for more details. I hope you find it useful! :)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMvv59t9KSQ&index=1&list=PLP90♥♥♥lxXzhlZDAd7hyIZt4fXxXZ1xmk","May 6, 2015","true","11.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The game is in early access version 0.03.\n\nThe game is a strategy game reminicent of an RTS like age of empires but with more of a story type of element. The game has you piloting an alien insectoid species. There is definitely some really cool ideas that the developers are working with here. I believe I read somewhere that you would eventually be able to evolve your species to gain buff and whatnot. As of yet, there is very limited actual in game content, which is to be expected sometimes in early access games.  Eventually there could definitely be an amazing game here, but I think there is too little to justify purchasing it as of yet.\nIf you watch some videos or read some stuff and decide you want to support the developers like I did, hope they create a great game, and want to be involved in some feedback here and there, then by all means get it. But if on the fence, I'd have to say wait until there is a little more meat to the game to decide whether or not you want to get it. I'll keep and eye on it and change my reccomend option when/if the game gets to the point where it's worth buying for the average person. But it just doesn't have enough playability/function as some of the other early access games out there. But again, take this review as an extremely early opinion on whether to buy, not as the quality of a final game to come. It definitely has a lot of potential.","January 25, 2015","false","0.7"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","3"

What I got was a Warcraft 2 style game only with ¾ of the content taken out.\n\nYou can finish the solo campaign in less than 2 hours and there are no skirmish options or multiplayer just the campaign. As far the strategy in RTS there is none the npc just stand at their base (normally 3-5 guys per camp) and wait for you to attack them.\n\nWorkers build gather resources but can only build 3 buildings a barracks, town hall (hive) and a resource-depo, you can only build 2 types of soldier range and melee. there’s a cap to how much soldier you can build ( 3 rangers,4 melee) but that don’t matter because just 1 melee unit  can take out 1 npc\n\nIt is on early access but it’s barely a game more of a teaching tool for toddlers on how to play a RTS.

The whole game can be completed in about 10-20 minutes due to the fact that as of writing there are two levels in it. This game was released on Oct 9th, 2014 with a single level so that means in three months they have released one stage. Also you do not play anything that is in the trailers of the game! The whole part where you dig out those blocks, not there. There is no mining in this game, nor is there any unit progression.\n\nNow please make no mistake when I say rough I do not mean difficult, I mean rough as in unrefined. I really hope this game becomes better because in its current state it’s nearly unplayable. I would call this game a prototype at very best or an amazingly rough outline. What I see is something that could be very neato but what I was presented was an interesting but barely cooked chicken dish. You can't eat barely cooked chicken my friends, nor can you play a barely made game.\n\nList of things that are particularly rough:\n\nThe fact that the voice acting changes from the first stage to the second.\n\nAnimations in general pretty not great.\n\nThe main boss of the first stage gets shrunk down to become a common enemy is a thing.\n\nRecolor/textures of enemies being changed to become a new enemy is quite excessive (lack of verity in general in modeling, too much reuse).\n\nCould use a lot of sound work in general, with a intense lack of feed back sound effects (click a unit it makes a quip, tell it to do something another quip).\n\nLack of any and all unit statistics, zero information to tell what a unit can do number wise.\n\nThere is VERY little feed back when I take actions. I give shift commands, no icons appear on the ground (such as small arrows pointing to the spots I clicked), also there are NO build progress bars in this game for units! If I select a unit producing building and press a unit icon to build there is nothing telling me I am building said unit. The sheer lack of information in this game is really, really awful.\n\nThe camera in this game is absolutely cancerous, I’m not trying to be rude but it is one of the hardest to work with cameras I have ever had to deal with, not to mention border scrolling creates this awkward vibrating when you go too far instead of simply stopping.\n\nOverall lack of things going on. Now I realize not every RTS is a twitch micro game but the absolutely nothing is starting to really wear on me, and it’s only level 3. Also puzzles in an RTS? Interesting but a “walk on these tiles or you die” puzzle, really?\n\nLack of responsiveness of my units when I give commands.\n\nThe fact that if I rapidly right click something my ranged units will fire as fast as I right click/will only fire if I right click and not continuously from a single attack command.\n\nThe mini-map is very deceptive as in the view cone is more of a general direction of the direction of my camera and not actually covering the general area in which I can see.\n\nAnd worst sin of all, the drag selecting is absolutely awful. The fact that there is no visual drag box to tell what you are dragging over, or shift selecting is like removing the W key from an FPS game, or left click.\n\nCome on, you can do better than this. This could be an amazing game.\n\nOkay wow, so I wrote this while sitting at the end of the second mission screen and suddenly I am met with a "this is all that is left" screen. At 50% off you get around 15 minutes of gameplay for 9 dollars. At full price you are paying more USD in dollars than minutes of the game you can play. I feel amazingly ripped off, but if the game becomes actually made with some decent content in the next few years (considering it's current progress speed) than perhaps it'll be good, but for right now it's not worth a buy.","January 26, 2015","false","1.3"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","0"

It really isn't. It just doesn't hold a candle to the RTS games it tries to emulate. It's not as sophisticated as Warcraft 3 or Starcraft 1. And it really wants to be Warcraft 3... the campaign that is. The only thing it has new are various puzzle elements. But there's no Warcraft lore, there are no grand scale battles and really, it gets tedious in under half an hour.\n\nIt's still early, and I did get it cheaply so maybe try it out. But it won't ever be more than this.","May 25, 2015","false","0.8"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Do not get me wrong, The Hive is by no means a BAD game, its just not a good game. There is really nothing that sets this game apart from other RTS games. I had fun for a little bit but after a while quickly got bored. I will definitely keep a close eye on the hive to see what unique aspects they introduce into it to give it its own touch but for now there is nothing that draws me back to the game.

Starts off with a human story, then you are playing as bugs without any introduction to them. /logic\n-The animations are bad. Really bad, just look at that sick moonwalking.\n-The sound is cloned from sc1/2.\n-Buildings and units are uninspiring.\n-AI, what AI?.\n\nSave your money, you may as well buy SC1/2 if you're looking for a colony/ant themed RTS.
