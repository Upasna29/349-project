The game takes five minutes, and has maybe 15 screens of minimalist retro gaming. It's pretty in its simplicity, and it challenges some gaming assumptions, but honestly if I had paid for it by itself rather than as part of a bundle, I'd be upset about it. It's a freeware game and has no more depth than that. Nice idea, decent execution, but so short it's embarrassing that they charge for it.","October 4, 2014","false","0.9"," 64 of 81 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","64","81","0","4"

In this way, PG had the chance to be a clever commentary on how many perceive these games, but instead it falls nauseatingly over itself in its attempts to make the most unquestionably pretentious game the internet could think up.\n\nPG is a story of lost love; soul mates turned divorcees, children abandoning their mother, players losing themselves to drunkenness, and death taking them all in the end. It's depressing to say the least, or it could be if it managed to make me feel anything at all. PG constructs itself as a tone deaf joke; content to paint a shallow picture of life with its simplistic blocks, never stopping to attempt to reflect the real joy and heartache we all experience, while reveling in its own self loathing. Any narrative that's left is nothing more than one individuals misguided view of reality, stemming either from their own experiences or what they perceive them to be like having not experienced them firsthand.\n\nIt almost seems irrelevant to talk about PG's gameplay, as through 45 minute game it changes and breaks its own rules so often for the sake of its rubbish narrative that's there is little left to define it by. It's a platformer that attempts to hide its blandness behind worthless dialog and an abundance of underdeveloped mechanics, lacking in every regard and managing to be incredible tedious despite how little you are required to do to complete levels. There's nothing here I could pick out as engaging or original, similarly matching the narrative its emptiness and attempts to emulate other games but barely scratching the surface of their design.\n\nDespite the loathsome name, I had hope that Keybol's square love story would be more than first impressions lead me to believe. Instead it's exactly what it says it is: a pretentious game that completely misses the point of the games it is making fun of, while simultaneously showcasing how tone deft many are to other games dubbed as "pretentious". It's memorably only for its failure at being nothing more than a misguided incarnation of overbearing, forced emotion and lopsided mechanics used improperly to move the story along. As a stalwart defender against the internet's unwavering determination to call everything deeper than the average shooter a pretentious mess, I say without reservation that yes, this is a pretentious game that should be ignored and forgotten in the hopes others don't use it as a blueprint for anything more than how not to attempt to say something deeper with a video game.","July 10, 2014","false","0.8"," 76 of 103 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","76","103","0","3"

It is pretentious. However, if it wants a title descriptive of the experience, "Bad Game" would also suffice.\n\nIt does tell a very basic story in some kinda interesting ways (which I don't want to go into in any detail, potentially spoiling it for anyone), but ultimately the gameplay leaves a lot to be desired. It is very basic 2D platforming. There are occasional twists such as clicking on characters to hold them in place, or walking on invisible platforms. The first time it introduces these mechanics it explains them via storyline related text, but in additional cases these are completely unexplained. On one screen I was left completely perplexed as to what I was supposed to be doing until I discovered some invisible platforms to which there was absolutely no indication that they were there. That is just bad game design.\n\nThere are four short chapters. It won't take you more than half an hour to complete the entire game. There are claims that more chapters will be available "soon", but other reviews from 6 months ago state the same thing, so whether or not these chapters will ever exist remains to be seen.\n\nUltimately, it's trying to do the whole Thomas Was Alone kind of thing, but does it much less successfully, and with bad gameplay mechanics.

Pretentious Game may try to lull you into its grasp by its self-aware title, but do not be fooled, it is exactly one of those Newgrounds games where a thing loves another thing and then it conveys itself through tedious platformer mechanics.\n\nWhile a few of the puzzles are somewhat interesting, the game mechanics are rudimentary and the storytelling is outright bland, bordering on awful. A girl square loves a boy square, one of the squares cheats on another, yet another square dies, etc. While you can try to derive meaning from how the little poetic bits of narration correlate to the mechanics you're meant to understand on the level, the game has very, very little to offer beyond that.\n\nIt is a very simple, uninteresting piece of work I do not recommend getting even for a fraction of the price while on sale. If you're interested in these types of games, I'd suggest something with a more powerful narrative to it (such as dys4ia) or something with more creative mechanics (such as problem attic - though problem attic is a very difficult game to swallow, it's certainly more interesting than this waste of time).","July 27, 2015","false","0.8"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","18","21","0","0"

This is a very nice trick, while some of the levels are esoteric it best, that single line of text will always lead you to solving the puzzle of each level.\n\nThe story revolves around A man, his wife, his mistress, the resulting children and even you the player all represented as boxes of various colours and how their various lives intertwine. Each level usually revolves around moving one of the story's players to either the other side or to one of the other characters but with a trick.  For example one level revolves around the character feeling invisible, so they are, only a little puff of dust is visible where they land.  While another claims the character has become self absorbed and only thinking of herself so the screen is zoomed in very close to the player and you can only see the close surrounds making the level much more difficult than it should be.  A nice little commentary on today's narcissistic culture.\n\nThe game is very short and I'm not sure if I can recommend paying full price, all three chapters and the epilogue will take less than an hour and there is no real challenge in the platforming.  I really enjoyed it but what each player will get out of it will probably depend on how the story affects you, but hey, we were all probably in love with a pink box at one time!","July 10, 2014","true","1.7"," 37 of 58 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","37","58","0","0"

Now I have voted five stars on Kongregate for the first three chapters that you find there for free (the fourth one doesn't seem to work). So it isn't that bad, yes? Yes, it is indeed a nice little game if you don't have to pay for it. The gameplay and story are nicely delivered, although at one point unfair, and it is a nice experience. However, with a total of around 40 minutes of gameplay for all the four chapters I see no justification for charging five dollars or your local equivalent. Yes, you can buy it if you want to support the developer, and some levels are redone for the Steam version, but otherwise I would recommend you playing this for free instead.\n\nThe graphics are minimalistic, the sound is not memorable.

Ultimately, this is not a game I would recommend to people seeing as how it doesn't really have enough actual game-play to it, but I still think it's interesting enough for people to consider looking at.\n\nThe Pretentious Game is another one of those titles that has the sole intention of potraying a story and conveying a message, while it certainly succeeds in it's aim to convey a message (quite a powerful one at that), it isn't a game, it is just another lecture.\nI am a fan of platformers, including minimalistic ones so this game looked like something I would enjoy, for the sake of £0.99 I thought it would be worth looking at... it was, but it certainly wasn't what I had hoped for. There is close to no gameplay whatsoever, it has a few puzzles that require little thinking to overcome and as far as platforming goes, there is no challenge here at all. Pretentious Game is nothing more than an intereactive story I'm afraid, you would get the same result watching a play-through on YouTube as you would going through Pretentious Game yourself.\n\nThomas Was Alone is a good example of what this game likely attempted to set out to be, it does a great job of telling a story while using minimalistic graphics and also has enough actual game-play and platforming in it to justify calling it a game. Pretentious Game doesn't, The best thing about it is the message it conveys, that's a fact. It is powerful and can really make you think about your own life and situation, so it definitely has that going for it.\nIf you are into games that are more like interactive poems then I would say check this game out regardless of the lack of gameplay it has to offer. It's not something I regret purchasing, but it's not something that I would play again.","March 31, 2015","false","1.6"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

I think you can even just play the chapters online if you looked it up! It's neat how the game puts together the narrative with the gameplay, which will give the player a hint on how to progress, but other than that nothing much about this game is very praise worthy. It really is a Pretentious Game.\n\nPretentious Game focuses on the story of this small cast of characters represented with colored squares that slide along the ground with no walking animation (just like all those crappy horror games the internet loves so much!). The story centers on the conflicts of relationships and love, and it serves its purpose of invoking emotion in people who actually pay attention to the story. It's nothing groundbreaking or special, really, but it's unique in the way that it gives a single hint in the form of a sentence for the players to continue on.\n\nThough that's where some of the game's faults can be found. In one part, in which you expect the narrative to lead the way, you have to somehow figure out there's invisible platforms to get to the end goal of the chapter's level. As much as I hate invisible platforms, it was made way worse when the narrative doesn't seem to have anything to do with how the level should work.\n\nThe fourth chapter has to be one of my least favorite chapters, really. It kind of repeats characteristics for these two characters, adding nothing really to the story. Yeah, I get it, they're very close and help each other out. This chapter was  also the hardest in my opinion. Yet, it seems very unnecessary, like it was just the creator running out of ideas and having to fill the space with this whole chapter. Not to mention that it leaves players on a "cliffhanger" of sorts, teasing for another chapter which still has yet to be delivered. The other chapters didn't even have this cliffhanger before, and they felt complete on their own. This one, however, has all this filler just to have the last part of the chapter actually add something to the story.\n\nAnyway, I would not recommed buying this game on Steam. It doesn't even have any achievements or any added content to make it more enjoyable. Just look it up and play it on your web-browser if you want to.","June 18, 2015","false","1.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Pretentious Game isn't a game that I would wholeheartedly recommend to buy, especially not at full price, but it's not really a bad game by any means. At $2 price point, I would definitely recommend it, but at its full price of $5? That I'm not sure.\n\nThe game is short, really, really short that you can finish it at 15 minutes. Comparing even to the extremely short Sakura Spirit visual novel, the game worth even less than it in terms of worth by playtime mileage and development efforts. There is nothing really original about it, either, other games has done something to this effect and better. The ending is also another problem, as it feels like it came out of nowhere. If the game had been longer, all of the problems with this game would really be solved.\n\nNow, why do I still recommend it? Because I simply really really like the gameplay and narrative's connectment. One of my biggest gripe over JRPGs are that they are often disconnected in terms of story and gameplay, the gameplay feels meaningless and only serve as padding rather than something genuinely fun or challenging (exception exists, of course). Meanwhile, this game's presentation of narrative and gameplay really boosts each other up. The narrative, short as it was, gives a greater meaning to the gameplay as well as be the instruction while still being a story that doesn't break the fourth-wall, and the gameplay boosts the story as it feels like we're enacting the story ourselves.\n\nI like the concept, even if it's starting to get overdone, and considering that sales data are the language of video game financing and investment, I would rather pay for these kind of games to be made more than many other Tripple-A games. Not to mention that it means supporting the developers whom we can see from this game and their next game to be a creative bunch, perhaps had they had better support before, this game would have been longer and better.\n\nAt the end of the day, Pretentious Game is a flawed game, but it is a flawed yet meaningful game that I would definitely prefer to support than mindless games that are neither fun nor meaningful. If you have some spare money, go buy this game, if there is a sale on it, definitely go buy it.","April 6, 2015","true","0.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It has a heart, and a minor story. Though it's hard to recommend a game that's only an hour long, I do. I really do. I wouldn't pay the earth for it, but it's worth playing. If you're familiar with platformers, and the Karoshi games, some of it will be reasonably obvious to you, but it's delivered with panache. I found myself wanting to come back to it because of the nice, settled atmosphere.

Only with the price reduction to $1.24, is it worth it. Finished first (leisurely) playthrough within 20 minutes.\n\nThis game is like the name says: Pretentious. However, the gameplay itself is not pretentious; it is the name of the game which is pretentious.\n\nGameplay is pretty much straight forward, you do literally as it tells you. Block styled (simple) gameplay, average music as well as a short play through is what has made me initially thumbs down. After another playthrough I decided to change to a thumbs up (explained in next paragraph). However, if the price dropped below $1 (at least), I would consider encouraging others to purchase the game. I hope there will be more added.\n\nThe ending (chapter 1) was pretty anti-climatic and an eye-roller, but nonetheless, an acceptable ending. Story can be considered deep. While others hate the game I still think it is worth a play through (especially with the deal going on now), because many intellectual individuals who are willing to dig deeper will appreciate this game. It can be considered relatable, and gives you feels.\n\nRating at current price: 6/10\nRating at below $1: 7.5/10 (only because of the ending)","September 9, 2015","true","0.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

The first one or two Interestingly break with some conventions and purposefully ask the player to ignore rules seemingly set up previously. The following chapters switch perspectives between various "charactes" (which are personified in similar ways as done in "Thomas Was Alone") and tell their interweaving relationships. It's about (flawed, unfullfilled) love, loss, misunderstanding and about some fates ending and others beginning. It's even more minimalistic than Thomas Was Alone. There is only one music track, no narration/voice acting, and barely any other audio. The game is offering less varied visuals than Thomas Was Alone. It was an interesting play, but a short one. Steam tells me I have 1 hour on it, should be about right, and I'm done with it already. Not sure if I would recommend it to buy at it's current full price for it's shortness and lack of challenge. It's very easy to play, mostly relaxing, except for the last chapter which has more difficult platforming parts, they are becoming some detailed jump work and spacebar hitting towards the end. Some of them may be close to frustrating, one or two for the wrong reasons perhaps, like your "character" clipping through boxes he jumps on into pits of fire. More chapters seem to be planned. The story could be seen as finished mostly, though the last chapter leaves some questions open regarding the perspective of one character and so I'm curious to see some more chapters added.","July 4, 2014","true","1.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Only historians scrabbling at the sand and dust covered remains of our civilization will know if Pretentious Game is one of them.\n\nI've reviewed many a game, yet not nearly enough in the public view on Steam. I've enjoyed the relative unreknown of spouting my opinions in the mere earshot of my friends and colleagues. Not that I don't think they didn't appreciate my input, as I am truly an independent man with no corporate masters, no ties to any corruption, or even accountability for mainstream taste, but rather the situation is that I have not truly subjected myself to the trials and tribulations of actually going out there and casting my net far and wide and taking the richly deserved flack that I would recieve for going against the groupthink that lies at the dark rotten heart of our society. Looking at our current political landscape, at the intolerance and pointless squabbling for power, it is easy to look at a game like this and judge it for something as lowly and unremarkable as trying too hard to conform to some alien notion of what a game should be. Worse yet, for failing to be aware of current social mores. A blue square, I hear you say unbelievingly, a blue square can approach and win a pink square. What a ridiculous stereotype to be perpetuating on the blues and pinks of the world! Even worse, to be disregarding the other colors of the rainbow who are silently erased as the other. Yet at the heart of this simple dynamic is a time-tested storytelling technique employed by some of the greats of our industry. A matter of motivation, a goal thrown to the player to be immediately grasped and reached toward, one that can immediately push the story forward despite the obstacles the game presents.\n\nOne could remark that the gameplay does expand throughout the story but does not complete itself, creating and disposing various elements without rhyme or reason. This remark would not be wholly undeserved but much like the geocities websites of the 90s that were adorned with those tirelessly working men, this game makes no pretentions that it is in fact a complete game: for now there are only four chapters. In future chapters there will be room to expand on the gameplay mechanics, to make them work with each other, to expand the Pretentious Game-verse. Naturally within this expanded game there will also be opportunity to make plenty of references to cater to the particular palate of our contemporary video game enthusiast. Some have naturally remarked of the game's similarity to Thomas Was Alone and it is an entirely understandable observation. My own intellect naturally pondered the teleportation mechanics of Portal, the mind-bending alternate physics of The Bridge, the split second strategic ponderings of Magicka, the unleashed player creativity of Minecraft and many more too numerous to name in this short space.\n\nBut you are not reading this review of the game that could be, you care about this game--as it is--rising from the ashes like a phoenix reborn: is Pretentious Game good? Well, I took this time to consult the dictionary and there are truly many variations on what the word good means. Morally excellent; virtuous; righteous; pious: good? No, I must remark that video games in general lack the ability to exercise moral judgment. Satisfactory in quality, quantity, or degree: good? I was satisfied with at least one of the quality, quantity or degree of this video game. Of high quality; excellent. good? Seems too circular for definitive comment. Right; proper; fit: good? Well-behaved: good? Kind, beneficent, or friendly: good? These again seem to attribute a moral capacity to video games that they currently do not have. honorable or worthy; in good standing: good? Well, if all it takes is my mere say-so to make this game good, then I shall say\n\noh yeah this game is pretentious, so of course i liked it. a person worried about value for money should note that i won the game in five minutes. i spent considerably more time writing this review than i did playing the game. if the title pretentious game did not make you quirk your lips into a sort of unappreciative half-smile this game is probably not for you. is that good enough for you?","December 8, 2014","true","0.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

You figure out how each stage is completeted through the text that's presented to you and it makes for a really interesting experience. It can be quite rewarding and compelling when you figure out how to get to the level by interpreting the text correctly.

In Pretencious Game you play as cubes who try to get to theyre lover. With words telling the story about theyre love. So how is the Prententious Game ? Overall its a pretty decent game. The platforming in this game is pretty fluid and the words effect they way you play. The game is an expansion of a flash game so i had to track down the flash game to compare on what they added and they added a lot stuff. But there are some things that i dont like. The game is incredibly short around 50 to 40 minutes long but they are planning on adding stuff to it later so im hoping to expand the universe. The game also has some confusing puzzles but overall its a pretty decent. Overall its a fun platformer that i suggest you pick up. Fun platforming, great story and some minor things that ruin the expierence.

I just finished Thomas Was Alone and played this only to find it is much of the same.  However that's not a bad thing.\n\nPretentious Game is not for everyone.  It is not a hardcore platformer, it's not a puzzle platformer (though there is some puzzling), but it does get artsy as so many indie games do now.  It only took me a hour and a half to beat it.  I can't tell much of the story because I don't want to spoil it, you're better off playing it yourself.\n\nAs for the gameplay you'll have to manage Tetris blocks again and jump on top of each other (or of course platforms) to get to the end of the level.  It isn't too hard, if you get stuck just try a different method or jump around until something happens.  At times it does break the fourth wall, for example it forces you to simply wait for ten seconds or turn the music off at like two levels.  Unfortunately that's as interesting as it gets in the gameplay part, but just like Thomas Was Alone you're playing it for the story.  Music is nothing special either, it's like one sad piano track playing over and over (or at least that's what it sounded like to me).\n\nJust keep in mind you have to use the keyboard as there is no controller support (as of now).  Use Joy2Key if you must.  Last thing I'd say is wait for this to be in a Steam bundle or a good sale, it's simply too short and unrewarding to pay full price for.  However if you get the chance and want an easy game to kill an hour with, Pretentious Game is a good choice.\n\nPS It looks like this is originally a series of flash games and an IOS game.  I guess you can sample this game elsewhere.  Also supposedly there is going to be more levels added in the future.  I'll keep this game installed for a few more months, if it updates then I'll play those and revise this review if necessary (doubt it though).","September 23, 2014","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's nothing here I could pick out as engaging or original, similarly matching the narrative its emptiness and attempts to emulate other games but barely scratching the surface of their design."\n\nThis is a bad game(TM). The gameplay is dull, the visuals are dull, the sound design is dull, the story is dull. It successfully parodies only itself.

No, there is a way better game that haves so much mor impact on you, betterly crafted and for free on gamejolt called "i saw her standing there" that does this much better even though it doesnt breaks the fourth wall like this one in game mechanics the emotional impact is so much more superior.\n\nThis is a game that have been done before and knows thst it´s pretentious, that is the only difference.\n\nAtleast the music is nice, i´ll give it that.","March 26, 2015","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While that may be skewed by having played it there first, I believe that the simplistic and clunky gameplay feels a lot more natural on that platform. As for how it lives up to its title, I feel bad calling it pretentious but it really does feel very pretentious without actually having much to say.\nPretentious Game explores some gameplay ideas which are ineteresting but that I had mostly seen before in experiemental flash games like the This is the Only Level series. The storyline feels frankly rather bland until quite late in the game and it ends incomplete with the promise of adding more later, which is okay on mobile but it feels very unsatisfying when played on the pc.\nThe style feels like a budget Thomas Was Alone which, while being a bit more expensively priced, is overall a much better experience.","June 7, 2015","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Going "aww" and "oh no..."\nThat said, this is a pretty neat game that I played twice just to let the whole story sink in.\n\nPros;\n+ Easy to play. You learn what you need to do very quickly.\n+ Puzzles are relatively simple. The levels only become different in small steps. The text/phrases you get every level are enough to hint what you need to do.\n+ Some of the puzzles are very clever and brilliantly thought up. This game doesn't only make you use your arrowkeys, but also makes you experiment, use the mouse, the mute button, etc. The game mechanism really enhances the strength of the story and doesn't hold it back.\n+ The story is told in a minimalistic art style which made it easy to understand.\n+ And the story is pretty good. It was a bit simple, but made me very emotional because of it.\n\nCons;\n- I had a lot of difficulty at the (hidden?) fourth chapter that featured the two children. This was because of a jump trick you needed to do several times in a row. Needless to say, it made me suffer immensely and I never want to play that chapter ever again.\n- The game is short (but sweet!). I replayed the first three chapters and managed to entertain myself for 101 minutes total. Sometimes I wish the game was a bit longer.\n- I really hate how sudden the car scenes were and the (short) noises that came with it. I am a very sensitive gamer, so noises like that and sudden motions make me very uncomfortable. It was a bit of a jumpscare for me.\n\nSo is this game worth your money? Depends on if you think the price of the game is worth around 1~2 hours of gaming entertainment. For me it was worth it. Despite all the negativity in my review, I am very happy to have played this and the story will probably stick in my mind for a week or so.\n\nI think this game is great for the casual gamer.
