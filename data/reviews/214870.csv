Every time   you kill  one of the hell spawn  using a variety of  exotic looking weapons, for example  a wooden stake gun that skewers   enemies to  walls.  The projectile  can be more effective againts larger enemies if shot from a distance as it will eventually catch fire and  do more damage.  All of the weapons in the Painkiller franchise  have a secondary  fire mode and in this case the secondary  fire (using the RMB) mode (accessed by using the right mouse button)  see's a grenade launched, which explodes on impact if you hit  an enemy directly.  There are also  other weapons such as the electro driver that shoots shurikens and  releases  lightning if you use the secondary fire,  there's a rocket launcher and chaingun combo.  Hell  & Damnation also has a new gun called the soulcatcher, which  shoots blades and   the secondary fire  shoots a beam that catches   souls, which makes it easier to retrieve them.  When using the primary  and secondary   fire in combination you can  force an enemy to fight for you. Then there's the ubiquitous default weapon, the   painkiller,  a saw like weapon that  can chop an opponent in half, or, if used correctly mince    them to shreds;  it's secondary  fire  shoots out  a blade,  which when   fired at a wall creates an energy beam between the weapon and the blade that slices through anything in its path.  Very useful  in creating a barrier between you and  the oncoming wave of  hell spawn   if the blade and energy beam are  placed  correctly.  If you continue to  use the secondary  weapon on a already dead   enemy shooting at it several times will produce a gold coin (this is commonly  called Monster Juggling) .  Once a hell spawn is dead  it will disappear and leave a soul behind, which appears as a bright mist which  you have to   collect  quickly before  it dissipates. (using the soulcatcher can greatly  help in this regard).   A couple of   the dlc  for this game also includes  new weapons called The Morgenstern and The Cannon.\n\n\nThere's virtually no   end to the waves of   these  spawn  attacking you  from start to finish  as you travel through the various area's of the  game;  (there are 4 chapters   divided into 14  stages).   The story has been changed slightly from the original  game, but it's still just a tweaked version of Painkiller Black.\n\n\nThe developers have basically   cut out  chapters from the original Painkiller Black and released them as dlc.  The total price of  these dlc  is almost £40 when not on sale and the basic game costs another £17.99, plus you can buy an upgrade to the deluxe edition which includes some extra's that were never included with the original game    for example  tarot cards.\n\nTo be honest, no matter how much I enjoyed playing this game,   I'd advise anyone   strapped for cash to get  the Painkiller Black edition, which is basically the same game  (includes the original game plus the first expansion 'Battle out of Hell' ).   The main difference between the two is  Hell & Damnation  has better graphics, but  they aren't  worlds apart  considering the original is 10 years old now, and definitely doesn't justify the  extortionate price of the upgraded Hell & Damnation.  Painkiller Black may not have the soulcatcher or the two new weapons included with the dlc, but its  much better value for money at only £10.   In the sales you can get this game for as little as £2.50.\n\nIf you  get the deluxe upgrade or buy the  tarot cards separately they can add an extra   layer of gameplay.  They  are used to unlock  perks when you meet certain  conditions during  play which can enhance combat.  The game also has a cooperative mode which is   quite fun.  In this mode you must collect all souls otherwise   some  enemy come back to life.\n\nIf you're a fan of  the original series, you'll probably buy this, otherwise I advise stick with the Black Edition, it's far better value for money.\n\n\nPainkiller Black gameplay video HERE\n\nHell & Damnation game play video HERE\n\nYou can see that the updated version  has a little more atmosphere, for example  in the graveyard the  mist is deeper  and the  graphics are  sharper, the weapons look shinier etc, otherwise it looks virtually the same.\n\nIf you are a regular player  you probably won't get more than around 5 hours of game play out of this title.","January 13, 2014","false","18.7"," 248 of 307 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","248","307","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jeefk0/recommended/214870/","jeefk0","Jeefk0","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jeefk0/","311 products in account","For a start, this game is an absolute copy of the original Painkiller, and because of that, especially If you're new to the franchise, I'd strongly recommend getting Painkiller - Black Edition instead of this. Reasoning? The original one (here it is on Steam) has 24 levels + 10 amazing bonus expansion levels, compared to 14 of Hell and Damnation, which were taken from different parts of the original game. That's much more content for a lesser price. Besides, the original Painkiller has the best credits theme ever, but that's just for my taste. But, if you're here for a bit better graphics and steam achievements, Hell and Damnation is probably your game of choice.  OR IS IT?\n\n[Graphics]\nThe graphics look almost exactly the same. I have no idea how the developer managed to do that, but the remade game feels and looks exactly the same as the original. Good work on that. Yes, the shaders are better, maybe some extra lightning and bump-mapping.. but during your regular non-stop bunnyhopping demon hunting you don't really have a chance to admire that beauty, so I wouldn't say Hell and Damnation is worth buying if you're only looking for a fancy picture. Unreal Engine 3 works great and provides with a smooth picture here, but there are other games around which look much better and on which I'm not rambling here because they're not Painkiller.\n\n[Sound]\nAs for the sound of H&D, it is solid metal great. Mostly original Painkiller music tracks with a few new ones, which sound very fitting too. All ingame sounds, including shooting and growling, are done very nicely too. My only concern is the lack of a cool vocal credits theme.\n\n[Achievements and Multiplayer]\nYou're not going to 100% this game achievementwise, unless you're ready to buy a whole package of odd dlcs, and convince at least some of your friends of buying that game to play multiplayer together. Yep, it's pretty deserted in mp, but you can always go for some coop walkthrough.  As for the dlcs, I've heard that the one called 'Heaven's Above' adds a bird's eye view, how cool is that? Yeah, pretty absurd, but I don't think you need to buy this particular dlc for any achievements, so there's at least that.\n\n[Gameplay and Plot]\nThe gameplay is really brisk, as expected from a Painkiller game. You're jumping around and killing tons of running towards you enemies, fun times! Hell and Damnation actually added 1 new weapon, which allows you to collect souls from a distance, and that's a pretty interesting new feature. Other than that, you have your old reliable shotty, stakes, and all the rest of the original Painkiller and Painkiller: BOH (the expansion) weapons. As for the plot, this game has traditionally close to none, so don't even try finding any sense or hidden messages here. Daniel is good, daemons are bad, go kill them, that's all you need to know.\n\n[Difficulty]\nAfter beating Hell and Damnation on the last difficulty, I realized, that it's Hellishly easy. And I'm not being overly-hardcore here, but playing it on Nightmare seems to be the most proper way of getting at least some sort of a challenge and the good old Painkiller experience. The unlockable Trauma difficulty doesn't really add much to it, provided you managed to get through the previous one and got all of the cards. The Tarot Cards unlocking process is also sort of simplified: most of the times you don't even have to look up your Tarot unlocking conditions, and you still 'achieve' a card or two by the end of the level. The original Painkiller game had something much tougher than that. Like a no-hit Tarot challenge.\n\n[Altogether]\nPainkiller: H&D is a fun game, which ends just before you can get bored of it. The only big concern is the price of the game, which bites a lot, especially if you want to get the full package with every level and achievement available. H&D offers less content than the original Black Edition, but it has a bunch of extra sweets, like an extra halloween cemetary level, or easter eggs hunting, which is pretty awesome, because that's actually something new. If you manage to get your hands on H&D (and it's dlcs) during a sale, it's most likely worth your while and you're in for a hellishly fun ride!\nOr just go and buy it now, we need more people in multiplayer :P","February 7, 2014","true","43.4"," 129 of 159 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","129","159","0","4"

It seems that Painkiller really has not changed all that much since I last remember playing it.\n\nHell & Damnation keeps the spirit of the original gameplay and adds some new features, such as an upgrade to Unreal 3, new story line, and Steamworks integration.  Unfortunately it also seems to have a bit of a downgrade in the amount of campaign content.  I remember Painkiller having twice as many levels as Hell & Damnation.  What has happened is that half of the original levels were chosen to be included into the campaign and then the remainder were added-in via DLC.  This really takes a lot of the value out of the game as the original was twice as long and less expensive.\n\nThe game has stuck to it's original formula with little change.  The epic boss fights are still there.  Guns still feel great and the alt-fire modes give plenty of ways to dispatch hell's minions and the heavy metal soundtrack is as heavy hitting as the weapons.  The levels appear mostly the same as they were before and little has changed other than a few minor things here-and-there.\n\nI have also noticed a change in the voicing of Daniel Garner in this game.  It appears that John St. John (of Duke Nukem fame) does the voice acting for Daniel in Hell & Damnation.  I kept expecting to hear Duke one-liners every time I heard him talk!\n\nOverall the game was fun to play though I am dissapointed with the decision to remove half of the original content and repackage it as DLC.  I was fortunate to get Hell & Damnation as part of a bundle deal and purchased the DLC during a Steam sale at 80% off.  I would recommend Hell & Damnation if you can get it on sale.  Otherwise if you don't mind missing the visual upgrade to the Unreal 3 engine and the Steamworks bits, then Painkiller Black Edition is a better deal since it contains all of the original Painkiller content at less than the H&D price.","June 8, 2014","true","12.6"," 70 of 76 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","70","76","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/terry309/recommended/214870/","terry309","terry309","http://steamcommunity.com/id/terry309/","60 products in account","First of all, if you've never played Painkiller before DO NOT GET THIS GAME. I reccommend starting with Painkiller black as you get all the original 24 levels (including the last level which was cut from this game).\n\nPainkiller Hell And Damnation feels drastically differrent from the other games in the series, sure it's an HD remake of Painkiller Black but despite it's surprisingly accurate level design, this game uses a completely differrent engine to the original game, and that's not a good thing.\n\nThe original Painkiller used the Pain engine. The Pain engine was designed specifically for Painkiller to make it perform at 60fps with decent graphics (excellent visuals though despite the dated engine) to keep the fast paced gameplay and havoc physics running smoothly.\n\nPainkiller Hell And Damnation on the other hand uses the Unreal engine. As such a graphical improvement is to be expected... but for the most part, Painkiller Hell And Damnation just doesn't deliver in this department, some levels are just lazily recreated as if they were just copy/pasted (i'm looking at you Colosseum), most levels, whilst clearly show signs of improvement (particularly in the clutter and terrain) feel kind of lackluster. You have to remember that Hell And Damnation is NOT a HD port and sometimes it really feels like it is. Sure some levels recieved clear improvements and look so much better, Opera House and Train Station to name a few but i still find that there is a lot of room for improvement.\n\nIn addition to these issues, the Unreal engine synchronizes poorly with the gameplay, it's like a completely differrent game. Quickturning whilst bunnyhopping isn't as smooth as it was with the Pain engine and this is noticable right from the start, the game feels very rough around the edges. To make things worse, the hitboxes for the enemies are insane. Whilst they did increase the hitbox for the Painkiller's combo attack (about damn time), the enemies hitboxes are ridiculous, they can hit you so easily it's not even funny. This has led to some horrible difficulty spikes. I can run through Cemetary in Painkiller Black on Trauma without many problems. Playing Cenetary on Nightmare on the other hand was painful to do because of the hitboxes and the sheer speed of the enemies. This means that melee enemies are insanely tough and it also makes for some nasty difficulty spikes. Sure the original Painkiller's difficulty curve didn't win any awards but lets face it, after the first two levels it got harder and the difficulty went up from there. The first level, Cemetary is supposed to be an introductory level so surely it's easier than level 2. Wrong!\n\nIn fact, to make things worse, you don't even have the Painkiller for level 1, you have to get it in level 2. So if you run out of ammo, your only other option is to suck the enemies souls one by one till they're dead. One of the greatest things about the Painkiller is that it was versitile but to remove it from the first level removed an important learning curve for the player. I swear i died so many times on Cenetary it's laughable... and that was on Nightmare. In the original game i can breeze through it easily on Trauma and that is simply because of the way the engine works in Hell And Damnation. It's horrible. Put simply, the gameplay in Painkiller Hell And Damnation is the worst in the series. Sure Painkiller Ressurrection had godawful level design but at least they didn't ♥♥♥♥ with the gameplay. After all it was a mod using the Pain engine which was used to make the gameplay for the original Painkiller so what do you expect?\n\nSo why do i reccommend this game? Simply because of it's DLC. Put simply if you're going to get this, you'll probably want to get the complete collection on sale. Painkiller Hell And Damnation certainly isn't bad, just not as good as the original. Like i said, some of the re-worked levels look really nice but the majority of the effort was put into the DLC. Asylum and Snowy Bridge are drastically differrent from the original game and to play them you need Hell and Damnation and they are honestly worth playing. Now believe me, i hate what they did with the DLC and i highly encourage you do not support this practice. If you see the complete collection for sale cheap though, i'd say go for it since you're getting the DLC packs with it only having paid a fraction of the cost. Do not buy the DLC separately though, i can't stress this enough!!!","May 6, 2015","true","25.5"," 68 of 77 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","68","77","3","0"

As it is a remake it offers better graphics and better sound effects and music. And of course we now have achievements! This I would normally say is a really good thing as you can practically relive the experience you had with the vanilla game. This is good, right? We should bow before Farm 51 and Nordic Games for making this possible, am I right?\n\nUnfortunately, no. I do not really have anything against DLCs but when DLCs are required to have the full gaming experience I consider it a mistake. What happen here is that Hell and Damnation offers only half of the campaign. In fact, while these had a theme in the original game and were divided up properly into chapters we now have a mess. A rather weird mix of levels and as half of them are missing you can spend more money to obtain all the missing stages. They did create some new levels and boss battles and weapons and also enemy types but these I believe were completely unnecessary.\n\nIf Farm 51 had just remade all levels and released them at once without having to stick with DLCs I would have easily recommended this game. If you do not mind spending some extra money then perhaps you may find the remake interesting. Otherwise, pick up the Black Edition of the vanilla game and complete it once more and leave this version to those who are new to the franchise so they may not be deterred by this version.","March 27, 2014","false","7.3"," 98 of 122 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","98","122","0","0"

But the rule of cool can only carry you so far, and subsequent expansions and sequels either failed to match the spirit of the original or just didn't deliver anything we hadn't seen before. Unfortunately, Hell and Damnation is just another such title. It doesn't even know if it wants to be a reboot or a sequel, and the vaunted new graphics aren't even anything to write home about in this day and age.\n\nCampaign mode is woefully short, should only take you the best part of a day or two unless you invest in any of the DLC, which only serves to bulk the game up to what it should have been in the first place. There's also apparently a multiplayer mode featuring all the usual modes like Capture the Flag. Is it any good? Does anybody besides me even play this anymore?\n\nThe best any Painkiller veteran can hope for playing through this expecting the old buzz will be a feeling of mostly "... meh."

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/214870/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Painkiller Hell & Damnation was made by Farm 51 and released in 2012. It's a remaster/remake of original Painkiller, Hell & Damnation stand for HD. A funny one at that - story-wise it's a sequel, gameplay-wise it's remake. Usually it opposite. It doesn't have so many single-player levels, quite few, developers payed more attention to multiplayer part instead. But hey, even such remake is great when the only things that Painkiller was getting for few years were awful expansion packs.\n\nTechnically, it's fine enough. As fine as Unreal 3 Engine allows. Loading time is good. Performance is good. Has nice amount of video options. Aside from having issue on my laptop where game will stutter more and more the longer it runs. But that's laptops for you.\n\nMultiplayer is where developers payed more attention. There is a bunch of competive games. Even more, there is a survival mode for up to 8 players. And even better, you can play campaign with a friend. Coop mode is something always wanted in Painkiller Black Edition. So it's awesome even if it's 2-players only. So it all should give you a reason to buy this game despite owning Black Edition.\nBut community is dead. I see absolutely no servers online. So, I am afraid, multiplayer part isn't actual anymore. Well, competive part. Can always drag friend into coop.\n\nStory follows Daniel after events of main game. Like, many ages after that. Or unknown time, but Eve isn't queen anymore. And it's all in the past. Well, I guess we can take it that all expansion packs after Overdose weren't canon. Daniel still travels around purgatory with no big reason, until he meets Death, who demands 7000 souls. Don't worry, this game is not sequel to Painkiller Redemption which had 1000 monsers per level, you don't actually have to do that in a game.\nAnd well, you will see few cutscenes after that. And in these cutscenes you will be wondering why everybody is being so dumb. Actions don't make sense around motivations. Let's forget about it already.\n\nSo, what we are left with is a single-player portion of remake. Well, let's do numbers. This game has 9 main campaign levels plus 4 campaign boss levels. Plus it has one bonus level Factory. Plus 3 thematic small bonus levels. And you can get Christmas Trainstation bonus level DLC for free. And it also has two more bonus levels Labs and City on Water in "DLC Levels" for free, which makes no sense. So simple game purchase gets you 20 levels or so. But Black Edition had over 30 unique ones. So it's still feels like mini-version.\n\nBut if you care about DLC, then it should bring number close to Black Edition, also having some unique ones, like top-down DLC levels. I probably should be complaining about DLC milking, but damn, whole Painkiller Complete Pack goes on big sales sometimes where it becomes totally worth it.\n\nAnd to be honest, I wish they wouldn't be afraid to remix levels to bring their own strenght. The way that levels in the game work, they are usually accurate with few lacking details. Like, it doesn't show off physics as much. But sometimes it also gives small improvements. Like, the lamp in Opera House doesn't crash down, which was impressive in Black Edition. But it has witches rocking on scene.\n\nSometimes it's clear improvement, both in graphics and small details. Trainstation is one of them. Small scene, additional types of enemies. Better looking. The train section itself even changed geometry slightly to allow monsters to chase you more effeciently, instead of using freaking stairs everytime you change spot in Black Edition.\nAnd sometimes it's more on lacking side. Take orphanage as example. While outside it's slightly changed and even teases you at upcoming boss, which is nice detail seen few times in a game, once you get inside, it's pretty much copy-pasted geometry from original. Unreal 3 doesn't help to enhance noticeably. Actually, lighting feels a little off there, with overly bright flashlight and not enough darkness. And there is no small detail like a toy ball bouncing down the stairs. The different end of the map is nice in theory but ended up awkward on practise, due to not exactly knowing what to do next.\nI didn't try DLC yet though, maybe they did it better there.\n\nGameplay-wide it pretty much stayed the same. Almost. This time around the hero drags along 8 weapons. 5 original and 2 from Battle Out Of Hell. And there is new additional Soulcatcher weapon, which shoots group-clearing saws and can catch soul and can even make enemies join your side, becoming powered-up as well. I will never get tired of watching fights between enemies in FPS games, really. And it helps to pull souls too. Not to mention that it's awesome to see leg of shielded crusader get cut out with a saw.\n\nYes, if there is one clear improvement then it got to be gore. Things still go flying from shotgun blasts. But this time you may also see a hand fly somewhere else, while the main body hits the wall and leaves blood all over it. So yes, it's quite satificatory if what you want from games is violence and guts.\n\nThough it lacks some enemies, like those stereotypical "Woaaah!" bikers. But also brings new ones along. Mostly reusage of errr fat meat cutter. And those fast skeletons. Spooky. And it dares to use kids from Orphanage in other levels as well, which I don't approve so much.\nBosses stay pretty much same. Only feel easier. Mini-bosses are mostly cut down, in most cases replaced by group of mini-boss from the first level. But hey, at least those stupid "puzzle" bosses were cut too, save for one in Orphanage.\n\nBalance pretty much stayes the same. Just small details. Like, stake gun can kill the flying undead with helmet in Cathedral from one shot, which I approve. Yet the gun that shoots 5 stakes feels worse than stakegun, somehow. Especially at distance. All while Battle Out Of Hell would tell you that it's sniper's dream.\nIn all honesty, gunplay here feels like having a bunch of toys. You just pick few favourites and stick to them. Because they all do fine. And there is a lot of ammo. So the game doesn't force you to switch guns much, you don't have to think about that. Which makes combat feel more repetetive. I, for one, completely forgot of existance of Shotgun and Stakegun. Well, okay, at least you can say that those two aren't as useful as others. Or I will forget about other weapons. Yea, too much.\nDifficult is slightly different. The Normal was harder than Black Edition, it didn't forgive as much. But the whole gameplay didn't force too different approach for each sitatuion, so it also felt easier in repetiveness. Doesn't help that some bosses may end up being dumb.\n\nOn another good side, I loved tarot cards approach in this game more. This part is just more fun. Objectives are easier and don't require as much of grinding, so you can do some while concentrating on beating level. Like, sawing limbs of 50 enemies. It's not like "something bonus that hardcore people do after beating game and never use again due to beating game". Though, another small difference, is that HD doesn't open all doors in a level once exit appears. So, those who want to find secrets should do it during main gameplay. I even cared about souls more, due to powering up Soulcatcher with them and since you can drag them with this weapon.\n\nBut new music isn't all that good.\n\nAnd they say that this game was made by developers to see if community still cares about Painkiller or not. And focused on multiplayer more than singleplayer, which is mistake, looking at it now. And well, judging by all DLCes, it probably was a success, hopefully we will get sequel soon. At very least it reminded people that Painkiller franchise wasn't always a terrible joke.\n\nIf you wanted Coop with friend in Painkiller levels then you should pick it complete. It doesn't exactly reach Black Edition otherwise. Took few levels, but not always the best ones. Doesn't remix much. Still good game though.","July 9, 2015","true","26.0"," 30 of 35 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","30","35","6","0"

Ignore the other reviews, seriously. Let me break it down easily for you:\n\nLEVELS:\n\nThere's less levels, yes. But the included ones are EXTREMELY pretty. Everything was touched up, but not much has changed, except for a few surprises on some of the maps :)\n\nThe game is better to buy if you are going to get the dlc's, which add the other maps and a few new ones that actually live up to the painkiller style! (nazi bunker and coastal level).\n\nThey also made changes on dlc versions of other old levels, such as new areas for the Asylum and cool changes to Snowy bridge.\n\nI REALLY enjoyed this and it was so SO satisfying to see these amazing levels in full HD. It didn't feel as nice playing painkiller in the original graphics as the years went by. It DID get dated, it's still a classic.. but Nordic Games has done a terrific job.\n\nCO-OP:\n\nThis was not as fun or functional on release, but after the mega-patch it's functional and FUN. You now CAN unlock tarot cards on your playthrough with your friend, so playing trauma together on a playthrough is exciting and fun, and progression can happen.\n\n\nSURVIVAL: These are GREAT challenge levels brought into the game. Even for veterans. Some of the difficulties are quite hard even for good players and it's fun to see how well you can do. It's fun!\n\n\nSTORY: Sub-par unfortunately. It IS a (maybe?) canonical sequel, but the concept is kind of crappy and the voice-acting for Eve is bad (you can hear her microphone buzzing a tiny bit). But Painkiller doesn't need too much story!\n\n\nCONCLUSION: This is a lovely game if you buy the DLC's. I dunno about Heavens Above because it's some gimmicky 3rd person mode but I imagine it might be fun too. The rest is spectacular. <3","October 27, 2014","true","30.9"," 31 of 40 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","31","40","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/214870/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","This is a very strange product. Although Painkiller (2012) bills itself as a remake of Painkiller (2004) and its Battle Out of Hell expansion, the action is set after the 2004 game. Losing his girlfriend in a car accident, David blasted his way through Hell in order to see her again only to be denied this mercy. At the start of Painkiller Hell and Damnation, Death approaches David and offers him a deal: collect 7,000 souls and he will deliver Catherine. This doesn’t make a whole lot of sense in context because even though the story is set after the events of the first game, David ends up replaying through the same levels as the 2004 game. It even goes as far as to reuse old cutscenes while adding new pieces of dialog. Again, it’s all very weird.\nLooking beyond the bizarre recycling of old content, Painkiller Hell and Damnation is a callback to a bygone era of run and gun first person shooters that didn’t require too much extraneous thought to enjoy. Using a unique collection of weapons, you’ll destroy demons in areas throughout Hell and Purgatory that resemble war torn areas in history. Thought it has its faults, Painkiller is a fun enough shooter provided that you haven’t already played it.\nThose familiar with the original game will find that the core design hasn’t changed: large, open stages are broken down into smaller pockets of action in which David must destroy groups of enemies before crossing through a checkpoint to the next area. To combat the hell hordes, David calls upon a host of savage weaponry including a double barreled shotgun, the eponymous Painkiller, a stake gun, rocket launcher and a gun that fires ninja stars.Completing levels usually requires David to defeat all monsters in the stage while others see him taking on large bosses before advancing.\nApart from weapons, what makes the gameplay unique is the Tarot Card system. Upon fulfilling special level parameters, David is reward with a Tarot Card that will grant short term game altering effects that can be called upon during battle. Up to four cards can be equipped and it is in the player’s best interest to come up with a card combination that offers the best effects.\nAfter finishing the main campaign, there isn’t much to do afterwards. A co-op mode is available for two players but doesn’t offer anything new outside of the solo campaign. There’s also a multiplayer but I never had a chance to try them because no one is playing.\nRight from the beginning, it is clear that the primary focus for Painkiller Hell and Damnation was to make it look as pretty as possible by updating the graphics to the new modern standard. While it is no Crysis, comparing the the original with the remake does show off a significant visual jump. Rather than simply up-rez the textures like most HD-ified games this year, it looks as if Farm 51 rebuilt the textures from the ground up. In-game enemies benefit the most from the redesign as their identifiable details make them all the more frightening and the lightning makes for some dazzling moments. The levels themselves are are hit and miss with some areas.\nPainkiller is fun largely because of its simplicity, a design that had been popularized after the incredible success of titles like Doom and Serious Sam. It’s not perfect, however, and the noticeable offender is poor enemy AI. The monsters really don’t pose much of a challenge as they make a bee line for your position with little regard for the hail of bullets/stakes/lightning being thrown in their direction. As such, there’s very little strategy involved in combat as battles are won by simply holding down the fire button and strafing left and right.\nPainkiller’s dialog and voice work should be brought to notice simply because of how bad it is. The actor they got to spout out David’s lines sounds as if he were attempting to imitate Max Payne with hilarious results. It’s hard to tell whether or not the game is trying to take itself seriously because of the unintentional comedy and B-movie trappings.\nPainkiller Hell and Damnation is just as fun as the original game if not a bit quaint. Updated visuals and a new weapon might be an easy sell but the barren multiplayer and co-op landscape don’t add a whole lot of value to the overall product. Best to just wait for the inevitable Steam sale and pick the game up on the cheap.","June 26, 2014","true","7.4"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","23","29","0","1"

This game is supposed to be a remake/sequel to the franchise-starter Painkiller: Black Edition. However, the way the levels are structured are completely different. A good portion of the old levels from PK Black Edition make their return, but with some changes, and in a completely different order. Another thing different is that each level is very much a self-contained experienced as opposed to a part of a whole chapter like the original game was. While this makes re-doing a level to get the card unlocks much less of a chore, this comes at the price of sacrificing weapon pacing. One thing troubling is that while this game has 5 levels more than the original Black Edition of the game, a big part of the game is locked behind several DLC pieces, which, in order to get the full experience for single player, you'll need to pay out $57.94 for the base game and 3 pieces of DLC worth $6.99-9.99 in price each. Without any of the DLC, you'll only have access to the 13 levels of the main campaign (Barely over half the size of the original game's campaign.) and 7 extra bonus levels, 2 of which are holiday-themed remakes of campaign levels, and 2 of which are short gimmicky levels.\n\nSo why am I recommending the game if the base game is anaemic compared to the original? Well for one, the Single-Player DLC are just that good. Showing that The Farm 51 really learned a lot about level design since they released the base game. They are all well-designed frag-playgrounds with plenty of enemy variety and lots of things to shoot. The remake/sequel offers at least 3 more new weapons over the original, all of which are very satisfying and fun to use. Most noteably, the Soul Catcher, allows players to catch souls, and use them to power a possession shot. Creating a small group to do the work for you is really fun and amusing, especially in large extended waves where you're constantly fed a supply of souls and minions. It also fires a power sawblade shot which is just as useful to use as any other weapon. Not only that, the Heavens Above DLC, offers a nice change of pace by providing 5 extra levels where you can frag through levels like a top-down twinstick shooter.\n\nOverall, I would say that if it weren't for the awful price-gouging DLC set up, I would recommend it much more fully as this is the first real worthy successor to the original game. Look out for the next Nordic Games sale, or a bundle that includes this game + DLC to pick it up. You will have a good time.","October 24, 2015","true","26.8"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","19","23","3","0"

Either that or Nordic Games, trying to cash in on all the assets they bought off the corpses of THQ and JoWood, rushed this POS out the door and chopped it up along the way, hoping to milk more money out of the older fans.

The plot was irrelevant, the levels looked great, and the variety in weapons and enemies made the game an enjoyable alternative to most contemporary first-person action.\n\nIgnoring the DLC, this game has about a dozen levels with the bonus one's included. The updated graphics for the environments, effects, and enemies are excellent and the best part about this game.\nThe reptitive enemies (that is to say, the lack of variety) and limited missiosn destroy this game. Without the DLC you're essentially purchasing a stripped-down variant of the original game with a few levels from Battle out of Hell incorporated.  Co-op support is one highlight marred by the aformetnioned lack of level choice.\nHaving ponied up the $9 for all the DLC and buying a four-pack for $11, I can say the price is about right for what still amounts to a waste of potential.\n\nNit-picking details include: Changing the enemy sounds for reasons?? Rehashing the same enemy types again and again as oppossed to the unique encounters in almost every level in the original duo, nixing the Hell level from the original game (Personal Favorite) and finally adding only a single entry into the weapons arsenal.\n\nTLDR: If you pay more than $10 for this you've been had.","August 6, 2015","false","12.6"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","64","18","28","5","0"

However I do have some criticisms to make:\n1. The voice acting is subpar.\n2. In comparison with the game which it is a remake of, it is incredibly short - it took me about 5 hours to beat, and I have more time than that clocked on the original Painkiller - and I'm not even halfway through that.\n\nThat said, I'd still reccommend this game - it's not quite the original Painkiller but it's fun nonetheless. I played this and the original intermittently, and I must say that both are a lot of fun.

It could have just been an HD remake and that would have been awesome. Instead they slapped on this bizarre new story and crowbarred in cutscenes that made me cringe. The worst tried to halfheartedly humanize the demon hordes you're almost constantly mowing down by showing them going about mundane routines, like a witch pushing a recycling cart and a Nazi corpse and BDSM gimp hugging it out on a park bench, just before you show up and apparently RUIN EVERYTHING! Game balance and flow is messed up by a dumb mechanic in which If you don't collect killed enemies' souls fast enough, they turn into skeletons that are harder to kill than the original enemies they came from. The Tarot cards are worthless. Levels from the original were reworked liberally, sometimes in awful directions. Some of the best like the WW2-themed one and pretty much the whole final act, including that amazing boss fight in Hell, have vanished and been replaced with hot garbage. As a final insult, the ending cutscene actually gives a nod to probably the worst of the sequels. ♥♥♥♥ this game.","October 2, 2014","false","4.1"," 37 of 67 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","37","67","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jewthanasia/recommended/214870/","jewthanasia","Jewthanasia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jewthanasia/","660 products in account","So let me start off by saying that I am a big fan of the original game and its development team. I've played everything People Can Fly have developed, including Painkiller and its expansion, Gears of War Judgement, and Bulletstorm. I've also played the games made by some ex-People Can Fly developers, like Flying Wild Hog's Hard Reset and Shadow Warrior. And I've played the first game by Farm 51, Necrovision. Suffice to say I have followed these guys and their games from the beginning.\n\nNow this new Painkiller plays pretty much like the original. It has many of the same sound effects, the same weapons, and you can still bunny hop to get places really fast. And the levels are pretty much remakes of the original levels, as promised. So far so good, right? Here are my two problems.\n\nThis is just a matter of personal taste so people can disagree but looking at all of the games I've listed above one thing that has been included in almost all of them since Painkiller is an upgrade system of some sort. Now I don't need a Shadow Warrior style, complex, almost RPG-like, upgrade system. But the stuff in Hard Reset, Bulletstorm, and even The Farm 51's followup to this game Deadfall Advenures all have a nice upgrade system. Now for some people the lack of such a system here will be a plus. But in its place you have the tarrot card system which can make the game incredibly easy or incredibly hard if you want it to. That is of course up to the player, but it's a system I don't enjoy nearly as much.\n\nThe second issue is the amount of content for the price. The game "only" costs $20 but this isn't a complete remake of the original game. Only about half the levels are included. If you want to triple that cost you can get everything that has been released for the game. Yes, that would make this game your standard price of $60, but this is a remake here. While the graphics are spruced up, at its core this is a decade old game. If you look at console HD remakes you'll see they rarely cost full price. The upcoming Halo Collection for the Xbox One includes every Halo game outside of Halo Reach (4 games total) with one completely remade from the ground up, and the others getting boosts to visuals and performance. Note that Halo 2, the game being remade from the ground up came out in 2004, the same year as the original Painkiller. Yet for its full price the Halo Collection also throws in 3 other games that have all been spruced up themselves.\n\nSo ask yourself a question. Do improved graphics and Steam achievements make a 10 year old game worth $60 to you? If the answer is yes then just buy the Collector's Edition and the two DLC packs (the final piece of DLC is a top down shooter not additional levels) and you can relive your childhood days of blasting hellspawn with ridiculous weapons. Personally I would wait for some sort of ridiculous sale before buying (it's what I did), but if you are willing to plunk down the cash then know that the game itself works and plays pretty much like a prettier version of the original.","September 2, 2014","true","6.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

This is NOT a full remake.\nSure, it has pretty graphics and they added a touch to some levels. They added humor here and there. But that's pretty much the only positives.\nYou see, they cut a huge portion of the original game. In total, Black Edition (original game + expansion pack) has 32 levels + 3 bonus ones.\n"Hell and Damnation" only remade about 15 of them.\n\nOn the top of it, the developers dare charge us more money to have some more of the original levels in their DLC.\nPlease, do NOT buy this even if it is on sale!\n\nI recommend "Black Edition", though. It's a fun fast-paced arena shooter. You have to kill all enemies in an area before the doors open, allowing you to progress. It sounds repetetive, but the various environments make up for it. Also, there are different enemies in most levels, enemies that match the environment. Skeleton knights in the cemetery, evil monks in the monastery, undead military in the military base, ninja... Most of them are melee, but some also have other attacks as well. There are 5 weapons in the game, but we could say there are actually 10, because each of them has a secondary fire mode that is very different and that uses a different type of ammo. The expansion pack adds 2 weapons (or 4).\n\nThe level design is mostly linear, but you can also explore a bit and find secret areas.\n\nSo if you like this type of shooter in which you don't have to think much and just shoot monsters, then you might enjoy it.\n\n\nTL;DR DO NOT BUY this scam called "Painkiller: Hell and Damnation".

With that out of the way, Hell & Damnation, despite being made by yet another studio, is an HD remake of the original game -- and while perhaps an inferior experience to the purists, is the first release since the original to at least stand on its own. It's a frantic oldschool-inspired shooter experience with genuinely insane weapons, and you'd better learn to bunnyhop if you want to keep your skin on.\n\nThe knocks against it are mostly that it's missing a good handful of levels from the original game, it feels a bit different because of the new engine, the plot is still stupid, corpses still linger before giving up their all-important souls, and the reinvented final boss is still a poorly designed hassle that no longer has the benefit of at least being thematically interesting.\n\nOn the upside, it still plays just as well, generally looks better, has an additional weapon, adds a pretty good selection of achievements, uses a better save system, actually has acceptable loading times, rebalances enemy distribution to mostly do away with the annoying hitscan attacks, inserts a few new levels of its own to make up for the ones cut; and the levels that were cut, despite being aesthetically memorable, were really kind of an ♥♥♥ to play. There are also co-op campaign and survival horde modes that I haven't had a chance to dive into yet.\n\nReally, the biggest problem with it is that it costs twice as much as the original at this point while ultimately having less content, but if you can grab it on sale it's a perfectly worthwhile remake that doesn't overstay its welcome. The bosses are still kind of awful, though.","November 3, 2014","true","5.7"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

But the difference is in the xx DLCs and some nice effects.\n\nI've finished the game only in co-op, I was really bored of playing it alone, I asked a friend for help. The 1st difference, there's no more... quick save and quick load in SP. Also this game still neve heard of... a map? Or more info about the Tarod cards. I wasn't able to find some of them and seeing that I can't quick save... I never bothered to try again. From my point of view, that's zero replay value.\n\nAlso I have never bought the DLCs... sorry but those were meaningless for me.\n\nOne curious thing is that the co-op experience doesn't count as a team the gold/souls/ or secrets, nor shares any info between the players. It's hard to know where the co-op partner is since there's no map or a 2nd arrow that can help with this. Also if the co-op partner found a secret, it's not shared, which is quite strange since only one the co-op partners can select the deck before each level.\n\nIt has acheivements which is ok, every game has those anyway, but these are not really explained. After the confusion with the co-op experience, the achievements are not shared either, only the leader of the co-op session will get them. Again... why?\n\nAs a let's say... poor design choice is the girl... or the facial animations, or the voice... all are bad. I mean the people that worked on this game, never cared about it. The voices do not relate to the char, the animations are not that good, maybe decent, but the movies are... well not at a 2012 level.\n\nP.S. One of the cards, the ones that attracts the souls to the player, doesn't always work. It doesn't work on all the souls, and the distance from where the souls are atracted to the player is not that big. I don't think this will ever be fixed, but one can hope.\n\nTo be honest the co-op is decent, yes there are some problems but one can play and finish the game, with a friend. Finding the secrets, the cards and using different decks is quite ok, and I liked it. But I had no idea about some secrets, I couldn't even find a map or a decent guide that could help me find those secrets and I focused just on finishing the game.\n\nIt takes around 6-8 hours to finish all the levels, some bosses are nice, same are lame but it's like playing Painkiller with a nice graphical upgrade. Also one nice thing are the weapons, this is by far the most interesting feature implemented. Every weapon has two modes, different but very efficient at killing the enemy. Painkiller has inovated this feature and I don't think that I know another game with this many weapons and implemented like this.\n\nMy score is 6/10. Quick save/Quick load is gone, that's 1 point, no map, another point. Having too many DLCs... sorry I don't like it, thus I've bought none of them nor I want to buy them in the future. The fact that the money/secrets/acheivements are not shared doing a co-op session... that's 2 points by itself. I didn't like it, and considering in what year we are... sorry but a co-op session should share anything between the players.\n\n\nNonetheless, please try it. Just for the weapons alone, since the story is a little bit confused :P.\n","December 7, 2015","true","9.1"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

I have to say is more like remaked version than sequel. Even, the story is written in alternative path. The cutscene uses its in-game engine which is very well made, but overall story is quite decent compared to its origin.\nThe big change is its graphics, Unreal engine 3 this time provide spectacular look and atmosphere is much more alive. The loading time is improved and very well optimized. The gameplay is still fun, blasting enemy away or pin them to the wall are pretty much satisfied. Most of weapons are from original game which I think it doesn't need to be changed at all and the soul catcher provides your handy saw and enemy possession.\n\nHowever, it's really disappointed from my expectation. Hell and Damnation doesn't offer much more content. The content is cut in half compared to original (Black Edition). The enemies are pretty much reused in many levels and it's getting repetitive due to lack of enemy variation. Moreover, you wont see some potential enemies from original (Nun ghost, Loki, Ninja, Vamp, Nurse Lab, etc.). They have some tricky move and fun to kill. The soundtracks still top-notch, but some new tracks doesn't fit with level at all. I may sound *****ing so much, but these elements are the reason why painkiller always hold my fun.\n\nAnother thing I have to mention is player hitbox is too wide. Even you try to change your FOV or moving backward during attack animation, you still get hit. It's really annoy flaw, which still wont be fixed yet.\n\nHell and Damnation can be a great refresh for series, but it lacks of potential content which you can get all of them from Black Edition with much more lower price. Most of its DLCs are just contents from original and gamemode doesn't feel like Painkiller which it's poor business. You want more map, pay for original maps, you want more tarot cards, pay for more original card. So, I recommend to get it on sale for both old fans and newcomers.\n\nPainkiller series is always one of my favorite old school shooter all the time, but this one just doesn't hold me long enough than original, beside complete game achievments and play with some friends.","September 4, 2014","false","14.5"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","11","18","0","0"

Can You believe that? Games, that were made ONLY to be the best games in the world. No matter how much time/effort/money it would take, this was the goal of the developers. To make a good game idea come true, not to make a cope-paste game just to make some $$$ for paid reviewers.\n\nAnd Painkiller was certainly one of those "golden age era" games. And the most beautiful thing is... It's the same thing with PK:Hell & Damnation! And I ADORE this game.\n\nThe graphics are stunning (seriously, one of a few games that used the power of UE3 very wisely) and at the same time the optimization is great. The sound design is awesome and the gameplay is amazingly fun and the humor is just great. It totaly feels like a good, old fashion Painkiller and... guess what?... it's TOTALLY rad!\n\nI feel that this, is what game industry needs now. It needs games that are created by people who truly and sincerely love them. By people, who just want to make their vision come true. Gamers (IMO -.-) are sick of AAA games that are all about the money aspect. All the AAA companies think about, while making such game, is "How to make a game, that takes the least effort and money and makes as much money as possible?". So all they do is milking poor gamers with pointless DLCs, stupid never-ending franchises, targeting casuals and all that stuff.\n\nBut this game is not like that. Oh boy, how wrong You would be if You would thought that.\n\nAsk Yourself, when was the last time, that game developers made hallowen/easter themed events for a mostly SINGLEPLAYER shooter? Yes, this game have those and they are AWESOME!\n\nAsk Yourself, when was the last time that devs acctualy cared to make as true remake as possible but at the same time enhance it in all the aspects, that would only make the game benefit from it? Obviously, they did it and it feels FRICKING awesome! They changed some smaller and bigger things but IMO all the decisions they did made the game even better. Example? sure.\n\nRemember the gun that was shooting shurikens and tased the enemies with the second attack? Now, it's a big gun that shoots big shurikens BUT they cut the enemies limbs. And while in the original PK, I feelt that this gun is rather meh, comparing to all the other ones, now it's super cool to play with this weapon.\n\nIf I still didn't convince You, let me just tell You, that I absolutely HATE DLCs. Every time I read/write this word, I wanna vomit. But it's probably gonna be the first game  ever, that I will buy DLC for (BF3 Premium doesn't count, I felt that I would only have 50% of the game if I wouldn't buy it and I really like so I just had to).\n\n\n\nThat's how the remakes should be made, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ IT! If You still haven't played this game, then go play the demo, or just buy it on HumbleBundle.com, it's super cheap (6$, plus You get a bunch of other cool games!).\n\nWHAT YOU WAITING FOR?

Don't want to say it's great one, because I saw DLC and the game is quite short (Well they selected some level from the original and Battle out of hell altogether). However, gameplay is still the same. Kill everything. ​I would say the movement is not fast (you can't sprint like Serious Sam 3 or Doom) but still you are able to do bunny-hopping. Varieties of weapons. No reloading. Boss fight are still good as original (Even they switch the level order). Background music is, well you know this is gonna be heavy metal. They composed some new tracks which is nice, still Heavy Metal.\n\nBut this, from my pov, "done right" in implementing Unreal Engine 3.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Somnambuls/recommended/214870/","Somnambuls","D.Cosmos [lv]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Somnambuls/","233 products in account","This game is about shooting demons in the face. And it's good about it.\n\nThat's the short story.\n\nThe long story, however, is that Painkiller: Hell&Damnation is a straightforward old-school FPS with a bit poor storyline, but it's fine, because you get a lot of action instead. I started to play this game for this particular reason, because I was tired of boring side missions in Borderlands 2, where you need to collect cookies or walk a dog. I just wanted to shoot things in fast pace and this game offers precisely that!\n\nI very much enjoyed the demonic graphics and infernal landscapes, as well as the boss fights. Though, this game runs short of bosses - they're only four bosses in the main game. I particularly liked the Orphanage, which was really spooky - I'd say it's the second most spooky level in my experience after Return to Castle Wolfenstein's Catacombs level.\n\nAs to the co-op experience, it's decent, but it's lacking mini-map, so it's hard to locate your partner.\n\nAlso, I think that Painkiller: H&D has one of the best soundtracks in gaming history.\n\nAfter you're done with the main story, you can buy DLCs, play community maps or try find the secret areas and holy objects, which is not easy. So there's a certain degree of replayability.\n\nSome complain that this game is a downgraded remake in terms of the content, which I guess is true and there is a lot of (and expensive) extra content for Painkiller, but since I bought Painkiller for 4 EUR in Humble Bundle, I have no complaint. I'd recommend to buy this game with discount.\n\nSo, to sum:\n\nPros:\n\nlots of action and shooting;\ndecent amount of awesome weapons;\nhidden areas and secrets;\ndecent co-op;\ngreat soundtrack;\nworkshop items\n\n\nCons:\n\npoor storyline;\nshort gameplay;\nno mini-map in the co-op mode;\nit takes a bit more time than usual to understand how this game works;\npricey DLCs\n\n\nMy overall rating: 8/10.","August 9, 2014","true","11.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's kind of a mix of new and old levels, with some variations on them. My main gripe with this game is that it is TOO SHORT. Without any DLC it took me 4 hours to complete it. Sure, you can extend the game with paid DLC now (there weren't any when I got the game), but I'm not a big fan of this business model.\n\nSome people say that the game didn't translate well to the new engine, but I don't feel it to be that much different. It's still same ol' Painkiller, with tons of demons to kill and heavy guitars in the background.\n\nWould I recommend it? Only under two conditions:\n1) You are a Painkiller fan already, and you're looking for some variation on the game (some of the old levels have some fun new stuff in them)\n2) The game is on sale (with DLC. I got lucky, got the game with a magazine, and bought the DLC pack on sale with money I got with selling steam cards).\n\nAre you a person who wants to try out Painkiller for the first time?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/electrichellknight/recommended/214870/","electrichellknight","ElectricHellKnight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/electrichellknight/","95 products in account","Painkiller can best be described as a flawed series. The original Painkiller game remains fun to this day and the sequel, Painkiller Overdose, is, although not quite as good as the original, still quite fun. Unfortunately, after Overdose, the series took a dramatic downfall with one lackluster game after another. Each of these were, although officially endorsed, technically fan-made expansions that continued to milk the original game engine well past its due.\n\nHell and Damnation should, for all intents and purposes, be considered the next true Painkiller game after Overdose. The series makes a triumphant return in this exciting and fast-paced romp through purgatory.\n\nIs Painkiller Hell & Damnation a sequel? A remake? Well it is sort of both. While the story progression in its relationship to the first game is... foggy... that does not keep you from enjoying it. As a remake, many of the original Painkiller levels are back and better-looking than ever, models and textures are all redone in gruesome HD glory. As a sequel, many bold new levels are presented. These all feel nicely done and stay true to the Painkiller style, unlike the levels of many Painkiller sequels.\n\nAs gameplay goes, well there is plenty to love. If you like your games fast, violent, and loud, then you will surely not be disappointed here. the weapons all feel powerful and all serve their own purpose. No one weapon is truly 'better' than another, and you will find yourself using each of them in specific situations. The enemies are all unique, and you will learn that although this is a fast shooter that revolves around your reflexes, 'shooting it until it dies' is not always the best strategy for dealing with every foe.\n\nOn the negative side, this game is disappointingly short. I managed to beat the main campaign in only four hours on the "Nightmare" difficulty on my first playthrough, and I was hardly rushing. This is definitely one of those games where if you do not buy the DLC (which adds about twice as many levels) you will feel like you don't have the whole game. This is disappointing, but hardly the end of the world. Besides, although story-wise there is no replay value in the campaign, gameplay-wise there is plenty, and a given level will not stop being fun just because you've done it once.\n\nTo conclude, Painkiller Hell & Damnation is a game I absolutely recommend. I would also recommend the original Painkiller, it's expansion (Battle out of Hell), and Painkiller Overdose, but advise that you ignore the others in the series. If you like Doom, Wolfenstein, Serious Sam, Duke Nukem, or any other old school fast-paced FPS games, then you will like this one.","November 23, 2015","true","8.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This game is fantastic for being a unholy and (in the COD day) unorthidox shooter.  Not much to go on for story or anything else other than shooting masses of demons though.\n\nIf you liked Serious Sam, you'll probably like Painkiller. The mood is a little darker, the game is a bit shorter, and there arent as many enemies that come up asking for a bullet at the same time (granted I've never seen a game that throws as many as SS3 does Although painkiller gets close). However the weaponry is more unique and each gun has at least 2 diffrent fire modes (some have more if you are talented enough to pull it off). All of which are fun to use and add a great addition to gameplay.\n\nIn Serious Sam 3 there comes a time where you just quit using the old pistol and shotgun. That doesnt happen here. Each weapon has special talents and can serve you well all the way through the game if you choose to use it, but you'll have quite a selection to choose from.\n\nThere is not a lot of story to go around, but the voice acting and dark mood is great. Speaking of voice acting, the protagonist is voice by the same voice actor of Duke Nukem, Mr. John Saint-John. So... if you like the idea of a darkheaded Duke blowing demons to bits in the depths of hell, give this one a shot.","May 3, 2013","true","14.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game has returned to polish programmers and it's former glory. Graphics are nice but nothing as spectacular as Crysis or other big titles. One thing that can be mentionet as flaw is bad model detection and collision - what was superb in 2004 - in 2012 looks unnatural, pehaps its Havoks fault but still worth mentioning. Besides in this game there is so many things to kill you will hardly see any graphical flaws but from me 7,5/10 on Graphics.\n\nSound is quite good. Strong metal songs and sometimes no song untill monsters come - it can build suspense. Some of the sounds are familiar from 2004 version (secrets - checkpoints sounds). But nothing is irritating (unless you hate strong metal music). 8/10\n\nGameplay is far better than previous Painkiller Overdose. The game is returning to its roots, and you can feel it. Don't expect any plotline that will blow you away. Its just plain and simple shoot everything that moves. What is missing from oryginal Painkiller:\n\nminibosses if anybody remember invincible miniboss in 2004 version - you must've drop him into lava pit destroying wodden planks from beneath him. it was very  suprising but maybe not in modern FPs so no harm done.\nGame is shorter than oryginal - couple of level are missing (HELL), In Summary gameplay is strong 8/10 but game overal 7,5/10","March 12, 2014","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Cut your ways through mindless hordes of enemies using an array of guns and strafing. Overall the game is visually appealing and the cutscenes are very well done in terms of conveying what minimal story the game has. And this is the games main fault, in essence its story is very minimalistic, not that it represents a genre strong in this regard but if a first person shooter  is to be centralized around single player gameplay then the main story should be engaging. Multiplayer is also an option with this game although it seems an afterthought. Regardless this game delivers on action and is a fast paced shooting experience.

Which is really weird considering I've tried it in co-op with my friend and based on previous experience, pretty much anything you can play with your friends is fun, no matter what genre, except for this game for some reason. I don't hate the graphics or gameplay itself, I just find the visual style of the game really ugly in the first place, dumb enemies and even for a "wave" game like this unbilievably repetetive and boring in like five minutes. I don't know why. I was really looking forward to enjoy this, especially when able to play with some of my friends, but I was really disappointed.\nIt' discounted on regular basis tho, so it's worth a shot for people who just want to play some action games and try it with someone else.

Daniel is your run of the mill badass character with a dark past and a penchant for causing incredulous amounts of pain in a short time, Daniel is offered a chance to reunite with his love in exchange for collecting seven legions of souls for the Grim Reaper himself; thus begins your thousand mile marathon of blood.\nGameplay, as mentioned previously, is absolute retro FPS goodness. You can carry as many giant and powerful weapons as you can get your hands on which you use to impale, dismember, decapitate and gib all the varied waves of foes foolish enough to get their ugly mugs in the way of your crosshairs. As you massacre foes by the bulk they drop souls in the shape of glowing green orbs, collecting them heals the player for 1HP and can overheal you to well above 100%, and to encourage players to collect dropped souls the player can enter "Demon Mode" when they gather 66 souls. Demon Mode grants the player damage immunity for a short time all the while replacing your weapons with an instant-kill pulse that shreds all enemies nearby. When your screen starts pulsing in grayscale that means you've almost collected enough souls, so you have a chance to line yourself up with a large amount of foes in order to maximize it's effect. The player can also collect gold in the levels in order to cover the cost of "Tarot Cards" that provide a powerful buff for a short duration, these buffs include improved damage resistance and slowed time, among many others that can be unlocked as the player progresses. Enemies in Painkiller have a wide variety of capabilities, from being simple mindless cannon fodder to hefty tank enemies and sometimes enemies that can use special abilities to slow or disarm you for a short period.\nLevel design is extremely straightforward, but easy to navigate so you can kite the waves of ghouls into bottle-necked corridors for easier clean-up. There are also secrets and hidden areas to find, making level exploration a rewarding and worthwhile experience.\nIn terms of graphics: There isn't much to mention. Graphics are sub-par at best despite the well animated opening cinematic, and character animation is at best laughable as Daniel and everyone else in the cutscenes move stiffly and robotic. Enemy animations are pretty well done, and much more aesthetically pleasing than cutscene animations.\nA negative aspect of Painkiller is the physics system: Jumping or otherwise interacting with physics objects in the world is clumsy and awkward, and cleary remains unfinished. This is especially bad when you are trying to kite enemies and you get hung up on a stray object that's laying in your path.\nBut the worst part is the glitchy coop mode. Several times in the coop campaign I have been unable to move, access the menu or do anything after re-loading a level, not to mention the horrible server issues and terrible lag compensation.\n\nNow, another note for all newcomers: It is HIGHLY recommended that when reaching the first boss of the game, known as the "Necrogiant" that you PAUSE the game and search up a strategy guide. Because no word of a lie, this boss will sh*t all over unprepared players on any difficulty.\n\nSo in conclustion, Painkiller Hell & Damnation is a retro FPS targeted towards players looking for a blast-from-the-past with no limited weapon inventory, health regeneration or cover systems seen in all these newer shooter titles, and instead focuses on everything that made the genre a success to begin with.","May 30, 2014","true","3.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The one truely fun part of this game is the bunny hopping by spamming space bar, however this is ruined by the amount of crap they put on levels and the small size of the levels. The game is currently $4 due to the release of workshop. From the looks of it its just multiplayer maps.

Unfamiliar with the series? Imagine the original Quake and Duke Nukem games. Painkiller is essentially a combination of the two. It's an old-school shooter with no proper storyline, but a ton of evil creatures to dismember, nail to walls and blow up. Not enough for you? Jon St. John, the man behind the legendary voice of Duke Nukem had done the voice of the main hero of the game, so you get to hear him curse and talk about big guns during the cutscenes. Not only that, but the chaos and destruction of the gameplay are accompanied by amazing pure metal music.

They literally just took some of the best levels from the original, and repackaged them with some fancy graphics, even the alastor boss fight is just a stupid remake. No context is given for fighting alastor like in the first game, so it was at the end just extremely stupid.\n\nThis makes the story even more conviluted, as your are just retracing your EXACT steps from the first game, except eve and daniel are just saying different stuff. Voice acting is particularly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as well. However, the grim reaper was a pretty cool character. Additionally the developers are starting keep up with the times since eve is somewhat clothed in this version, only somewhat however, still in kind of poor taste.\n\nPainkiller Hell and Damnation is an excellent piece of evidence of what happens when game developers get really lazy. They crap out a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ title expecting fan boys they got from the previous games will buy it right away. When people want evidence of this, they no longer have to only point fingers at Call of Duty. Lazy game design can happen to any developer.\n\nAll in all, just buy the original Painkiller: Black Edition. You'll get a ♥♥♥♥ ton of levels, that includes the ones in this game. So what if the graphics are a bit dated, you get your moneys worth which is more than I can say for this abortion of a game. By the way, I only payed 2 bucks for it.\n\nIf you buy this version instead of Painkiller: Black Edition, you are either an idiot or too obsessed with graphics to make a good decision, in which case you are still an idiot.\n\nPainkiller: Black Edition 8.5/10\nthis pile of steaming feces: -3 / 10 (was going to be -4, but the soul catcher was kinda fun to play with)\n\nEDIT: Yeah I know I'm bein a ♥♥♥♥ in this review, but if you have played Painkiller:Black Edition you'd understand why I feel this way.","November 9, 2014","false","3.4"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","2"

The dialogues sound like they were written by autistic twelve year olds, and the voice acting is done by stoned hobos who don't even give a ♥♥♥♥. At some point when I started playing, I was stuck outside of the map, unable to do anything. Not to mention, the quality of the terrain is just ♥♥♥♥ing beautiful. You got everything from midget skeletons stuck in the ground to sword-wielding hipsters stuck inside of walls, extremely slow witches who occasionally just stop moving to stand and glare at you (making your screen constantly fade from normal to black) and hell, this game's even got floating trees. I've never during these recent years experienced a modern HD video game crash so many times. Just after I begin playing, being stuck inside of the map, I restart - causing an immediate crash which kept continously happening unpredictably as I went on playing. Even after I beat the first level, the game crashed. There's nothing much to say about the gameplay. You keep running and blasting random ♥♥♥♥ and obstacles that appear on your screen. I easily beat the whole first level on nightmare mode without the slightest feel of stress; felt like I was playing on easy, since there is barely any challenge/effort put into this game.\n\nOverall, I think this game is pretty solid. Anyone who's a classic FPS gamer will love this pragmatic gaming experience. If you want to waste 27 bucks on random junk, I highly recommend you try out this game.

Youll occasionally be able to fling an axe monk across the map with a shotgun blast or turn a clown to mincemeat with the painkiller, but it almost feels scripted rather than being an innate part of the physics of the game.\n\nIn addition, the difficulty feels like it just gave up.  Past the initial rushing enslaught of enemies, their actual threat has been quite drastically toned down. Bosses in particular are guilty of this, though perhaps for the better in certain cases, they feel very little of a threat - more a chore that must be rushed through or painfully waited out when forced to.\n\nThe levels themselves are also different: a number directly torn out and (only some) replaced by what only play like bad knockoffs. No more bomb and bullet infested Alcatraz and no more cramped, ghost-riddled mansion to fight through.\n\nIs this all a testament to the original or something of incompetence from this new developer? Probably both: the best things are that which remained untouched. Bit of a shame, really. If you havent already, just get Painkiller Black Edition and stick with it. A few prettier pixels (with shoddy performance, mind you) and some unecessarily shoe-horned cutscenes should not sway you any.","March 6, 2013","false","7.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

That was my childhood.\n\nI had a diet of games like Doom, Duke Nukem 3D, BLOOD, Unreal Tournament, Serious Sam, and Quake. What do they all have in common? Fast movement and twitchy gunplay. I loved the original Painkiller. In Painkiller, you're faced with hordes of monsters while you're frantically back-peddling, unloading your double-barreled shotgun in their faces. But the best part of the game? You get to become a absolute killing machine if you collect enough SOULS!\n\nBut playing this sequel/remake, there was something missing. After about 3 hours, I started yawning. Maybe I've gotten much more sophisticated with gaming appetite. Maybe it's the dreary level design. Or maybe it's the AI.

The dialogues sound like they were written by autistic twelve year olds, and the voice acting is done by stoned hobos who don't even give a ♥♥♥♥. At some point when I started playing, I was stuck outside of the map, unable to do anything. Not to mention, the quality of the terrain is just ♥♥♥♥ing beautiful. You got everything from midget skeletons stuck in the ground to sword-wielding hipsters stuck inside of walls, extremely slow witches who occasionally just stop moving to stand and glare at you (making your screen constantly fade from normal to black) and hell, this game's even got floating trees. I've never during these recent years experienced a modern HD video game crash so many times. Just after I begin playing, being stuck inside of the map, I restart - causing an immediate crash which kept continously happening unpredictably as I went on playing. Even after I beat the first level, the game crashed. There's nothing much to say about the gameplay. You keep running and blasting random ♥♥♥♥ and obstacles that appear on your screen. I easily beat the whole first level on nightmare mode without the slightest feel of stress; felt like I was playing on easy, since there is barely any challenge/effort put into this game.\n\nOverall, I think this game is pretty solid. Anyone who's a classic FPS gamer will love this pragmatic gaming experience. If you want to waste 27 bucks on random junk, I highly recommend you try out this game. If you want to waste 109 bucks, however, you should buy their money-consuming 4-pack DLC along with the game.\n11/10, would bang in the ♥♥♥♥.","May 22, 2014","true","0.7"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","4"

However, being a HD remake/sequel/thingy you'd expect all of the original content right? Well for some reason, the developer or publisher decided that a lot of the original content from Painkiller: Black Edition has been cut to be sold as DLC or were just never remade which is sleezy and frankly makes it a rather pricey investment to get all of the content unless it's on sale. Would I buy it? Yeah I would because while the content you get is damn awesome as it is, I want it all and more even if it means I have to buy something that should have been there in the first place. This is a Steam review so let's do the TL;DR stuff.\n\nPros:\n*Old school, bunnyhopping, demon blasting fun - a helluva game to play\n*Tons of replayability - playing through levels, beating your high score, getting all the tarrot cards and more\n*Lots of achievements - while I think achievements are arbitrary, at least they are fun to get here and there's a ton\n*Awesome and creative weapons - a gun that fires stakes, a sawblade with a weird laser thing, etc, awesome stuff\n*Plenty of enemies - a ton of enemies to fight and there's a lot of variety here; skellingtons, demon clowns, etc.\n*Huge boss monsters - creative boss fights, some are better than others and a lot of mini-bosses too\n*RIP AND TEAR - guts, blood, viscera; just everything everywhere and it's glorious\n*Amazing art design - the visuals are lovely with a wonderful art style to boast, looks like a metal album cover in motion\n\nCons:\n*Controller support - the controller support is ♥♥♥♥ed beyond belief, do not bother with a controller\n*Minor framerate and stutter issues on high end rigs - people with weaker machines might experience more of this\n*Low-res textures and models - certain elements were clearly taken from Black Edition and look noticeably outdated\n*DLC-galore - a lot of the original content has been cut up as DLC and the pricing doesn't help neither\n*Weak workshop support - it has workshop content, but a very pitiful amount; would be lovely for mappers to fix that\n*Disappointing to Painkiller fans - the expansions were apparently horrible but this remake/sequel is a sin to big fans on the DLC aspect alone, clearly made for people new to the franchise\n\nOverall, it's a bloody good game - a brilliant game in my opinion and I would love to play more and produce Workshop content for the game (If I'm any good at it of course) but that DLC issue and performance problems would be a massive turn-off for people looking to buy this game.

It does look a bit old, yes, but not bad.  But, graphics are beside the point here--this game, proclaiming to be a "remake" of the original game, is so only in name.  It cuts over half of the levels, including the fun bosses (no hammer wielding, physics-hating boss?  But they kept the bloody swamp thing boss that was one of the most painful experiences in the game?), and has completely redone what enemies appear on what levels with no apparent rhyme or reason, while leaving some unchanged.\n\nThere are some neat little changes throughout the game that fans of the original will notice, and that are pretty neat and often worth a small chuckle or delighted grin, and these are definitely excellently done (and exactly what I like seeing in remakes)--they're not intrusive, they never (as far as I can recall) get in the way of the gameplay, and they're neat little things to notice as a player of the original game.\n\nThere are also a few new weapons added, which is nice (the original was a bit lacking at times, having only four real weapons plus the eponymous painkiller), and definitely a fun addition to the gameplay.\n\nThis isn't to say it's a BAD game by any stretch.  It definitely stands on its own merits.  However, when compared to the game it's supposed to be a remake of, I think it falls pretty flat despire the few cool additions.  The neat, small changes to the various levels, the new weapons to spice things up, and the prettier graphics don't compensate enough for the amount of content from the original that wasn't ported into the remake for me to reccommend this game.\n\nAll that being said--if this comes up as part of some bundle with a bunch of other games you've been eyeing, give it a go--it's a fun game, but it doesn't stack up to the original.","November 30, 2013","false","7.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I mean seriously, to my disappointment I found out that this was the exact same game as Painkiller Black Edition only with improved graphics. That means Daniel's Whiney "AUGH" Voice every time he gets hit is the same, the music is the same, the enemies are the same, the levels are the same, EVERYTHING IS THE SAME!!!!\n\nAt least with Serious Sam HD they knew they weren't going for a remake and they just called it HD. That is why it worked! It wasn't a remake, It was an actual update of the game! They should have just slapped Painkiller HD On this which would have made it much more better. But instead, they went with an insulting name to trick buyers into thinking this was either a new game or a different take on the original.\n\nYou may be thinking, I gave the first one a good review so why does this one get a negative? Well, Daniel becomes very annoying very fast every time he gets hit. It's always a stupid whiney "AUGH" or "EUGH" Voice which frustrates the hell out of me. That is the reason I stopped playing Painkiller was because of the repetitiveness. To think we were going to get something new and find out it's the same thing is so insulting.\n\nBUYER BEWARE.

Or the snowy bridge with ninjas? Or the military base with the UFO at the end? Well I hope you do, because this game doesn't have them.\n\nPainkiller Hell & Damnation is basically a prettier but anorexic Painkiller Black Edition. If you've never played Painkiller in your life, start with Painkiller Black Edition, which is avaliable on Steam for only 9,99€ and gives you about 30 levels right off the bat, whereas Painkiller Hell and Damnation, which costs 19,99€ will only give you about 15 of those same levels, some of which are arguably weaker than their original counterparts. That's half the conten for twice the price. And if you want all the singleplayer content for this game you're gonna have to fork over nearly 50€ (assuming you buy the base game + 2 DLC bundles and not all the DLC separately). So Painkiller Black Edition is just a better offer all around.\n\nWith that out of the way, what's new in Painkiller Hell and Damnation?\nWell, here are my observations from beating the game on Insomnia (Normal difficulty):\n-You get a new weapon (The Soulcatcher) which is kind of OP. It shots a saw blade that cuts through several enemies, it's alt-fire acts like a vacuum for souls, which is insanely useful and once you collect enough souls (about 5 or 6) you can use the tertiary fire to convert some of the enemies into your allies for a short period. Overall this new weapon makes the game a bit too easy, but I guess you can just opt out of using it for the most part\n-Speaking of weapons, the progression has now been altered, but on the flip side you can use the Battle out of Hell weapons in the vanilla levels. Also some of the weapons have been slightly rebalanced, the most notable exception for me is that the Electrodriver is actually useful now.\n-The order of the levels has been redone somewhat. There are now 4 episode instead of the original Painkiller's 5. Train Station is now in episode 2, as opposed to episode 3. You fight the Swamp monster in episode 3 and Alastor in episode 2. In episode 4 you get the Orphanage and Looney Park.  The levels themselves have also been changed to some degree. Like the Colosseum is missing some of it's traps, the Oriental Castle takes place in day instead of night etc.\n-The monster placement is different. The only new enemy is a skeleton which appears in most of the levels, but then you have some weird decisions like clowns in the Opera House, bikers in the Train Station, and a complete absence of gladiators in Colosseum. I guess it's good that they wanted to make it a fresh experience but a lot of it feels weird and out of place.\n-On that note the conditions for Tarot cards have been improved, in my opinion, with the exception of maybe one or two. You can also unlock two tarot cards per level now AND it tells you if you have fullfiled the requirments, which is a very welcome addition.\n-You can the story in co-op although I haven't had a chance to test this feature.\n-There's also a story with cutscenes in there but honestly I wouldn't bother, it sucks for the most part except for a few "so bad it's good" moments. Also Daniel is voiced by Duke Nukem, but his performance is kind of boring\n-If you buy the "Heaven Above" DLC you can play 5 levels of a top down Painkiller, which can be fun, but the camera is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bad it made the whole ordeal way more frustrating than it ought to be.\n\nSadly some problems haven't been fixed from the original - souls still take way too long to appear for no reason, the enemies still get stuck in doorways and a vast majority of the enemies are ♥♥♥♥ing braindead.\n\nSo would I recommend Painkiller Hell & Damnation? Well I wouldn't recommend it over Painkiller Black Edition and certainly not with it's current price tag. However if you love the original game and get this one when it's on sale, I think you won't be disappointed. Really the biggest problem with this game is the price tag, because it just doesn't offer enough new content and features to be priced almost the same as a brand new triple A game.","March 24","true","7.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

On one hand this is easily the best entry in the series since the original, on the other it is mired in some bizarre choices. Notably HD is something of a retelling of the first game. Not that anyone should be playing Painkiller for the story, but somehow HD's narrative manages to be even more nonsensically bad than the threadbare excuse found in the first. Utterly listless voice acting doesn’t help the matter. The second, more glaring issue is the omission of some of the best classic levels such a The Town. While available as DLC, to hack the original apart and hide bits of it behind a pay wall is idiotic.\n\nHD features the addition of the Soul Catcher weapon. Despite being shoehorned into the plot, the weapon simply isn’t very fun to use. The primary fire is decent, while the secondary’s soul drain function is tedious at best. The weapon’s big draw, the ability to possess enemies once enough souls have been absorbed, is redundant when you can wipe out entire swaths of demons with a single rocket.\n\nStill, there is plenty of free DLC and the game retains the same classic Painkiller feel and is every bit as fun as it used to be. Co-op modes and multiplayer helps to stretch the experience out despite the truncated campaign's best attempts. This game is only worth the money if one happens to be a fan of the first game, wants to give the new content a go, and manages to catch it on sale.\n\nTellingly all the best parts featured in this update are the ones left more or less intact from the original version. The new additions, almost uniformly, simply fail to measure up to bar of quality set by the first game. Hopefully the heavily implied sequel this remake sets up does much better. Newcomers to the series would be far better off simply buying the Painkiller Black Edition and simply pretending all the other titles in the series didn't exist.","October 20, 2013","false","6.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dsythe/recommended/214870/","dsythe","Deathsythe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dsythe/","173 products in account","Painkiller: Hell and Damnation represents a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand this is easily the best entry in the series since the original, on the other it is mired in some bizarre choices. Notably HD is something of a retelling of the first game. Not that anyone should be playing Painkiller for the story, but somehow HD's narrative manages to be even more nonsensically bad than the threadbare excuse found in the first. Utterly listless voice acting doesn’t help the matter. The second, more glaring issue is the omission of some of the best classic levels such a The Town. While available as DLC, to hack the original apart and hide bits of it behind a pay wall is idiotic.\n\nHD features the addition of the Soul Catcher weapon. Despite being shoehorned into the plot, the weapon simply isn’t very fun to use. The primary fire is decent, while the secondary’s soul drain function is tedious at best. The weapon’s big draw, the ability to possess enemies once enough souls have been absorbed, is redundant when you can wipe out entire swaths of demons with a single rocket.\n\nStill, there is plenty of free DLC and the game retains the same classic Painkiller feel and is every bit as fun as it used to be. Co-op modes and multiplayer helps to stretch the experience out despite the truncated campaign's best attempts. This game is only worth the money if one happens to be a fan of the first game, wants to give the new content a go, and manages to catch it on sale.\n\nTellingly all the best parts featured in this update are the ones left more or less intact from the original version. The new additions, almost uniformly, simply fail to measure up to bar of quality set by the first game. Hopefully the heavily implied sequel this remake sets up does much better. Newcomers to the series would be far better off simply buying the Painkiller Black Edition and simply pretending all the other titles in the series didn't exist.","October 20, 2013","false","6.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Most people are giving a thumbs down for it not being like the original. I personal havnt played any other Painkillers but this one. For me i really enjoyed this game, And i still do go back and play whatever level I want whenever i want. This game reminds me of when i played Quake, or even Doom back in the day when i was a teenager. As soon as combat  starts and the Rock music begins to play, I just zone out and blast my way threw those demons, undead and reapers on my quest to finish the level. By no means is this a GREAT! game. The story isnt the best. But thats not why Im playing this F.P.S game anyways. I just want to kill ♥♥♥♥. And that is exactly what you will be tasked to do. Each level was some what unique. The boss fights were fun and depending on the difficulty you choose to play im sure it could even be hard. I'm giving this game a thumbs up Because I enjoy and still play it. I have even started to buy the DLC for this game which makes it even funner. especially when you get to dual weld your guns.

Valami eszméletlen beteg egy játék, az hogy kaszások futnak neked + elég furcsa FPS játék. Igaz 5.2 óra alatt végig lehet játszani, de nagyon jó játékélményekkel vannak teli a pályák. Elég durva ellenségek vannak és választható fegyverek. Anno még a ,,PC Guru"-hoz kaptam, mellé Two Worlds II és Overlord.\nTörténete valami olyasmiről szól, hogy mi és a szerelmünkkel autóbalesetet szenvedtünk, mivel hogy kinyilt elöttünk a pokol?! és kaptunk 1 esélyt a ,,Kaszástól", hogy ha gyüjtünk neki elegendő lelket, akkor visszakaphatjuk azt a nagy Ő-t. Mikor elvileg összegyüjtöttük az elegendő lelket a Kaszásnak, akkor azt mondja hogy 1 lélek még hiányzik, és a pályák során találkozunk valami csajjal, ismerőssel, aztán feláldozza magát, mint az utolsó lélekként, hogy visszakapjunk a Nagy Szerelmünket. De a Kaszás becsapott minket és meg kell ölni a végén, mint FőBoss!  Szerintem így világos.\nCsaj ajánlani tudom mindenkinek! :D","January 21, 2015","true","5.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I played the original painkiller - twice - once with vanilla, once with the black edition. Then I played the expansion, whatever it was called.\nHowever, this doesn't do justice to the original. The 'feel' is off - seems like the whole thing has been desaturated heavily, and every level looks crisp but bland. I can honestly say I had fun with the original, but not with this. And the menu structure/mishmash is just awful. Confusing to say the least. I expect a 'continue' button to drop me back in the game, not take me to a level-choice screen.\nUnfortunately, fail, although I know the devs probably put a lot of time into it, it's not worth the $3 I paid. A shame.","June 16, 2014","false","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
