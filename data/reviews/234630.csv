While racing you must account for everything. This isn't another racing game where you can speed through corners to pass up other racers. One little mistake can cost you the race.

Then this is the game for you.\n\n(If you found this review helpful, consider giving it a thumbs up!)\n\nLooking for more steam friends?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/teabagjohn/recommended/234630/","teabagjohn","TeabagJohn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/teabagjohn/","252 products in account","I had a very popular positive review up for this game until now. Over the past year my opinion has changed.\n\nI play with a racing wheel and play a lot of racing games and sims (all Codemasters games, iRacing, rFactor 2, RaceRoom,...).\n\nI'll keep it short:\n\nThe good\n- It looks great and runs pretty well on Nvidia graphics cards\n- With DLC there is a good amount of content available and a nice selection of tracks & cars.\n- Some cars sound fantastic, others rather mediocre\n- A lot of settings are available\n- Full day/night cycle and weather (imo the best thing about this game)\n- No tuning and almost no street cars, this game is about racing race cars on a race track.\n- Solid career mode with a good amount of diversity.\n- You can do 24h multi class racing and even switch drivers like in real life so you don't have to drive the 24h completely on your own.\n\nThe bad\n- The AI is garbage and inconsistent. Sometimes they are slow, sometimes they are overly aggressive BUT they ALWAYS CHEAT. Seriously, the AI is cheating and that just kills off any enjoyment I had with this game. They drive like maniacs in the rain and somehow have more grip than I ever had on soft tyres on a sunny day. Furthermore they can brake much later and never lock up. On some parts of the track they have problems with overtaking, so either they ram you off the track or crash into another AI car. Terrible.\n\n- The physics are mediocre but that's no surprise and not really a bad thing in my eyes. What's terrible is the force feedback. This has to be some Need For Speed level of force feedback because you can't feel anything on the default settings. You don't know what the car is doing half of the time. If you want to play this game with a wheel then I recommend to take a day off of work to find some force feedback settings that work for you.\n\n- Multiplayer is either dead or a complete cluster♥♥♥♥. Everyone crashes and drives like an idiot. Don't buy this game for online racing if you are looking for some clean and exciting fights. Either join a league or take a look at iRacing.\n\n- No triple monitor support. Game looks terrible on three screens.\n\n- Career had a "coming soon" section for almost a year until they finally removed it with the last patch.\n\n- A lot of features were cut and will make it into Project Cars 2.\n\n- ♥♥♥♥♥♥ damage model\n\n- No safety car, no formation lap, no yellow flags\n\n- The track stays the same during the whole race. In real life the track builds up more grip on the racing line, which makes it harder to overtake off the racing line. That's very interesting in endurance races (2h-24h races) but in Project Cars the track stays the same, no matter how many laps you do.\n\n- You can't select specific opponents in a race. You can either select "Identical" (same car as you), "Same class" (for example GT3 class if you use a GT3 car) or "Multi class" (a random selection of all cars in the game). Not sure who thought this was a good idea but you can't make your own WEC race for example, because the game will mix in some random garbage vehicles that don't even fit in the 24h of le mans.\n\n- The game had hundreds of bugs and missing features on launch and it took them 10+ patches to make the game somewhat decent.\n\nVerdict:\nGraphics powerhouse with a nice selection of tracks and cars. But when it comes to racing it is one of the worst racing games you can get, made by a company that over promises and under delivers.","May 6","false","57.1"," 254 of 308 people (82%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","82","254","308","15","29"

Initially, the game seemed fun to me, especially with its one-of-a-kind Career Mode - only to be brought with the disappointment that you could start wherever you want in your career, therefore losing the motive in grinding your way from Go-Karts to Formula A. Although there are a lot of downvotes to the game there are a lot of good sides to the game.\n\nPros:\nThe In-Game Menu is one of the best I've seen in quite a while.\nGraphics are absolutely facinating.\nGameplay is fairly smooth, rarely come across visual / physical bugs.\nController support is one of the best, also comes with VR Hardware support too.\nA lot of Online Lobbies to choose from, if not, create a private lobby for you and your friends.\nIn-game car tuning has a lot of depth, a lot of things to tune, giving you an upper-hand above those who don't.\nMehs:\nCar statistics, usual car stats a game would bring you.\nMechanic is a meh, when it comes to long races, sometimes the mechanic would get on my nerve.\nPhysics are alright, usually a bugs here and there but it doesn't affect the gameplay too badly.\nCons:\nThe In-game AI is generally a let-down.\nAI doesn't really let you pass on blue flags, sometimes won't even aknowledge your existence on the race track, ramming you left and right.\nPenalty system is also disappointing\nSometimes you will get penalized for things you didn't even do, such as corner cutting.\nPenalty system also doesn't affect the AI, giving them the upperhand in races\nCar selection doesn't include one of the biggest brands and icons (as of Jan 4, 2016) Ferrari, Nissan\nSAFETY CAR WHERE YOU AT?? YELLOW FLAG WHERE YOU AT??\nGames I Would Suggest or Relate to    Assetto Corsa\nConclusion  Project Cars is a fairly fun and realistic racing game, and has a small mix of Arcade and Simulation (may not be the best idea). If you're looking for a more realistic game, look for iRacing. If you're looking for an arcade-y style game, I would personally suggest Need for Speed. Overall Project Cars was an initial disappointment to me but the deeper you look into what the game has to offer to you, the funner it gets.\n\n\n\n(If you found the review helpful, giving it a thumbs up would be nice!)\nIf you're looking for more Steam Friends?

However after spending some time with this game I have been dissapointed with the immersion this game offers as there are many features missing that a racing simulator should have.\n\n1. There is no flag system or safety car. This gripe may seem nit picky but it does take away from the simulator feel of a race day when there are no flags to warn drivers that there may be a hazard ahead. Flags and safety cars are a huge feature in modern racing, often changing the outcome of a race and entire strategies devoted to pitting around safety car deployment. This leads into the second gripe, there are no AI caused accidents for there to be a safety car or flag system in the first place.\n\n2. AI too flawless. The AI has no character in this game, they drive around almost on rails only to deviate in the most extreme cases occasionally onto the grass but then make a full recovery and lose 1 second on their lap time due to a small mistake. They are aware of the player, but too often they will completely give way to the player as if repelled by magnets. The biggest problem with the dull AI is that there are no retirements no matter how long the race is. 100 Lap races will 100% of the time have a full field finish, no mechanical faults, no accidents, no spins, even with full damage turned on. The AI does not make a mistake that leads to any game changing events. This makes for a very dull, boring race experience.\n\n3. The career mode only offers a single full season of driving (17 races in a season) in one mode, the F1 equivalent Formula A mode. If you want to drive touring cars or karts or any other league the season is made up of only 5 or so races. It is kind of like the progress of simcade racing games like GT and Forza, just without the upgrades and car modifying and street circuits.\n\n4. Every car is as solid as a tank. The damage modelling in this game reminds me of an old Need for Speed where you were able to drive at 300kmh and crash into any solid object and just bounce off. Damage is a huge component of racing, often slight damage will lead to changing a racing strategy and adds a huge element of risk/reward to a race. Damage is what keeps a race on the edge, gives a race character. Drivers will avoid taking huge risks because damage is a deterrent, and damage affects performance. Not in this game though, damage for the most part does nothing. You can use other cars as a brake with little consequence. Crash into a wall head on at 200kmh, and you will suffer slight suspension problems and get a couple of cosmetic scratches and a bent hood. That kind of a crash in reality would end with a DNF and debris everywhere. Since there is no deterrent to crashing in this game, the only solid tactic for racing is an aggressive push all the other cars off the road style.\n\nThe surface of the game is really spectacular, it will easily draw you in and look amazing, but don't be fooled. This is not what I would expect from a racing simulation, it sits halfway between a Forza/Gran Tourismo and a racing sim, but does neither very well. It is not an arcade game where you can customise your cars and earn a sense of progression with unlocking newer nicer vehicles and new modifications. It is not a simulator where you can immerse yourself into the reality of a race day. Project Cars lacks any character or vision for what it is, and in attempting to appeal to a very broad audience it has alienated the fans of both arcade and simulator fans alike by providing neither.\n\nIf you just want a game where you have the opportunity to drive around very pretty circuits with traffic and time trials then this game might be sufficient. It feels great looks great and sounds great. But it really lacks in the gameplay department so if you want a game that simulates racing, then I recommend you look elsewhere.\n","July 14, 2015","false","26.3"," 264 of 343 people (77%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","77","264","343","16","3"

As is the norm within the gaming industry and a lot of big projects there have been a few delays, but the developers have followed through with their vision of the game and did not rush it out for a quick buck. The game was funded through their own World of Mass Development (WMD) crowd funding system, where the each member of the community could purchase a tool pack to gain access to the game and the rewards scaled with each tool pack level, up until the required funding was reached (similar to Kickstarter, but a portion of the profits will be paid back to the tool pack holders). This game is not a one off, SMS want this to become a new racing franchise which pushes the envelope on what is possible in the racing genre and video games in general [Note: There will not be annual releases of the same game and they will not immediately drop support of the latest game, each game will improve on the previous one and be supported after release].\n\nThe "CARS" part of the name stands for "Community Assisted Racing Simulator" and the original backers of the game (about 80,000 in total) have spent the past three and a half years providing feedback, suggestions and bug reports which have led us to this point. SMS also received the assistance of several professional race drivers (e.g. Ben "The Stig" Collins, Oliver "Oli" Web and Nicholas Hamilton, brother of Lewis Hamilton) to further make the game as authentic and close to real life as possible. There were also other drivers which got involved in the project in an unofficial capacity and used it to help prepare themselves for races (e.g. René Rast).\n\nProject CARS is focused on racing and whilst some people will complain about the lack of cars, when compared to other racing games, it does have one the largest number of tracks in recent history and that is much more important in my opinion. The other complaint is that certain cars and manufacturers are missing, but the reality is that some licenses are exclusive to certain companies (e.g. Porche, but Ruf is included) and others are just too expensive for the budget, cannot be justified or do not fit in the game (e.g. Ferrari and Lamborghini) . There are also no road cars, with a few exceptions which have the racing trim and setup, because this is a racing game and those kinds of cars are not seen in professional motorsport events or series. The focus of the game is spend time driving each car and learning the intricacies on how to eke out that extra couple of hundredths of a second from a lap or sector. This is not a game where you go around grinding for cash or points to unlock new cars which you will quickly move on from when you unlock the next one. Every car is unlocked from the get go, each one has been selected to fit into the featured racing series, modelled to match the real life counterpart and the performance that you see in game is as close to the real thing as possible.\n\nThe campaign allows you to work your way up from the bottom (karts) and reach the pinnacle of motorsport racing (F1 or LMP), but there is also nothing stopping you jumping in at any of the levels because you get full control over your racing career and each play through can be different. There is also the Driver Network and multiplayer portions of the game, which allow you to compete against others and get involved in the community events.\n\nIt would be a lie if I said that everything is perfect, there are a few bugs (not game breaking) and features which did not make it into the game for launch, but those should be added later on and the bugs will be squashed. The most important thing is that SMS have set the bar very high and this is a great thing for every fan of racing games, because the competition are going to have to work hard to match this.\n\nThere are ultra settings and the game is 12K capable, supports three monitors and supports VR headsets, so do not be unreasonable and expect to be able to max everything out on current hardware and not notice a significant drop in the frame rate. Even on lower settings the game looks great and you should take the time to find your optimal setup for the best performance.\nI am very thankful for SMS to allow myself and the rest of the WMD community to join them on this journey and I plan on participating in further projects in the future, but for now I will see you on the race track and possibly in future WMD projects.\n\nHead over to the official website for more information on the game, including the tracks and cars.[www.projectcarsgame.com]\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: As one of the WMD community funders of the game it should be no surprise that I have recommended this game and I will receive a very small portion of the profit from sales, so do not just take my word for it, you should have a look at all of the other positive reviews that the game is receiving. I cannot claim that I am not biased towards loving Project CARS, but I would also not be praising it if I truly did not believe in it.","May 6, 2015","true","117.4"," 329 of 453 people (73%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","73","329","453","35","9"

It's a beta and they released either way when it should be delayed a bit more\n\n2-Ian Bell is a d1ckhead when it comes to deal with criticism about his work and customers that don't agree with him\n\n3-They are not commited to fix the issues like they were while in closed beta where we had almost a new build with fixes and improvements per day\n\n4-They are already announcing Project Cars 2 without even fixing the first iteration of the franchise without any hesitation\n\n5-They expect crowd funding the second game like the first one, so they can raise another truckload of money, do a lot of PR bull♥♥♥♥ marketing again to sell it, and then run off the scene without even trying to finish the product, like they are doing with this one.\n\nREALLY?

Feels rushed. Like this bug I experienced a few hours ago, I was on first place but suddenly game says that "I have to let the guy on second place pass me because blue flag", first thing that crossed my mind was "must be a bug" but I turned on the HUD and oh my, somehow the game said that I didn't complete a single lap when I did nothing wrong from the very beginning.\n\nDark souls easter egg? I doubt it:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=443151756\n\nPhysics\nPhysics are a joke, I know is some kind of hybrid between arcade and sim, but it is an awful mix imo. Sometimes at the same turn you are on rails, others you are on ice for no reason whatsoever. And they tried to sell this game saying that literally "Has the most advanced tires physics ever seen on a game"? I guess they have never played AC or iRacing before such overstatement.\n\nAI\nAI is made of psychos who have no issues crashing their cars with yours, but guess what, NOTHING HAPPENS TO THEM while your car is a wreck and all you can do is retire or restart the race. Another one of its tricks is cut through grass to overtake you or never have the need of warm up their tires. I don't like passive AI in racing games at all but this, is too much.\n\nHere's a couple examples:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=442798605\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=440909046\n\nAnd this is what happens when AI gets crazy:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=442804380\n\nCareer\nCareer mode can get boring pretty fast, since there's no feeling of progression. You start with everything unlocked, you can even drive LMP1, the top class in this game, from the very first minute so it is up to the player to choose what to do, but imo it gets boring once you have to deal with the same issues mentioned before (Specially AI) over and over.\n\nGraphics\nGraphics are great, because thats what this game is all about. Graphics, graphics and graphics although the game is poorly optimized so don't expect to run everything on ultra unless you have a beast. Although the game doesn't look as good as screenshots pre-release made us believe, not just that, but the cars are the only thing that looks great. Backgrounds look like ♥♥♥♥♥, and visual damage is utterly poor. Btw, AMD users stay away from this game, check the forums for more info.\n\nSound\nGood, but again there's some issues like loosing engine sound or hear your engine working after you blow it up.\n\nMP\nServers are a danger zone, again full of crazy people with only one task, troll as hard as they can. Plus there's some severe lag issues.\n\nConclusion\nMany praise this game, but I won't, not until they fix it and release a game worth full price. So others can praise its graphics all they want, but graphics aren't everything in a game. And so far imo this game is Shift 2.5. A ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mix between arcade and "simulation". Seriously, stop this bs. Make an arcadish game (Like GT or Forza) or a sim (Like iRacing, AC, Rfactor, etc...) but not an awful mix like this one.\n\nEdit: AGAIN, If you own an AMD Vcard, forget about this game. Just pay a visit to the forums and you will find out what I mean.","May 10, 2015","false","40.0"," 379 of 537 people (71%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","71","379","537","17","16"

So I'm going to give a long and thorough review of it.\n\nTL/DR Version:  Broken promises, missing game features, and crippling bugs should keep you away.  Ultimately, this entire things feels like a giant paid BETA for Project Cars 2.  I.E. You are paying full retail for the privilege of beta testing for the sequal.\n\n\nPro's:PCars is relatively cheap.  $50 retail + $50 DLC sounds like a lot, but compared to other sim racing games, it isn't.  Fully investing in "iRacing" could easily cost you $500+ ($10-$15 per car / track, EACH), not to mention the $15 per month subscription.\nAmazing GT3 selection.\nBest graphics of any racing sim, by far.\nBest weather system of any racing sim, by far.\nNo cars are gated at all.  First race, want to try an F1 Car?  Go for it!  Even people without DLC can join a DLC room (but they can't host it, or play it in SP).\nClever and fun Single Player campaign.  You can jump in anywhere from GoKarts and advance all the way to LMP1, and anything in between, all the while progressing through it from where you started.  I.E. Start at Formula Gulf (not go-karts) and still advance through to LMP1.\nPhysics system is leagues better than from release, but still not perfect or finished yet.  Tire physics are trash.\nRelatively good VR / headtracker support.  (They just broke Headtracker support, though.)Con's (in no particular order):No Oval Racing, despite being promised and advertised.\nReplay system is utterly broken.  Some cars don't show up at all.  Some don't ever start off the line.  Some have switched models and skins.  And the control system was designed by a 2 year old.  Don't even bother to save a replay.\nSpectator system is trash.  What good is a racing game if you can't give people a good way to watch the action?\nDedicated Server is missing half the features it needs to be viable, including race steward powers..\nMultiplayer sessions are missing half the features IT needs (separately from ded. servers) to be viable in the long run.\nOptions available in Single Player Campaign are not available for custom and multiplayer races.\nNo full course cautions option.\nThere is a skill / safety rating system built into every driver's profile, but we can't see other people's rating.  Absolutely moronic.\nThere is a collision measuring and fault system built into Project Cars, but it isn't used for anything.  For example, after 3 dive bombs it could kick out the bad driver, but doesn't.\nSome of the maps are broken and unplayable in Multiplayer.  Including maps that have been in the game since day 1.\nThere is an entire Map Pack DLC that is basically unusable in Multiplayer because they don't have pit lanes.\nPit stop system is unintuitive, hard to use, and broken / bugged.  Sometimes the system doesn't give you tires when you ask.  And Visa Versa.  You are also limited to a TOTAL number of pit stop strategies over all of the cars available.  Furthermore, pits give you gas, then tires, with no option to select otherwise (like simultaneous) or select class based setup.\nAlmost a year after release, there is only the 1 option for Race Modes:  The standard race.  There are no other modes, even as gimicks.  You can guess that people are getting tired of it.\nThere are still some "tuning" tricks (bugs) that make cars go faster than they should.\nThere is no way to save a tuning file, import one, or export it.  Everything has to be transcribed manually from in game to out, and back.\nNo viable option for a custom skins.\nAll multiplayer games go through steam.  Steam goes down, your race room dies, even in the middle of a race.  I.E. Steam isn't just a match making service, it is a server hub for the race and all of PCars.\nQualifying results are wiped if someone is DCed.  They are not attached to the Steam ID like they should be.\nNo "Tow back to pits" option if you get damaged.  So basically you have to try to drive back, and endanger everyone else on the way.\nNo ability to reconnect to a server if you get DCed mid race.\nThere is a "Time-out" function to prevent people from connecting late in a session (practice, qual...).  I can't tell you the number of times I've seen someone bust their ♥♥♥ to practice for hours and get entirely locked out of a race because the game won't let them connect when there is 2:20 left, rather than 2:40.  Absolutely moronic.\nThere is the option to host a race that is 24 hours long, but you are not able to switch drivers.  Why freaking bother?\nSome of the weather options are broken and don't work.\nThe in game spotter system is absolutely crap.  He doesn't spot for you, nor does he actually say anything useful or worthwhile.  (Though someone has made a 3rd party spotter APP that is amazing.)\nHard enforced "Cut Track Penalties" which force you to slow down immediately (often in front of other cars who can't avoid it fast enough).\nNo real mod support, specifically Steam Workshop use.  This game could have lived for years, if it had.\nMultiplayer Rooms are dying, apparently 10 months of crippling bugs and missing vital functions is too much for some people.  Most of the time 50% of a room leaves when it's clear that they won't win (see built in skill / safety system bulletin).\nVAC doesn't seem to ban cheaters (not implying that there are any at all), all it does is ban people who rejoin too many times, or gives off a false positive.  (There is no way for a regular server to turn it off, too.)\nThe lobby chat system is broken.  You can't type anything in or see anything others in the lobby chat have typed.  You must be driving to type and see.\nNEW GAMEBREAKING BUG: There are invisible walls in the middle of the track.  Imagine driving down the middle of the road, and your car smashes into something invisible.  Guess what happens to a car at 180 MPH when it comes to a sudden stop.\nNEW GAMEBREAKING BUG: Cut tracks are now broken.  They are applied inconsistently, and sometimes get stuck.  Since you are hard forced into slowing down, the cut-track penalty getting stuck kills you.\nOLD GAMEBREAKING BUG NOT YET LISTED:  Cars spawn in to the starting grid sidewise, upside down, backwards...  I.E. The game doesn't work sometimes when the race starts!\nOLD GAMEBREAKING BUG NOT YET LISTED: Sometimes when the race is over, the final results splash screen doesn't show up.  I.E. The entire room breaks, and you can't see what happened in the race.\nOLD GAMEBREAKING BUG NOT YET LISTED:  Rolling starts don't work.  AT ALL.\nOLD GAMEBREAKING BUG NOT YET LISTED:  Sometimes the game locks up on loading.\nNEW GAMEBREAKING BUG:  Tire system is broken.  Soft tires last as long as mediums or hards.  There is little to no real tire degradation.  There is very little tire strategy due to them being broken.\nOLD GAMEBREAKING BUG NOT YET LISTED: Severe controller (wheel) issues.  Sometimes the steering ratio is borked when you start up, and requires a game restart.  Some people get FFB bugs.  Some people need to recalibrate every single time they start up the game.  Horrible controller support for a full retail game.\nSo to sum up, Project Cars 1 is missing a LOT of basic, necessary functions a racing game needs to be just a normal racing game.  Maybe Project Cars 2 will fix it, but after fully investing in PCars1 and getting stiffed, I'll not be buying PCars2.\n\nEdit:  After seeing the utter incompetence of WMD in not fixing their game, I've decided to list the remaining gamebreaking bugs I hadn't yet listed.","April 10","false","976.1"," 143 of 187 people (76%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","76","143","187","10","24"

I do not feel that it lives up to the hype.\n\nFirst off, the graphics are hardly as great as all the review sites claim. In some ways, they are impressive. The lighting is the standout, once you get past the cliche stuff like post-processed lens flare. The car models are impressive too. Textures and landscape are passable. But, what kills the look of this game for me are two things: First, the terrible, terrible shadows. These look like what you'd expect from the 16-bit era. They are rendered in what looks like horribly low resolution and flicker like crazy. almost pixelating the track wherever they are cast. Even on 'ultra' setting. Just terrible. And SMAA antiliasing seems to make the shadows worse. Speaking of which -- then there's the aliasing. Sure, the game offers a whole bunch of anti-aliasing options. But none of them work very well. Even with MSAA 4x and SMAA at 'ultra', there are brutal jaggies everywhere. The only way I could reign this in was by cranking Nvidia DSR with smoothness filter at 50% and FXAA at 'high'. That would normally result in a blurry mess in most games, but this game is so over sharpened and aliased out of the box that you need to do this to get anything like a decent look. Overall, I don't get the big fuss over this game in the graphical department. It looks decent but nothing special in my opinion. I've run it maxed out in 1440p and on triple 1080p screens, downsampled from 4k, you name it... nothing has impressed me very much.\n\n(By contrast: another recent racing game, Dirt Rally, currently in early access, looks to my eye WAY, WAY, better. That game has excellent anti-aliasing, excellent shadows and ambient occlusion, and at least as nice textures and models. No comparison, in my view.)\n\nSpeaking of triple screens, the game currently has no independent rendering, so you have to set a high FOV and keep your monitors in a straight line. That alone should be a strong signal this is not a very serious racing game, despite whatever the marketing fluf would claim.\n\nThen there's the racing. The dealbreaker for me here is that the AI in this game is infuriating. If you play at the easier difficulty levels, it's a cakewalk to leave them in the dust. But as soon as you crank up the difficulty, not only do they get faster (which is good) but they get excessively aggressive -- so the game becomes a demolition derby.  Earlier today I tried TWENTY TIMES to get through the first corner in an open wheeled race. I ended up rage quitting. The AI cars ram into you and each other like suicidal morons, so you can't get started without getting rammed and spun out, very likely suffering 'suspension damage' that renders your car undrivable. I tried a bunch of different race setups and the result is nearly always the same. Set the difficulty at 80% or higher, and most of the AI cars will be missing bodywork 10 seconds into the race, and the only way to avoid their mayhem is to hang back behind them all. This is so stupidly unrealistic and game-breaking, it'd be hilarious if I hadn't dropped a good chunk of cash on this.\n\nSo, overall, we have decent but way overhyped graphics and racing crippled by terrible AI. My recommendation is to pass over this game, at least for now. I bought into the hype train on this one, don't make the same mistake.\n\nEDIT AS OF PATCH 2.0:\n\nThis latest patch seems to have achieved some improvement to AI aggression. I no longer experience as consistently infuriating a melee off the line and into the first corner with high difficulty levels. However, that isn't to say the AI cars won't still ram you from behind, sideswipe you while cornering, etc. They still seem to drive like they're blind, drunk and senile pretty frequently. And it's frustrating when this happens halfway through the race, when some AI driver comes out of the pits and decides to ram you. This may actually be even more annoying than the demolition derby off the starting line.\n\nAlso, the main AI avoidance mechanism now seems to be driving off into the grass and the gravel traps. Which is a bit comical because they seem to magically drive at full speed over these surfaces and rejoin the asphalt at race pace. I often look in my rearview and see AI cars driving at full clip all over the grass as they struggle to avoid each other. By contrast, you will slow to a crawl and struggle to control your car if you hit the gravel. I've also noticed the AI drivers cutting corners, while you will get a 'warning from the race director' if you do so. These warnings, by the way, seem overly sensitive with this new patch. This adds to the frustration when an AI car sideswipes you, forcing you to put a wheel on the grass, and the game announces you've 'cut the corner' and will be penalized.\n\nI've also experienced some frustrating new bugs and crashes. A standout was when I had run a great qualifying lap and wanted to skip to the beginning of the race. I was treated instead to an infinite loading screen. I had to end task, lose my time, and start again. Checking the forums I saw numerous others are having the same problem.\n\nI still have mixed feelings about the graphics. I guess if you have a high tolerance for aliasing and other temporal artifacts (I've noticed lately that the game also seems to have texture fighting issues, with distant objects flashing), and enjoy post-processed lighting effects, this will impress. But that is not my preference, and it is still my opinion that this game's graphics are overhyped.\n\nOverall, there is some improvement evident with Patch 2.0, but not enough to edge this out of the thumbs-down zone for me. The frustration is still overwhelming the fun. The game still feels far from a polished product. Maybe someday this will be a great game, but it isn't yet.","June 13, 2015","false","50.2"," 341 of 504 people (68%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","68","341","504","24","24"

Going into PCars, I was hoping for a light sim with drivable if not phenomenal physics and track modelling, tons of qualilty content, a solid career mode, and top-notch artificial intelligence.\n\nThe physics for most of the race cars actually managed to exceed my expectations.  The Prototypes, GT Cars, and modern Open Wheelers in particular are generally fun to drive and behave more or less in the manner you would expect.  Most of the street cars, on the other hand, would be unsellable if they handled as poorly as they do in this sim.    There are also the odd gMotor-like physics issues with regards to how the cars interact with the track surface, as occasionally what should be minor undulations will actually cause tires to lose contact with the track entirely, as if the suspension isn't doing its job properly.  Additionally, some cars have very little grip when the tires are outside of their optimal temperature range, where in reality you would expect slightly less grip but for the tires to otherwise maintain their usual slip characteristics.\n\nThe tracks are also surprisingly well modelled considering that, AFAIK, laser-scanning was not used to create them.  Having driven many of these tracks in iRacing and Assetto Corsa, I was impressed with how close they are represented here.  With that said, elevation and camber changes seem to have gotten the worst of it, but overall the tracks are functional and don't take me out of the experience.\n\nThe career mode is almost insultingly barebones.  I am absolutely in love with the idea of basing it on a real motorsports career, where you can choose a starting level and work your way up and down the disciplines appropriately.  What I'm not in love with is the hightly repetitive nature of the social media aspects, where the same handful of headlines, emails and fake twitter posts are repeated based on your performance in the most recent race.\n\nWhat I'm also not in love with, in regards to the career, is how the AI difficulty is automatically scaled downwards based on which tier you are racing in.  I understand that they're trying to simulate the level of talent increasing as you progress higher through your career, but the differences should be based on the density of talent rather than a change to the overall difficulty slider.  This is something that I think Dirt Rally does well - the top times are always in the same ballpark, but the overall skill of the field tightens up as you move through your DR career.  Whether you're racing in karts or the LMP series (which is, laughably, placed higher than F1 in the career tree), the top drivers should be similarly skilled.  The difference should be that the LMP series would have more of those top drivers than the lower tiers.\n\nSpeaking of AI, the AI is super aggressive.  I like that they attempt to defend and gain positions, but the "red mist" that has apparently been implemented has got to go.  It is routine to see cars, after being passed, immediately cut the next corner or run wide on the exit, even if doing so means driving directly into another car or a physical barrier.  Addtionally, the lines they take at times are shockingly bad.  Braking too late into corners and then getting on the throttle far too late, causing them to crawl down the ensuing straight.  Cutting corners or exiting wide, again causing them to crawl down the ensuing straight.  The AI in this game basically drives like first-time online racers, with no situational awareness and no understanding of the importance of early throttle application on corner exit.\n\nI feel like, despite not recommending this title, there are quite a few positives to be had.  However the poor career mode and AI really make the overall experience pointless, as there are far better sims out there for online play or hotlapping.  As of this time I cannot recommend the title, but I do plan on revisiting it in the future when it has been patched further and more content has been released.","July 3, 2015","false","46.9"," 237 of 344 people (69%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","69","237","344","21","11"

Quite a few people were interested in this aspect so will put this update up top.\n\nThe rest of the game has improved but is still a mixed bag. To be blunt the early access DiRT Rally is a more consistent and polished product than the current version of pCARS.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWell here we are finally project cars is erm finished? Complete? Er let’s just say its ‘released’!\nConsidering where the build was years ago I had hoped, dreamed, and even reasonably expected more. Somehow I think by trying to do absolutely everything pCARS has it all but none of it is really 100% sadly.\n\nDon’t get me wrong pCARS is great. If I could, this review wouldn’t be a thumbs up or down but a wavering in-between. There just really needs to be a critique of pCARS other than the overflowing WMD love fest currently on steam. Take with a grain of salt the reviews of those personally involved with the development of this game. We all stand to possibly gain financially from its success to boot. Although the details are very very murky. Perhaps my negative review will mean my financial reward is lost? We’ll see :) Would you trust the cast of a movie to honestly review a movie on release? Of course not… what about the crew? Well if they all have royalty options and are hardcore fans dedicated and have been working for free the past few years? Up to you. I see pCARS as the first racing sim to have a hardcore fan base with plenty of ‘fanboys’ preloaded before release!\n\nIf you have 20 minutes spare this video captures my point exactly:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eD7o_f7s0Y\n\nPROS:\n-Variety\nHeaps of cars for all tastes! Open wheelers, road cars and everything else!\nLots of tracks and configurations.\nWhat a variety of conditions. Want to run a 24 hour race around Bathurst with everything from thunderstorms to clear sky’s go for it!\n-Visuals\nAmazing screen shots. You’ve seen them!\nThe car models are stunning.\nGreat cockpits with all moving parts (via g-forces too) bells and whistles.\n-Large grids.\nDepending on the track run 40 cars. (this has been unstable for me in the past)\n-Built by the community.\nDespite my problems with the rabid variety of fan boy any developer that listens and reacts is doing good in my book.\n\nCONS:\n-Variety\nBy giving you everything and the kitchen sink (thank god rallying was dropped!!) SMS have bitten off more than they could chew in my opinion. Few cars or tracks feel 100% polished at this stage.\nPushing the limits of number of AI and conditions still results in occasional crashes for me.\n-Visuals\nThey don’t live up to the screen shots!\nAt the beginning of development my PC was woefully under spec. I could tour around in some builds hot lapping by myself waiting for the day I got a beast and it would look like the screen shots.\nI got my i7 with SSD and 16gig of ram gtx 970 and I can get over 100FPS with a full field in the rain but it doesn’t look at all like the screen shots out there. Some talented community members have worked magic with the photo mode and post processing on videos.\n-Starts in background.\nThe game has never ever, on 2 different PC’s I’ve owned, started as the foreground window. It starts goes into the task bar and there I can click or alt-tab all I want, it stays until I kill the process… The only way I can play is from the quick launch right clicking steam. If it’s been a while since playing I have to start it then kill it and quick launch. This was raised and talked about forever on WMD, how on earth is it still not fixed? Don’t have any trouble with any other game at all!\n-Terrible gamepad support.\nYes I can hear them now why use a gamepad it’s a SIM etc. Short answer I have too. My back is stuffed. I have all the gear I want it’s no good if I can’t use it. Anyway I have learnt to get around in other SIMS with my Xbox one PC controller. It’s not easy but I get around in iRacing, rFactor 2, Assetto Corsa, Race Room Racing Experience and many other sims with the gamepad. Race Room Racing Experience in my experience setting the bar for how a sim should support gamepad.\nI really can’t understand it I used to enjoy NFS shift as an in-between serious racing game for some fun. It had terrible wheel support with massive dead zones and was only really playable with the gamepad. So now the same developers have gone and created a game that is completely unplayable with the gamepad but now works great with the wheel? Why why why?\n-AI\nThe AI has improved a lot in the final build. But then it had too! In this final build the AI displays less of its psychotic death wish driving style, actually respecting the track boundaries and your car for the most. However it is not possible to run a race without finding corner tyres and witches hats strewn everywhere after the first few laps. Being on a qualifying lap then slamming into a corner tire thrown onto the racing line and losing your lap time because of contact brings the kind of joy known only previously by the gran turismo special mission races. Don’t touch anything or you fail. AI rams you… oh joy! Why do all modern sims have such poor over aggressive AI? rFactor 2 is the only modern sim that will give you anything like the sort of behaviour you would see at a professional race weekend as opposed to the open multiplayer full of kids experience todays AI seems to replicate!\n-Physics\nWMD members get excited by the SETA tire model. It dynamically simulates aspects of the tire model that other sims use static graphs and data to simulate. In theory tires should heat up, cool down, wear out, flex and a whole lot of subtle things more realistically. In practice I don’t think it’s finished yet. A tire model is a hell of a thing to develop. Clever people have been at it for decades building upon previous work done. Is this dynamic model a step toward the future. Yes. Does it right now give you the best, most consistently matching real life data model out there today. Nope. In a word the physics feel 'floaty'...\n\n\nAnd this pretty much sums up pCARS right now. The potential is huge. Bigger than anything before. But there simply wasn’t enough time to finish every part of the game to the level it deserves. I would have gladly had less cars, less track, less dynamic models to have GT cars with the weather all at a 100% finished level polished like all hell, than a bit of everything that doesn’t quite feel right a lot of the time. I would say if your using a gamepad wait, if you’re not really into your racing sims wait. If you have a wheel and enjoy a wide variety of different racing sims that all have different pros and cons then no doubt this purchase is a no brainer! Just don’t expect the holy grail of sims that some claim it to be and you won’t be disappointed.\nI’m hoping they finish this off it really could be brilliant. But having heard pCARS 2 already mentioned I’m not sure this sim will ever get the polish it needs.","May 7, 2015","false","91.1"," 542 of 820 people (66%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","66","542","820","37","36"

Most reviews of this game come from people playing a controller. In it's own right I understand that not everyone will have a high end racing wheel to use. However, any real sim should be tested and reviewed at minimum with a controller and a wheel.\n\nFirst things first, I am not some crazy over the top fanboy. This game looks great. The interface is smooth, and has a very nice layout. The graphics put it in a league of its own. There are lots of little things that this game gets right that a lot of other racing games and sims alike seem to really muck up. This is one of the first games that I have played that did not immediately lock up the rear wheels when pulling the hand brake. On the subject of Brakes, this has a loose idea of something called Brake fade. The hotter the rotors get, the more distance the car will need to stop or slow down. The engine temp will rise and fall depending on ambient temperature, Driving style, clean air V.S. Drafting. It has a lot of small things done very well. It is one of the few where you can toggle the lights and see the effect on the environment. The different camera angles are spot on. There are true elements the devs wanted this game to be a sim.\n\nI want to like Project CARS. I really do, but I can't. This is not a sim. It is a game. Had it been marketed more as a game I would have loved it. In fact in early development it was. It changed rather abruptly near launch however. It became the "Ultimate Driver Journey" and "For Racers by Racers." None of the actual racers I know whether it is SCCA cone chasers or Rally America drivers had many things that we said put into this game. The end product actually turned out to be something some of us downright hated. The physics are buggy, sometimes you fall through the track, sometimes the car has more grip than it would on rails, other times it is like driving on ice. Collisions are far from sim level. You might be asking, " Isn't the point of a sim not to crash?" Absolutely, however mistakes happen on the track. It is a reality of the sport that drivers have to accept every time tires touch the track. This game has nearly no consequences for mistakes large or small. Hit a rumble strip too hard, nothing will happen. Bump a player or AI. Mild scratches. Really hit them, body damage and mild alignment failure. It seems really upsetting that games or sims in this genre really seem to ignore player punishment. The odd thing of it all is that is what players want. We want the aggravated feeling of throwing away the whole race over a miscalculation leading us to rip an oil pan off and blow an engine; Or the feeling of unspeakable pride when we finally master a track.\n\nI know that there are going to be bugs in a game like this. I am sure things like that lack of Force Feedback, or awkward dead-zones will eventually be fixed. There isn't a game out there that is trying to achieve this level of detail that wont have a few things to work out. I understand that, but there was so much potential that was just thrown away. It was like a sim that didn't know it wanted to be a sim. Driving feels disconnected and not very authentic.\n\nProject CARS is a good game, but just that. If you are a hard core racing sim seeker I would go into this game with the idea that it is not a sim. It is a fun and somewhat challenging racing game, but it will not meet all of your needs as a hardcore driving sim fan. In total I will give Project CARS a 77/100. The beautiful graphics and amazing attention to detail make this game stand out, but I can not forgive the vague sense of driving or the important bits that Slightly Mad Studios Gave up on. With that I can not recommend this Sim as a sim. It gets an "Eh maybe" as a game.","May 29, 2015","false","20.9"," 272 of 415 people (66%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","66","272","415","23","13"

Either SMS have an idiotic sense of finances and were duped into including nvidia ads in their game for free, or they are lying through their teeth. As their successful financing of the game hints at good sense of money, I'm sorry to say the latter one is the more sensible of the two options.

I own Forza for XBox One and GT6 for PS3 so the first thing that stands out are the graphics on the PC... Wow!\nThe loves.. I love that when you are racing in any city, that you feel like you are there.. the buildings in the distance are as detialed as the race track, the smog, the amazing weather affects.. as it starts to rain, it is on your windshield but not on the track, as it continues, you can see the rain puddle as the track stops absorbing it! And the sunset hitting the clouds as the rain stops.. Wow again.\nThe likes.. I like that there are 7 views possible for racing: bumper, hood, left/mid/right driver view, windshield, and above behind. I like that the controller is very responsive.. I haven't tried my G27 with it yet. And I like that it feels as though it has a lot of potential..\nThe dislikes.. Where are the cars? There are 74ish cars. And I'm sure that there are lots more coming.. but that's just it.. it doesn't seem finished. From the menus, to the woman explaining each part, it doesn't feel as polished as the actual racing. I couldn't figure out how to quit the game! Why would I want to? The cars come fully modified. Meaning there is nothing to buy. But you can fine tune every detail from +/- .1% toe in angle, to shock height etc. But don't take too long cause the practice, or qualifier timer is still running.. and you want to qualify for one of the top 4 spots or forget it. When I have started in 16th I have usually ended up in 16th.\nSo to sum up. If you want a racing game that is exceptionally detailed visually, has great car control (for the cars it has), and has a lot of potential.

Moved original review UP for people who can't read.\n\nHaving over 100 hours in this game now. In many parts it feels good, but there are many things that are constantly annoying, and after I think 7 patches so far the problems are still there.\n\nPros I can think of:\nLook better than most other sims, day/night transition and weather look good\nA career mode which keeps you busy\nA decent number of players online\nMany cars are good to drive and makes more sense than most arcade titles\nProblems I can think of:\nTwtichy graphics. Flickering textures here and there no matter what settings I use. Reflections and special effects often look fake.\nDespite most people's praise, the game looks bad in many aspects, such as night. It looks way worse than say the new NFS. Also you can try driving behind a Mustang at night with you head light turns on. The Mustang's rear will look really bad. Same with many other cars. In addition, Azure coast and California highway don't look quite good as those screenshots.\nYou need to turn track detail settings to high in order to see graffiti on Nordschleife, which means they don't regard graffiti as reference points but as decoration.\nIn-car camera way too dark. Feels very unrealistic. It looks like you have window tint on your windscreen.\nOnline lobby is usually a big mess. Much bigger than sims that more heavily depends on dedicated server. Everybody makes a lobby with car/track they like, and many don't make much sense such as 5 lap race with mandatory pitstop, Formula A cars having track day with slow road cars, etc. There are lots of wreckers too.\nMany cars feel stiff, and their behavior sometimes doesn't make sense.\nAI is bad, they either can't drive themselves, or like to ram players, or are too pacifist and don't give chanllenge, depending on car classes they use. AI is particularly bad in Karts.\nThey aren't affected by weather as much as players do, which is unfair and frustrating.\nRolling start is broken. It often guarantees the 2nd place player gets to 1st when green, and there are a lot more bugs related to rolling start, which havn't been resolved since launch.\nRace start sequence is fixed. The timing from the last red to green is always the same.\nTrack-cut detection is broken. People can still gain lots of advantage cutting the track without getting any penalty.\nEngine start is the most pathetic in all games that have this feature. Instant engine start with no sound at all.\nFFB feels too much spring, and the community relies on JackSpade guy's hard work to make FFB work, which should be the devs' job in the first place.\nCommunity events/Time trial leaderboards have problems. Record on Hockenheim GP is an SLS GT3 in less than 25 seconds. I bet it's faster than a jet fighter.\nCalendar in the career mode is poorly thought out. 24h Le Mans seems always in mid December which doesn't make sense. You can have multiple events on the same day at opposite side of the planet and feels very unrealistic.\nUI is made worse and worse. After the new update the option button and shutdown button on the top right corner are almost invisible. What were they thinking?\nNo proper triple monitor support (graphics are stretched to side screens and UI is not designed to work best with 3 monitors), and the telemetry HUD is unusable on triple monitor, while other features kind of work on triple screen. This means when they first design the game, they never even think about triple screen setup, which is ridiculous since it's aiming at the sim racing community.\nThere is no way to change any option at all when racing. You can't even adjust game's sound volume. To get a nice FOV or to find the best video settings, you have to go into and out of races back and forth constantly, and there is no automatic visual settings. There is also no way to check you button binding when you are in race.\nMany problems with physics. Rain is unrealistic. Contact between cars is broken (cars that make contact with stick to each other).\nAs a Wii U owner, the developers' attitude towards the promised and then abandoned Wii U version and Nintendo supporters is ridiculous.\nDLCs, especially the Japanese car DLC, feel like lazy work and cash grab.\nIt's a nice game but loaded with problems. I think a "Postive" rating should best describe how it is.\n\n\n\nYou don't have to read the updates below at all.\n==============================================================\nUPDATE 3/27/2016\nRepsonse to that daddy do it right guy with a reply regarding the Wii U stuff. I assume this guy is a PCars fan, and I dislike his attitude towards my negative take on PCars Wii U release cancellation.\n1. Far back in 2012 SMS has confirmed a Wii U release. The Wii U logo appeared on their website, along with Steam OS version announced and confirmed. They did get a lot of funding from Wii U owners and supporters from their crowd funding campaign.\n2. Since the annoucement of PCars, SMS had been constantly asked about the Wii U's capability of handling such a racing sim as PCars, and SMS had been constantly saying PCars will come to Wii U. You can still access the presentation slides here: http://www.wmdportal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/WMD_Overview_160212.pdf\nThey talk about utilizing Wii U's unique controls quite a bit.\n3. For people who don't own or like Wii U and believe I (along with many other Wii U owners) am "gullible", check that slide and see on page 22 how many promised features and aspects are left out from the game or are made into paid DLCs to milk gamers. You can even find videos of Indianapolis track from early builds of the game, but the official release left this out for no good reason.\n4. I'll list some quotes from SMS regarding the Wii U version of PCars, check what they said:\nJan 7, 2014. http://gamingbolt.com/project-cars-will-showcase-the-hidden-power-of-the-wii-u-slightly-mad-studios\nSep 5, 2014. http://www.gamespot.com/articles/project-cars-wii-u-delay-theres-no-conspiracy-dev-/1100-6422143/\n5. Even without a Wii U release, the PC version and console versions are full of bugs and issues. I personally will no longer support this developer. Me being gullible? No. It's this developer's attitude and expertise being far below my guess, and many others'.\n\n\nUPDATE 2/6/2016\nReply to the "if you don't want it just refund it" comment:\nTo begin with I pre-ordered this game because I wanted to support them bring the first ever racing sim to WiiU (but then they dropped it which is disappointing), and back then there was no such thing as Steam refund.\n\nBesides, current refund policy requires game time less than 2 hours, which in most cases will not do a fair review for racing sims. Most racing sims even need more than 2 hours to set up your controller and FOV correct. I have over 100 hours into PCars now, and I'm confident that my negative review on PCars much more fair and unbiased than other people's negative review, who only spend less than 2 hours in the game. Yes PCars for me should be more than 5/10, but due to the polarity of how Steam review works, if I'm asked "Do you recommend PCars to people who wants a racing sim" my answer would probably be no, hence my negative review.\n\nAlso I just lost my about 80 hours career save when I change my hard drive. It seems that the save file is local and not cloud backed-up. Be careful when you reinstall the game.","December 27, 2015","false","115.7"," 321 of 505 people (64%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","64","321","505","23","28"

They don't react to the terrain (such as gravel, which is like glue to you, the player, but the ai seem unaffected), they follow their terrible racing line whether you're trying to pass or not, they smash into you constantly, and they sometimes fly off the road at full speed into a chicane or hairpin (even on 100%). I'm not the fastest and 100% ai is pretty easy to beat on most car/track combinations. If the driving was amazing I might even look past it (I do for AC's ai woes) but the driving is pretty meh.

I wanted to back it up but i was afraid to throw my money away because Slightly Mad Studios were behind NFS shift series, which i disliked. This time there's no EA behind the game, instead Namco Bandai published the game, it's not the best publisher out there, but they're definitely better than EA.\n\nThis game is nothing like NFS shift (i so want just erase that „f“). Shift 2 was unplayable for me. I have tried it on PS3 and PC, on both platforms i had a huge 0,5 second input lag which made the game unplayable for me. I tried some fixes on PC, but it didn‘t help. Besides that there was almost no force feedback and the performance was not so great. Many people thought that Project cars will be Shift 3. But fortunately it‘s nothing like Shift, it‘s much MUCH better. It is one of the best racing simulators to this day. But of course it has flaws. It was released in a very bad state, almost unplayable if you play career mode. Patches coming very slow, SMS do not want to acknowledge bugs. Consoles are holding the patches too.\n\nI can‘t not compare pCars to Assetto corsa, i own both but i like pCars slightly more. The physics in pCars are no very good and ffb is worse. Nothing changed to this day. And what is even worse that AI is not affected by physics. Raining or not, physics laws doesn't apply for them.\n\nThe graphics. This is probably the best looking racing game on the market. The graphics are stunning. Of course at some weather conditions it can look bland, but the same happens in real life. Unlike Assetto corsa pCars has weather conditions and full day/night cycle. Racing at night while raining is awesome. Rain effects are great, the game looks even better in the rain.\n\nPerformance is not very good. It‘s playable, but i expected better performance with GTX970. It drops to 30-40fps which is not acceptable. But if you lower the graphics options it can run really good. There's slightly to no chance that the game will be optimized.\n\npCars has great career mode unlike AC. And career is really long. You'll race every kind of vehicle, every kind of race etc. You get rewarded for winning and collecting all the rewards will take some time. Difficulty is easily adjustable so is race length.\n\nThe car selection is varied but there are not many cars in the game. Yes quality over quantity, but we need more cars, let it be DLC cars (please give us real DLC, not ones which are already in the game and are created much earlier). I‘d love to see some more slower road cars, more muscle cars, Japanese brands. With such good sale they can afford much more licenses now, so if SMS will not waste the money we could see some nice cars. Sadly there's a problem with custom liveries. If you download one, it replaces the old one. What a nonsense. And the workshop was promised, it even has a section on steam discussion, but there's no workshop.\n\nTrack selection is great. It lacks some tracks, but there is more than enough tracks. And it includes the famous Nordschleife, unlike AC were you need to pay 15€ for it. I guess more tracks will be added via DLC. I also hope for more point to point tracks. Yes AC has laser scanned tracks, pCars not, but not everyone is a maniac who notices this.\n\nI probably haven‘t seen a really good AI in a racing game. pCars is no exception. AI is pretty bad. But from the funny side it is very realistic because you often feel like racing against real people because AI rams you, cut corners and do other stupid things, same as real players. But if being serious, AI is bad. AI is not affected by rain so it‘s very hard to win in the rain, especially when it starts raining in the middle of the race AI keeps the same pace. This was one of the most reported bugs, but SMS did not fix this.\n\nThe multiplayer is similar to other games. There are crashers all around who don‘t know what brakes are. There also are community events where you compete with others in the leaderboards. Similar to Gran turismo system where new events are added each week/month.\n\nThe game is good, but it needs more work, more polish, to fix the bugs, add more features and make current features fully working.\n\nAll in all i can recommend this game if you love racing games and have a steering wheel, love to drive/race, love to adapt to new cars, love to grasp the handling of each car which is completely different. It has it's flaws, especially the official forums, where you can't criticize the game, point out bugs, complain etc. Ian Bell the head of SMS can't communicate properly and even banning people who liked someones negative post. Besides many addressed issues were not fixed in patch 1.4. But how it can be fixed when reporting bugs on official forum can be a bannable offense. So the game is good, but it's not finished and buggy and it will probably stay that way forever. There's no support from SMS. After two months major bugs are not fixed. So i suggest wait at east half a year or even a year and get it for 75% off (it is not worth the full price), maybe the patch will be released which will fix the bugs...in a year or two.\n\nPros:\n\nGreat graphics\nGreat sound\nNice career mode\nGood amount of tracks\n\nCons:\n\nPoor physics and tire model\nPoor FFB\nLack of car variety\nLack of updates and fixes\nIan Bell","June 13, 2015","true","38.6"," 163 of 266 people (61%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","61","163","266","8","13"

The physics are really forgiving when compared to iRacing, but overall they are solid. The Career mode is good, and provides you with a lot of opportunities to drive all different kinds of cars while still giving you a "season"-style experience. The emails and feedback you get from your racing directors are repetitive though... not sure why they are even there considering they say the exact same thing over and over again, to the letter.\n\nMajor con against the game would be the trash AI. Open-wheel racing is near impossible due to the AI's desire to wreck you. In closed-wheel cars its less of an issue, but its a major frustration elsewhere. Also, the multiplayer is unpopulated and disappointing.\n\nIf you want a good single player racing game, get Project Cars.

Kart racing in this game has actually improved my IRL go-karting tremendously.\n\nI'm not exactly an experienced driver when it comes to racing wheels; I use a DF GT on my rig whenever time permits me to play PCars, but what I do play I enjoy thoroughly. The game could be considered sim-cade'ish, but its leaning towards sim' so yeah, but AC is probably a better choice for pure driving. Car selection in PCars however is the ♥♥♥♥ for racing oriented vehicles, street not so much (although DLCs are fixing that).\n\nMy only criticism with AC (which I consider a better racer in terms of driving physics and such), and mostly the reason I prefer to play PCars over AC atm is the presentation and UI.\n\nAC's UI is IMHO garbage, it plain sucks. I use a 3K display monitor and the way the game is set up between the menus and the actual driving part is "bleh" to say the least because of windows scaling issues. It's not very user friendly is what I would say.\n\nPCars on the other hand is more welcoming, sort of.\n\nYou can't really save multiple tuning setups for the same car so that's a gigantic PITA, and configuring my wheel took forever (I haven't played in a few months, some of my complaints may have been resolved, who knows).\n\nAnd it has to be said, the announcement of PCars2 shortly after release was a bit infuriating, but at least it doesn't exactly seem like they have stopped support for THIS game so we'll see how it goes.\n\nMultiplayer in this game is eh I guess, not really much in way of variety. I LOVE the track day pub sessions (which is primarily the only sessions I ever come across), lots of cars with both good and bad drivers behind them swerving around tracks like Francorchamps or the Dubai Autodrome (my two favourite courses), and of course the lovely Nordschleife ;)\n\nI'd give it a 7-8/10, game has a lot of good in it, but the bads do outweigh it. Definitely try it out if you're into racing sims, and ABSOLUTELY use a wheel.[/b]","April 25","true","32.2"," 34 of 46 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","34","46","0","0"

I do like it, mostly.  The proble is that the controls don't feel realistic at all.  Not even close.  Even after pouring a good chunk of time into changing every concievable aspect most cars come off feeling like you are driving either a heavy truck or like you're driving on ice.  This game is totally unfinished and feels like a beta release.  the graphics are 7/10.  The driving physics are hit and miss but not even close for something claiming to be a sim, so 5/10. The AI is garbage and on rails.  I'm not great, by any means, but I know smart AI drivers when I see them and this ain't it.  I bought this thinking there might be some support for it but it turns out they are already looking to PCars 2.  Ah well.  I'd say it's worth $15, not the $30 I spent.  Even on sale, this game feels like it's asking too much.  I appreciate the attempt, but the excecution falls WAY short of what is now industry standard.  I'm not new to driving sims or arcades titles and this is neither one.\n\nEdit:  Something else to mention is the disappointing lack of customization and small car roster.

Since 2012, I've been a huge fan of rFactor 2, probably spent more than 2000-3000 hrs on it since then.  I also have more than 600 hrs with Assetto Corsa, and I came back to rFactor 2, because AC is so shallow.  The visuals sure are better than rF2, but everything feels gimmicky.  Lots of canned effects, and after a while, the initial wow factor wear off very quickly.\n\nIf you like to race single player, than AC is pretty much only hotlapping, if you have any driving skills, the AI is very weak.\n\nSo I like rFactor 2 AI a lot..  it feels very natural in most cases.\n\nI have not been part of the alpha phase of pCars, since I learned about it, and the registration were closed.\n\nKnowing this was SMS, those who made Shift series, I expected something like it, but maybe more oriented toward sim.\n\nI also expected the game to run far from the visuals I have seen in screenshots and video, since my rig is pretty modest:\n\nPhenom II X4 965\n8gb generic ram\ngtx 580 1.5gb\n\nAnd yet, the game runs silky smooth at native resolution of 1920x1080, with AA, track details ultra, grass ultra, most other settings high, reflection mid, and the game looks pretty good, miles better than I would have hoped.\n\nI started the game with more conservative settings, and bumped them up a few times, and this is what I'm running now.\n\nI'm playing the game with a stock g27, and the feedback is nothing short of stellar.  It blows AC out of the water.\n\nThere are so many settings to tailor the game how you want it,  I've played with FFB settings, and managed to get feedback almost identical to AC, and with some different settings, feedback like rF2.   I'm now playing with something in between.  Feels very good.\n\nThe UI is excellent, looks good, clean, but could use more usability refinement.  Going to options to adjust settings is too many clicks away.  The same when you run hotlaps.  We could have the leaderboard showing there, instead of having to go back to the menu, in leaderboard (and it doesnt remember the car you have selected, so you need to select the car you are running) and then you see where you stand.\n\nBut having the leaderboard integrated like this and the possibility to load up any ghosts from there is a huge feature, if you are like me, and like to improve your lap times by running time trials.  I play mostly single player.  Haven't tried multi-player yet, but I wouldn't expect much from public lobbies.\n\nSo far, I'm nearing 2000km driven on the nordschleife exclusively, as I haven't tried any other tracks, and this one is brilliant.\n\nAfter seeing this version, one might question if Kunos really laser scanned their nordschleife, since the elevation changes don't look proper after nordkhere, thru hatzenbach, and hocheichen.  This version seems to nail it on spot.\n\nOne thing Kunos have done better tho, is the attention to details regarding the bushes, the fully modelled terrain (this seems to use a few layer of cardboard mountains) and curbs.  In this version, most higher curbs seems to have been lowered, and they don't quite have the shape they should.  They are made so you can run over most of them.  A little bummer, but it is indeed more interesting as you have more racing surface to use.   Also Kunos have dirtied the x bricks seen in the inside of the karussell and other locations, SMS did not.  Kunos also added 3d grass on the outside of those brick.. it looks nicer this way.  SMS x bricks looks brand new.\n\nPhysics are what you would expect from a sim.  I haven't played with aids or anything, so I dunno how far from sim it can become if you don't play as I do, but in my book, it's a sim.  Pure sim.  It doesn't lack much options either.\n\nYou can fine tune FOV for EVERY view, independantly, and there are more options for anything than you probably want.  If you are a console gamer, you will definately feel lost.  But play with a setting, and go back in game and see what it does.  If you use the helmet camera, there is quite a few options to set exactly how you want your view.\n\nThe car setups are as detailed as any sims would be.  The numbers used for setting might not be values in real life, such as downforce for wings, it's not in degree, but a fictive number.  But does it really matter for the targeted audience?  F1 drivers wont be traning professionally with this...  neither they are training with rF2, but instead rFactor pro..    but the game could probably be turned into a pro version to train pro drivers.\n\nSo, if you are like me and have every sim there is, like rFactor 2, AC, BeamNG, WRS, GSCE, etc, then you have to give this one a try, specially if you are more into single player like I do.  The integrated leaderboard will keep you honing your skills as you defend your position in it.\n\nI haven't tried to race the AI much, but have done one race, and it seemed very good.  Might not be at rFactor 2 level, but it's probably the next best.  Well, with rF2, I'm also counting all gmotor engine based game... so that includes GSCE and more...  at least the recent ones... I'm not sure for rFactor 1 itself, would have to play it again.\n\nI'm delighted with pCars and I will be playing this for a long time to come I think.\n\nGood job SMS!","May 8, 2015","true","277.5"," 65 of 101 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","65","101","3","0"

To be honest it seems like Project cars has taken little bits of each racing game I have played and combined it into one mass production.\n\nPROS:\nThe Graphics- Simply stunning, this has to be one of the most realistic games I have purchased in quite a while and certainly does impress (provided you have the specs to push it)\n\nThe Gameplay- When it comes to racing, nothing is more important than playing a game which is fast paced and competitive, there are plenty of settings that accomodate for difficulty, weather, time and day to customize to your every need. If you want, you can have a Sunday drive in a classic vehicle on some of the worlds most famous roads, or have a heartracing encounter at bathurst behind the wheel of a true racecar.\n\nThe Cars- If you like your cars, this is the game for you. There is a mass selection of cars that are available (without purchasing DLC packs) and you can also expand your garage and buy unique cars and show them off to other players.\n\n\nCONS:\nAI- When racing in a Singleplayer game, you would expect the AI to be somewhat realistic to online racers, but its dissappointing to see when your going for a pass (particularly on tight tracks) that the other cars seem to sway for no apparent reason, some even running of the track when making turns. Now this may not be a major issue and could even be fixed via difficulty settings, but its not a major setback.\n\nOnline- Probably the most annoying thing in this game is the online community, yes there are people that do actively engage in Project CARS, but there certainly could be a heap more people that play. Its never really common to find a game that has more than 20+ people in the one race, but there are always racing groups which you can join and then play with them (I do that, because not many Australians play this in my opinion)\n\nCar Customisation- Please dont be fooled by the title, but Project CARS does not let you customise/ modify any of the cars (all you can do is customise liveries), not a big issue if your just into racing.\n\nOverall, this game certainly puts pressure onto Forza and Gran Turismo, as it really makes you feel like you are playing a professional racing simulator. There are arcade elements to the game, but if you want fast cars and pure racing, this is the game for you. Aside from the negatives, this game is thoughrougly enjoyable and will give you a pleasent suprise when you start to get into it. I can guarantee, if you spend the time to effectively tune and work on your car, you will be hooked for hours.\n\n(Just a note, I use an Xbox 360 controller and am getting a Logitech racing set to play)\n\nRating- A (84/100)","February 10","true","64.0"," 40 of 58 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","40","58","2","2"

It still works badly if you have an AMD card. Considering the price of this game, you have to make far too many compromises in order for it to run acceptably well. I am forced to accept this because I already have the game and want to get 'some' value out of it.\n\nThe developers blame this on AMD, but that is irresponsible. Bandai and Slightly Mad should have sorted things out with AMD before selling the game to people with AMD cards. However, I guess 'greed' weighed more than 'ethics'.\n\nAnd 'no' it's not the physics that tanks the system, as games like RaceRoomExperience and Stock Car Extreme offer much more complex physics than Project Cars yet don't overwhelm anyone's system and does not prioritize a specific manufacturer, in this case Nvidia. Instead it's the graphics that tanks the system.\n\nProject Cars highlights everything that's wrong with mainstream gaming. It's all about looking pretty, forget about delivering a quality product worth $60. If you make things that looks pretty enough people will flock to buy it and make excuses for every problem the game has.\n\nAs if it's somehow my fault the game works poorly with my AMD card even though the developer and publisher advertised(!) the game to work with both cards, that somehow I interpreted 'works with ATI' to actually mean 'works with ATI'.\n\nToo many reviewers of Project Cars erroneously equate 'realistic graphics' with 'realistic physics'.\nThe cars and weather effects in this game do indeed look realistic, if you have an Nvidia card that is, but that does not make the game realistic in terms of physics.\n\nIs it a Forza-killer ? no, it only has a small fraction of the cars that Forza offers.\nIs it a competitor to PC racing sims ? no, Project Cars is essentially 'Shift 3' in comparison.\n\nDon't buy this game when you have quality sims like Assetto Corsa, RaceRoomExperience, Race 07 and Stock Car Extreme around. These games are not as pretty as Project Cars but they are all about proper sim racing, where physics matter more than cosmetics.","May 4","false","8.1"," 36 of 51 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","36","51","2","0"

I followed it's progress in the few months leading up to release and thought "Wow, this game looks amazing. AND it's a racing sim. Perfect!"\n\nWhat I got (in my humble opinion) was neither amazing, nor a racing sim. Or perfect, for that matter.\n\nI started my first career with the first tier of karts, which I quickly learned was a huge mistake. The physics and handling models applied to them were so atrocious that I wanted to vomit. Not from motion-sickness or anyting, but because they were so bad. Yes, 125cc karts are lightweight and hug the road, but the handling was just way too unresponsive and twitchy with an xbox360 controller.\n\nAfter forcing myself to finish a season of the karts career, I decided to try one of the events in which I get to drive a proper road car. During qualifying, it started to rain heavily after about 2 laps and I had posted the 2nd fastest time while the track was still dry. After pitting and getting 'wet' tires put on my car, I noticed that the AI were consistently crushing my posted lap time even with racing slicks in a torrential downpour, sending me back to 13th place. Now, I'm no expert on tire physics, but I've seen enough F1 races to know you can't drive soft-compund racing slicks in the rain and expect to have the slightest bit of grip. I thought unfair AI advantages were something of old arcade racers like NFS and not new racing "sims"? The handling was better with the cars but still not what i would call simulation-like.\n\nI cannot comment on the supposedly beautiful graphics because I'm running 2+ year-old laptop hardware,\n(Intel i7 @ 2.4ghz, 3.2ghz with turbo and NV GTX 765m graphics)\nbut I would get sudden drops in FPS from 60 to about 45 that would last a few seconds while running medium-ish settings.\n\nThe game does, however, have a large selection of tracks and a nice selection of cars from what i saw. A little more variety in some of the car classes would have been nice, though, like the open wheels.\n\nI was excited to pick this up on sale, but now I'm excited to hear back about a refund.\n\nUPDATE:\nLess than 2 days after requesting a refund, my request was approved even though I have well over 2 hours spent on the game.\n\n\nIf you like your racing "sims" with a  side of twitchy, unresponsive, and inconsistent handling with terrible AI, then by all means, go for it.\nBut if I were you, I'd wait this game out and see if they patch some of the issues that I've seen.","June 12, 2015","false","3.8"," 62 of 98 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","62","98","4","1"

This game is really something special and an evolution in racing and gaming in general backed by the power of WMD.  Raising the bar to new levels from the [literally] jaw dropping visuals to the high levels tuning and technicalities of the tire simulation.  There's so much to talk about from the dynamic weather that can mimic real world conditions, a deep career with realistic and challenging AI, a complex damage and wear system, to the solid arsenal of cars and tracks made to the highest of standards you really need to see to believe.\n\nDeveloped by racers, for racers, where our opinions and ideas actually made a difference with the outcome of the game.  With that said, is it perfect?  No.  It's not without a few bugs here and there but I can tell you SMS will be supporting it and patching things in well into the future.  The level of detail and high standards shows you just how much they care about it.  If you're a gearhead and/or like racing games I highly recommend getting your hands on this.\n\nA word to the competition: The bar has been raised.

Wanna play a realistic career? Damage is bugged. Wanna do an endurance race? Every single car will blow it's tires and be parked in the dirt by lap 8. Wanna listen to your crew chief? He'll tell you it's  raining heavy when it's clear as day. Wanna watch a replay with dynamic weather and time? Car lights and damage are bugged (and you can't watch the replay from the perspective of other cars). Like fancy particle effects? Bugged. Wanna race clean in a packed field? Sorry, you're a target and the other cars are missiles. Need to hear your tires to know exactly what's happening with your car? Tire volume is so low you can barely hear them.\n\nThis game actually does a LOT right. The on track car count is out of this world, the graphics are great, it's well optimized on Nvidia cards (I've heard nightmares about AMD cards though), it has more options and tweakability than any racing game I've played.  But it gets so many things wrong I just can't recommend it right now.\n\nIt's worth noting that similar to the Elder Scrolls games I'm having a TON of fun with the game when I'm able to look past the glaring issues. But too many of the issues really ruin the experience for me.\n\n[EDIT] I've been wanting to change this review to a thumbs up but since writing it two patches have come out and not only have none of my issues been fixed but I've discovered several repeatable bugs. One of which allows you to shift into first and drive off before the race has started leaving the pack in the dust. When such simple things like not being able to start driving before a race don't work the game is just not ready to be called "released".","May 8, 2015","false","17.8"," 163 of 277 people (59%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","59","163","277","25","3"

This has been 90% fixed with the lastest patches\n-Cut content and broken promises. The devs of this game made GTR2 and then split to form two seperate dev teams. One team when on to make Race07 and its dlc and kept it very very true to the format of GTR (it doesnt hold your hand, you have to do everything, drive out the garage, hit your speed limiter, drive a safe pace lap yourself, cautions both full and partial, and open for modding)\n\nMy honest review of the game is that it is a half baked remake of race07/gtr2. Half baked int he sense that they ditched the SIMULATION aspects for the... pretty graphics? You cant even cut down a tire in this game. My honest suggestion is that if you want a hardcore racing sim get the race07 game and all its dlc, it goes on sale often for super cheap. You will get liscenced race cars from all over teh world and tracks as well. And when you want more content just get some mods and be on your merry way in anything you could imagine (ALMS, BlanPain, Le Mans, Rally, ETC)\n\nThis review doesnt even begin to go into detail on the things that i have bared witness to on their forums... That is a fiasco showing that Mr. Ian Bell is by no means a man i want to give money to based on his mouth and way of cunducting business.\n\nI however, have already paid 30$ for this and so i aim to get my moneys worth out of it and struggle through it hoping it gets better with age and time. I ONLY reccomend getting this game if it is on sale for 25$(USD) or less. It is a "40$ brand new" title that you see many mid grade developers doing these days. i sincerely hope this game grows on me a bit more though. It has potential in about 5 years when the game's files get torn apart and modded because boy howdy being this pretty.... well the mods that will come in time will be marvelous. Shame that the team didnt allow that from the get go, but they have DLC to sell and well, the way they "voted" on whether it was to be allowed or not was reminisent of the old "3/5th compromise" as not all votes are equal over there.","August 16, 2015","false","218.1"," 48 of 74 people (65%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","65","48","74","5","2"

Physics wise it's a very complex sim,  not without it's faults, but other sims that people rate have had major physics rewrites, especially  tyre physics. The game is not without faults that much is obvious, the importance of the faults will  vary from one person to the next. I couldn't give a rats hairy crack about multiplayer or league  racing, but that's just me. Others do and for them PCARS falls short and I understand that. But for  me the overall experience is excellent.\n\nGraphically it is excellent, the details on the cars and the tracks are at times stunning when  combined with the day/night and weather transitions. On PC only Assetto Corsa comes remotely close and  it falls short compared to PCARS IMO, Kunos have done a stellar job updating the tracks but they are  still sterile compared to PCARS. The car models are excellent in both titles. But it's mainly the  PCARS Day/night and weather transitions that make me slack jawed in wonderment, it's a stunning  looking game. Probably the main reason some luddites call the game Simcade, as they refuse to believe  anything looking this good could be proper Sim as well.\n\nSounds wise it falls short of Raceroom Racing Experience (hereafter referred to as R3E) which is the  best by quite a margin in this genre. But the sounds in PCARS are in the main well done, a few weird  engine notes but overall above average (no Gran Turismo esque "hoovers" here!). Ambient noise is well  done IMO, including sheep and cows at Bannochbrae (DLC).\n\nFFB is good for me, others don't rate it and that's fair enough it's a complex beast to setup right  and if your not invested in a game then it's daunting to wade through it. Luckily with My CSR  everything felt reasonably good out of the box, yeah I'd like a bit more road sensations but I can  tweak that in when I can be bothered. It's not a million miles away from the other Sims I have  (GSCE/AMS, RF2, R3E and AC) I can feel the front go light when locking up, front goes light in wet  weather when on slicks, I can feel weight transfer. Overall it's decent when it works and nowhere near  as bad as people make out.\n\nPhysics is fine for me too, I spin when I push too hard and I can feel what the car is up to, I can  sort out handling issues by adjusting the relevant setting and can tame cars that have default setups  not to my liking. Cars are easy to drive under the limit which for some in the community means  "simcade", literally EVERY racing driver has stated that cars are in reality easier to drive under the  limit than some games would have us believe. Push the cars up to and over the limit and the cars  behave in a logical and realistic way, there no Ridge Racer or Need For Speed unreal levels of grip  here at all! ADD in the fact that apart from RF2 none of the others even have wet weather simulated at  all!!\n\nCareer mode is interesting and varied, none of the short pathetic 2 lap races that console racers  start with (I'm looking at you Forza and GT!), but the length can be adjusted if the player wishes.  Most have Practise and qualifying (unlike Asseto Corsa which has a VERY console game like career  mode). Could do with a few more types of cars oustide of GT3, but overall decent enough. Weather  effects and time of day keeps you on your toes, think you know a track well, try it in the early hours  of the morning in low light and in a THUNDERSTORM!! Nerve jangling stuff especially when you see the  lightning! Scripted weather in main career races is puzzling though, strange decision.\n\nYes the game has bugs, changes and omissions, these are all incredibly disapointing for everyone. Some  have logical reasons for why and a few do not. for me these do not detract from the overall. It's a  real shame and I hope that these issues can be solved with PCARS2.\n\nNo official mod support is a bummer but I have Asseto Corsa, RF2, GSCE/AMS for that, PCARS was never going to support modding  properly, it was always going to be a franchise that gives us sequels rather than the traditional  method of devs and modders supporting a title for many many years. Some really dislike that and fair  enough that's their perogative and they can play the games that follow the traditional methods. SMS  have chosen this path and I believe it fits quite well, even at 45 euros I have more than got my  money's worth out of the game from release. And I'm not counting the multiple hours of enjoyment I got  when testing before release. Despite all that there are unofficial mods coming out so it IS possible, just not as easy as other Sims.\n\nI highly recommend this game as a single player value for money at full price. I FULLY recommend it in  a sale. If you're after something articially difficult with low grip then PCARS is not really for you,  if you want a game for modding it's not for you, if all you want is MP league racing it's probably not  for you. Other than that, love cars? Love racing? GET THIS GAME!!","May 6","true","308.7"," 29 of 42 people (69%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","69","29","42","5","0"

What that doesn't tell you is that all this time (not to mention my 19 posts in the game forum) was spent tweaking parameters and tryng to make the game minimally functional. So far I have been unsuccessful. I have never - never! - joined a single race or even spent a few minutes of practice on the track.\n\nYes, it's a nice game, with beautiful graphics, and it has lots of potential. But, despite the hype, it is far from finished, the interface is quite clumsy and the force feedback issues make it unplayable. If you doubt me, visit the official forum. You will find literally hundreds of pages (one single thread about FFB issues has 141 pages and counting) with people trying to make sense of its obscure FFB parameters and discussing how to make the game work for them. The developers seem to be as bewildered as the users and are of little help, when not outright rude.\n\nProject Cars has been launched some two months ago and is already patched to version 1.4, but most problems remain unsolved. Since I am one of those old-fashioned people who believe software products should be sold only when they are fairly functional, instead of being sent out on the world to have their problems sorted out by their buyers (granted, some people actually seem to enjoy that), I give Project Cars a 3/10 at best. I may review my opinion later on when these problems are fixed, but right now, if you want a racing sim that actually works, go for Assetto Corsa.\n\nUPDATE: Now I have 13.7 hours into the game. This accounts for a whole afternoon spent trying to make FFB work. I still haven't driven a single lap.\n\nUPDATE 2: Patch 2.0 is out, supposedly to fix FFB problems among other things. Now I have 14.4 hours in the game. The difference was the time I spent lauching PCars, finding my pilot floating 5 meters above the ground, verifying it was still unplayable with my wheel (in fact, it got worse) and closing it in frustration. I also have 34 posts in the forum without a single helpful or informative reply from the devs (contrarily to other users, who are trying very earnestly to help each other play the game).

After a few attempts at trying to solve the situation, i decided to give up and put this game on the wait-list and try again months later.\n\nToday (18th August), i decided to try this game again. To my surprise many of the issues i had before are now gone thankfully. Yet, game is still unplayable with random issues occuring from time to time. Did a free lap session as usual to try out the game, figured i would test the game once more for potential issues. First time worked fine, i drove a racecar for a while but i didn't costumize my controls (can't do this ingame), so i quit the free lap session, which ended up in a forced game crash out of nowhere.\n\nNow, after messing with the options and controls for a few minutes. I decide to give it a go again, to my surprise (once more), my game glitches out everytime i get in race now. Screen turns dark, i can see the pre-race menu, can't do anything from there. Sound still works, game seems frozen so i'm forced to shut down the application manually.\n\nI would give it another try later but i really lost interest in this glitched up mess of a game, i had hopes that the game would run fine now, after a few months of its release, but nope.\n\nIn other words, don't buy this game yet, it's not worth it.

Here is a list of the things the A.I. can and does do.\n\n1.  Ram you because they brake later.\n\n2.  Brake later because physics are not applied evenly.\n\n3.  When they do ram you, they are a brick and you are a bouncy ball (see evenly applied physics).\n\n4.  Go off the track and accelerate past you  because the grass doesn't effect them at all.\n\n5.  Drive in the rain on slicks.\n\n6.  Drive faster than is allowed by the rolling start rules.  You will literally start slower than they do, so they immediately pass you.\n\n7.  Take turns faster than you possibly can, they have the grip of the gods, see evenly applied physics.\n\nHonestly this game's A.I. is so horrendously bad I think GT2's was better in the 90's.

I knew this game had potential because it had the team responsible for the NFS SHift games that I love so thought this could go know wrong and boy was I not. This game has that perfect blend of sim that you want from a game that looks this pretty. With the detail of the vehicles and the tracks you are not expecting an arcady racer, you expecting something more and this game really delivers on that. The feel of the cars are completely believeable and the all the tuning options that they give you effect you vehicle also in a realistic matter, a way that you would expect it to happen.\nThat is what make this game great. You choose one out of the fully detailed vehicle, so then choose from one of the masterfully done tracks and then you go and start driving, tuning and then you take then you join others with the car and the game immersses you to the point where you feel like, the car is your car. That's the great experiance you get out of this game.\nThis game could definitely be more but for it's first iteration, this is definitely a racing game that'll be coming up over the years.

I'm not sure whether this affects all wheels, however, it has made this game virtually unplayable in the admittedly very brief 30 minutes I have spent on it. Sadly, even when I overlook this huge issue which makes delicate steering corrections impossible, the cars feel strangely disconnected from my steering inputs, making them behave unpredictably and sadly much like RC cars, rather than than high performance cars they are advertised to simulate. This could be a personal problem, however, having spent far too much time throughout my life on racing games I can honestly say, this is a problem unique to this game. I also own Assetto Corsa, which seems to be Project Cars' main competitor and the cars in that game feel weighted and react accordingly, unlike this one, which offers absolutely no 'feel' for the cars whatsoever.

Maybe after a few patches but not right now. This game is FULL of game breaking bugs. This game could have used another delay and that would have been the smart thing for Slightly Mad Studios to do instead of rushing out this incredibly buggy game. So let me point out just a few bugs that I have been experiencing lately in Project CARS.\n\nCan't play single player because my laps don't register so I can be racing until the end of time. When I finish a race in first place, the game will sometimes register it as last place. While racing and being in first place, the game will switch my position from 1st to last or any other position making me lose the race.\n\nPlaying online is the reason why I bought this game. Big mistake. This game is almost impossible to play online without experiencing bugs. I don't even know where to start. Lobbies are endless pits and sometimes can't start the race. Sometimes I'll be adjusting settings in the lobby and it will start the race while I'm still adjusting settings for the race. Hud display vanishes while racing, can't tell which position I'm in unless I use the cockpit view. Cars hop around the track constantly. Lets say the race is 4 players, the game will make me start at the end of the starting grid even though we are only 4 racers...I can go on forever with these bugs but I have better things to do like play Assetto Corsa.","May 17, 2015","false","46.1"," 99 of 175 people (57%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","57","99","175","4","1"

I will only scratch the surface of this rotting, vulture-devoured carcass by mentioning the following bugs:\n- In multiplayer cars can't even exit the garage half the time, forcing you to exit and re-enter lobby.\n- starting grids often start with a tornado like effect of random cars being dropped sideways on the starting grid almost as if delivered by a sky-dwelling demon. This often results in a penalty being given to the unexpecting exorcist act victim.\n- open wheelers drive like the chassis is made of limp carrot and the tyres are suspended on sea sponges. Formula A handling is most disastrous.\n- AI are to put it very kindly inconsistent. To put it bluntly they behave like a rebellious teenager experimenting with recreational drugs. The results are always unexpected.\n- Finishing positions are sometimes displayed in incorrect order. You might clearly finish 2nd but the results table puts you in top spot. I mean WTF?\n- I've lost count of the number of times the game has frozen or just shut down entirely.\nI could continue til the cows come home.\nThe most conceited and enraging thing about all this - Slightly Mad Studios has the nerve to start crowdfunding for development of Project Cars 2. Send a strong message to SMS that their greed and incompetence is unacceptable. You can do that by not buying this game or better still buy it, try it and get your steam refund asap. In most other arenas of commerce this kind of behavior would be bordering on criminal. A defective product sold on the back of glamorous pre release hype is a clever, get-rich-quick scheme plotted by soul-less thieves.

I cannot advise any stronger that people stay away from it, and don't even consider touching it with a barge pole.\n\n- Cars can be launched into the sky for no clear reason\n- Half the car can begin to levitate, and driving becomes impossible until this ghostly influence stops\n- AI is a mess, exceeding track limits and causing wreckless collissions every single lap of every single race. Makes career mode pointless.\n- Setup menu is buggy. Some settings only take effect if you save the setup then quit and reload the session.\n- The pit menu only opens when you're in your pit box. You sit still with your pit crew doing nothing until you've finished selecting what you want in the menu\n- Reporting bugs, and asking for help on the official forums will get you banned... Yes. Seriously.\n\nPCars is only good as a hotlap sim with these issues. The bugs will ruin your races if you enter anything longer than a short sprint, or if you join a league.\n\nThe developers have their heads buried in the sand about real problems. The head of SMS (Ian Bell) has had numerous public outbursts, outright insulting people who are genuinely experiencing game breaking bugs. It's a miracle even a handful of bugfixes came out of these people post release.\n\n0/10 would not back again.

Even completely getting out of the throttle wont prevent this. I've gone in and reduced Steering and Throttle Sensitivity all the way to zero and it still does it.\n\nFor me this is completely unacceptable. The handling in this game is down-right broken.

I was very excited for the retail release of Project CARS.  With many hundred hours sunk into Gran Turismo, Forza, and more recently Assetto Corsa, I had high expectations, especially after the months of hype lead up.  Additionally, being an experienced real life driver with many fender to fender road races and some rallying under my belt, I feel that I can see these simulations with a grain of salt.  That said, the day one version of this title was not good, mostly due to the control setup / feedback with a steering wheel.  Everything just felt so wrong.  Even though I could sense that there might be a sound physics model under the hood and the pretty face, the inputs felt so nonlinear and highly exaggerated at the extremes.  It made car control incredibly tricky and completely unrealistic.  I immediately went to the forums to look for help and found I was not alone, many other reported similar issues and suggested control tweaks.  I tried many of them with varying levels of success, none of which bringing the game to the level I thought it should be.  I stopped playing after about a week of fiddling.  What a disappointment.  Fast forward to a few weeks ago when I see the version 4.0 update information, I decided to give it another go.  Am I glad I did, THIS is what the game should have been like on day one.  How it made it out with the controls in the state that it did is completely unbelievable to me, especially with the whole community assisted beta aspect.","October 5, 2015","true","49.7"," 24 of 39 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","24","39","0","0"

Short review, TLDR form:\n\n\nEDIT: Changed some words and opinions after re-playing with sufficient sleep. <3\n\nPros:\n-Amazing car graphics\n-Finally, a nice-ish damage model\n-Variable weather\n-Oh the list of cars is fantastic.\n\nCons:\n-Physics are varied - overall they need improvement, but some cars more so than others (looking at you, Lykan).\n-Tracks are not as detailed as some of the game's peers (esp. Nordschelife).\n-Very little sensitivity and feedback - I don't feel like I'm in control.\n-Sounds are bad. Definitely needs improvement. At times it's muffled, at times it hurts, and some cars sound off (a C9 should not sound like it revs to 9000...).\n\nI suggest SMS and WMD put a hold on the weekly car release thing that they have planned and focus more on fixing the physics and the sounds first.

I bought it to play multiplayer in private matches with my brothers. So that is the only area I have really given any time to.\n\nUnfortuantly even at the time of writing this review, half a year later, the multiplayer is still riddled with game breaking bugs. Silly ones like it always ignoring your qualifying position and falling through the floor. There were plenty more.\n\nIts a shame, as I know I would really like the game if it wasn't for the bugs, but the frequency of the bugs are too great. In the last gaming session I had prior to writing this, not one race went by with out some oddity or other happening. Some were quite bad, others were amusing. but all in all it ruined our experience.\n\nThey have been releasing patches at an OK rate, but still its massively bugged.

The more you play this game the more bugs you will encounter.\n\nFirst off the cars sounds different online compared to offline, the "whine" sound from the gearbox or whatever is not present in multiplayer until the 2nd game in the same lobby and it's a well known bug. This makes some cars sound quite different and in some cases quite dull and boring online.\n\nThen comes the steering ratio bug, when I first load into a session and go out of the pits, the steering ratio will always be 900 degrees no matter what car, and requires and Alt-Tab to overcome this(may be my ancient wheel is to blame). Not forgetting to mention changing your steering ratio in setup requires a session rejoin to take effect.\n\nOk then I'm ready to go on with qualifying, or at least try to. You see everyime someone joins the session you get a split second delay (I get about 0.5 sec of screen freeze, some people get up to 3 sec). Imagine driving in Monaco and you get that freeze? into the wall you go, freeze while you're under heavy braking? you WILL overshoot the corner, freeze while turn in? wide you go, freeze while on the straight? you're fine. It's a lottery while trying to do qualifying. Gone are the outlap-hotlap-inlap style, you HAVE to put like 5 laps fuel and go round until you HOPEFULLY get a clean lap.\n\nOn to the race. Theres a bug where cars spawn on each other, if a car happen to spawn on top of you and lands on you, you WILL get a drive through penalty because your car moved. If anyone decides to jump the start and hit you = drive through penalty for you. If you manage to survive the race start then great. Since my location gives me about 250 ping I'm always delayed at the start and lose places but I don't think this is the game fault, I can't upgrade distance to server. Also I can jump start like 0.5 sec to 1 sec without penalty, or maybe it's because of my ping, or another bug.\n\nOn to the racing. Cars will STICK to one another on side contact. Once 2 cars touch, they lose all steering capability and will just slide straight off the track or until they come apart. Penalty system is literally useless. There is NO PENALTY FOR RAMMING. Imagine T1 at Monza, someone hits you and you're forced through the chicane at T2, the rammer just continues on because he's still on track, you on the other hand are considered to have "CUT THE CORNER" and get a 10 SECOND penalty where you can't accelerate. There is another abuse where you can cut chicanes without penalty and gain massive time in a race. Track limits is also another problem, on some corners 1 wheel on the grass is considered cutting the track but on some other corners you can go all 4 wheels off and hit the wall and yet it is not considered cutting the track, with this technique you can actually gain time on some tracks by 'wallriding' or you can run wide on some corners and gain time(eg. Degner 1 & 2 at Suzuka).\n\nOnto car setup. Some settings are just not realistic. On some class like GT3, running 0 camber  is still the best. And then there is the abuse of running 0 radiators & brake ducts. The telemetry for tyre temps is inaccurate for the inside, center and outside of the tyre. Using full negative camber can result in higher outside tyre temps. Also the left front bump stop seem to be the only one that can hit 'red' and not the other 3 bump stop corners. "Live" telemetry is not that useful because you have to drive and see telemetry at the same time which is hard. You can download apps for telemetry recording but the problem is suspension is not part of the numbers which you can see, and suspension setup is critical for a race car. You can only have 1 setup per car/track combo, so if you want to have multiple setups you have to manually record and enter it. There is a 'summary screen' in setup where you can screenshot but it doesn't include all the settings you can do on the car so it's kind of pointless.\n\nChat was broken a few patches back and never fixed. You cannot chat in the online lobby, you have to drive out of the pits, park somewhere and chat. Vote kick function doesn't work, only the host can kick. There is a bug where it auto kicks people randomly in the session.\n\nReplays are completely broken and never fixed since game launch. Cars parked on the grid, missing cars etc. Saved a replay where you just had an exciting race? or a collision? Go to check it out and see yourself racing against nothing, crash with nothing. Completely useless feature.\n\nIf you like hot lapping and top the leaderboards you have to abuse the 0 radiators & brake ducts to get the 'perfect' lap. Also since there's not gearbox protection you can downshift like a mad man 6th gear to 2nd gear in a second to maximise engine braking without penalty, and you can off tyre wear so your tyres don't degrade throughout the lap.\n\nHaving spend some time in the official forum you read about all the problems people have with the game, promised features which will never be in the game, and also all the bugs which will never be fixed. Forum threads questioning the developers on these topics often end in arguments and the thread closed. Some 'top people' will defend the game with their life even though there are so many problem with the game itself. It's like they're blinded by something and don't want to see the issues. I even saw an insta-ban on someone for insulting the game. It seems the common answer to every problem with the game is "It's a well known bug", "The Devs are aware of this", and the most popular is "It will be solved in Project Cars 2"\n\nResources spend for fixing the game is less than resources for new DLCs. Makes sense because it is a business after all but if your product is of such low quality then you will lose more people compared to people buying the DLCs.\n\nOther stuff you will encounter include:\nHitting invisible wall/car while leading\nDriver floating without car\nDriver floating in mid air(Imola chicane)\nHitting a landmine(literally car flies & flip) - too bad for you\nFFB bug where it feels like you have a flat but you don't - requires game restart\nTotal lost of steering wheel functions - requires game restart\nScreen freeze but sound still works - requires game restart\nOpponent car stuck at 45 degree angle, creating smokescreen for everyone behind\nQualifying 1st only to discover someone beat you with a time of 00:00:0000\nCars spawn on other cars/upside down on the grid, or in pitlane during race start\n\n"But hey maybe all this will be solved in PCars 2 eh?"\n\nOverall I give this game a 5/10 and that's being generous. Only because of the fun racing I have with the friends I met racing online. If you plan to buy this game for serious racing then don't, this is a "Sim-Cade". Only buy if there's a massive discount. There are better sims on steam which are cheaper, have better physics, and less bugs.\n\nedit* typo","March 2","false","593.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

For example I drove the P1 around Spa, the bumps, the curbs were not there in the meaning of I couldn't feel them through the wheel (G27). A little bit inward the curbs you got these little bumps which I could feel. Then we get to the car, the P1 there was no connection to the road, I should've felt something but the only thing I felt was the rear stepping out on various occassions , 1st to 3rd gear in a straight but also in 5th gear through a high speed corner, I mean come on guys you delayed the game soo many times already and yet this happens? 3rd or 2nd gear exiting a corner I can imagine the back stepping out but , 5th gear on quarter to half throttle going more than 160km/h (100mph) is a bit absurd. Yet on some occassions the cars felt good and some occassions the cars felt like boats. My fears before release became clear : Oh dear, Here we go with a yet another simcade game trying to be a simulator, but failing at trying to be one. I heard many players having the same opinion as me, yet I heard players who like it. And these kinds of people I like to categorise in : sim-racers and arcade-racers. I expected Project CARS to have similair car-physics as Assetto Corsa but what I felt was less than that. For arcade-racers to find a new challenge this is a game for you, for sim-racers like me it's a dissappointment.\n\nGraphics wise, the cars are sublime , nothing wrong with that, weather-effects the same thing. Tracks could've had some\nmore love in the end.\n\nDespite this I nor hate or love the game. Every game has it's flaws , but this games has the flaws where I didn't want it to have them.   5/10 - It was promising but a let down after all the hype around it.\n\n---------------------------------\nNew Section : Third day of playing\n\nThis is what I noticed over the third day of playing Project CARS.\n\nFirst of all lets start with the animations, I use with my G27 the H-pattern on the cars that have it, Nothing wrong with that? Well the animations of shifting seems first fine from neutral to first all is well, from first to etc. you see the animation going for neutral then being cut off and restarted for the animation to the selected gear which is annoying after a while and for me noticeable at the third day of looking through what is wrong. What is more wrong, is the rain effects on the front and side windows of the car, because if you want to implement rain you need also take notice of the windspeed and the speed of the car, because the flowing air makes the rain drops move in certain directions, as for the rain drops in pCARS they are static pretty much at whatever given speed.\n\nNext part about the rain drops involve the windscreen wipers, after the windscreen wipers cleaned an area and they go back in an up right position you see for half a second in light rain or a thunderstorm / heavy rain, that a certain is dry. Rather more than that is the water particles from the wheels as they go through the car model ( only seen in third person camera behind the car ).\n\nFurther more some cars like the, BMW 1M or RUF RGT-8 do have incorrect engine sounds. So are more cars like that. There a few cars which I find driveable are the Renault Clio Cup car, the Aston Martin Vantage V12 GT3, the Ford Focus RS, the RUF RGT-8 despite the lack of a good engine sound.\n\nTrackwise, I drove a few laps around Sakito GP not sure if I said it right (Suzuka, a real track located in Japan) missed some corners, I don't know if this is done on purpose or not, there can be a reason which I or we don't know.\n\nDespite this I can find some fun in the game.\n\nNow for the online gameplay, it's well done with the lobby's and interfaces.\nBut, the following was a HUGE let down for me, probably for others as well, after a while my steering wheel was no longer recognized and i had to force quit the game and restart the game, one of my friends had to restart his computer to get his wheel working again. After that we could play a nice round on Watkins Glen Short.\n\nThe score of my rating stays the same, I won't lower it because it is already given.","May 8, 2015","false","12.5"," 75 of 136 people (55%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","55","75","136","8","4"

I prefer only feedback on what the steering rack provides, a GOOD pair of head phones comes in extremely handy. The sound in the game brings in the immersion, paying attention to the sounds is key to balancing the car.\n\nThis is the only sim out there that i keep coming back to, not to mention the only one you can hop in and join an online race at anytime compared to the other games. I own AC, RRRE, The whol SimBin bunch, the immersion from this game just keeps me coming back. There is something about the feel and physics of the game that lends itself to be natural to me. The input and output feels like a car at least the road cars for the most part feel like my car. The EVO behaves like it does for me at AutoX and general track days. I can toss it like i would in real life, granted not as extreme, you know the whol its a game thing :) Can't just restart and have a shiny new car in less than a second...\n\nRegardless, you will read a lot of bickering about minor stuff, while i agree about some (safety car, proper flags, custom championships) even without it i get way to much joy out of driving this game. So many cars, so many tracks, so many combinations.\n\nAt the end of the day, its about what feels best for you. Find a Sim that you agree with most and master it. I can't do AC or RRRE3 because of the wonky tires (instant grip loss on slip and its just like ice after that) and they feel like they are way to canned with the steering, like its guiding me rather than me driving.

The cars feel like hovercrafts, on a straight road you can let off the wheel, no movement at all, although  I'm seeing in cockpit view the wheel shaking and the car moving. In corners I hear the tires whining but feel no feedback in the wheel.\n\nThat means no real fun in driving, I think Project CARS is not ready for release and overhyped.\n\nAlso small things like the default wheel button assignment for T300RS is more or less empty...  and the interface is not directly  supporting a flawless feeling, you have to use at some steps the mouse and change between wheel buttons and the mouse.\n\nOn my PC the HUD doesn't come up even if the button for HUD cycle is mapped.

Even with all assists off it still feels as though all cars have some amount of traction and stability control enabled, the behavior of cars at low speed is weird and in most cars it's impossible to do a burnout as you can in any other simulator.\n\nVisually comma it's mostly just an okay looking game, in certain weather conditions and times of day it can look very impressive but it is not the photo realistic tour de force that it has been made out to be in promotional shots and various shill articles from around the internet. Sound, which in the lead up to release was touted as being one of the game's killer features is actually on the poor side. Engines sound clipped and distorted, which can be a cool effect, but in Project Cars sounds tinny and lacking oomph. Cockpit rattles, backfires and tyre squeal are serviceable but nothing exceptional.\n\nThe AI in single-player is slow, even on the hardest difficulty, any competent racer will find that they don't put up much of a fight. They also have difficulty keeping off each other and it's not uncommon to find them all dog piled on top of each other on corners they find a bit tricky.\n\nThe games true killer feature is the dynamic weather. Setting the weather to random is great fun and really adds something to the game that the other sims don't have. It's also during rain that the game engine really looks its best with terrific looking pools of water forming on the track and atmospheric lighting, it really makes for an immersive experience.\n\nMost troubling is the games current state in terms of stability and features. The game is supposed to have fully animated pit crews, but as of patch 2.0 this is still not in the game and who knows if it's actually going to be added. You also don't need to look very hard to find the plethora of bugs still present in the game, with cars absorbing into each other, flying into the air and falling through the track. The collision physics are also very odd. Touching another car seems to mute your steering, often causing both cars to just carry on off the track, sort of glued to each other. These issues combined with the announcement of Project Cars 2 along with it's funding campaign leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nProject Cars is not a bad game, but it feels unfinished and even with the polish it needs, I am not confident it could match the single player experience offered by games like Stock Car Extreme and RaceRoom. If you are someone who enjoys weather effects and cares more about immersion rather than the racing, Project Cars will have something to offer. Otherwise, don't bother.","July 5, 2015","false","74.3"," 24 of 40 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","24","40","0","1"

Lets fast forward all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that happened inbetween with the constant glitches, bugs and horrible dev responses. Lets look at Official Oculus Rift launch day.\n\nThis was ment to be an Oculus rift launch title. Well, it is. However, they've completely forgotten about their original backers and earlier adpoters by forcing them to buy the entire game again ($91aud) or buying all of the DLC ($65aud) to get a key to the Oculus version of pCars. The only other options are to stay on 0.8sdk. What kind of options are these? This type of greed is not acceptable to backers or early adopters or anyone for that matter.\n\nWhat about VIVE launch you say? Well that launches early April. With SMS not even making an attempt to respond to this very question countless times, I think it's safe to say VIVE support will be screwed or non existent come launch day. From what I've read, I could only imagine Oculus trying to run 1.3 through STEAM VR to be a horrible experience and resource hungry.\n\nNow add these issues ontop of the 12 months worth of issues (some of which are still not fixed) and you then ask yourself, will you support SMS with pCars 2? Or any other title? No chance will they ever get a cent off of me. Never. ♥♥♥♥ing. Again.","March 29","false","61.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

EVEN with the limited edition pack you barely get any cars without buying DLC and their mostly European!  I mean sure there are plenty of Fords but how can you flat out ignore the other great manufactures out there?  I'm really surprised project cars has not learned from GT6 that players actually like driving cars from their favorite manufacturer?  Also a real killer is the fact that there is ZERO customization for the cars, you cant even change the paint color which seems essential.  When they say "we listened to what the players wanted" they really do not mean that, I cant see a single player actually wanting only 30 (I know i may be off a bit) cars to chose from.  The only pro I have with Project cars is the graphics, which can STILL be horrible it does not matter what monitor or GPU you have, textures will still be tearing everywhere and if your CPU is not top of the line it will still be imposible to play agianst any AI.

I’m a sim racer using a wheel. My first race was in a hot hatch that kept losing the back end somehow every time I lifted off the throttle. I spent ages recalibrating, trying driving aids, but couldn’t solve it. That level of simulation would embarrass Sega Rally. Occasionally you find a car that handles okay and you see what this game could have been.\n\nThe racing is flawed. You can massively cut corners and chicanes, overtaking dozens of cars.

Assetto Corsa and Race07 were my go-to racing sims before Project Cars came out.  I've been in the racing sim genre as long as anyone else and I can say, without a doubt, that I completely enjoy the setup of this game.\n\nDon't want to grind out the cash to finally race your dream car? No problem, you don't have to. Every car is available from the start.\n\nTired of being trialed through licenses to race your favorite kind of race? No problem, you can do it all from the start.\n\nThis game is purely about testing/tuning/practicing.  The racing is just the icing on the top.  The AI are extremely aggressive, but smart.  If you are off the pace, you won't be able to bump your way to the front...because the AI are already planning on getting you out of their way.  It's a culture shock to those who are used to very passive AI systems.\n\nThe phyiscs, while different than Assetto Corsa and Race07 (and Forza/GT), are not arcady and closer to the previously mentioned games.  Each sim has a different feel and I'm glad to say that this game nails tire physics.  Unlike Codemaster's games, where you can feel the 'rail' that they want you to race (*cough* F1 series), this game allows you total freedom to miss an apex or not. It's however you want (or can) take the turn.\n\nCareer mode is definitely deep.  And by deep, I mean if you want to succeed on more difficult settings, you have to practice, tune, re-practice, and re-tune.  You start by choosing a class to race in, which is tiered (cart/open wheel, GT, and Prototype - form three linear paths)...all ending with the LMP1 class.  You choose a team to race for and it's only a couple who are interested in hiring you, so expect to learn a car that you didn't expect to learn before.  From there, it's all progression.  You can set just about everything, from race-length, time of day, practice/qualifying sessions, to AI difficulty...all while you've already started your career.\n\nOn top of that, the DLC package was extremely cheap and came with cars that I find interesting and useful.  Free updates are on the way, but cheap (and quality) DLC like this is rare.\n\nPlain and simple, this game was meant for people who dream of living the life of a racecar driver.","July 2, 2015","true","625.5"," 61 of 111 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","61","111","4","0"

Graphic is simply the best I ever saw in racing games, but... Handling of cars is really, really terrible. Overstearing in almost every corner, validating times is some almost impossible think, if you run through the corner and due to really overstearing thing in this game, you just a little miss the outside way of the corner and time is not validated, omg why???? (not talking about inside of the corner, thats understandable when you shorten the corner that the time is not validated).\n\nThis game is really not worth the money, it is pain to focus all the time and even when you focus, cars behave like nothing real. I have really bad car in my real life, but I can run through any corner in real life at higher speed than in this game and comparing the stearing at low speed has nothing to do with real simulation.\n\nI like realism, but not unreal realism, this game could be more fun with arcade stearing exept of trying to make something real.","July 7, 2015","false","18.9"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","17","28","0","1"

It all looks like a bit of a cash grab from the developers now, they claimed that starting work on pCARS 2 would not affect the continued support of pCARS 1 but that is simply not the case, many 'features' (I would call them requirements) like triple screen support were supposed to be implimented and are all of a sudden going to be in pCARS 2 instead (except this info was only 'shared' on a post within the forum, same as a lot of the ommissions and back tracking the devs have done since release), all while they still churn out monthly paid DLC. The patches are getting smaller and smaller with less fixes which proves they are no longer working on the core of the game, which is still a mess in places.\n\nI'm glad I never put money into pCARS 2 as I can see the devs playing the same cash grab scam as the first, promised the world, released it broken, patched it to a beta state, don't mention all the stuff that they are not going to impliment, let time go on so that people who invested good money into it don't feel so sore about it then slowly leak the fact that your not going to deliver what was advertised, nice strategy.\n\nThis game has some good points about it, there is a big if bland career mode, and the driving model is nice but the lack of ability to save more than 1 set up for a car (seriously this was achievable back in days of the Amiga, it's 2016 FFS), dodgy collision physics, odd wet weather tyre behavour (especially the AI, this has been 'fixed' apparently yet still exists in certain circumstances), no real multi-class racing (hey look we have prototype 1 and 2 and GT3, but were not going to let you race them together because clearly our game engine can't cope with it) which ruins the career progression for me in this regard, very inconsistent AI meaning you never run at the front with the same guys race to race (this is again shocking, Amiga racers had this, c'mon), no custom championships (yes another staple of most early 90's racing games seems impossible in 2016 for SMS) along with a plethora of small niggly little bugs and issues that culminate to make the experience one of frustration rather than fun.\n\nMy advise, wait to see what pCARS 2 produces, do not buy it on release, read the forums (don't for heaven sake post there, especially with anything less than wishing to suck the balls of the developer or you will probably get banned) and see if they are capable of producing a sim that lives up to even half the hype they surround it in.","March 5","false","93.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

BETTER THAN FORZA AND GRAN TURISMO!!! Yes that is an OPINION please don't hunt me down.\n\n---------------------------------------- The Review -----------------------------------------\nIf i wrote this review about 8 or 9 months ago, my recommendation to you would be leave this game alone at all costs and save your money! Now however i can say the opposite; throw all your cash at this game (there are no micro-transactions, don't worry.)\n\nI bought this game on first release, i had been looking forward to the game hoping that it would be a PC rival to Forza Motorsport. Sadly on release i was disappointed by endless bug, optimisation issues and gruesome GUI screens.\n\nYou start the game driving Go Karts which is great to teach you the basic mechanics of the game, you then progress upwards onto harder difficulty vehicles with the game occasionally throwing you a cheeky challenge race with some Million Horse-Power monster. The original issue was that after you stopped driving Go Karts and went onto full sized vehicles, the game became dramatically unstable and would leave you with a game just coping at 20FPS (on low settings!!!)\n\nI might point out my computer isn't weak it has a GTX 780 which still packs one hell of a punch.\n\nNow for the bit you were waiting to read, because you are sat there wondering why this game has a thumbs up and so far all i've done is moan about it.\n\nThe game is now, on writing this, in version 7. All of the optimsation issues have gone (on Nvidea Cards) and the game handles and soothes every driving style possible.\nThere are a great selection of tracks! From the favourites to the ones you've never heard. Cars i would argue are a bit lacking, this could be due to my current progression level in the game, however on selecting quick race i still don't see many cars.\nDon't let that put you off though! Although there are limited cars, they do leave you feeling satisfied after a race and don't make you wish you chose another car because it has big flames on the bonnet.\nThe career system seems to have improved also with a far clearier understanding of what you are actually progressing towards.\nMy biggest issue with the game is, the still horrible, GUI. The menu system is like working your way through a maze of horror; left does not mean left all the time and the same for right, before you know it the selection has gone upwards and you are sat there feeling frustrated because it's taken so damn long to click one box. Whoever designed that UI i do hope your on a good training course now cause by god who let you get that through Quality Control.\n\nTo sum up, the game is now fantastic with its small niggle of GUI horror. The gameplay is smooth, fun and leaves you feeling satisfied that the driving you did was your driving and not a military GPS system guiding you every step of the way (although those options are available, except for the military GPS thing.)","January 24","true","20.1"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","12","19","0","0"

The problems that existed at launch still linger, with the game suffering severe framerate issues even with rather conservative settings applied.\n\nIf I ignore all that, there's something that could be fun hidden beneath - though it requires players to be patient and invested in authenticity over the more immediate action of competitors like Forza. In the end I've come away feeling like this whole 'needing to practice and qualify before a race' thing just isn't for me, and it seems a shame that the game doesn't offer a slightly more streamlined approach to the career mode for players who just want to experience the main events. You can manually skip to the main races, but it hamstrings you, putting you at the back of the grid each time. In the end I just got bored.\n\nPerhaps my view has been skewed by the frustration I've felt spending hours fiddling with graphics settings and drivers, and maybe the smoother experience on offer for nvidia players will genuinely lead to more fun, engaging play sessions. Alas, the experience I've had has not been worth the investment (in money  or  time). I only hope Slightly Mad stop blaming AMD for their QA problems and do a better job next time.","August 14, 2015","false","15.3"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","14","23","0","1"

Why do I say that? You need a steering wheel for this. Sure, you CAN use an X-box controller, but be prepared to spend a long time setting it up, and it still won't be great.\n\nI have a Logitech G920 with clutch and pedals. It cost me a pretty penny but I feel it was worth it as it really improves the game (and every driving game I have). BUT it doesn't improve this game enough, unfortunately.\n\nYou see, Project Cars is a bit of a cluster-♥♥♥♥. If you want career mode, you will be at the mercy of a calendar, which will often force you into a very narrow band of choice with regards to racing types at any given time. This means that you will have to slog through a lot of racing types that might not be for you in order to get to the races you do want, and even then you might have to slog through even more crap to get to those. It's tedious, especially when the AI will plough into you, causing disqualifications while perfectly hugging the race line without drifting or anything.\n\nDuring a racing session, whether it's a solo race, free practice or career mode, you will be unable to select a colour for your car... sorry, that's not true: you can select a colour, but you won't get it in the race (a problem that has been present since release) These things really detract from the game for me as I don't get a sense of progression, achievement or ownership. I want a nice, unique paint job on my cars. I want to unlock cars and be able to use whichever one I want (confined to the racing type of course) rather than just be told to eat what's put infront of me.\n\nThis is a sim, through and through. The driving itself does feel nice, but only with a wheel. It's a real shame that more effort wasn't put into this game to give it some staying power or making it a bit more user friendly, as the gameplay is a real let down. If you are happy doing races in whatever cars are thrown at you or failing that, playing single races with no sense of progression, then you might enjoy this game; but you had better buy a wheel first.","January 4","false","6.7"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

Bought this off of ♥♥♥ for $30 and even at that price i feel scammed.\n\nPROS\n- Well... um... There's lots of tracks and cars i guess.\n\nCONS\n- Physics are terrible, clip the curb of an apex and the next thing you know your kissing a wall. The grass spins you out way to much. Driving a stock Renault Clio turns into driving a Formula drift car over ice covered in butter.\n\n- Graphics are WAY to beefy. People are saying this game sucks because its optimized for NVIDIA graphics cards, I have a NVIDIA graphics card, and a decent computer, but running this game on all of the lowest settings is a challenge.\n\n- The GUI and menus DO NOT ALWAYS SUPPORT CONTROLLERS. I'm using an Xbox controller but in most menus you have to use the keyboard or mouse to use, which is a hastle for me because i like to sit far away when playing racing games.\n\n- All of the cars are too clutchy, a little flick of the joystick sends you into a 180, and there's no way to fix the sensitivity.\n\n- Tapping the brakes DOESN'T WORK, you either give it the beans our come to a complete stop. If you tap the brakes you get an EASY spinout which will cost you the race.\n\n- Penalties. Get bumped off the track in qualifying because of one or all of the control issues in this game? Good news! Your next 2 lap times dont count! took me 15 minutes to quallify 4th to last.\n\n- Go Karts. Are they really necessary? The brakes are so sensitive that even a little bit of braking stops t he kart immediately. Plus they unreallistically rev really slowly after stopping, so every time you use the brakes, you're looking at a good half second off your time.\n\nI haven't even gotten to use the multiplayer because this game is si bad in single player. Too bad you can't get your money back.\n\n","June 23, 2015","false","6.9"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","1"

The sounds of the cars is not bad at all, engine notes are captured very well but tyre noises aren't that realistic at least from experience of being in the drivers seat. The single player career mode is a nice idea but annoying you can't skip the races you aren't interested in unless you start higher up the ladder but then you miss out of some of he earlier fun ones.\n\nI love driving/racing games but somehow I just can't get into this one, and I can't really explain why.","January 9","false","15.2"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","1"

I have a lot of those, and some are far cheaper than this one. The graphics are good tho, the sound is ok and support for various popular racing wheels is solid. I like the array of cars and tracks as well.\n\nHowever, I tried this with both a trustmaster racing wheel and a xbox 360 controller,and found myself doing figure skating untill I tweaked the control sensitivities and saturations. The controls are very sensitive by default. So if you wanna have a go at this game for the heck of it, then I surely recommend a tweak. At least.\n\nThe pricetag alone should trigger a thumbdown when you compare to other racing games in this class, and that it's not all that easy to learn by default as well, ensure a thumbdown from me.

What a mixed bag this is.\n\nAs far as physics go: this is not the best simulation.  It's ok, sort of a Forza style representation.  Slip angles are extremely forgiving. Slides are quite eaily recoverable.  Understeer is more prominent than oversteer, though both are fairly minimal.\n\nForce feedback with a wheel: lacking.  Even if you spend hours and hours tuning and tweaking the force feedback (which you WILL), you won't get as immersive an experience as rFactor 2, iRacing or Assetto Corsa.  It feels numb, lacking in representative feel relating to what you see on screen, and sterilized.  There's also an extremely heavy centering spring that you'll have to spend lots of time tweaking to get where you want, but it still won't be great. This is my biggest dissapointment with the game.\n\nGraphics: These are pleasing, but they aren't as amazing as they're made out to be.  On par or slightly ahead of Assetto Corsa is my best description.  There's tons out there on the graphics in this game.  Tone you hype back a notch or two and that'll get you a relatively good expectation level for the reality of them.\n\nAudio: Nothing particularly stands out.  It's sufficient.\n\nGameplay: The career mode is underwhelming. I enjoy that its all about the racing, but I find it lacking depth via no differences between the teams you sign for and an obfuscated progression between series.  IE: There's no real clear goals to achieve in order to attract a team from a particular series you want to progress to.  There's some big and obvious flaws there I'm extremely surprised the developers didn't seem to notice.  The one thing they get right is track and car selection.  It's very diverse and populated.  Easily PCars' best attribute.\n\nOther: The UI is annoying.  It's pretty but when it comes to using it, there are many places of frustration.  For example, only being able to change FFB settings in the main menu options.  So you have this thing that takes a ton of initial setup work (yes, even after the updates), and the only way to change the (many many, too many really) settings is through the main menu. Yet, the only way you can test those changes is in game.  So the end result is the user spends hours and hours tweaking in the main menu, booting up a session, quitting the session to get to the main menu, changing things in main menu, booting up a session, etc, etc.  It's one of the dumbest things in the game without a doubt.  Choosing a car skin is similarly annoying as well.\n\nOverall, the game is a struggle.  That's the best way to describe it.  It has a, on the surface, career type I want.  However it doesn't excecute it well.  The physics are *ok* but not very good and definitely not up to par wih its competition.  The force feedback is a quagmire of disappointment.  The visuals are nice but not nearly as pretty as advertised or hyped up to be.  And there are a myriad of annoyances throughout the experience from UI design to choosing a car skin.  The one and major saving grace for this game is its extensive car and track list. I won't go over the PCars 2 drama and what that may or may not entail.  Nor will I go over the development drama of this game. However, as an owner of this game, I really hope Slightly Mad Studios keeps working on this title.  It still has potential, but at this point is more of a Beta release than anything.","August 28, 2015","false","36.9"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","1"

PC platformu için böyle bir oyunun , FORZA ve GT ile yarışması için gerekli olduğunu düşünüyordum. Oyun genel olarak NFS : Shift 3 diyebiliriz. Az daha dayanabilir bir fizik motoru ve oynanış sunuyor.\n\nNormal şartlarda oyunu tavsiye ederdim. Çünkü şu anda Assetto Corsa'dan başka rakibi yok. Ancak tavsiye etmememin sebebi kesinlikle indirilebilir içeriklerin çok hızlı ve fazlaca çıkması. 6 ay gibi bir süreç geçmesine rağmen 8 tane paket geldi. Bu paketler tabiki güzel ancak bu kadar yıldır geliştirilmiş bir oyunun içinde bazı ekollerin ve ikon arabaların olmaması bence çok komik bir durum. İşte tam bu noktada bence oyun yapımcısının daha sonra indirilebilir içerik olarak satmayı göze alması yatıyor. Zaten 2015 Mayıs ayında çıkan bir oyunu 2015 Haziran ayında %40-50 indirime çekiyorsun ondan sonra insanları tahrik etmek için ayda birden fazla indirilebilir içerik çıkartıyorsun. Şu anda 8 paketin toplam fiyatı çok rahat bir şekilde oyun fiyatına yetişiyor. Yani bir oyun parasıda ekstradan sahip olmak istediğiniz 3-5 arabaya veriyorsunuz.\n\nOyunu tavsiye etmeme sebebim budur. Yoksa oyunla ilgili ne grafiksel bir sıkıntı , ne optimizasyonsal bir problem veyahut ne de motorsal bir sıkıntı yaşamadım.\n\nİndirimdeyse alın ancak onun dışında sakına tam fiyattan satın almayın. Benim gibi araçlardan hoşlanan biriyseniz alamadığınız her paket , her araç size kötü hissiyatlar yaşatacaktır.","November 25, 2015","false","17.2"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","16","28","3","4"

And that's saying a lot, considering Gran Turismo 5 was released in that timespan.\n\nThe game lacks basic interface functionality; you can't change the horrible futuristic speedometer you get in racing cars, and you can't even have a rear view mirror in certain camera positions. The menus are irritating and unnecessarily fiddly (and barely functional if you're using a controller), the user interface is cluttered up with pointless ♥♥♥♥♥ such as artificially generated twitter posts, and you have to restart the whole bloody game if you want to alter the graphics options, and sit through approximately 9 hours worth of opening splash screens each time. Hell, you can't even adjust volume levels while in the pause menu, you have to exit back to the main menu; and how exactly are you expected to know where to set the volume levels when you're not driving?\n\nThe driving mechanics and car selection certainly don't make up for this either. While Project Cars does seem to offer a dazzling selection of manufacturers and models at a glance, on closer inspection it is apparent that ~70% of the cars available are lazily designed, ugly, soulless race-cars which, quite honestly, all drive identically.\n\nThe biggest let-down with Project Cars, however, is the appalling career mode. Instead of sticking to the classic formula of the old Gran Turismo and Forza titles, this game adopts the insipid "racing contract" system of the famously lifeless Codemasters racing games. Earning credits, finally getting your hands on that gorgeous Jaguar and at last having the power at your fingertips to win greater titles has always been part of the fun of racing simulators; this game throws it away completely. On starting a career, the game railroads you into a tediously narrow selection of cars, then forces you to keep using one for an entire season. What's more, you're stuck with the utterly bland LM racecars right from the start, so there's also no feeling of progress whatsoever in this supposed "career" mode. The calendar design is intrusive, and sometimes kicks you into round 4 of a race without choice, skipping the qualifying and practice rounds; I can only speak for myself here but being forced to race on a track I've never seen, in a car I don't like, starting in 20th place isn't exactly fun.\n\nDon't be fooled by this game; it may look appealing on first glance, but believe me, you're looking for something else.","April 9","false","14.8"," 17 of 30 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","17","30","2","0"

I honestly can't put my finger on it. It claims to be a sim but it sure doesn't feel like that to me. Driving physics feel "wrong" after playing Assetto Corsa for well over 200 hours with a G25 and TH8R shifter. The cars I've driven so far feel clunky, even when the settings are set to realism. There is no sense of speed when you go over the track at 250 km/h and still feel as if you're going 100 km/h.\n\nThe list of cars is also a bit disappointing. There is, however, a huge list of tracks, featuring some of my favorite like Spa, Nordschleife and BRNO.\n\nProject Cars isn't a bad game but the physics and the way the cars handle still make it feel rather arcade than a sim.

Bugs everywhere, terrible performance on AMD cards, cars  glitching all over the road, etc. It was almost unplayable at the time, and with the announcement of Project Cars 2, I assumed it was going to be left to rot.\n\nI'm glad I was wrong. Many of the bugs have been fixed, and in that time I switched from AMD to Nvidia and can run the game much more smoothly. While some bugs persist, such as infinite loading screens, players randomly being flipped around on the starting grid or the invisible wall bug, the game runs much better and is a huge improvement on what it was like at release.\n\nI mostly play online in the GT3 class, and there are full lobbies most of the time with plenty of other people to race against. As with any public racing lobby, there's your mix of inexperienced slow players, angry ramming players, lagging players glitching all over the road and AFK players that never move from the grid. But this isn't the game's fault, and it's still possible to have very satisfying wheel-to-wheel battles against other sim racing fans.\n\nTL;DR - tentatively recommended as long as you're not using an AMD card and don't mind dealing with idiots online.","February 23","true","110.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","3"

They haven't deserved your money in the past n'or they will in the future, this[www.wmdportal.com] is a prime example why it's no longer worth paying for games in todays generation. Barely a month has passed after a buggy official release + 1 DLC  and they already opened funding for PC2. Unbelievable.\n\nTL;DRIs it buggy? Yes.\nIs it fun? Yes.\nIs it finished? No.\nIs it worth the price? No.\nIs it worth to acquire? No.\nEven I that paid 50% less for the pre-order I still consider that my money could have been wasted somewhere else more worthy of my money.\n\nThe gameplay is okay and graphics are good but unfortunatly that's about it, I mean there are too many basic bugs to be considered a stable release and too many missing features from gameplay to be considered a good racing simulator or a game worthy 50€.\n\nLonger reviewPart 1\nAssuming you've read the TL;DR that's the sad truth. The game was too hyped towards what it ambitioned to be. A racing simulator that was from the gamers to the gamers unfortunately after so many delays they might as well have delayed it a bit more even though they claim the game is in a finished state they ambitioned[www.wmdportal.com] despite the fact they internally still have plans to add more features to improve simulation immersion. Many simple bugs you'd assume wouldn't exist and that any person could replicate are present such as uncoded settings arrows or settings that are reset when changing from fullscreen to windowed mode. Although I personally for the most part have only witnessed minor uncompromising bugs many people are having more severe bugs. Like I said before the gameplay is good and racing is fun which makes multiplayer great because going career mode, despite being fun to progress your career through the classes you want, the AI & Weather combo is broken. AI isn't affected by weather while you the player are. If you're unlucky rainy races are your worst nightmare and for the most part you're likely to skip them until this problem is solved. Graphics and performance wise are actually pretty good.\n\nPart 2\nPeople praise for the developers to keep in touch with players although I personally see it more as a PR stunt since they say the same thing over again[forum.projectcarsgame.com] as their actual benefit from community feedback is unclear. Incase of the Head of Studio even disregarded game's point of failure justifying with its top sales and ratings[forum.projectcarsgame.com] (as if they meant the game was good). Despite moderators duty to defend their game, I'd say they could try do it more descreetly unlike some WMD veterans which are seen defending the game quite too blantly. From what I've been seeing in the forum the "chain of command" is split into 3/4 groups. Common players that have purchased the game after the crowdfund was closed. WMD personnel which for the most part are also players but considered veterans and thus more respected among the rest. And staff/devs which are responsible for moderating the forums and pass information onto the devs for them to work on. Upon game release they launched the pCar forum which common players go there to communicate with each other and report problems. However these forums aren't directly connected to the devs instead the ones more connected to the devs are the old WMD forums which gather more information and details of the game development. The WMD forums are more closed and give almost a sensation of NDA despite the fact I've heard terms such as "wishlist"[forum.projectcarsgame.com] which present features missing from the game that are to come, revealing the statement regarding the game is finished for release not entirely true. I've also been told that some bugs are still present in the game for as much as 2 years[forum.projectcarsgame.com]. So don't tell me that 5000 active feedbackers aren't enough to report the 10+ bugs I found in 2 days[forum.projectcarsgame.com]. Possibly many other bugs would have been present before the delayed releases however this still isn't a good release imho. At the most it would be released as Early Access in case of steam but of course such move would have to be made much earlier and the marketing wouldn't have happened.","May 11, 2015","false","43.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

However I only play it in the DK2 so it's definately not a deal breaker.\n\nI really like Assetto Corsa, I've had great fun in multiplayer (Which is an absolute disgrace to set up a server and HOST a multiplayer event, Project Cars really does it MUCH better, no messing around with external servers, Router settings, IP forwarding, or whatever other torture Assetto Corsa inflicts.\n\nBoth of these games are officially released but IMHO Project Cars is the game that feels like it, Assetto Corsa feels really rough around the edges and should have been delayed until it was finished. I did buy the Dream Pack and am happy with it but not so happy that it fragments the multiplayer even more than it already was, you can't join a session if there is even a single car that you don't have in it, rather than just letting you join and not be able to pick that vehicle, how dumb is that?","May 8, 2015","true","356.8"," 25 of 46 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","25","46","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/huttbutter/recommended/234630/","huttbutter","Hutt Butter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/huttbutter/","105 products in account","I'm reviewing this as a game for the HTC Vive. I bought the game after the last patch which added SteamVR support, and I've not played it as a normal racing game on a monitor.\n\nInitial set-up was painful for me. My advise is to totally unplug the Vive and go through the initial setup of your wheels and pedals on the desktop and make sure they're working. It's also far easier to create a career profile if you can see your keyboard while you're doing it.\n\nAlso there continues to be an annoying bug in Steam Big Picture/SteamVR Overlay where wheels and pedals are interfering with the controls making it impossible to interact with Steam. To get this game to work I first start SteamVR, then plug in my wheel, then plug in my pedals then, from the desktop, start Project Cars In VR. Then... everything is peachy.\n\nAs for the game itself: To me it's absolutely marvellous. Seriously. Being able to sit in these cars and karts, to have depth perception of the incoming road, to really feel like I'm there... well I'm finding it a LOT easier to drive than I normally do in these sorts of games. The graphics are pretty much as you'd expect from a Vive game: Resolution isn't great, you can't turn everything up to ULTRA FULL AMAZING without killing your system... but that doesn't matter at all. The cars and karts are detailed and the enviroments are breathtaking, especially with all the different weather and lighting conditions. The immersion is there, ultra quality can come later with better GPUs.\n\nThere seems to be a great range of tracks, including quite a few I know, some I've never seen before but they've all been great and well modelled so far. Project CARS likes you to do a practice round, then a qualifying round, then the actual race. You can skip these, if you like, but I find that going through all these steps methodically is the best way of learning the tracks and learning the cars.\n\nIt tells me I should go into the pits and set a 'pit strategy' but I don't care about any of that. Maybe that stuff is good but it's too nerdy for me. I just want the car to be set up right out of the box and so far I don't really have any complaints about the defaults.\n\nThere seems to be a good selection of cars. Nothing on the scale of Gran Turismo and the 'normal road car' selection is sadly lacking but then the game is really about fast cars and racing so it's understandable.\n\nSo basically: So far I'm really into this. If you're a Vive owner with a wheel this is absolutely an essential purchase. If you're a Vive owner without a wheel I probably wouldn't recommend it... this game needs a wheel. It really does. Should Vive owners buy a wheel and the game? Well, that's a trickier one. If you've ever owned a wheel in the past and really enjoyed something like Forza or GT on the consoles then this is probably exactly the PC racer you're looking for. My feeling is that if you own a Vive then getting a flight stick and a wheel and enjoying racing sims and elite dangerous is all part of making the most of your stupidly expensive headset so... yeah. Why not?\n\ntl;dr: The best racing sim available for the HTC Vive.","May 15","true","47.8"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","1"

Driving on them will not make a difference to normal road (e.g. Donnington, Spa and others)\nNo collision detection during pit stops, leading to other cars driving through you when rejoining or entering the pits\nSome of the HUD Elements bug out (e.g. the "predictive" timer)\nMissing things I consider important for a game marketed as "the next-generation of racing simulation":\n\nHandling is rather simplistic. Weight transfers are barely present, the car feels lifeless (although I have to say that there are quality differences between cars...still none of them feels good. All assists off btw.)\nForceFeedback is not up to par with other sims like Game Stock Car Extreme etc. Even after spending almost two afternoons tweaking there is just no really good feeling.\nNot possible to share setups with friends\nCould not find a way to have multiple setups per track (only 1 for each training, qualifying, race)\n\n\nThings that are just not good:\n\nThe AI is atrocious. Divebombing like crazy, ramming like the best of them...sometimes it feels like racing on a public multiplayer server\nThe AI only seems to be aware of the player after being about half way alongside while overtaking. Driving alongside an AI car overlapping only about a third car length is a sure way to be rammed of the track.\nOn some tracks the AI seems not to be subject to the same physics calculations as the player. Clearly visible when following behind closely and watching turning behavior of the AI. Also when driving in rain or watching AI racing through sand/gravel without being affected. Also AI seems unaffected by cold tires...\nSome of the tracks are just not very well modeled. Some of the corners of Spa are just wrong...the Nordschleife (a track I know from RL) is of laughable quality (Hatzenbach, Miss-Hit-Miss, Mutkurve just to name a few corners are really not well modeled)...in Barcelona the corner radii are off...\nPit stops are plain broken....tried to finish a 2 hour race multiple times to only be unable to pit because multiple AIs are stuck perpendicular to the pit straight accelerating into the divider.\nThe replay system is so limited it borders broken. Watching a second replay while driving will bug the replay controls out.\nThis game could be really good. I could overlook the very limited tire model and physics or the lackluster FFB, but all the bugs added to that make this a huge disappointment. And I have given it more than enough time to show its qualities.","May 19, 2015","false","92.9"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","1"

It's not a real career mode, more like "drive those races and you can change the mode after you finished the season" and by mode I mean you can change between GT4 and Formula C and stuff.\nYou kind of work your way up but you can also start in Formula A (the highest one) if you want.\n\nSo I like it for the fact that you get different race weekends with the whole practice and qualifying stuff which is based on the real regularitions (i guess).\n\nBut there are plenty of races you are "forced" to drive wether you want to or not. So I'm in GT4 atm. and am forced to drive a Lotus cup. If you drive those compared to the GT4 it's like you put on a Speedhack and turned off the traction. If you accelerate to much you will turn around. You cannot even start straight if you've got full acceleration.\nThats kind of annoying.\n\nAll those Karts and Formula cars I've tested seem so freaking unrealistic. I've been karting in real life and in this game it's just like a speedhack version of that. You cannot control anything. Well I can't.\n\nEitherway in career mode I've started with the Renault Clio (since Karts were not an option for me).\nThose feel like your steering a battleship. You're so slow and heavy.\n\nAfter that I've been driving some GT5 car i forgot. That was better but felt pretty heavy, too.\n\nThe Aston Martin Vantage (GT4) is really fun to drive though. Atleast I like it. But it doesn't seem to be realistic in any way. You're like driving on rails compared to the Formula Cars. And that's what makes me wonder. Isn't it the other way round?\n\nAll in all I might not be the best informed racer on earth and I've not tested all the cars in this game but I can say it is partly fun but there are better games focusing on one part of what this game tries to combine.","December 8, 2015","false","13.9"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","1"

There's a lot of issues with the actual game client itself that's not system related but game related. There's some options missing that are sorely needed and every change to the visual settings requires a restart of the game. There is no default settings option at least none that I could find which was a pain when I just wanted to get above 40FPS and set everything to high.\n\nThe driving is just so incredibly boring. It's stiff. Really stiff. Messing with the sensitivity just results in oversteering(You actually have to lower your sensitivity as the default is way too high at 50!). Using a controller the steering just isn't smooth at all. It's like it's emulating mouse key presses and locking them at degrees to where your controller stick is. A little bit to the right this game isn't a little bit to the right in most racing games but it's as if you're quickly tapping a key on your keyboard. It feels janky...\n\nThe multiplayer just sucks a fat one. I really can't explain how incredibly disappointed I am with it. All you have is Short or Long races. Long races can last a freakin' day but default to two hours! There's even practice rounds that are default to two hours! The MP browser is just terrible by any stretch of the imagination. You can't sort by ping, you can't sort by name, you can't sort by length, you can't sort by map unless you use the filters. The only way to find things is by using the filter options but there is NO sorting options at all. Even at that the filter options are extremely poor at best which makes finding the right lobby needlessly hard to do.\n\nMP is basically drop in and drop out from what I could see. You don't start a race with everyone else. You just kind of load in... take off from the pitstop... and drive around... you just keep driving. It seems incredibly pointless especially when races can last over an hour at a time and no one sticks around for that long. It's like paying for a drive around Mondello Park; it's you just driving around a professional track seeing how fast you can go. There may be other people on the road but you aren't racing them, you're not even competing against them. You're just driving. It's just so sorely lackluster and so unfun.\n\nI was expecting a good RACING game. I didn't get one. I had to refund this... Knew I definitely wouldn't get any enjoyment from this. Maybe you can but from what i've experienced, if you're in it for MP(Which I am), it's not worth the money even on sale for €20.","January 2","false","0.9"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","8"

My first run was with the Mustang Boss 302R at Brands Hatch. It didn't feel right, kind of floaty... then I dug into the MANY MANY options, and found just the right tuning setup for me and the way I drive.  Granted, I still feel like I need some practice, but that's just awesome.  The graphics are good, in some ways better than anything else out there, in other ways the additional realism makes it feel a little flat.  (Sometimes in game development, a little oversaturation in colors makes the game more engaging, making it feel more real somehow compared to photographic perfection.  It's all a perceptual thing.)  On the whole, so far, I'm very, very impressed.  The number of choices and options is just staggering.  The only real flaw is some of the options have nice descriptions in the center pane when you select them, but then there's other areas (like controller settings) that offer no advice or documentation whatsoever.  I hope they'll polish that up a bit.  But again, really great sim.  Another thing I will miss from Grid Autosport is earning cash to buy new cars, and getting sponsors to get more cash... I found that personally very engaging, and that's missing from Project CARS.  However, it's absolutely not a deal breaker, just a personal preference that I'll miss.","May 7, 2015","true","22.8"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","14","25","0","0"

Game is effin pretty; beyond any other racer currently out. The Weather and lighting is some of the best I've seen in any game to date.\nI'm using two very old 550ti 1 gig cards and Project CARS seems to perform fairly well on those. I'm able to run at 1080p with all settings maxed except for MSAA, AA and or FXAA. I run FXAA at low and sometimes I opt to run at 1600x900 with FXAA cranked all the way up. The thing is even at 1600x900 Project CARS is still a very pretty game. For those with higher performance rigs take it up a notch and add SweetFX to the mix.\n\nSimulation vs Simcade vs Arcade: Project CARS on the surface can hit that area of simcade a lot of players look for, but, dig a little deeper and Project CARS is a full on simulation that can be brutally difficult with no room for errors. There is nothing Arcade about Project CARS.\n\nViews: There is a wide range of views to choose, from cockpit, helmet to third person. You can adjust the depth of fields on the fly to fine tune to your liking.\n\nTrack Selection: All the best tracks in the world, been years since I've played a game with this good of a selection on day 1.\n\nControls: If you're using a controller, you won't have much of an issue with just getting straight into the game. However, there is a lot to be desired still. I find the default setups to be very twitchy on an xbox 360 gamepad. I've had to put numerous hours into adjusting my controls which leads me to the next part.\n\nUI/GUI: Project CARS has the worst GUI I have ever came across in my life long gaming career. It is confusing, lackluster, ugly and hard to use.\nSo for example in the controller setup there are no tooltips that explain a single thing....This is kind of "what the ♥♥♥♥". So you're forced to look for guides on steam or other websites that explain how the controller setups work and what everything means...Then you can't adjust controller setting from in game. So you are forced into this cumbersome process of bouncing back and forth between this terrible GUI.\nThe entire UI sucks and sucks hard. There is nothing good to say about this UI. It's horrible. Car selection is even a chore, the tunning menus are somehow worse than the controller settings menus. This UI is pathetic, what a waste. This UI looks like something a 10th grader worked on at night after he/she got done with their homework for about 2 weeks. Then brought it to school for show and tell. COME ON GUYS. GET WITH IT. This UI brings Project CARS down in so many ways.\nSMS has made a great game here, held back by a ♥♥♥♥ING HORRIBLE UI.\nThere is no section of Project CARS that has a good UI. It's all bad. In career mode, the ui sucks, online the ui sucks, tunning the ui sucks, controller setup the ui sucks, car selection, track selection the ui sucks and just to type it out one more time....THE UI ♥♥♥♥ING SUCKS.\n\nSo Project CARS is pretty, fun, and, held back by a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥ing piece of ♥♥♥♥, god awful, train wreck, amatuer UI\n\nProject CARS still has numerous bugs as well. You can't even enable advanced options in controller setup, because if you do, you have to remember to go in turn on the settings you want each time. For the life of me I can't figure out how to save a controller profile so I can load different setups. It seems it's simply not an option. Again ♥♥♥♥ THIS UI.

And my first expirence past the Go Karts.\n\n\nI turn off all driving assisstances in the game including ABS and traction control systems.\nI spun out alot in some car no faster than my actual car. You cant just drift around corners you'll spin out, it is a very unforgiving game you have to work to learn the corners (which gear, how much throttle, braking, steering angle, driving line). Too much throttle after a corner, spin out. Brake too hard especially in a rear wheel drive, spin out. Raining and you try to floor it off the line, spin out.  Even a poor gear change can cost you 2 positions easily. I literally sweat trying to hold poll position.\n\nI love having to work on it. Critizing myself on how i performed each corner.\n\nThere is a no BS game, you dont have to earn money to unlock a car. All tracks and cars are avialable from the start. You dont spend an hour putting decals on your car, you'll spend 1 hour tuning your car to fit your driving style on a specific track.\n\nThe gratification in this game comes from mastering a track, not from earn 1mil to unlock a car. Getting hyped you knocked off 1 second from your lap time. It really is a racing game for racing enthuesists.\n\nThe game is literally about racing nothing else.\n\nI get people like and are used to unlocking cars, tracks, decaling their cars and a feeling of progressing through a story.

Now that it has Vive support I've gone and bought all the extra content too, Not just to experience it but to say thanks to the dev team for pushing forward with the vive support which has changed me gaming life forever as an experience I recommend evangelically to anyone! :)\n\nAlso, quick notes on VR/Vive support. I recommend an absolute minimum of aliasing on 2x for now, even if you have to set everything else at minimum as it makes an insanely big difference to distance you can see and jaggies/pixels//shimmering.\n\nThe other stuff (on a 980 at least) to set high is car detail (for up close cars passing by) and maybe the rest at low or medium.\n\nSet the screen res to 640 lowest too as that seems to be just for the preview.\n\nAlso, a small detail is that the two "head" camera views are slightly different in the way they behave. One will keep your head movement relevant to the cars angle so that if you hit a bump, crash or go up a hill, your head moves at the same time the car does. That can be off putting for low frame rates and isn't that smooth. The other view though will make the head movement absolute so that if you go over a bump you see the car move up or down but your head stays fixed to the horizon and stays stable, same with hills, it's much smoother. Not sure which is better though to be honest. I think the first is more realistic but might be too much for some ;)\n\nSlightly mad studios. If you read this. You might need to have an additional sound option for VR as the mix could do with adjusting for such a visceral experience as VR. ;) Things like road noise, wind, tires and other cars need to be a bit louder I think to stop it feeling a bit claustrophobic in VR and maybe bring some of those great external engine sounds you get in the 3rd person view to make it even more lively.\n\nAnyway.. I hope there's even more optimisation coming but this is an amazing start for my favourite car game. Like others here. I'm not even a big car nut but project cars with a wheel, VR (and some to be "simvibe" vibrations) is a must have experience! Don't pass on it!\n\n...hmm. lastly.. PLEASE devs.. also get round to adding even just a basic multiplayer/co-op career mode.

So I tried all the modern racing sims and as soon as I tried Project cars I was absolutely hooked. From the lovely realistic graphics to the nose to nose racing, and the real feel of the driving I felt it blew everything else away. And after almost 130 hours I am still loving it.\n\nUnlike many other modern games you dont get unrealistic unlocks of technology in this game or daft challenges. No this game is all about real racing. So you get a real career where you can pick the style of racing - GT, open wheel, road, endurance etc - and you progress through multiple seasons gradually getting offers to race for higher quality races. You also get invitations to race events like historic car races and single type competitions that span a few weeks.\n\nThis game has it all - loads of interesting cars, loads of famous and unusual tracks, pitting, tuning, yellow/blue flags, practice sessions, qualifying, long endurance races over several hours, extremely customisable car AI, weather, race weekends, multiplayer, solo practice sessions, and breakdowns.\n\nIt speaks volumes that one of my favourite events is the Clio Cup in this game where you race Renault Clios around all-British tracks such as Donnington, Snetterton and Oulton, when you can get so much enjoyment out of racing a little underpowered car I think that reflects the quality driving experience. But all the cars in this game are amazing and you get to learn all of them throughout the career.\n\nIn terms of downsides to the game there are very few - the car AI is varied and you will find yourself beating Clios at 90% AI around Oulton only to then struggle to beat historic Escorts at 60% around the same track. Also the AI cars dont experience breakdowns or cold tyres. You do get damaged when you collide etc but not as much as you should. Finally there is no Nascar or rally driving. But that is about it in terms of 'the bad'.\n\nSo overall I heartily recommend this racing game, its far better than anything else for the PC (or otherwise). The free updates and continual expansions really add great things to the game so it keeps developing. And the best thing about this game - you can drive around a track with realistic GT cars, then go watch the same sort of race on Motors TV and its just like it is in the game! It's a fantastic experience that never gets old.","May 30","true","132.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Since Assetto Corsa v1.6 dramatically improved the tire modelling that is the better game now.\n\nSomewhere along the road the handling in PCars changed to be as though the cars on on ice, this isn't helped by the extremely confusing controller configution.\n\nAC is very playable with a joypad, PCars isn't, though it is fun with a wheel as a group of us found out on LAN night - AC is just as fun, moddable, less frustrating to play with a controller and has a better, more robust online system.\n\nAC has Laserscanned Nurburgring amongst other laserscanned tracks, the roads feel real, not super smooth like, you know, a video game.\n\nThe licenced cars in AC are better, more desirable - and there are people adding more as mods every day - so look past the fancy graphics of PCARS because that does wear thin over time, look past the weather system because you'll constantly disable it in favour of "very sunny" go and by the better overall product, go and buy Assetto Corsa.\n\nRecommended because I got 100 hours out of it, so by that measure it is good value.

Forza is one of my all-time favourites next to Mario Kart. The car selection is second to none (even Gran Turismo is behind) while the simulation physics are well done, with realistic damage (though not as extreme as in Project Cars with wheels flying off). Oh, did I already mention Forza has a ton of great cars without stupid sponsorship livery ruining the exterior?\n\nI don't want to pay for Xbox Live, and have been wanting to play a racing game online for a change, so I picked up Project Cars after seeing a friend enjoy it. At $23.99 CAD, I don't regret it, but I do wish I could've paid less, because the game, while good, just isn't as good as Forza. Is there ever going to be a PC racing game that has both simulation elements and a good car selection?\n\nProject Cars' car selection is abysmal. Seriously. There's only a handful of stock cars without promotional livery (Audi R8, BMW 1-series, Mercedes A45 plus a few others), and many of those are locked in paid DLC. I decided to suck it up and try a few of the cars with ugly livery like the Scion FRS so I could have some variety, and have gotten used to it, but I still don't like it.\n\nOne of the game rules is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as well. "Cut track penalty"? Seriously? Sometimes I screw up a drift and end up in a situation where I've "cut the track" but have actually caused a setback for myself, and this disadvantage is made worse by my speed being limited for 5-10 seconds, which is NOT FAIR. I tried to find a way to disable this in my own lobby but to no avail.\n\nBut putting those glaring flaws aside, I am genuinely having fun with the game. The simulation mechanics are more hardcore than in Forza, with tire wear, fuel consumption, and mechanical damage (including blown engines and complete losses of wheels) to worry about. Sometimes you can ram another player and send him flying into a wall at 200 km/h and cause his front wheel to snap off, and then his engine blows as he tries to get back on track. It's deliciously satisfying when that happens.\n\nThe graphics are to die for. Forza doesn't come close. There's even an Xbone version of Project Cars available and that also puts Forza to shame.\n\nThe setup flexibility in races is amazing. You can have up to 23 AI opponents. You can set the race to occur at NIGHT (which means you need your headlights and you need to avoid frontal collisions that could destroy them). You can turn on light or heavy RAIN which can add an extra challenge in handling.\n\nOverall, Project Cars does many things right in spite of its flaws and so I recommend it. But it could be so much better, if it added the Forza car selection and took out the cut track penalty.","February 19","true","7.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I originally played this game on a steelseries SRW-S1 which is an accellerometer based wheel and I found the game to be excellent but once I bought myself a Logitech G29 it just totally transformed the game for me.\n\nThe game excells in it's graphics and its content. Whilst there are lots of DLC packs to be bought, they are in fact worth it. Once you have the FFB dialled in the way you want it, the game really unlocks to you. I've seen some comments suggesting that the FFB is annoying because of the default set-up, but the way SMS have set up the FFB is that you can adjust so many different global FFB settings and more specific FFB settings on a per-car basis. The result is everyone (with a little tinkering) can find the settings that suit them.\n\nI will say that the Multiplayer can be annoying sometimes but I am more of a single-player, also the AI will shoot across corners with reckless abandon and receive no punishment from it unlike the player. Bearing these two things in mind, the game is not reaching its full potential but with out a doubt you will still definitely have fun with this game.\n\nI know some people complain that the physics are basic. Having not played iRacing or Assetto Corsa, I can only compare this game to arcade games and for me the physics are outstanding. I really feel like I know what the car is doing.\n\nAs for bugs, I have found bugs with the RADBULL drift car and some multiplayer connection issues but that is it in 550 hours of gameplay a very few small bugs so I don't quite know what is causing them for other people.\n\nThe graphics are excellent and well optimised. I play on a laptop and have all the graphics on High and get 60fps so they have done an excellent job in optimising the game for Nvidia cards.\n\nThe gaps in vehicles including in the game might put some off (e.g. no Ferrari or Lamborghini) however if you are patient, Machine Dojo Modding Team are working on free car models to include in the game. SMS rather helpfully released an update which makes it a lot easier to install modded vehicles.\n\nAll in all the game holds it's own. The AI is a bit arcade-y and the multiplayer has some bugs in relation to people's internet connection (as many games fdo). Maybe as it is my first Racing Sim it seems more amazing then it is but to be honest from what I've seen of other sims; imo this game is very well rounded and is the best parts of acrcade and sim to make sure everyone has a good time.\n\nAlso recommend checking out ApexOnlineRacing (AOR) leagues done on pCars to get a good idea of the level of racing you can achieve on this game","May 18","true","612.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The AI. Yeah like everyone else has said, the AI does unfortunately cheat you sometimes. However, if you are really good at this game and get good with race lines...they really don't stand a chance. My hardest difficulty I've played AI is 90. So I guess I can say I'm alright. I've only ever played online with friends and not randoms. I enjoy the challenge though. There are times when the AI will get so far ahead that it's just unexplainable. I don't mind restarting, but I can imagine this would ruin people's gaming mood.\n\n2.Visuals.  Projects Cars is probably one of the best visual racing games I've seen. I was hoping GT sport was going to beat PC, however I was left in utter disappointment when I found out it was just basically gt6 with an e sports feel. The trailer was highly misleading. They still have 6 months to go, but I don't have much faith. Assetto Corsa has more of a matte finish with their visuals, but it's close to PC on say, medium-ish settings with some low. I'm happy with my pruchse when it comes to visuals.\n\n3. Driving/Gameplay. At first this game was really hard to get a hang of. I remember I tried to play it like NFS shift or Forza, it just didn't work out for me and for about 2 days I was regretting my purchase. For those first two days I was braking while making turns instead of pre breaking. I quit playing for a while and didn't touch the game for sometime. I couldn't refund because I had broke in 5 hours. One day I decided to just give the game a real chance and learn it. I'm glad I did. With the right music or just the sound of the engine alone, the cars are a real joy to drive. I use a 360 controller, but would love to have a wheel...just not willing to spend so much for one. 360 controller works just fine for me. My current favortie car in the game is the mercedes AMG GT3. Has amazing handling and reasonable HP. There are some cars in the game, no matter how much the setup is tweaked, the car is just still bad for me at least. I'd say my least favorite are the audi's and aston martins.\n\n4.Tracks. Lots of familiar tracks from other games appear here. Sadly this is a professional racing sim. So, you will not see beautiful night time cities like the underground series of NFS had. I guess they would be a nice addition to the game, but I do like the professional feel a lot more. Makes you feel top dog, if you will. You can customize track settings to a fixed wheather setting or have it mixed which is nice. I always used fixed. Nightime will defintely make the race more interesting and have you on edge.\n\n5. Online. Like I mentioned before, I've only played online with a friend or 2, so I can't give my opinion on the community or quality of online when there are a lot of cars. However I hear that a lot of people leave during the race. I've seen this on youtube for the console side on PS4 thanks to viperconcept. One thing I do like about online is that you can make the games private. I would probably have asked for a refund if all I could play was public games and deal with trolls occasionally.\n\n6.360 controller. When I first got this game, the controller would at times,....eh stop working. I'd have to restart the game and it was annoying. This was also a part of my regret. Ever since I decided to give this game a real shot, I've noticed it hasn't been happening so far. I'm glad it was fixed, I hope I didn't just jinx myself.\n\nI guess thats all I have to say. hope this gives you a better understanding of what you could have if you choose to buy.\n\n","June 1","true","44.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

First of all let me state that I play with a Geforce GTX980 and a T500 RS + Th8A using the natural transmission type of the individual cars (i.e. clutch + H-shifter / sequential with paddles / sequential with shifter). In addition I mostly stick to the single player career mode with the following settings:\n- opponent strength of 80%\n- a session length of 30%\n- helmet camera\n- full damage\nand the following assists enabled:\n- traction control,\n- anti-lock brake,\n- stability control\n- partially visible racing line\n\nAt the beginning I started to play with all assists off except racing line but found it way too time consuming to get used to the different cars' handling in order to achieve decent results. Even with the above-mentioned assists enabled, most cars are far from having a handling like being on rails. With many cars you always have to take care of not going full throttle in bumpy corners, on curbs or revving too high in low gears. So in essence this is for me by no means a casual game, but a game where you have to be fully awake and be willing to take the full grind of training, qualifying and race. For each event I am in absolute need of the training to get a feeling for the car and the track. With some car beasts or tracks one training session isn't even enough for me.\n\nLet's get to the pros and cons:\n\n+ excellent graphics, especially the lighting and rain effects\n+ dynamic weather and time-of-day changes\n+ many different cars and car classes\n+ many different tracks with different layouts\n+ many of the cars and tracks are great fun to drive\n+ immense feeling of immersion in helmet camera view, especially in the open wheelers\n+ nice sound\n+ good FFB (I use Jack Spade's tweaker files)\n\n+/- very demanding and time consuming to master the different cars and tracks\n+/- opponent AI\n\n- the available car models in some car classes are very unbalanced in terms of performance\n- the racing line braking points are quite often misplaced and thus useless\n- Due to the very strict short cut detection system it can sometimes be quite time consuming to get a valid lap time at all. In addition it is really annoying that you can get a short cut penalty even when the AI pushes you from the track.\n- The AI is way too quickly back on track once it gets off, while for yourself it can sometimes take ages to get back.\n- Unbalanced opponent strength: At 80% opponent strength, I often am 1 or 2 seconds faster than the AI while sometimes I am 3 seconds behind. E.g. with the 90's DTM Mercedes on the Nürburgring I don't stand a chance at all, while races with the Lancer in Monza are like a walk in the park.\n- For my flavour it rains too often in carrer mode. Even when it's currently sunny, if you forget to check the weather forecast for a three lap race, you can get in BIG trouble.\n- Save game is only stored locally and not in the Steam cloud. Not knowing that in the beginning once cost me about 40h of career progress.\n- Majority of Community Events requires owning DLCs.\n- Sporadically I have the suspicion that the driving assist and/or rain tyre selection detection is bugged as the handling can be like on soap.\n- Annoying menu for graphics and controller settings. You always have to leave the race for changing anything. In addition I can only partially navigate with my wheel buttons through the menu.\n- No possibility to save the progress within a race. For multi-hour races you can only put the race on pause, but you have to drive from beginning to end.\n\nOverall I give Project CARS a 7/10.","May 27","true","147.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kythrol/recommended/234630/","Kythrol","Kythrol","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kythrol/","601 products in account","A great racing simulator with a variety of cars and tracks, plus a unique career mode.\n\nProject CARS is a racing simulation made by Slightly Mad Studios, the studio which was - before the release of this game - mostly known for developing the Shift games. This time, not under the Need for Speed franchise nor Electronic Arts, they took a shift (pun intended) towards realism. And all in all, I'd say they did pretty well.\n\nAt first you're welcomed with a neat main menu which has everything separated into categories, making it easy to find anything you're looking for without having to really go and look for it. Which is nice. Although I don't think you'd get this game only to admire its menu, so let's assume that after going through the options and configurations a bit - which I had some issues with since the mapping detection seemed to have a day off but everything ended up working in the end - you'll want to try actually driving.\n\nYou can either jump into the career mode straight away, have a quick race weekend, or perhaps start up a free practice session. Whatever you choose, the experience remains completely up to you. Your career can start in any series you want; if you like, you can drive a season in Le Mans Prototypes, or maybe go racing karts and work your way up slowly all the way up to the F1 equivalent. And in the other modes, choose any car and track you want to race on - and there are loads to choose from. No unlocks, no grinding. Now some people like that approach and some don't - I found it alright, with the included accolades and achievements providing challenge and motivation to some degree. Of course, it's not like Gran Turismo, but it works. The multiplayer portion of the game is also very populated, with a game to find at pretty much any time you want to race.\n\nFinally getting on the track, the first thing to notice is surely the audiovisual appearance. The game both sounds and looks great. Well, maybe except for the rain drops, which have went as far as ruining every single rainy race I had and I have no clue why would they want to keep that ugly effect in the game, but maybe I'm in the minority on that one... Disregarding that, the developers' attention to detail is definitely noticeable everywhere. I'd classify it as one of the prettiest racing games around, at least at the time of its release.\n\nThe gameplay itself, I don't have a word to say against the car physics, and you can further enhance how the car feels with a lot of tuning options. Every car feels entirely different. The AI is alright as well, could have been better but the opponents aren't necessarily frustrating to race against which by itself makes it superior to the most of other titles. The game can be very strict in terms of respecting the track limits, but that's probably for the better.\n\nI dislike that some bits of the game feel unpolished, with little bugs, both gameplay and visual to encounter at times, and even missing capital letters at the beginnings of sentences or even the drivers' names. Those things certainly don't look nice but aren't too game-breaking, and the only crash I have encountered was caused by my own doings because I alt-tabbed to the desktop and the game probably didn't like it at that point. Everything else seems to be good at the technical side of things.\n\nProject CARS is good. It can pretty much be what you want it to be, a realistic simulation - although not comparable to the likes of iRacing - or a slightly more arcadey experience if you prefer it to be that way. It has loads of cars and tracks, and, most important of all, it's also pretty fun and exciting to play. For the price you can often buy it at, it's worth it.","March 15","true","7.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

For reference, I come from a Gran Turismo background so a lot of my feedback will be based on that as a 'simulator' with the use of a wheel/pedal setup (My current setup is a Thrustmaster T500RS, TH8a Shifter & T3PA PRO Pedals).\n\nGRAPHICS - 8/10\nThis is easily the strong point for PCARS. I am fortunate to have a very good PC so play with mostly Ultra setting with some at high getting roughly 70-100fps. The detail within the cars is excellent with the environment and tracks being even better, a really good looking game. However I must note that even at the point of this review, there are still graphical glitches seen in open cockpit cars when it is/isn't raining.\n\nINTERFACE/UI - 7/10\nIn one word I would say....simple. Everything is easy to find and straightforward. That being said, the "career" segment is so basic and shallow it seems like an afterthought. WTF is that calendar system all about? Could the Devs not think of something more interesting/complex than a calendar?\n\nAlso pointless emails/"tweets" are pointless. WHY? I won 15ish races on the bounce and I still got emails from people saying "...this could be part of a streak"....??? Really? You think? Why do I care what Betty whatshername wrote about me on twitter clone-hashtag thingy? I don't!\n\nPHYSICS - 6/10\nThis is where I start to see a downturn in PCARS. The physics attached to the cars are very good and definately worth the title of simulation, however the score I have given reflects the lack of positive impact changing the settings of any vehicle has on it's handling. I have tweaked the settings to try and improve charachteristics of the vehicle (Escort Mk1) but to no notable avail. It seems as though every car is set-up to be pretty darn competitive out-of-the-box to the point where there is no real reason to change anything, even though any positive changes seem unoticeable. Why have such an indepth choice of tweaks and settings to your car when it isn't really needed?? Also to note, crash physics between cars is below average at best (It feels more like you are playing bumper cars!).\n\nAI - 5/10\nBoring. Just plain boring. They are okay for casual racers that just need someone to race against in offline mode, but for people looking for a challenge just go and face real humans (....or try another game?). Apart from staying pretty rigid to the raceline, they do not seem to offer much of a challenge when trying to compete for podium places. I feel this is a problem area that almost the entire race genre has, probably owing to the challenge of coding such an AI. So in that regard PCARS is no different than most racer sims, which in of itself is dissapointing considering PCARS is meant to be the challenger to the race-sim crown.\n\nFEATURES/DEPTH - 5/10\n...and quite frankly I feel I am being generous. You never *OWN* any of the cars within the game, you are purely a contract driver. As a concept this is fine, but it will naturally lead to a lack of depth in gameplay owing to the fact that you are simply a faceless dude that turns up around the world in a blink, races then jets back home (This is the main problem with PCARS). This is unlike in Gran Turismo/Forza Motorsport ect where you earn the money and put blood, sweat and tears into owning a piece of machinery. Then, carefully taking your underpowered Golf Gti and turning it into a FWD beast, you face the challenges with something that is YOURS. You earned it, raced it, improved it then won in it. The concept is rewarding and makes for improved length of gameplay and a vast array of features.\n\nPCARS has none of that. You're a faceless grunt, deal with it.\n\nCONCLUSION - 6/10\nWhen I first learnt of PCARS I was HYPED. The idea was brilliant with a community focussed race-sim that delivered a Daddy of all racers that I could spend vast amounts of hours being a nerd while drooling over cars I will probably never own. However, I feel disappointment. It's very pretty yes, but it's so...so shallow. The "Career" is pathetically boring at best alongside the AI that seem to be drafted from the deaf-dumb-polite society.\n\nDisappointed.","January 23","false","34.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

So I was disappointed when the development shifted towards what so many racing sims on PC are, a non car customisable, choose your racing car sim. After becoming bored with the prebuilds I abandoned the forums & discovered on release that instead of receiving a copy of the game as initially promised there was a 50% off coupon in my Steam inventory. Thankfully after a few months the backers received payments from sales but as I was still disappointed from not receiving the game I avoided it until Vive support was added.\n\nNow being one of the few racing games to support the Vive I've been enjoying the game. Racing sims are hugely improved with VR, the ability to judge distances and being able to see elevation changes, just the immersion it offers.\n\nIt's worth picking up if you have a Vive, but I won't be backing Project Cars 2.","May 24","true","27.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","6","10","2","1"

Some off the top of my head would include IndyCar Racing I & II, F1GP2, Grand Prix Legends, Sports Car GT, Richard Burns Rally, GTR/GTR 2, GT Legends, Race/GT-R Evolution/Race On/etc., RaceRoom Racing Experience, SimRaceWay, Game Stockcar (including Extreme and Reiza's truck game), Live For Speed, netKar Pro, Assetto Corsa, iRacing, rFactor 1 & 2 and NASCAR Racing 2003.\n\nI can wholeheartedly say that among all of the sims I've ever played none have felt as alive, as deep in handling nuances and as engaging to drive as Project CARS, and it is by far my favorite sim of all time (it also inspired me to really look into the physics of racing and to develop my own spring and damper calculation tool, which I'll release at some point). I'll tend to agree with Ben Collins and Kristian Roos in that past sims were often way too difficult on and over the edge, too punishing. Like Rene Rast has commented, racing cars are designed to go and be driven fast and inspire confidence in the driver, they're specifically designed to be good at going fast, which means that until you start to get to the limits, they're not that necessarily that hard to drive. So the cars feel like they actually do have some semblance of grip as they should, but start pushing to the limits and shaving those last hundredths of a second and you'll find all the challenge you could hope for.\n\nI love this game.","May 7, 2015","true","273.9"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

I have lower end equipment, true, but it is above minimum specs required for the game and I have less than 60 FPS with all settings to low. And if it rains....forget it. Some tracks are better than others and if the frameraate was consistent even being less than 60 i would be happy. It simply is not very optimized for most if not any computer. So with all the beautiful graphics and they really are, if you cant play it at a consistent FPS it is not worth the money.

I made the mistake of buying Assetto Corsa which while it simulates car driving well, has no discernable game around it, the AI is terrible.\n\nSo, I have been following Project Cars for a while and unfortunately missed out on supporting it in early access, I bought it on day of release.\n\nAfter playing it for a few hours I can say this is the more serious driving game I have been waiting for for years. It isn't a full on sim, with all the baggage that carries, but I would put it at the casual end of the racing sim genre.\n\nI play with a steering wheel (old logitech Momo) which after setting up in game works well, although the Force Feedback leave a lot to be desired, it is very weedy and inconsistent. The general driving experience is great, whether doing time attacks around a course chasing ghost cars of faster real players laps, or when driving in races against the AI. The AI is the one of the highlights of the game as they genneraly act like real drivers on the track, and not crash into you like other games do. You can adjust the AI strength from 1-100 which allows you to fine tune the experience so you get a good race. I haven't tried MP yet.\n\nMy only major disappointment is the Kart Racing which unfortunately you have to do a load of races in to progress through the career mode. The Karts hand terribly with a wheel, I found I had to use my 360 controller instead, which fortunately makes the Karts playable, though still very tricky to drive. The AI in Karts doesn't work too well either. Personally I don't think they should have included Karts in the game, it detracts from the masterpiece that driving the cars in game is.\n\nThere is a wide array of tracks in the game and a decent selection of cars, although 95% of the cars are in the very fast to warp speed classes, and only a handful are at the slower end where I like doing a lot of my racing.\n\nI know the hardcore sim snobs look down their noses at Project Cars, but IMO they should be more supportive of it even if they don't play it themselves. It acts as a great introduction to the more serious side of racing and will probably lead to more people moving to sims down the line, which is good news for their niche ecosystem.\n\nOverall I can really recommend this game to someone who want a more serious driving game that isn't intimidating.\n\nPros\nGreat gameplay\nTop of class AI\nGreat graphics, makes you feel like you are really racing in a car.\n\nCons\nKart Racing with a steering wheel\nForce Feedback\nNot enough slower cars for my tastes","May 10, 2015","true","87.3"," 37 of 71 people (52%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","52","37","71","5","5"

More configuration than you can poke a stick at, I honestly don't know what half of it does.\n\nGraphics are incredible but you'll need a high end rig to do a packed race without framerate drops on ultra settings. If you have less than a dozen cars it's usually fine. I get a solid 60fps driving in heavy rain with 12 cars on the track on the highest possible settings with a GTX 980.\n\nPlenty of beautiful tracks to race on, including Bathurst for any Aussies out there.\n\nPersonally I'm a little bit let down by the variety of cars, but there's definitely plenty to choose from. You'll be going without brands like Ferrari and Lamborghini... and even more of a let down for me was the lack of V8 Supercars (something that is offered in many other Steam racing titles such as Grid Autosport). You can't have Mount Panorama with no Holden or Ford V8 to drive! EDIT: DLC adds some extra variety, such as the Old Vs New car pack adding some Fords. Very cheap too, the base price without discount is only $4. You'd be paying on average around $1 per extra car WITHOUT a discount.\n\nDefinitely worth picking up for $50 or less.

I have lower end equipment, true, but it is above minimum specs required for the game and I have less than 60 FPS with all settings to low. And if it rains....forget it. Some tracks are better than others and if the frameraate was consistent even being less than 60 i would be happy. It simply is not very optimized for most if not any computer. So with all the beautiful graphics and they really are, if you cant play it at a consistent FPS it is not worth the money. And as I have said before the way the studio head belittles his customers and the banning of any one who dare point out a legitimate bug is banned and ostracized i would not recommend supporting this studio in this game or any other that has the SMS and WMD logo.\n\nEDIT: I have recently majorly upgraded my equipment, 16GB DDR4 2133MhZ RAM: Zotac GTX970 Graphics Card; icore 5 6500 3.2Ghz 3.6 Turbo Processor; Its a beast now, and I still wouldnt recommend this title becuse of the poor treatment of customers and players who are still upset from the empty promises that have not been fulfilled and the poor A.I. and many other problems that still plague this title. I will admit, it is beautiful and really could be a must have tiutle, but , its not at this juncture and dont think it will ever be. I think they have pretty much given up on any more "fixing" of the game and the fanboys will say they still have a large team dedicated to this title.

Menus presented in a decent fashion as well.\n\n+ Online community is good, good online integration\n\n+ Physics model compared to GA is much better, physical modelling of tires and contact forces, cars handle very well really adds depth, tire scrubbing if turning in too fast, loss of traction, cars suspension bottoming out, tire temperatures and effects, fuel weight effects, many nuances are shown for each car, cars look great in replays and adds a level of detail in car handling not present in many games, really cool!\n\n+ Audio [edited after 2.0] Car engine sounds are great and diverse, environmental sounds are too loud, typically hearing crowd sounds over tire sounds is very problematic. After 2.0 tire sounds are much better to hear but still difficult to pick out over the din of the crowd, still wishing tire sounds and states were better transmitted through audio as it helps to get a feel for the car. Loss of traction sounds, brake lockup sounds and other sounds are more noticeable now post 2.0 which is a lot better than before.\n\n+ Offline is extensive regards career mode, nice offline practice and quick race functionality\n\n+ Car selection is amazing, DLC are cheap, all have great interiors and outstanding 3d models and textures, repaints available for each car are amazing and look amazing.\n\n+ On a 4770 + nv 760, with some Ultra settings but no [ott] particle effects I am getting 100fps + offline, dipping to well above 60 in online with many cars, I would say it is well optimized even more of a shame they never fit in split screen as it seems reasonable spec computers can get good framerates.\n\n+ Good menus for fiddling with controls, defaults for many peripherals\n\n***************************\n\nEDITED After 2.0 (removed rant and recondensed with more positive outlook after recent changes);\n\nPrior to 2.0 and as a new user coming from GA to Project Cars with the G-27 I had a lot of trouble getting the force feedback to a reasonable state which made left me very sour.\n\nAs a more experienced player now finally getting a better ffb experience through my own tweaking and understanding the numerous parameters I have removed the rant with my new outlook, however as a new player even into 2.0 there are many frustrations with ffb and feel of the game through this popular wheel which I will add a condensed rant;\n\n- Default FFB settings as of 2.0 produced endless amounts of "clipping" on G-27 resulting in terrible feel through wheel feel and can really offput you getting into the game further.\n\n- Default Car setup page FFB effects are in my opinion terrible for new users, many of the default tire forces, for example lateral tire forces, obliterate subtle helpful force variations for example tire torque, and have to be radically tweaked to get better feel, I recommend only Mz and Sop Lateral forces on each car at 100, zero out all the other parameters or your wheel will get saturated.\n\n- FFB options are many falling into two primary filtering techniques, relative mode and soft clipping mode, by default the relative mode is used though I found this unsuitable with jumping between cars with wildly different tire forces (ex. FA to Road Car) resulting in clipping. Basically the over 20 sliders dealing with FFB are a headache for new users and require a lot of tinkering and exploring to make them feel better.\n\n[I think FFB feel is a subjective thing, if its of any help I used the soft clipping settings of; SCH2,SCF0,RelSettings All 0, Deadzone 0 Deadzone Falloff 0.05, TF 100, Knee settings of position 70 and strength 30. Though these are ok for me as of patch 2.0 subsequent patches may alter tire forces and render these useless!] [These are also in conjuction with default car ffb strength and only 100 Mz and 100 Sop Scale + 100 Sop Lateral, too many other car ffb forces here I find washes out much detail]\n\n[I even ended up charting my own G27 force linearity, or so called linearity, it has a very linear response at ~70% force upwards at a logitech profiler strength of 106 (I found this the most linear response strength) Below this its all over the place with higher force output than input, I used a knee reduction of strength of 30% at the 70% mark to match aprox my own wheel and it feels ok, different profiler strengths produce much different outputs, the default 100 produces some odd dips and rises as well. Not to mention the force deadzone, though this can be treated with increasing the force strength, more strength less deadzone, 106 is not as much deadzone reduction as higher but has best linearity]\n\n- Learning about ffb effects and interactions as a new user is as you can believe a bit of a bore lol! Once you are past the hump the game is good and the ffb is good too, though the game at default makes too high a demand of a new user with a G27 (and other wheels?) to get good force feedback across different cars without asking for a ******* degree in tweaking :(\n\nRant over but better than before!\n\n**********************************************\n\nTLDR Version;\n\n+Game is the best racing game I have ever played, It is the best racing game in existence.\n\n- Users with a G27 will need to be patient to get the game ffb working, keep at it, hoping much better default ffb setups will come in future along with much better car default ffb effects as well.\n\n*********************","June 29, 2015","true","116.6"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

I did have to upgrade from my old GTX 760 to a GTX 970 in order to play this on mostly high and ultra settings, but for the visuals this game provides it was well worth it. Feedback while driving is good, the amount of detail put into each and every car, track, and the environment is fantastic. Also owning Asseto Corsa, I would recommend this game over AC any day of the week. In Project Cars, the menu system is much better laid out, it loads faster, and is far more polished. My only complaint is that I wish it had more cars - but I'm sure they will add some in the future. I'm getting a Logitech G27 this weekend and will likely report back with an update on how well it works with that as I've just been using a controller thus far. So far, I am much more pleased with this over Asseto Corsa (which is okay in its own right, as well).\n\nTo those of you comparing this to iRacing, I think you're trying to compare apples to oranges. I've always known and been told that iRacing is more of a legit racing simulator, and know several semi-pro drivers that actually used that game to learn some skills on. I honestly wouldn't put Project Cars or Asseto Corsa into that same category at all - they are likie Forza; a racing 'simulator' for those who really enjoy driving games. Games. I just believe this is one of the most well done racing sim games for the PC available to date.\n\nSo far, I haven't noticed any of the bugs that other users have mentioned, but I haven't tried playing online yet. Gameplay has been smooth and predictable without major issues.","June 4, 2015","true","11.6"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","11","20","0","0"

It's only worthwhile playing with other people.\n\nThe amount of vehicles, currently available, is not that good.  Most groups/classes, only have 1-3 vehicles to choose from. (unless you like Formula/open wheel)  They also promise "Each month, Project CARS players will also receive a free car. We started with a bang in May with the $3.4m hero car from the movie Furious 7 - the Lykan Hypersport - and players can expect delivery of the next very soon..."  Seeing as it's now July, we're still waiting on the 2nd & 3rd free car... (Edit 10-16-15: 4th free car has been added.  We're a few months after release now, & unless you're buying up all the DLC, there aren't many choices for cars.  If you own all of the DLC, the car choices are much better now.)\n\nThe amount of tracks, currently available, is average.  One would expect a lot more tracks than what they have now.  Most tracks, currently available, are variations of each other.  They boast a whopping 110 courses, when in actual fact, there are only 30 actual tracks, which they call locations, with most having 4+ different layout variations.  http://www.projectcarsgame.com/locations.html\n\nThe graphics are above average (I have no issues with an AMD setup, FX6350, R9 280X, with 16GB RAM).  Nothing like what you see in the media releases though.\n\nThe realism is, well, there is none.  This is an arcade racing game allowing tuning of many parts of the vehicle.  Yes, each change will alter what the vehicle does, but, the "simulation" side of things is an illusion.  There are too many unrealistic features for some of these cars that, no matter what you alter in settings, it will never feel like you're actually driving it.\n\nThe career mode is a waste of time, literally a waste of time.  There's no reason to even do the career mode.  No story.  You don't unlock anything.  You don't get special licenses to do special races.  The AI is not that good.  If anything, the career mode is for people without an internet connection (I.E. PS4 players).  I think that's the only reason it's there.\n\nThe online mode only searches games within your Steam Download Region, which can only be changed manually.  (This has now been fixed.  Well done WMD.)\n\nControls are not controller friendly, no sensitivity options for throttle, brake or steering.  It's either 0% or 100%, nothing in between.  (Steering is now a bit more forgiving with a joystick/controller.  Throttle/brake, are still 0% or 100%.)\n\nThis game is NOT worth the money they're asking.  Even half price is still too much!  60-70% off and you've got yourself a game that is worth buying & playing.  Perhaps once they start adding more vehicles, needs about 10x more, it MIGHT be worth buying at its current price.\n\nThis is an Early Access game at best!\n\nEdit 7-19-15:\nI will say that with the past couple updates, they have managed to fix a few bugs & create a better experience when playing.  Although, it was at the expense of new bugs & new penalties that may alter your gaming experience.  Also, still waiting on these new cars that were promised.

Yes that's right its a sim.  Ignore everyone else who says it isn't.  Get yourself a wheel, turn off all the assists and drive round Spa in the Wet....yep told you.  The game does have issues (what new game doesn't nowadays), sad but true.  There has already been a patch on PC with more to come no doubt.\n\nYou will have to spend some time setting up the FFB if you have a wheel, I use the G27.  I'm on the PC and I haven't played with a pad so I can't comment on that, I can imagine the karts would be tricky with a pad but with a wheel they are crazy fun!  The actual driving part of this game which is surely the main bit is absolutely phenomenal!  One of the best interpretations of road racing I have played on PC period.  There are a large selection of cars all exquisitely modelled and they sound great too.  You don't have to unlock anything, it's all there at the beginning which is a refreshing change in my opinion.\n\nSo like I said once you setup the feedback and dial in some settings the game comes alive.  If you expect to just jump straight in and expect to make competitive laps you will fail.  There is a learning curve but that's how I like it.  What you waiting for?

The front end menus look slick and are very easy and smooth to navigate! There's a great selection of tracks and a decent selection of cars. This definitely isn't the car collecting game though as you won't find nearly as many cars as Gran Turismo, but every car that is relevant to racing is basically here (Kart, Touring, Rally, F1, Nascar, All open Wheel Racers etc. etc....)

The front end menus look slick and are very easy and smooth to navigate! There's a great selection of tracks and a decent selection of cars. This definitely isn't the car collecting game though as you won't find nearly as many cars as Gran Turismo, but every car that is relevant to racing is basically here (Kart, Touring, Rally, F1, Nascar, All open Wheel Racers etc. etc....) I am playing the game on windows 7 64 bit, with an i3 3220, Nvidia GTX 650ti and 16 GB of ram and my Resolution is set at 1080P, Textures are set to high, Car detail is high and everything else is on medium, I've disabled vsync and I have anti aliasing enabled (nothing crazy just minimal) and I also have a texture filter on. With Those settings and Specs I've never been lower than 53 FPS in-game and my HIgh side is around 85 FPS and my Average is about 74 FPS. Considering That I don't have a true quad core and I paid 150 for my card over a year ago I would say that is really and it actually exceeded my expectations. The last thing I want to mention is that my on;line experiennce has been perfect as well, its very easy to create/invite/join games and I* haven't been plagued by any lag whatsoever! Awesome Game!!!!! I would definitely reccommend it to any fan of racing/driving games. MY score for this is a 9.3 out of 10 and if it had more cars and tracks and perhaps a bigger more expansive single player/career mode I would call it perfect :p","May 22, 2015","true","114.4"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","14","26","0","0"

But as soon as you begin your first race you will realize that there is something completly wrong with this game. i play with an xbox controller and sometimes the game ignores my inputs and refuses to make a turn so you have to put your stick back to the center and try to get repeat the input this is not a hardware problem i have tested this bug with 3 different controller one of them being a PS controller and they all encounter the same bug. Also sometimes the game will armwrestle the controls from you and force you to make a turn when you want to go steaight for some time. and then there is time... when i am playing the singel player time will begin to slow as i enter the begining of a turn and this effect has no duration bar or anything it is just like bam 50% time speed and bam back to normal, they could atleast give it a more fluid transition.

Now I know you here that phrase used all the time and trust me I get tired of hearing it too but trust me, this is unlike any racing game out there. The immersion is so incredible and the graphics are so good that (no joke) it actually looks like real life. I looked up Project CARS on google just to see some amazing screenshots and one of them was actually real life but for the first 10 to 15 secs I thought it was the game...\n\n-UI: The UI is very clean and crisp. Everything is easy to find and manage. Only gripe is that changing your liveries for cars requires you to go to your garage and change it from there instead of the quick car list. (Not a big deal but still worth mentioning). 10/10\n\n-Singleplayer: I haven't even started a career yet but I assume it's amazing. As for just random racing, it's amazing. You can add up to 55 cars (most I've seen at least) on the track at once which was at Le Mans and can also have multi class so you can simulate the 24 Hours of Le Mans or 24 Hours of Nurburgring. 9/10\n\n-AI: AI is a bit iffy. They are quite a challenge if you have it at 100 and do make mistakes on there own but seem to not even care your on the road. 7/10\n\n-Multiplayer: This is where I have spent the most time on, mainly cause it is actual people and I like that more. Everything runs smooth and the people for the most part are nice and aren't trolls/wreck everything. Getting together with your buddies is a breeze. This is by far my favorite part of the game. 10/10\n\nBugs/Crashes: The only crash I have experienced was on Spa Francorchamps and my screen froze but the audio continued. I had to CTRL+ALT+DEL to close it which kinda sucked but over all that is nothing compared to all the fun I have had.\n\nBasic Specs of my Setup: NVIDIA GTX 970 (EVGA)\n\ni5 4590\n\n8gb RAM","May 21, 2015","true","53.1"," 17 of 32 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","17","32","0","0"

In an attempt to do everything, the only thing they have gotten correct are the graphics (for nvidia). The rest of the game feels like it is a beta release. The fanboy steam community jerk off going on over this game must consist of console gamers. No one should be using the word "sim" to describe this.\n\nOh yes it looks phenomenal if you have an nvidia card, but anyone who thinks these cars handle correctly and that the force feedback feels realistic obviously hasn't driven real cars before, or real sims for that matter. Cars don't spin just because you let off of the throttle before you even turn the wheel. The rubber band AI drive like teenagers who just got their license and can get away with antics like cutting corners bouncing their way through the grass. Damage is a joke other than cosmetic, you can plow head first into a wall and back up and continue like nothing happened. You can even shift without the clutch all through the RPM range without consequence on stick shift vehicles.The sounds are even a little off, and some (tire squeal for instance) are just straight up unrealistic. I mean judging by sound alone you can't tell if your brakes are squealing or your tires have locked up.\n\nIf you love games like Gran Turismo and Forza, you are new to PC racing with a FF wheel (and blissfully ignorant), or you just want a racing game that looks great on your new monitor then this is for you. But if you want a simulation, know how driving a car should feel, have a triple screen setup, oculus rift, or an AMD card - STAY AWAY. Buy Assetto Corsa instead and save some cash.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dangerhesh/recommended/234630/","dangerhesh","Dacia Sandero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dangerhesh/","280 products in account","I'll share my somewhat unique experience with this game, although perhaps not exactly a game review.  Shortly before purchasing Project Cars I became a fan of the show Top Gear.  Before watching the show, I had no interest in cars whatsoever.  Over the course of a few months and 21 series of Top Gear I developed a taste for cars and was learning the basics of racing terminology and mechanics.\n\nTop Gear introduced me to the idea of track days.  I researched them and found at there are events every weekend where I live in Southern California.  I signed up for one at random and starting researching the track.  Shortly, I realized I had signed up to go to Willow Springs, which of course is in Project Cars.  I did over 250 laps in Project Cars on Willow Springs in the classic Ford Escort before I went and did my track day there.  For those interested, I drove my land yacht Kia Amanti at the track haha.\n\nProject Cars was an OUTSTANDING preparatory tool for me.  As a novice to track days I was required to attend some short classes before we started and after each session.   The instructors would ask us about the turns, the straights, how our different types of passing were going, and so forth.  I restrained my arrogance verbally but could not help thinking in my head that I was miles ahead of my peers.  The teacher would explain what an apex was and use turn 9 as an example.  And I would listen thinking "I already know where the apex is on that turn, I also know that the track dips just before the apex, I have decent idea of the speed I can take the corner at thanks to the accuracy of PCars and the similarities of my car to the Ford Escort.  I knew every turn.  Their apexes and exits.  I knew the race line.  I knew where the pits where.  And I also knew my limitations.  I knew the dangers of turn 1 and how likely I was to go off.  I knew that I could stay flat out through turn 2 and that I had to find the apex out of the passenger side window.   My first track was one of the most fun days of my life despite being in a terrible car.  And I have no doubt that my experience was deeply enhanced by my preparation in Project Cars.\n\nOnly flaw with Project Cars - No Top Gear test track in the game.  Make it a DLC.  Someone make a mod.  Something.  I wanna drive that track soooooooooooooooooo bad.\n\ntl:dr Project Cars unquestionably made me very well prepared for my first track day in real life and has helped to further my enthusiasm for cars.

This is what everyone who spent hours on end in forza or gran turismo racing to get that .001 of a second wanted. I gave it a 9, because known of this game for about 5-8 years hype builds up so much in those years. It is better than I could expect. The twinkies (horizontal bumps) at lemans that launch you into the air don't. People have been saying that there is no force feedback while using a wheel... not true, I have a G27 wheel and racing a F1 around nur you feel more than you could imagine from looking at the track. This is a sim, casual weekend racers beware! This game is really everything we wanted from forza and GT, Rain, Night racing, lights, physics, absolute carnage! True Aerodynamics, Tyre wear and fuel on or off are seperate! Endurance racing, parts will fail and break like they actually do IRL! This game is really out standing! It looks amazing I don't have it turned up to ultra yet because I only have a GTX 650Ti :(. All in all this game is what we asked and begged for for years and years never to get it.

Moreover the developers actively support the game searching for interesting content like Audi 90 IMSA GTO or McLaren F1 GTR Longtail and include it to the game.

In my old review I thought the performance issues were from the game, when it was really my hard disk giving up the ghost. In any case, here is what I think about the game:\n\nPROS:\n- The game is beautiful, and the locations look faithfully rendered. I've actually been to both Laguna Seca and the northern parts of CA Route 1, and I can say that they really spent some time on getting details right, although I feel as though some of the locations are holdovers from NFS Shift and Shift 2, like the Nordschliefe.\n\n-The Cars look good and perform well, and they sound pretty faithful. Although, I feel a lot of the cars they are releasing for DLC should have been included from the beginning instead of being part of specialized packs.\n\nCONS:\n- There are a few bugs. Every once in a while, the car decides that it want's to do it's own thing and run into a wall when I gently nudge the joystick (I bet that doesn't happen on a wheel). Other times, I've run into an invisible wall, or clipped something invisible. That doesn't happen often though.\n\n- The handling model still needs some work. Sometimes the cars feels like they're breaking traction and they're skating around, making them a little more difficult to control. Other times, they aren't responsive until you turn too much and then end up backwards and facing the rest of the pack. You'll need to tweak the controls to your liking, but there is still that level of unpredictability.\n\n- The DLC packs. I understand that this is a way to keep interest in a game and make more revenue, but when the game was first released, the car list made me go "meh". There wan't really any cars that I was itching to drive except for a handful, since a lot of racing games have the same cars. They should have had the cars from some of the DLC packs from the beginning, instead of trotting them out pack by pack. Also, for such an anglo-centric game why are there no TVRs? I would love to drive a faithfully rendered Tuscan Speed 6. Or a Cerbera Speed 12.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nProject Cars is exactly what it says on the box...er..Store Page. It's a graphical powerhouse of a racing sim aimed at people who want to have faithfully rendered cars and tracks. It's a game about the cars, not necessarily about the racing I feel. Even though they billed it as the next major racing sim, when you make an achivement in the game, it doesn't really feel like an achievement. This is probably because all of the cars are unlocked in the very beginning, meaning that you don't unlock car classes the farther you go in your career. I feel as though thats a very important thing to have, as now there's no real incentive to complete the career mode.\n\nInstead, I end up spending most of my time on my home tracks (Laguna Seca and CA Route 1) with some of my favorite cars in single races or time trials. In that case, this game is closer to the Test Drive series of games than it is a full on racing sim.\n\nStill, taking a McLaren on the Coastal Highway isn't a bad thing at all.","June 4","true","88.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's much better than it was on initial release, excellent feel, good selection of cars and better selection of tracks.

Stability under Win10 is a bit rough sometimes and generally speaking there are issues with getting the game running in full screen (like now with the latest Oculus related update). The main point is that playing the actual game is really good.

I know was in on it at the start. Beta test this game for 3 years. They SMS had great ideas not sure what happen. But some where down the line it didn't happen. After 5 years of working on this racing game its still not done. Menu's still lock down , Kart tracks are open for racing only no pratice can not put a set on have to run the one it came with. When you cut track they turn you  power off for 5 sec right in front of other cars . Why not a drive threw . SMS wanted to make it so we could swap drivers (not working). Set up menu is a mess can only save one set up per car per track. Can not send set ups to friends . There are all kinds of bugs in the game there is a bad force feed back issue with g-27 if you exit on the track and then go back out the wheel will pull to the right. If you want to run more then one class of cars there is no way to pick what class of cars run . When you open it up to all cars on the start of race you have all type of claasses of cars all over the grid. Maybe a filter sytem to allow us to pick what class runs. Beside not finishing the game. Why not sure but I wish it would get done because it could be best racing game out there.","April 13","true","336.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It is the first driving sim I've ever played, and I can tell this is something I will be doing for a long time. I bough a used Logitech Driving Force GT steering wheel, and it works great with the game. The car selection is awesome. Carts to F1, amazing road cars, GT cars, and classic cars. The tracks are fantastic. I have a lot of fun just doing time trials in various cars to see how I stand up against other people on the Nurburgring Nordschleife. Career mode is a lot of fun, you can start in whatever driving discipline you want, then at the end of the season decide if you want to move up, or stay the same. The AI is really good. I like being able to change their skill level so easily. I can get pole position at AI 70 most of the time now. The tuning options for each vehicle are fantastic. It is definitely difficult to get the hang of tuning, and find good set ups, but there is plenty of help online. Overall I highly recommend this game to anyone who has an interest in driving sims.","April 13","true","66.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Unfortunately, I am never giving that secret out because it would just help the cheaters and it's unfortunate for any legitimate player that wants to play this game because unlike me, they will have to deal with them.\n\n-Lots of steering wheel users do have problems.\n-They allow keyboard players. I mean come on. It's a racing game, at least use a controller. I guess the reason they want to allow keyboard users is because it's easier for them to use their cheats because they can just bind the super brakes and acceleration cheats to where they need them.\n-Did I mention that cheaters don't even have to worry about VAC? So if your one of those losers that got banned from counterstrike because you're to stupid to play fair. Get Project Cars and you will never get banned because VAC is a joke.\n-The system for using the PIT is horribly done.

I don't regret choosing it for my first PC racing game. In career mode I will say though that Kart One racing is VERY frustrating. The handling of the kart is just... stupid. Super Kart (the next tier) is much better, though it can feel unstable at high speeds. Rookie Formula is where things get pretty good. Throughout the game, the AI can be... a little inconsiderate. The moment I go off the track and into the grass, it's as if I'm not there to them. You can imagine what happens when I try to merge back onto the track. At the moment there are a couple bugs, one being that the racing guide line doesn't display the color green sometimes and only displays yellow and red. This can be a pain if I'm new to a track and don't have an idea of proper speed in certain spots yet. This is a rare bug mind you. I also think the game has an oversight in fuel load calculations. A max fuel load in Formula A (only time I noticed it) didn't provide me enough fuel to run a full length race, and in Formula A refueling during the race isn't available. Either I did something wrong with my tuning setup or it's an oversight and needs to be fixed, otherwise I'm stuck running 50% length races. All in all, the game is great. Lots of pros to outweight the few cons. If you have a racing wheel or plan on getting one, you should consider getting this game. It's a good deal for the price.","May 25","true","24.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

The game is playable as long as I do my car setups in free practice sessions outside of the career mode.  Its not ideal, but there is no denying the gameplay is excellent and graphics are beautiful; recent bug fixes have improved performance in general.\n\n**edit 6-12-15**\npatch 1.4 still does not resolve the car setup problems.  Steam cloud sync is also an option available but "not implemented, most devs stopping using it because it caused game crashes".\n\n**edit** a major patch (1.4) has been announced to address many of the bugs, however no release date has been announced as of today (6/10/15)\n\nI currently can't recommend this game.  If slightly mad studios would release some bug fixes, I might change my mind.  It seems they're more concerned with fixing bugs on XBOX.\n\nI waited for pCars to come out for a year...It's been out for a month and I haven't played it since the first week of release because of game breaking bugs that I do not have the time to work around.  The biggest one being that the car setup resets itself every time you come into the pits during practice.  This means that to tune your car, you have to write down every change you made and then redo them all to make a simple tweak to the setup. You'll also have to redo them for every session (qual and race).\n\nI also run an AMD R9  290 which was a big investment a year ago and it struggles with the high settings to keep 60fps due to the lack of AMD support (which they claim is an AMD driver issue, funny I don't have any other games affected by this issue that weren't poorly designed in the first place).\n\npCars was plagued by delays to release a "more polished version" but I think it was still premature.

I like that race weekend are properly simulated, but you can still individually pick the length of the race in percentages of the real life length. I like that the pit engineer actually gives relevant information for the race and for a slightly novice driver like me it's really helpful, not to mention it's pretty cool to have Ben Collins as the voice. The main downsides of the career so far have been lack of podium animations and some extra atmospherics stuff as well as partly missing pit animations, but luckily those are coming soon with a patch.\n\nThe physics of the game feel very, very realistic too and you really have to manage your steering, your gas, your weight transfers, your tire temperatures and other. At the same time it doesn't feel alienating hard; you can pick up a car and drive it, but to truly compete you need a bit of practice with each car. The simulated weather conditions bring life to the racing as changing temperatures affect the grip, rain can wary from slight dribble to proper storms and you have to go change your tires. Proper 24h racing on all tracks is absolutely amazing as well and that combined with the realistic tracks makes the racing so amazing. Each car feels unique and you have to learn and tune the charasteristic to your taste. Only a few cars feel a slightly off and the default settings are very "safe" for new drivers, but overall the physics are sublime (apart from collisions, which don't feel so good all the time).\n\nIt also looks stunning on my computer with a i920 and 280X, even though some AMD drivers issues haven't been fixed yet the performance is pretty good too.

Cars also look very good and detailed, though the car roster could certainly use some more cars, but right now the game offers such a huge variety of different motorsports it's obvious some concessions had to be made to achieve the vision of having so many racing series.\n\nSo overall, I can't help but to recommend this to anyone who loves cars and motorsports.

It's so easy to pass them...but beware the next corner because you will be taken out if you don't have at least a 1 second lead.\n\nI race offline for fun so I race AI all the time.  Game Stock Car Edition has great AI.  A/C lesser so.  But these AI are the worst for a newer game.  The old Simbin games are better, and they were bad to begin with.\n\nI still recommend the game, if only for the great graphics, and good car and track selection.  But I wish there was a undecided option.","October 10, 2015","true","207.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I definitely recommend it.  The graphics are absolutely stunning.  However, if you like racing games like Forza where you can upgrade various parts of your cars, and where you can buy the cars you use in "Career" mode, this may not be the game for you.  I really did like that part of Forza, and Project CARS doesn't have it.  It is, regardless, an excellent game.","October 10, 2015","true","20.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I have hundreds of hours logged playing gran turismo and many other racing games and so far, this is my favorite. The two things I wish it had are a wider array of production cars so I could drive my own car or something like it and performance upgrades on those cars. Thats one of my favorite parts of gran turismo that this game doesnt have. However, the things this game does, it does well. I bought iRacing and it is a good game but I like this better. I would much rather pay the 1 time price of this game than all the nickle and dime stuff that iRacing pulls. Not to mention this game loads much faster and doesnt have the stupid browser based login. The saddest thing of all, iRacing was released in 2008 where as this game was released in 2015.

This is my first steam review ever so pardon me if it's not that helpful\n\nI bought this game in the Steam sale, and let me tell ya, it's fun. When you start.\n\nThe game feels... weird. When you start out, with the go-karts, the game is great. Superkarts was great fun for me and i was getting progessively better as I learned what everything does and learned how to tune, what to tune and why.\n\nAt this point I was having a lot of fun with the game, but as the game progressed, as tracks got more complex, you could start to see the cracks show up with bumps in the road that literally sent the car flying, AI cutting corners like it's nothing (and not getting punished by it), crashing into you when you're CLEARLY not doing anything wrong (following a racing line, and doing everything perfect), etc.\n\nWhen I left karting, I left this game. I played a couple of seasons of Karts, and won the second one when I already knew the tracks and was used to the car. I moved forward, only to see that the cracks that were simply annoying in Karting were gigantic and horrible in other disciplines. From being unable to heat up your wheels, to the AI straight up ramming you, to the AI not being affected by tyre wear or weather conditions, to tracks being bumpy where they're not supposed to, and oh so many more issues.\n\nI'll admit, I had my fun with the game. Karting was extremely fun and challenging and I was playing in the hardest difficulty and winning but not by too much. But then the cracks start to show and things start to get weird and you just get frustrated with the game and stop playing it.\n\nIf you can get this game for less than 20 of your currency (dollars, euros, pounds), it is worth some 20h of playtime and you can judge yourself if that's worth it for you or not. But for the full price, the game is not worth it as you will not put enough hours into it to make it "cheap" so to say. Unless you wanna be a kart racer for the rest of your life.","January 23","false","64.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I play using the Logitech G27 racing wheel and I find that it works very well with Project Cars. The graphics are great and the sounds are as well. The only drawback in my opinion is the car selection. I love racing the GT cars and whatnot but I would love to see a large road car pack to be released, even if it cost a fair bit. I came from Forza 4 which had many road cars and It was a lot of fun to challenge your friends in slower cars, especially the ones you could hope to own, and I think that this aspect would be even better on this game. Overall this game is a huge jump from forza and definitely on the same level if not better than Assetto Corsa.","December 26, 2015","true","34.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The visuals and sound is also brilliant.  Very nice damage model.\n\nThe less than good:  The physics doesnt feel right for something that is supposed to be more sim orientated that an arcade game.  Dont get me wrong, this is no need for speed but somehow it feels like its not entirely there.  I have more fear of corners in GRID than in Project cars.  It just takes so much to unsettle a car but when that happens you have no idea that you are on the edge until you loose it and correcting the car is impossible as it feels like you are skidding on ice.  Getting  the force feedback on my wheel (G27) dialed in properly was an absolute nightmare and still it is severely lacking.\nThe lack of proper feedback through the wheel is terrible and it robs you of so much.  This is probably my single biggest issue as it makes it very difficult to figure out how close you are taking the car to the edge.\nIn Assetto Corsa I can feel so much more via the wheel and that title really lets you know what is happening with the car.  I am hoping that I will be able to work around this when I have Simvibe set up...but ultimately some fixingfrom the developer would be required.\n\nPerformance wise, this is definitely a title that can bring your rig to its knees.  I run an i72600K (4.4Ghz), 16GB RAM and a GTX980 SLI setup and had to fiddle to get it to feel smooth (even at a framerate of above 100fps there seems to be lag with all settings on max).  Dropping the motion blur as well as the AA settings, fixed this quite nicely and the game is definitely not much worse off eye candy wise.\n\nMy verdict at this point is that there is still a lot of work to be done and some refinement is needed.  If you are looking for the best looking racing "sim" around, this is it.\nTo those of you who are used to Assetto Corsa, note that this will probably not draw you away from your AC fix, even when Kunos does an update and breaks stuff.  Project Cars is beautiful but does not rival AC for feel or realism.\n\n\nUpdate (2015/06/30):  After spendig quite some time with this, I can honestly say that this game is sh*t.  It looks great but the physics and AI suck.  Cars dont get unsettled when you try to do so but the handling goes for a ball of cr@p FOR NO APPARENT REASON!!!  AI is dumb as SH!T as well.  especially in wet races.  So if you fancy a demolition derby game, this will knock your socks off.  Unless they fix the issues properly regarding the FFB and physics I will most likely end up not playing it anymore...  Simvibe helps with adding some feedback but you can only do so much with a flawed physics engine, dumbass AI and poor FFB.\n\nTHIS IS RUBBISH...GIVE IT A PASS.  DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!!!\n\nAs of Patch 9.0:\n\nThe game has improved somewhat although the issues with FFB, AI and physics still persist.  SMS seem to be fixing some things with every patch but glaring omissions like triple screen support has been dropped altogether with focus being more on DLC.  Said DLC for the most part is not bad but it would be nice if the core issues with the game were fixed in full.\nUnfortunately the physics and handling of the cars still feels somewhat suspect.\nFps also seems to be inconsistent.  When i fire it up, it may run at 52fps or double that.  Seems like the luck of the draw.\nI keep hoping that PCars will become what it said on the box...  Sadly 9 patches down it still does not exactly cut it and with PCars2 on its way, i wonder if there will be another 9 patches deployed to fix things before no 2 is all the rage and this one is left by the wayside.\nNeedless to say I will most likely not support SMS in their new endeavors.\nPCars is no longer a flaming ball of crap...but a smoldering ball of crap is not a much better experience in the end.  It still stinks, just not as bad.","May 8, 2015","false","96.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

The in depth career mode is a great way to actually feel as though there is a point to continue racing by giving you that ability to move up by your own success.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/donohand88/recommended/234630/","donohand88","Hopeless","http://steamcommunity.com/id/donohand88/","279 products in account","I love racing games and Project CARS is the pinnacle of the genre.  It's been a long time coming and has actually drawn me away from Assetto Corsa.  This game is for sim lovers however does have many options to make it more accessible to the more casual gamer.  Normally, sim games are not your first idea of fun however playing it multiplayer with some other great gamers I know, it can turn out to be a great experience comparable to many other games out there.\n\nThe main selling point for CARS (other than the racing experience) was the graphics.  They are beautiful even when you are not running everything maxed out.  Thankfully, SlightlyMad has left many options to tweak the visual appearance to suit your own preferences.  Don't like JJ Abrams  lens flare?  Yeah you can disable it or go through and select the type you like.\n\nThe attention to detail is quite impressive.  The first time you get to race in a BAC Mono is an impressive.  The car model shows every curve and line from suspension arms to the exhaust in so much detail that you sometimes forget that you are looking at a game.\n\nProject CARS does what it set out to do really well.  I just can't help but compare it to SlightlyMad's previous outing in NFS Shift 2.  I liked the career element in NFS where there was more incentive to winning than just the glory.  Also the ability to make the cars your own I think is something that could have made the game feel like you are not so much going through the motions.  I can understand why the devs went this way but it is a nagging little detail that plays in back of my mind.\n\nOverall, CARS is a great game.  It is the closest thing to Gran Turismo that us PC gamers have.  It is visually stunning and the gameplay is rewarding.  It will continue to get better as the devs have put already a lot of time into it and will continue to do so for a while.  Oh, and I suggest that dropping yourself into a multiplayer lobby and hoping for the best is probably a bad idea.  Build some hours up on track as this game will really test your ability.","May 24, 2015","true","204.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

And yet, this game runs FINE. It runs smoothly, looks good, and I have no crashes.\n\nSecond: It's a great racing sim. Is it the most realistic? Maybe, maybe not. But for all that it gives you, it's realistic enough. The cars all feel different and great to drive.\n\nI will say that the AI needs a bit of work. There is a bug, which the dev is fixing, that makes the AI drive too fast (comparitively) in the rain. There is a difficulty slider for the AI, and it does work. At 50%, the AI will be too easy, but turn it up and you'll be losing races soon enough.\n\nGreat game, best racing sim I've played.

I love it ! ... Mind you there is just one thing i would like to see added ,, the ability to change your view whilst in-car like assetto corsa - Pcars only allows seat position up/down fwd/bkwd . I would like to be able to move the view left/right to set it better on my tri-monitor setup to center it better , no biggie but AC has it 100x better for viewing position . As for people with AMD GPU's saying they're having issues is (in my opinion) just on their end , in my experience it is usually a cheapo card ie: saphire or some generic money saving card . I have  yet to have any problems or indications that the card is an issue. I have an MSI Radeon R9 280x 6gb Gaming card . The game runs perfectly on ultra and everything maxed out :) ...The one problem i do get and im assuming its something on my end is a memory allocation problem that causes game crash BUT only when using a certain track with certain weather settings .

I can happily say that this game feels different from them. While the current racing game market keeps shifting more and more towards the arcade style, Project CARS has delivered a true racing sim. It may have its issues and in my own opinion the physics while in karts is a bit screwy, but overall the game looks, feels, and sounds amazing. The in depth career mode is a great way to actually feel as though there is a point to continue racing by giving you that ability to move up by your own success. Unlike other games were you work though an event list or play a "career" were all you do is select a race and a car without any real reason, following a calendar and gaining invitationals again by succeeding in your current league keeps you engaged and gives you that want to just keep on going!","May 24, 2015","true","28.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I am more of an Assetto Corsa player and love that intense realism. I bought this game on a whim really not knowing what to expect, I was just hoping it wasn't going to be like Grid or Dirt, arcade stuff. All I wanted was something mostly realistic with good AI and a fun campaign, as that is lacking in Assetto.\n\nThe driving is smooth, and pretty comparable to Assetto but a lot easier to get the hang of. The cars don't feel as weighty, but the driving with the settings on Pro is similar enough. This game has nice features like overheating brakes, mechanical failure, pit strategy, damage. All of these feature seem to work and work well. I have driven several  40+ lap races and having little things like a wheel nut lost in pit or random suspension failure are exciting and fun (don't worry it's not often).\n\nThe AI is intense but good. They are a little stiff but I don't really know how they could be much better. They are fun to race. The one thing that’s troublesome is that when you race the AI you pick the difficulty before the race, which is good. I normally have them at about 80% strength and it’s a tough but good race. I win some, others I am in the pack somewhere. Still sometimes the strength is just horrible on certain maps. 80% will become more like 200% and they will drive the map like the rules of physics don't apply to them. I wish there were a standard for the percents. I don't expect to drive every map well and I don't expect to have to turn the AI down to 30% on one race in a series because they are dirty cheaters.\n\nThe campaign isn't all that great you don't really get to feel like a race car driver and talk with your engineer, team or anyone. It's good enough though and it's fun to have the events focused and to be the champ in all the classes.\n\nOne of the things I complained about in my initial review was that the physics from the carts where a bit ridicules. They seemed to fix all the wonky physics. Still on the technical side the game can be a bit…. troublesome. I can't host multiplayer games because sometimes the G27 just won't even work once the map loads in. I had a problem with the grass textures filling my screen nearly every other time I loaded a map. The grass thing was an easy fix, but the wheel problem is one that started with the last patch.\n\nMultiplayer is GREAT. It's easy to get in a game or to host one. All the other random players I have played with have been really good people and I have super slow internet (1.5 mbps) and have had no issues with latency.\n\nI have to say I'm finding the game really worth the money and it fits into a fun place that is separate from Assetto and other racing simulators I have played. It’s a great game and I really enjoy it. I have suggested tow others to buy it as well and they both love it.","May 7, 2015","true","110.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

If you overlook the load of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in online, this game as an overall package is amazing. I can't afford a decent wheel, but I'm using a DualShock4 (with InputMapper, therefore is recognized as a 360 pad) and the driving is still pretty satisfactory.

The deciding factor was the fact that the developer has pushed at least three patches since the game's release in May. According to some of the reviews, the newest patch has fixed many of the issues early negative reviews mentioned. This tells me that any remaining issues are likely to be addressed. Apparently there were some AMD issues early on which have been reportedly fixed. I haven't let a Radeon card touch any of my systems since it was still ATI, so I can't comment on that.\n\nThe game looks absolutely incredible. More importantly, the physics are just about perfect, with an edge over Assetto Corsa (especially in the tire temperature modeling). The AI is fine--some reviews mentioned the aggressive AI ramming players on higher settings, but I didn't see any of that in the latest version. AI cars are careful to get out of your way if you try to swerve into them on lower settings, but higher difficulty means they're less likely to give up their line. Even so, the only contact I had with AI cars was when I initiated it.\n\nAudio is great. No complaints.\n\nI didn't have a problem with a lack of a real career mode or unlocks, like some of the review sites did. There are several good arcade racers out there (Burnout series) to choose from if that's what you need, and several mediocre ones (Grid).\n\nThe only real downside for me is the lack of some content. I'd like to see how the game handles Mugello. And the missing Lamborghini license is killing me, although there are a large number of other cars in the game. I haven't seen Lamborghini in a good PC sim yet. It's also missing Ferrari, Chevy, and Porsche (RUF is here, but fairly limited). And there are clearly still a few bugs--I deliberately rammed a barrier to get a feel for damage modelling, saw a tire go flying off, then drove away with no effect. I did it again, the other tire flew off, and this time the car reacted like it was supposed to.\n\nI haven't tried multiplayer yet, so can't comment on how solid it is. I likely won't try until I get a better wheel and more practice on the PC. Negative reviews about multiplayer look like they're aimed at the other drivers, not the game itself.\n\nI bought the game on sale this morning for $30, and feel like I got my money's worth. If you're reading this review and it's full price, you might want to make sure some of the existing (minor?) bugs are ironed out or wait for a sale. If PCARS had a few more high-end car licenses I'd consider it worth the full price (and will end up buying DLC if they get the licenses I want).","September 13, 2015","true","1.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

I'm running an i7-4790K 4GHz, 16GB ram, GTX780, Window 7 64bit.  I'm playing with all visuals on ultra and maxed out and I have yet to see a single stutter.  Now the game.  Visuals are really nice, lighting, reflections, rain all very realistic.  I would be ok with a little more spray coming off the car in front during rain stints, seems the realism is lacking a little here.  I have played GT, Grid, Dirt, NFS and I feel Project Cars is a above all of these when it comes to car handling.  You have a lot of options in PC to personalize your game play and the challege level and I really like these options.  I was on the fence between PC and Assetto Corsa.  I really like games that lean more toward sims than arcade and I feel PC does lean this way.  I chose PC because it is a newer game and so I figured it would have more realistic graphics and from what I reaseached it leaned to the sim side.  I can't say if the graphics or game play is better than AC because I have never played AC.  The one BIG issue I have is with car damage.  I have my damage level in game set to "Full Damge" this should affect visual damge to the car and the performance.  If you slam into the walls enough you will eventually lose a hood or maybe break off a tire.  I intentionally slammed a wall head on during a race at 150mph.  I backed up took off and still won the race.  I looked at the outside view and all I had were a few scrathes on the front.  This part of the game is a joke.  There are no penalties for hitting the walls or other cars.  If this was real life at 150mph a wall would take you our of the race.  Minor contact with a wall or another car should at least leave you with some visual damage and maybe a slower or ill handling car at least.  If you are a player that doesn't like these effects then turn damage "off" or to "visual only" but for those of us that do want the full damge let us have it.  This is really my only beef with the game.  Fix this an you will have a great game on your hands.   Now don't get me wrong, it's hard for me to stop playing this game.  This is a solid racing game and it is a lot of fun to play.  I plan on playing this for a long time.  Just consider a patch to cause some more damge and penalize me for not racing like a real driver and I will be super stoked.  If you like racing games you can't go wrong with Project Cars, buy it now.","May 13, 2015","true","109.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

I do have to say I get some crashes on some online servers which I cannot explain, but nothing that really ruins the game.\n\nThe game has outstanding visuals/graphics and mind blowing sound. Could not have been better in my eyes, but that is just my taste. The Physics in this engine are also one of the best I have ever seen. Tyre wear and Track Evolution are so well implemented that it allmost seems real. You really have to monitor the temps on the track and the tyres to get the best grip and stability. also don't forget to check how much fuel you need.\nYou can turn all those things off and you will have a pretty easy racing game but... why would you? I'ts a racing sim and it's a lot of fun once you get to know the mechanics in the game.\n\nI do recomend playing this game with a steering wheel and not a controller. It's pretty obvious this game was designed with a steering wheel in mind as it is very difficult to control some harder cars with a controller.\n\nYou have a very large collection of cars to choose rom but I would have liked to see some more road cars than racing cars. That's something I really liked about the Forza series. This game also doesn't have customization that Forza has but you can tweak everything about your car.\n\nOveral I think this game is an amazing racing sim and if you enjoy racing sims in general you should definitely try this one out. If you like arcade racing more it's probably not for you. This is one of those games you have to know beforehand if you like hard en realistic racing games.","May 6","true","80.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

I was very skeptical and felt that the game was over hyped in the raceing sim community. I play on a dated laptop running with an old Nvidia 635m and use a gamepad. I was very surprised when I was acutally able to play this game at a decent frame rate (on very low settings), while on Assetto Corsa I can't get any reasonable frame rate. I was also very surprised to see that the factory gamepad setting were usable, I am constantly fiddleing with my settings on Assetto Corsa and they just never seem to be right. I am very pleased with the game for my setup.\n\nAs far as it being a sim goes the cars in general feel much easier to drive than Assetto Corsa. In PCars there have been several situation where I felt that I had more grip than I should (playing without any assists), but overall its very satisfying and never really gives me the feeling that I am cheating the laws of physics too much. A minor gripe I have is that some of the cars I found shared the same brake whine, it really bothered me when I was driving a super car and the brakes whined under minor load when a 40 year old cars brakes whined in the same situation ??? I really liked the selection of cars in this game, although I would LOVE to see more vintage F1 cars (Licenses I know).\n\nOverall if you can, buy both PCars and AC, if you're poor like me just buy this.","June 20, 2015","true","13.5"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

The idea of letting the Sim Racing Community help shape the development of this simulator is in my opinion what's missing from so many companies. The graphics are the best in the Class. And the physics engine is spot on in terms of speed. I haven't driven all the cars, but I could only find fault with three that I've tried. Most every car felt great and a few truly put me back in the cockpit of the real thing. I'm an open wheel fan at my core and have turned a few laps with the big boys, and prior to the release of Project CARS, I spent most of my sim time driving Code Masters F1. It was less than a year ago I converted one of my flight Simulators with a Logitech Driving Force GT and a copy of F1 2012. over the next nine months I've moved from F1 2012 to 2013 to 2014. Then I got caught up in all the hype about "The Crew", I bought a G27 Wheel and up graded my system. But "The Crew" was a big big let down. Then along comes talk about Project CARS, and I was hooked again. While waiting for its release I built my dream system at the cost of many thousands. Well Project CARS is here and it is truly amazing. So come on people, suit up and show up to Project CARS. I would have never believed I'd be posting a clip of me racing at Sears Point on Facebook and have so many people write me excited that I'm racing again after all these years and wanting to come watch. Some still think I'm kidding when I tell them it's a simulation.","June 17, 2015","true","166.1"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Playing with a wheel and pedals is the only way to go.  Realistic driving physics and some really great cars to choose from (although not a huge stable) make this game have lasting appeal.\n\nThe best thing about the game is the career mode.  Instead of playing as some kind of car collector like you do in GT or Forza, in this game you play as a racing driver; working your way from karting all the way up through the ranks.  It's very satisfying.\n\nWith all of its strengths this game has one major flaw that I have to point out.  The AI often acts as if you are not on the race track.  You will get slammed into and barged off the track.  There are also other strange AI behaviors like shortcutting the track that will leave you scratching your head.\n\nOverall if you want a realistic racing game with a fun career mode, this is the game for you.  Hopefully the AI will be improved over time.","June 13, 2015","true","40.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Many people on here who follow racing sims are saying its bad, but unlike them,     I´ve actually experienced cars just short of the caliber of GT3 cars, and I don{t think they understand just how solid these cars are. Games like AC over'portray body roll in order to please these people, but it{s to such an exten that they feel more soft they these cars really are (not to bash AC, but I do find this game more closely related, if not maybe just a tad too stiff on some of the lower level cars).\n+Graphics are probably by far the greatest selling point. I´m sorry if you have an AMD card, I heard its basically unplayable, but the game runs great for my Nvidia 860m and have virtually no lag even under extreme conditions (24 cars, rain, and max graphics)\n+AI is pretty rough. You have to be careful as they are extremely aggressive, but the game is still very playable even with them.\n\nComing from a Forza and GT background (this is my first PC sim) I very much enjoy this game and would highly recommend to anyone that loves racing.","June 11, 2015","true","39.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

You might want to wait a few months and keep an eye on the patch notes.\n- If you want to compete on the leaderboards, you have to do some off-piste and corner cutting (which has ruined a lot of the fun for me personally, as I just can't bring myself to cheat like that).\n\nYou should get it...\n- If you just enjoy racing and can look past the issues I mentioned above.\n- If you just want to drive a lot of fantastic cars from different eras on amazing tracks for the fun of it.\n\n\nPersonal experience:\nI'm so glad I bought it. For me it's worth every penny and I'm confident that most of the issues I have will be fixed over time. There are also a lot of DLC coming like the Indycar Series. They plan to keep updating and adding content for the next 2 years, so I see a lot of potential for Project CARS to become THE racing game for all platforms.

The graphics are slick. The different views are good, I especially like the helmet cam where most of the things out of focus are blurred until you look at them.\n\nShort Review: Unfinished buggy racing sim, yet the things that work, work very well. 8/10\n\nLong Review: Read below.\nPros\n------\nGameplay is pretty realistic.\nFFB is very good.\nEngine sounds are very realistic. In game music can be repetetive but you have the option of spotify or listen to your own music.\nIn game options are very in depth and you can tweak a lot of things.\nHandling of cars is decent and good you can turn assists on or off or naything in between.\nPlenty of cars to choose from in different classes.\nSingle player career is good.\nAI can be tweaked from 0-100. This should allow you to enjoy the race no matter what level you are.\nMultiplayer is packed full of online players and there are a lot of lobbies to join.\n\nCons\n-----\nFor a beginner, the in game options will be daunting but as you start playing it more, the options are more than welcome.\nThe game is very good in the parts that work, but its far from a finished game.\nA lot of bugs which Dev are aware of but are they fixing them in priority? Im not so sure.\nUI could be much improved. i.e. Tuning has 6 main sections but its very easy to miss the sub tabs for each section. Could use breadcrumbs to make it look more obvious. Took me ages to fin out how to change fuel load.\nFull controller support would make this game a much better experience. I find having to reach for my keyboard now and then. i.e. The exit game button is a X on the top right of the UI is crap. How hard would it be to have it as a button next to all the other options you can browse using joypad / wheel d pad?\nIf you have damage enabled and lose a wheel, you can pit and get a new wheel, however, you cannot see that wheel during gameplay or replay. Who tested this exactly? The car handle like it is in 4 wheels, the telelmetry shows the invisible wheel statisitcs, you just cannot see it. This is cosmetic and does not affect the handling of the car though. But it is little things like this that need to be fixed before fixing bugs regarding smoothness of the sun, moon and stars during replays. Who cares about that?\nTire wear: set it to 7x multiplier, yet there is no tire wear for you but it affects the AI. This bug should be fixed ASAP.\nOn leaving pit lane, you get a penalty for going off track when you clearly have not. Race breaker!\nUnexpected Error Trapped CTD every 20 mins. Fixed it by enabling K Boost on my 670.\nHundreds of small bugs I have noticed but hopefully in a years time, they will have ironed out most of the game breaking bugs.\n\nI will give it a 80 / 100 for now. Once the bugs are ironed out i may update my score.\n\np.s. I also have had Asseto Corsa since alpha and preferred it over PCars, but now although I play both, I prefer PCars.","June 11, 2015","true","62.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

I have seen a few reviews online and ran in to the usual "This game is bugged" stuff. I decided to buy it anyway and I'm glad i did. I ran out and also bought a Logitech G27 wheel, which i highly recommend to anyone who dosent have one already, The only downside I see to it is that there are a very limited amount of cars in the game and I know they did that to cash in on the DLC of cars. Thats one thing I hate about gaming nowadays, you cant have one game come out without having to pay for "Extra" content. The graphics in the game are stunning, especially racing in the rain for the first time I felt like i was truly there. The actual driving of the cars is a bit different and expect to do some extensive tuning to get them to handle the way you want, but then again isnt that why we all play Sim Racers. The online community is okay but nothing great. Just hope you dont get kicked off the track on the first turn.

The idea of letting the Sim Racing Community help shape the development of this simulator is in my opinion what's missing from so many companies. The graphics are the best in the Class. And the physics engine is spot on in terms of speed. I haven't driven all the cars, but I could only find fault with three that I've tried. Most every car felt great and a few truly put me back in the cockpit of the real thing. I'm an open wheel fan at my core and have turned a few laps with the big boys, and prior to the release of Project CARS, I spent most of my sim time driving Code Masters F1. It was less than a year ago I converted one of my flight Simulators with a Logitech Driving Force GT and a copy of F1 2012. over the next nine months I've moved from F1 2012 to 2013 to 2014. Then I got caught up in all the hype about "The Crew", I bought a G27 Wheel and up graded my system. But "The Crew" was a big big let down. Then along comes talk about Project CARS, and I was hooked again. While waiting for its release I built my dream system at the cost of many thousands. Well Project CARS is here and it is truly amazing. So come on people, suit up and show up to Project CARS. I would have never believed I'd be posting a clip of me racing at Sears Point on Facebook and have so many people write me excited that I'm racing again after all these years and wanting to come watch. Some still think I'm kidding when I tell them it's a simulation.","June 17, 2015","true","166.1"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

NOT a racing game.\n\nI was excited about this game. I love forza, dirt, and grid. I thought it was going to a combination of the best of all 3. It was, but it also wasn't.\n\nThe graphics are good. The amount of detail on the cars rival, if not surpass, forza. However the track and the environment suffer.\n\nThe AI in the game is okay. They follow their race line and thats that. The will not move. They will not try to take the outside to pass you they will try to go through you in order to pass.\n\nThe game play is great. Each car handles in its own way. You feel the difference between the BMW M1, the Zonda, and the go karts you start out with. It is wonderful and I give full credit to the developers who made it. It is a job well done.\n\nMy biggest problem is the shear lack of cars. No ferraris. No lambos. No Bugatti. No koenigsegg. No Volkswagon Golf. No Chevy Corvettes. Litterrally 3/4 of the cars you find in Forza alone are not in this game. They have very few normal cars for you and your friends to drunkely race. Few super/hyper cars that you can only dream of owning and want to top out. It is by far the biggest dissappointment. The cars that are availabe are race cars with few road cars availbe.\n\n\nThis game is supposed to make you feel like you are a young race car driver. It does and it does it well. I now realize this after I played the game for a bit. I also realize what I liked about forza and grid and dirt are not good for a game that wants to be as real world as possible when it come to making you feel like a acutal race car driver.\n\nGrid, Forza, and Dirt are racing games. They look good, they feel good, they are focused on making the driving experience entertaining and fun. This game focuses on accurarcy above all else.\n\nAgain for the people who only read the first and last senteces  of a review:\nThis game is a race car driving simulater.

You could manipulate every gear as you like but this will end in two overlapping gears with the same ratio.\n\nIf you really like racing simulators, I can only recommend playing GranTourismo or AssettoCorsa and leave this graphicblender behind.\n\nP.S.: I play many games e.g. Star Citizen, BF4 etc. with no problems, so it can't be my rig being poor.","August 28, 2015","false","20.4"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","1"

I love the driving physics and the weather effects. Theres plently of leagues to choose from. I straight out love this game...... except for THE GOD DAMN AI!!! WTF?\n\nI am sorry, I really tried to like this game. But after beeing bumped out of the same turn on the same track restarting my Formula C session 25 times and the AI rear bumped me on a wet track EVERY GOD DAMN TIME, then its more frustrating then fun! I can see them, but I cant avoid them. They are way to unpredictable.  I try desperatly to slow down and do this 90 degree right turn, and every single time no mather what someone bumps my damn rear.\n\nIf I try to drive passively I spin out trying to avoid the crazy damn AI, I`ve tried everything, the only thing that worked was lowering the difficulty so much that the AI became braindead. Thats no fun. I won with 1 and a half lap...... is there no middle ground?\n\nI`m even racing passively, I let them pass me if I cant loose them. I keep my distance as much as possible in turns and only drive past them on straights. I drive flawlessly, still I cant avoid the AI. Its as if they are targeting me sometimes.\n\nIs programing an AI in a racing game really that hard? If I turn up the AI difficulty at all they keep bumpind and crashing into me. I know that the AI is suposed to be "aggresive" at times, but god damn! Having an AI slamming your side or rear so hard that you crash and have to break the race? WTF? THIS IS NOT REALISTIC! ITS FRUSTRATING!\n\nI mean, accidents happen sure thats realistic. But not when it happens several times in every single race.... I have to drive like a old grandma with an expired license and broken glasses just to avoid beeing rammed of the track.\n\n\nBut its not only on this track no, almost every single track I`ve raced on against AI. The AI suddenly and for NO reason just ignores my presence completely. Slamming into me hard, as if it didnt register that I was there. WTF?\n\nSadly I played this game too much and cant get a refund.... or I would....\n\nFix your damn AI before calling it a "sim driver" please. Its not a sim when I feel like everyone else on the track want to kill me. Thats not realistic, thats lazy design.

All of its competition completely blows it out of the water.\nPlaying this the graphics reminded me of Gran Turismo 4 for the PS 2. But thats about the only thing it had in common with that fantastic classic;\nThere are an amazingly lackluster amount of cars in the game. Seriously, theres about 3 road cars in the game, and 1 or 2 cars for each class that all feel the same as the other cars in the class.\nThere are a lot of tracks in the game but I imagine its pretty easy to add a lot of maps if they have less detail and less graphical fidelity than Forza 3.\nControls with a controller are absolutely atrocious and if you plan on using a controller DO NOT GET THIS GAME PERIOD. I cannot even put into words how terrible it is with a controller, as many people on the internet forums have complained about.\n\nBottom Line: THERE IS NO REASON TO GET THIS GAME WHEN FORZA 6 AND GRAN TURISMO EXIST.\nThis game is worse than the competition in every single way, most importantly content. I actually find it amazing that a PC game managed to have worse graphics than console exlusives.\nSeriously, I think this game has less cars than that Ferrarri exclusive racing game.\n\n1/10 worst racing game I've ever played. The only reason it gets as high as 1 is because it has a great options menu.\n\nOh ya, and some idiot decided to make the default post race button "restart" instead of "continue", so you have to scroll up before you press A or you'll be restarting your race. Seriously how stupid do you have to be as a dev to make restart default.","January 7","false","2.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","1"

Also with Project Cars Two in development I would try and wait because that will probably offer a lot more including Rallycross and Hillclimb, and then you can make a choice on which you like more.\n\n--- Example of bad side impact physics: https://youtu.be/4SsCCnqqOno\n\nI had a tough time deciding whether or not to recommend this game. I still feel it's very incomplete and WMD have already announced PC2. It seems to me they just used PC to earn money and start PC2. But ignoring that I still feel PC is a bit of a let down. A huge issue is the physics and AI. The graphics are top notch even without having them maxxed out its a beautiful game.\n\nAI\n- The AI are horrible, certain tracks they will crash in teh same turn over and over, on others they will have 5 car pile ups going into the first turn. They also dive bomb going into the turns often running through the grass and crashing into you mid way through the turn. They also hate racing close. When your going downa a straight side by side a lot of times they'll swerve away from you going through the grass or hitting the wall without any reason to. The difficultly is also too low. The cars I race (Ford Focus for example) without any tuning or practice on the track can beat the AI at 100% difficultly. I don't consider myself a very good sim racer either, but even in cars I have a lot of trouble controlling I can keep the AI over 90%, and in the Focus I can have them at 100% and easily make it to the front of a 30 car race.\n\nPhysics\n- The driving physics I'm not too sure about. Some cars feel great, others I feel I have no control over. But that might just because they are suppose to be harder to control. The real issue with physics is collisions. In some cars you can slide into a car, without too much speed and end up either shot off the car in a wierd glitch, or sometimes you end up sliding up the car until your car is almost horizontal. Basically you have to avoid any contact with the sides of other cars or wierd things start happening\n\nExample of side impact physics (same video as above): https://youtu.be/4SsCCnqqOno\n\nForce Feedback\n- I'm not going to comment on the force feedback because I'm worried my Logitech G27 is dying and causing force feedback issues. I will say teh tweaker files did improve my opinion of the force feedback.\n\nVerdict\n- Ultimately I bought this because I wanted a game close to Forza 4. Something close to realistic I could mess around on, with many different settings on car count, enviornment, race length, and AI settings. In this Project Cars met my expectations. I really do enjoy this game, although I only drive about 3 cars because I havent figured out how to control the others well enough for a good race. But the cars I have gotten used to I love (Ford Focus in particular is my favorite, front wheel drive can save you from a lot of mistakes). But if I had the chance I would definitly go back and buy Assetto Corsa instead, from my understandign its much more sim like with better AI, as well as allowing MODS which is huge to me. If you decide to get this game try and pick it up under $30 I was able to get it for about $35 and redeem it through Steam.\n\nExample of how easy the AI are, I take the first lap very slow because you can easily pass 20+ cars but I like to let them spread out first. I make plently of mistakes, and still win a minute, lapping most of the field: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wc8jG93R81k","November 3, 2015","true","67.0"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"

Also with Project Cars Two in development I would try and wait because that will probably offer a lot more including Rallycross and Hillclimb, and then you can make a choice on which you like more.\n\n--- Example of bad side impact physics: https://youtu.be/4SsCCnqqOno\n\nI had a tough time deciding whether or not to recommend this game. I still feel it's very incomplete and WMD have already announced PC2. It seems to me they just used PC to earn money and start PC2. But ignoring that I still feel PC is a bit of a let down. A huge issue is the physics and AI. The graphics are top notch even without having them maxxed out its a beautiful game.\n\nAI\n- The AI are horrible, certain tracks they will crash in teh same turn over and over, on others they will have 5 car pile ups going into the first turn. They also dive bomb going into the turns often running through the grass and crashing into you mid way through the turn. They also hate racing close. When your going downa a straight side by side a lot of times they'll swerve away from you going through the grass or hitting the wall without any reason to. The difficultly is also too low. The cars I race (Ford Focus for example) without any tuning or practice on the track can beat the AI at 100% difficultly. I don't consider myself a very good sim racer either, but even in cars I have a lot of trouble controlling I can keep the AI over 90%, and in the Focus I can have them at 100% and easily make it to the front of a 30 car race.\n\nPhysics\n- The driving physics I'm not too sure about. Some cars feel great, others I feel I have no control over. But that might just because they are suppose to be harder to control. The real issue with physics is collisions. In some cars you can slide into a car, without too much speed and end up either shot off the car in a wierd glitch, or sometimes you end up sliding up the car until your car is almost horizontal. Basically you have to avoid any contact with the sides of other cars or wierd things start happening\n\nExample of side impact physics (same video as above): https://youtu.be/4SsCCnqqOno\n\nForce Feedback\n- I'm not going to comment on the force feedback because I'm worried my Logitech G27 is dying and causing force feedback issues. I will say teh tweaker files did improve my opinion of the force feedback.\n\nVerdict\n- Ultimately I bought this because I wanted a game close to Forza 4. Something close to realistic I could mess around on, with many different settings on car count, enviornment, race length, and AI settings. In this Project Cars met my expectations. I really do enjoy this game, although I only drive about 3 cars because I havent figured out how to control the others well enough for a good race. But the cars I have gotten used to I love (Ford Focus in particular is my favorite, front wheel drive can save you from a lot of mistakes). But if I had the chance I would definitly go back and buy Assetto Corsa instead, from my understandign its much more sim like with better AI, as well as allowing MODS which is huge to me. If you decide to get this game try and pick it up under $30 I was able to get it for about $35 and redeem it through Steam.\n\nExample of how easy the AI are, I take the first lap very slow because you can easily pass 20+ cars but I like to let them spread out first. I make plently of mistakes, and still win a minute, lapping most of the field: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wc8jG93R81k","November 3, 2015","true","67.0"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"

Project Cars is now my favourite racing sim despite some issues with the AI. They can often be way too aggressive and will force you off the road or even go off road as they try and pass other vehicles. Hopefully this can be addressed in a patch. Despite the AI issues, offline racing is still lots of fun. I haven't tried online yet but I highly recommend this game to any racing sim gamer.\n\nUPDATE: I haven't had time to try many of the new features or improved AI since patch 2.5 (and now 3.0!) but I will update my review when I do. Feedback since these patches has been very postive so I'm sure PCars is even better than when I first reviewed it after lanch!","May 24, 2015","true","67.3"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

You will also notice that the Force Feedback is a bit dull and doesn't give you that true feel that you might expect from your wheel, in my case being the G27.  However after doing some research I found a helpful link in the Steam community forums that completely changed the feel of the game: http://forum.projectcarsgame.com/showthread.php?22938-Jack-Spade-FFB-Tweaker-Files&p=891198#post891198\n\nThe physics in project cars is decent not following the mainstream arcade route.  I might be wrong but I think this is the first "sim" racer that targeted the mainstream market, thus also attracting gamers without wheels.  This caused some confusion since sim racers are nearly impossible to drive on keyboards.  I recommend that you save up some moola and invest in a wheel.  After some practise you will learn to love the more realistic feel and never look at any arcade racer ever again.\n\nA summary:\nIf you are new to sim racing(like me) and do own a wheel I will recommend this game for you.  This game is easier than true sim racers but also requires some  practise to get use to and it's very rewarding once you do get the hang of it.\n\nThanks for reading :)","May 24, 2015","true","20.8"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","2"

Every single update that comes out may fix some issues, but breaks just as much. This game is not fit for public release at this point, even after multiple official patches. This latest patch refused to let me calibrate my wheel properly even after 3 consecutive tries. It's apparent that nobody quality tests these new releases on any platform. Car setups used to be OK, but even after fixing my wheel on the 4th attempt, they still feel like garbage. Any wheels off the track now result in penalties that slow your car down in the middle of the race making it dangerous for yourself and anybody around you. This is not racing. At this point, the game is a joke.\n\nHowever, the biggest joke of all may be the limitless level of unprofessionalism displayed by Ian Bell, head of the studio on their official forums. His conduct is enough to make anybody sick to the stomach. Silence the criticism, act like an immature child and employ moderators who somehow manage to act even worse. Say anything negative about the product and find yourself banned or accused of being part of some conspiracy. Full disclosure, I have never registered or posted on the forums myself. I heard of this through words of mouth and then proceeded to spend hours going through their major threads until I just couldn't stand any more. I would certainly encourage anybody who doubts these claims to go to the official website yourself, or look up some great YouTube videos including screenshots of all of this. This is one person who will not pay another dime for any add-ons or sequels thanks almost entirely to the conduct of their leadership.\n\nBeware when purchasing this game. Even if the bugs are eventually ironed out (and that will not be any time in the near future), you are supporting a studio who couldn't care less about what you think.","July 3, 2015","false","103.0"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","2"

Every single update that comes out may fix some issues, but breaks just as much. This game is not fit for public release at this point, even after multiple official patches. This latest patch refused to let me calibrate my wheel properly even after 3 consecutive tries. It's apparent that nobody quality tests these new releases on any platform. Car setups used to be OK, but even after fixing my wheel on the 4th attempt, they still feel like garbage. Any wheels off the track now result in penalties that slow your car down in the middle of the race making it dangerous for yourself and anybody around you. This is not racing. At this point, the game is a joke.\n\nHowever, the biggest joke of all may be the limitless level of unprofessionalism displayed by Ian Bell, head of the studio on their official forums. His conduct is enough to make anybody sick to the stomach. Silence the criticism, act like an immature child and employ moderators who somehow manage to act even worse. Say anything negative about the product and find yourself banned or accused of being part of some conspiracy. Full disclosure, I have never registered or posted on the forums myself. I heard of this through words of mouth and then proceeded to spend hours going through their major threads until I just couldn't stand any more. I would certainly encourage anybody who doubts these claims to go to the official website yourself, or look up some great YouTube videos including screenshots of all of this. This is one person who will not pay another dime for any add-ons or sequels thanks almost entirely to the conduct of their leadership.\n\nBeware when purchasing this game. Even if the bugs are eventually ironed out (and that will not be any time in the near future), you are supporting a studio who couldn't care less about what you think.","July 3, 2015","false","103.0"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","2"

You can change the actual car grip by mashing throttle and brake inside corner and the car won't slide at any speed, try going smoothly and you are off the track. Some kerbs (those that are on the outer side of a corner) will throw you outside the track, so does grass which is apparently made from glue. Some kerbs however are not a problem for the car and you can cut low speed corners in full speed without punishment. Crests don't work at all. Collisions do not work at all. You go side by side and if you touch you are stuck the the other car until you hit the barrier.

If you are expecting this game to be great out of the box, you'll find it frustrating. If you have all the time in the world and are some racing geek who likes to spend all day tweaking rather than driving, then this game is for you being provided with many options. Especially with all the delays, I expected some finished product rather than relying on the user to achieve what should have been. Force feedback is awful without any tweaks and some RACING cars will feel like a boat! It reminded of me driving an early 80's cadillac. I'm no expert and have absolutely no experience behind these cars but do understand that it shouldn't feel like driving a floating boat!\n\nI guess I don't have to mention about the awful AI but will remind you that it will ruin your game play most of the time, especially if you're not at pole position. No wonder this game have an achievement that rewards you to finish first after a crash in the first corner...lol.\n\nIf the developer decides to fix all this and provide us user with at least the base minimum at default, it would have been great as it does have the potential.","May 16, 2015","false","183.4"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","13","25","0","1"

The physics are a complete nonsense. I expected something arcade-ish like Shift2 without the "on-off" behavior, but it's actually neither realistic nor fun. The same car will understeer like hell on a curve, won't understeer at all in the rest of the track, high-end racing cars grip like a 60's Chevrolet... Tracks feel narrow and simplified.\n\nI noticed that passed a certain threshold, you simply have no control whatsoever when high-speed skidding during the first second, then get back in control when it's too late. I didn't identify the exact circumstances yet, The kerbs behave like ice blocks with some cars.\n\n(Edit) - Now I realize that when you break a bit hard, the cars goes straight, even when the wheels aren't locked.... your controls have zero effect until you stop breaking. I must say I didn't use any assistance, so I guess you need to turn on the ABS to have a more realistic brake system. Whatever. The physics are just ridiculous, I wonder who can still think that a winged racing car will slip everywhere as soon as you move the wheel a bit quickly, even on a tiny amplitude and at high speed. (/Edit)\n\nI expected much better graphic-wise. The graphics have clearly been optimized to look good during replays, or at spectacular times (dawn, rain). However, during normal plain-day racing, they are not that great.\n\nThe AI is worse than in Assetto Corsa, although very random in quality. The noise engines, claimed to be a huge step forward in some forums are not as realistic as in Assetto Corsa... The sound is not as good as in any other modern sim. There are scripted pops and noises when you leave the stands, while the engine at constant revv... The sound is flat and lacks seriously of complexity. I wonder how it could souns so good in the Youtube video comparisons between P. Cars and other games.\n\nI expected it to be a good arcade-ish game to complete Asseto Corsa, but in the end, I do think it's not even as good as NFS Shift...  less arcade and yet much, much less fun to drive (Ok if you choose the 4x4 of course, high-power 2WD cars were way too wonky in NFS).\n\nSaw an article about all the hype being somewhat crafted. Actually, it does make sense: ten of thousands invested quite a lot in the game and are promoting it, flooding the forums, trying to get a bit of cash by multiplying videos on Youtube. Many of the comments are just hilarious when you realize how the game really is. However, the 'positive' wave is so overwhelming that it probably influences the judgement of many. I am looking forward for finding the first honest review on Youtube, by somebody who isn't afraid to be seen as a troll.\n\nA bad game? No. Just every other car game I tried is more enjoyable. This one simply has no specific quality in any domain.  And more importantly, the incredible hype has no justification whatsoever. If you want something more funky than Assetto Corsa, better go for the old classics, from the first Flatout to the olds NFS, GRID etc, even GTR2 (not arcade I know, but the races, especially over 24h, are still without equal; and it's not a such hard game). They are much more fun. This one feels dull, it's only vain noisy agitation. Even Test Drive Ferrari, despite its huge flaws, was more fun. I guess I'll wait for a career mode improvement in Assetto Corsa.\n\nUninstalling ASAP, as it takes a lot of my SSD. At least I can get this back, unlike my 50 Euros, due to my pre-purchase.","May 11, 2015","false","2.9"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","13","25","0","1"

When the AI are being good they are very good and give a very human and competitive challenge, none of that dull just follow the racing line and nothing else crap. The handling and physics and feel of the car are top notch and even if the car list is a little bit low, again it doesn't matter because each one is bespoke and completely different. It will take hours or days to master each car. I'd much rather have 70 bespoke cars than 400 clones that look different.\n\nBeing in a retro DTM having genuine dog fights with capable AI is stunning. The weather is genuinely a daunting aspect of racing as the rain is not just a visual effect but actually makes a difference. If you have the PC and GPU to do this game justice then it is a stunning game. One recommendation would be to use the inbuilt Downsampling AA. 4xDS is the most practical. You can go higher but then it just a huge performance hit for no real gain. Also the same with Ultra reflections have it on High to save performance for little visual impact.\n\nIt does have some problems and areas that need fleshing out a bit. But that does not matter when what happens on the track is this good. And SMS plan to keep adding and updating the game for a while so these maybe non problems in the future. Already heard that the animated pit crews will be added shortly\n\nIf your a petrol head then there is no question if you should buy this game or not.\nOr if you like the GTR series then you will like this due to the fact it’s by the same core people.\n","May 6, 2015","true","323.3"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","13","25","2","7"

The manufacturer states that it is not a Game that belongs on a Laptop. My best guess, you'll be sorry if you do anyway.\nMy system is made of a AMD 8 core CPU, 16GB DDR3 RAM, a HD Radeon (7950) and had really good trouble to produce a decent game play. As you can see all in my enclosure is AMD and there are lots of complaints that the Game was developed with Nvidia in mind and forget about AMD. Not really true, besides I can't proof a thing about this statement. Apparently, Nvidia Cards perform a lot better than AMD on pCars, however with a little patience and a number of tests, it is possible to get up to 60 FPS too on a 60Hz monitor and above Graphics Card.\nAll the AMD gamer, will either have to wait until a major improvement in performance is offered or take what you got, or of course leave it.\nI'd chose to stick with it, because the Game has much to offer.\nIt is exciting to drive at close to 200 mph in rain and at night, a feature that I have only found in Rally simulator.\nPretty much all the legendary tracks are included with the base package. There are cars for pretty much every taste. I have seen older Racing Games, that can and do have 1200 or more community developed cars and hundreds if not thousands of tracks, but give me a break. What do I do with all of that, drive every day a different car on a different track for the next ten years or so?\nIn the end they all do the same, fake a moving vehicle on screen. How good or bad, is another question.\nSo, pCars has just enough cars to try and find the one that suites you best from various different categories.\nTracks are excellent and plentiful, pretty much everything for every taste.\nCar physics are excellent in my opinion, I actually can drive without spinning around, when I was a little too excited on the throttle. I remember, real high power cars do that too, but one can manage on a real road. I believe pCars has just about the right recipe to give you the feel of a real car. It will punish you, if you overdo it.\n\nIn short, I like the Weather feature (even real time weather), the car physics, the time of day settings, excellent vehicle models, Wheel support, realistic sounds, I am not much of a multi player fan, so I can't comment on that.\nAll over it is very enjoyable.\n\nWhat I don't like, is the limited support (I don't care which end causes it) for the AMD hardware. I am a Fan of AMD ever since Intel used a so called Business strategy, that was supposed to put AMD out of business. Besides, AMD provides hardware at a much more affordable level, meaning, less money to spend for the CEO. (Don't worry, he/she will still have enough to survive)\nSo minus score for the Video issue, since the Radeon could perform much better and we have to run the Game at lower settings.\n\nThere was a few other things I fell across, but forgot, guess it wasn't that important after all.","May 14, 2015","true","307.8"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","14","27","0","0"

My first issue was force feedback causing the game to drop to zero frames per second and stay there for random amounts of time. Sometimes crashing the game. So I disabled that. I set the graphics on high and could only average 22 frames per second with other cars on the track with me. How ever it runs at 30-45 if I'm doing time trials on the same track. I kept track of all the rumors and speculation of the physx/amd/nvidia issues. But sat silently waiting for a patch/official statement. Finally the devs state it's a driver issue. So I wait for a driver. Today 15.5 releases from AMD and I see absolutely no difference in frames per second. I turn off all graphics options that can be turned off and set everything at medium. I still can barely get over 30 frames per second. And the worst part is, when the game runs half decent on time trials, it'll randomly drop and cause me to either crash or invalidate the lap time. Shadows flash, textures glitch out and flicker. If I crash my car or blow my engine in a race, the replay is ruined because it will apply that same damage or smoking engine to the whole replay. At the start of a race when doing a rolling start, when the AI has control of your car and others, they will race ahead causing the AI controlling my car to race up and crash into the back of them, causing a messed up start with damage. Other times the cars will start sideways causing crashing while under AI control. Sometimes the car you're driving will join the kerbal space program and launch into orbit on contact with another car/invisible object.\n\nSo today I officially through out the black/red flag. I tried so many driver downgrades/upgrades. Disabling features, trying different game pads. I'm also all for PC troubleshooting if it was an isolated issue, which according to reddit/forums everyone has these same problems. I too want a refund. But I purchased the game through steam, so I don't think that's even an option. I'm not saying it's a terrible game, it actually seems like an excellent racing game. But the performance and glitches are preventing me from actually playing the game. I can't complete time trials as my times are invalidated by physics glitches or random frame rate drops. I can't complete races without smashing the car/losing control because of frame rate issues. Even with graphic options turned down. I can't enjoy the replays because of the issue I mentioned. I can't start races using a rolling start most of the time because of the issues I have. I can't have force feedback on my controller. This game is in a sad state, I warn you not to purchase this game.","May 29, 2015","false","7.5"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","14","27","0","2"

Alright, so I've been waiting for this game for some time now. I've always enjoyed racing games, and I was excited that the PC was getting a big sim release. I started the game up and as soon as I started playing I ran into my first issue:\n\n1. The game runs poorly on AMD cards (and some NVidia users have also complained). I understand one manufacturer having the advantage over the other in a specific game, but a 290x being outperformed by a 760? That's a bit insane. My setup is an i7 2700k @4.4Ghz and an R9 295x2 with a 2560x1440 monitor, and I had to turn the settings down to roughly medium/high just to get playable framerates (45+, it's not very stable).\n\nAlright, so I managed. I was having some fun doing the online time trial, and I was excited to start my career the next day. So I got up, started the career in the Clio Cup, and something just felt off:\n\n2. H-pattern shifting DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK. I figured this wouldn't be an issue, but apparently you're locked into using the exact transmission type that the car has. Yeah that's great and all, but what if I ENJOY using H-pattern? I personally hate flappy-paddle, and I can deal with sequential, but my Logitech G27 doesn't have a sequential option...\n\nSo those two reasons might not throw everyone off, but for me it's enough to say that I should have waited until there's a fix or at least an explanation for these issues. Is it a fun game? Sure, if you can deal with the flaws. However, the game currently feels unfinished, so I'd wait until the issues are fixed or wait for a price drop. I REALLY hope everything gets fixed though :/ .

It is simply way too arcade-biased and suffers from myriad flaws that ultimately spoil the experience.  A case in point is that the F1 cars are more benign in handling tems than the likes of the R500 and the Atom.\n\nThe sound is also very bad for some reason and sounds like it's been presented at very very low bit-rates.\n\nIf you love arcade racers, then jump in with confidence, but if you're looking for a sim, I'd look at Dirt Rally instead.

In certain situations I'm seeing 40fps, but normally 50-60fps with VSync on.\nMy system:\ni5-4670k with an NZXT Kraken x40 Water Cooler (I believe it's the x40, I think it was discontinued)\nEVGA GTX 970 SC (Old Cooler, before the 2.0)\nCorsair XMS3-1333mhz (ddr3, stock clock)\nASROCK Z87 PRO4 (All stock, no settings changed)\nGame is running on a WD Blue 1tb, 7200rpm. Loads fairly quickly, I'm impressed.\nEVGA 750W 80+ Gold Certified\nG27 Wheel, Pedals, and H-Shifter\nNot a mega power-house system but it gets the job done for sure. I race in full-manual, "pro mode." However, I still needed to go into the settings and turn off auto-clutch and other assists myself, anyways. Don't know why.\n\nAnyways, onto the juicy stuff.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone looking to get into sim racing. While the physics are fairly good, it doesn't outshine Assetto Corsa. What this game offers over Assetto Corsa is a more arcade-y feel, as well as more tracks and cars, and shinier environments for sure. (More trees and things on/off the track) Think of this game as Forza, but for PC, I suppose. Project Cars, in my opinion, is better if you want to see tracks almost how they are in real life. While Project Cars and Assetto Corsa laser scan their tracks, Project Cars puts much more detail into it. Like on the Nordschleife, not only do you get a prettier environment with a great skybox, you also see all the writing on the track, as well as skid marks and what have you on the apex's.\n\nHandling feels good, but I feel as if there isn't enough feedback, and if something goes wonky, like if you gas a car too hard, you don't really get this feeling of "wow, I need to fix that" while you attempt to initiate a save while your car is sideways--it kind of just happens and unless you clutch or let off the gas, there isn't much to do from what I've experienced. If your car starts to wildly sway left/right, or whichever way, there isn't much chance of saving it. It's as if inertia, mass, and traction are no longer a thing, and you're skating on ice. Hitting walls doesn't do much in regards to flipping you or throwing you, which is kind of dissapointing. Granted, I haven't played with the feedback settings yet, but the way the game comes, it seems that they're trying to entertain more casual players. More advanced players need to tweek the umpteen amount of feedback settings to get a better feel.\n\nI've found on my pedals that there is a dead zone when you tap it. With a little experimentation, you can easily find the dead zone. (pedal is less sensitive, so people that go hamfoot don't lock up brakes/overgas.)\n\nFor fellow car-enthusiasts, certain aspects of this game versus, say Assetto Corsa, will find that the sounds in this game versus Assetto Corsa are FAR different. Turbo noises are different AND VERY ABUNDANT... I've barely heard any gearbox noises so far. (I have a 5.1 speaker system right next to me, so it isn't that I can't hear it) Engine noises sound ok, but not as throaty and mean as I would like (yes, I'll say it, Assetto Corsa wins engine noises, and noises in general. Further testing is needed)\n\nPeople on console were complaining that their controllers/wheels weren't working correctly, but I've had no such problems with my wheel (obviously on pc.)\n\nIf I'm in the mood for a challenge, I'm not going to pick this game over a game such as Assetto Corsa (people also swear by RFactor, but different games for different people) It seems that in this game, every car I've driven (BMW E30 M3 Group A, Pagani Zonda Roadster, McLaren P1, Ariel Atom) makes the game feel as if I'm in a rocket ship. Yes, these are mostly track cars/race cars, but it feels a little awkward to me.\n\nIf you're looking to work your way up into more "advanced" simulators with more realistic physics, this is a great place to start, as you'll definitely get a good feel for racing simulators, as this one can be FAIRLY forgiving, with certain cars. However, my friends and I will definitely continue to play this game, because, well, it's a racing simulator. :)\n\nI know I sound pretty one-sided with Assetto Corsa, but I've sunk a fair amount of time into Assetto Corsa to make judgments. When Project Cars was announced, it was hyped to be an AMAZING physics simulator, but I think that didn't go so well, so they decided to spend a lot of time making Forza, but for PC. I'm rating it positive because there is room to fix this.\n\nSo this is how I'll rate a few things;\n\n7/10 - Garage graphics and car choosing, I have anti-aliasing and other things maxed out or at optimal settings, and I'll be honest, the car models look kind of bad. The colors are nice, but the models aren't. Too many small jaggies to be honest. On the track, they sunk a lot of time making these shiny environments, but there's so much, not everything could look spectacular. The teasers and promo videos made the game look super bright and colorful, but I'm not really getting those vibes. It's more bright and colorful than Assetto Corsa, I'll give it that, but there's so much going on that the little jaggies and whatnot are showing up.\n\n9/10 - Just the environment alone looks pretty good as I said above, if you just realize that the tracks/environment have a lot of time put into them, it's nice. It gives the tracks some character and feels more realistic, but not much. The tracks have the marring and graffiti and whatnot on them, which is interesting to see, while you blast cars with rocket boosters down the asphalt...\n\n9/10 - If you're a new sim racer with a wheel (I can't judge on an xbox controller I'm terrible with it, regardless of the game) the wheel setup is pretty good for beginners. It has a nice learning curve. Game is fairly forgiving. In Assetto Corsa, the way it comes stock, if you hit the brakes too hard you can easily lock up your brakes. I'll be honest, I'm experienced and I still sometimes do it in that game. But in Project Cars, I don't think I once went, OH CRAP if I hit the brakes too hard. I wouldn't say the pedal controls or anything are more refined, but again, they're appealing to the new guys, the people that go hamfoot (just kick the brake or push too hard).\n\n6.5/10 - If you're an experienced sim racer/casual/casual sim racer (I enjoy sim racers and play them frequently, but I'm not hardcore. However, I turn all assists and HUD off when I can.) this game feels like you're trying to eat pudding with a fork. Cars are drive-able the way the game comes stock, but the fact that the game makes you feel like you're on a one-way rocket ship to the next corner makes it feel like you're just going too fast to enjoy the corners or apex's. Apex's in my experience feel kind of flat. I didn't have an experience where hitting an apex launched me or jeopardized my lap because I hit it the wrong way or something. There's more, but I'm hoping you're getting the idea here. If you race with all assists on, the game is pretty easy mode (appealing to beginners and casual players).\n\n5/10 - Physics are really just not there compared to other games. Like I said above, if you're experienced it's like trying to eat pudding with a fork, and you know you can't really do it, but you flip the fork over and try and scoop with the handle (try and make the best of a situation) The physics exist somewhat, but don't expect anything fabulous.\n\n9/10 - Car selection is pretty sweet, but I haven't seen any slow cars.

The first thing that gripped me just from play-throughs was the A.I. The A.I actually attacked you into every corner which was such a breath of fresh air coming from the F1 codemasters games. The issue they had at the time was that they would not back out and wipe you out. However patches were released and I could finally race my seat off. The next feat I love is the sense of speed and this is also twinned with gear changes. When you change gears you feel the car reacting to every shift which leaves a delightful and engaging feeling everytime.

Don't bother complaining on the official forum either; criticism of any kind will not be tolerated (as per the official instructions of Ian Bell, head of SMS) and if you do you will get banned from the site (just as I've been).\n\nHere's a very small preview of he known bugs (patch 1.4)\n\n\n- when I leave the pits and I tell my crew to not refuel or change my tyres they still fill my tank up and give me tyres that overheat from the first corner (yes there is a bug within a bug, we're through the looking glass people).\n\n- In replays debris from previous sessions are shown and opponents' cars change into different models.\n\n- In sector 3 of road America the split times of the cars is broken and will show you timings that are minutes out.\n\n- There is also an invisible wall that will very rarely and randomly appear on the start finish straight of road America. Hitting this wall at racing speeds is all but guaranteed to end your race. (Has not happened to me directly but I have been in a session where my friend's car suddenly stopped and said he had hit an invisible wall)\n\n- A.I cars do now actually pit in wet conditions, but they often do it too early while it is just beginning to drizzle and when it does turn into a full on storm they won't pit again to change from intermediates to rain tyres.\n\n- A.I drivers occasionally fail to do mandatory pit stops in races or leave it until the last lap (doing so reduces the time lost in the pits)\n\n- FFB will occasionally run into issues ranging from minor (lack of feedback in the wheel) to game braking (wheel will forcefully turn itself to full lock, even when cars are in perfect condition) requiring me to turn off and on my wheel, or in rarer occasions I will have to restart the PC (does not happen with Assetto Corsa)\n\n- When joining a MP session that has already started and is in practice/qualifying mode you can occasionally be stuck in your pits unable to go to track. You can also join a lobby and be stuck there unable to join the session.\n\nI'm sure there are more that I have forgotten about (that have happened to me or that I've witnessed in game) but I've made my point. Not all of these are game breaking but all of them are capable of ruining a race/session.\n\nI also haven't even begun to talk about the non-bug related issues.\n\n\nWhen it works though (which  is 30% of the time) it's probably the best racing game money can buy.","July 2, 2015","false","28.0"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","2"

Simply put the game is just incomplete, both in content and QA testing. To sum up my experience below, it's a 6/10 game. Outside of graphics, there isn't one thing it does great, or even better than other options out there. I would say casual race fans looking for a "sim-light" experience should pick it up on sale, but the game breaking bugs make me hesitant to do even that. Look for one of the many better, cheaper games available for sale.\n\nVisually it's quite nice, and although it doesn't quite compare to the previews, it still looks better than pretty much any racing game out there. However there are several graphical glitches that still need to be worked out. Most that I've experienced have been cosmetic, but one seems to cause the framerate to speed up after breaking . It messes with the physics and throws your car off the track. It's hard to describe: the framerate is still smooth, but it's like your car suddenly has a jet strapped to it for a few seconds. I have a pretty beefy rig and didn't have this problem when I first started playing, so I don't know what's causing it. It only happens in the rain so I'm unable to race in what is supposed to be one of this game's big selling points: its dynamic weather (which otherwise looks great and the ability to set multiple weather conditions during a single session is awesome).\n\nAdditionally, there are a plethora of other bugs relating to the gameplay itself, but are far too numerous to list here. You can even find an acknowledgment of several specific bugs from the developers themselves, though even those are a fraction of the whole.\n\nThe user interface is horrible, and I can't think of anything positive to say about it other than at least the text is crisp and clean. I thought Codemasters had horrible menus, but I had no idea. Everything is counter intuitive and buried in pages upon pages, to the point where changing your vehicle's livery is an adventure.\n\nIf you're planning on using a controller with this game just forget about it. I have no idea how anybody could control it with a standard Xbox controller or Dualshock. Using my Logitech G27 wheel has been fine, but the force feedback leaves a lot to be desired. I swear I spent more time reading through pages and pages of forum posts and guides on how to fix the FFB model in this game, rather than playing the game itself. There are a lot of customization options, but most are beyond your average user. When I bought this game I didn't think I was enrolling in a course on the finer points of FFB tuning/modeling, but that's what I was forced to sit through. Even then it wasn't enough. Many have just downloaded mods to improve the FFB. Bottom line is that it doesn't work well out of the box after calibration.\n\nThe driving model itself is ok (think an improved version of Need for Speed Shift), and depends on the car. This isn't close to the sim its been advertised as, but that doesn't mean it's poor or that you can't enjoy yourself. Most of my time was spent with open wheel racers, and I felt that the lower class formula cars were really fun and felt good. I tried to work my way through career mode but unfortunately the karting is atrocious. If you set the camera to follow behind, you can actually see them unnaturally gliding over the surface of the track, like some kind of buggy hovercraft.\n\nThe reason I finally shelved this game was because of the hyper aggressive AI. Now I don't think ANY single player racing game has nailed the AI, but at least they didn't ruin the races. Anything under 80% was too slow, and anything above was like racing your friend in Gran Turismo back in the day. They just slam into  you constantly through corners, totally ruining any chance of a race. After I got into the grove with the Formula Rookie cars, I started a new career from that level and was finally having fun. However I soon got to Sonoma and the AI made turn 1 impossible. Every single time I took the turn an AI car slammed into me, throwing me off the track. I restarted the race no less than 18 times. It happened again, and again, and again. The last time I just sat on the track spun out sideways, blocking another AI driver to see what would happen. After about 30 seconds of just sitting there, he decided to ram into me and physically push me out of the way. DIdn't even try to go around. That was it for me with Project Cars until the developer does some serious work.\n\nThere are other issues with the accuracy of feedback from the community (I bought this game in part because of content supposedly on its way, but turns out it was just backers with a financial interest meaning that "they have faith the developer will add the features), the developers willingness to listen to feedback, their intent to fix issues, and the typical DLC/funding nonsense (we were supposed to get a free car each month... so far only paid DLC packs and an announcement of the sequel's funding campaign(, but this review has gone on long enough and you can find all of that with a simnple Google search.","June 30, 2015","false","12.5"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","1"

On maximum graphics that is, and frankly, the majority of people wont be able to run that, Putting that aside however, this is a fantastic looking game, as i said, probably one of the best looking video games of all time.\n\n- Tracks list is very impressive, over 100 different track layouts from all over the world, very nice selection of locations to race. I havent even raced on them all yet with over 12 hours in the game.\n\n- General game stuff, this game runs well, very few bugs and crashes, its well set out (the menus etc), racing wheels set up easily, its all those little, well functioning things that make the game what it is.\n\n-The sounds..... OH GLORY THE SOUNDS. Engine sounds, perfect, when you listen to them on a decent set of speakers or headphones, oh man its glorious, and the soundtrack, wow, the best soundtrack for any racing game, its so suiting to the feel of the game, the feeling of determination, passion, speed, its amazing. 10/10 for sounds in this game.\n\nHowever, there are the negative things, as with any game.\n\n- Cars list, yes there are a lot of different motorsports, from karts right up to Formula One, however there isn't much selection within each of those categories, with some classes only having 3 or 4 cars to choose from. Still an impressive layout, but not quite as nice as Forza or Gran Turismo.\n\n- Driving model, this game is supposed to be a simulator, close to reality. As a real world motorsport driver, I dont think it quite lives up to that. Sure, its more realistic than Forza/Gran Turismo, but not quite as real as IRacing or RFactor. This depends on personal preference, it depends what the player wants from the game, whether they want it to be realistic, or arcade like, its all up to personal preference here.\n\n- Career Mode, ok and heres the big one. Career mode. Frankly, in less than 4 hours of playing career, it got too boring and repetitive, so i stopped playing it. It just felt like I was playing the same thing over and over again, and to top it off there is no rewards system, such as in game cash etc, so you dont feel like you earn anything by playing career. Frankly, career mode in this game is a bit of a flop to me. With career being such a big part of a game like this, the game as a whole began to get a little boring after the 10 hour mark, until i found other things to do in it such as running my own time comparisons etc.\n\nSo it has its positives, and its negatives. Based on facts alone, for $70 US, $90 AUD (what I payed for it) this game would simply not be worth that. I know its new, and future updates may improve the game, but as it stands now, it wouldn't be worth that if we rated it simply on facts. There is something else to this game though.\n\nIts the feel of this game. Its the feelings you get while playing it. Its crazy how soothing and nice it feels to blast along the French Coastline in a supercar at 1am on a rainy morning in a game that looks this good. It just feels.... right. Based on that, I would recommend this game to anyone, it needs lots of work, but Its a great title.","June 29, 2015","true","97.4"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"
