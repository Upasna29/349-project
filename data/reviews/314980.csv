And even now, I can enjoy myself playing Supreme Ruler Ultimate... for a while that is. I would love to support the developers at battlegoat. I really would. However this game has so many large issues that NEED fixing, yet since I discovered this game 2 months ago. Nothing has changed.\n\nFirst off, the AI is much better than the previous titles. So I will praise Battlegoat for that. However the negatives outweigh the positives in this game.\n\nThe economy has always been a massive factor in Supreme Ruler games. And that is why it must be done right. But in this game, the economy is done poorly. Instead of fresh water (which is a necessity for any poputation) they replaced it with rubber. RUBBER! The only natural rubber resources are in 3rd world countries. Perhaps this is supposed to be balance. But it is the worst balancing attempt I have ever seen. Also, the bond system people requested to return from SR:2020, was not brought back despite the communtiy requesting it. (The bond system allowed you to manually take out new bonds or pay off debt) Now, this new debt system works in Supreme Ruler Cold War (not sure about 1936). But not this game. It is SO broken, that when a minister takes out a loan, it translates into free money! NO debt is added! Also, in the start dates, nobody has any debt (but I will not continue this complaint as the debt system does not work)\nAt times, you can suddenly start losing hundreds of millions a day for no reason. One day you just made 28 mil, and the next you start losing 100+ mil day after day until you take out a "free-money" loan.\n\nI, personally think the research system in this game is better than any SR game, with the tech trees, and the 4 different tech races all in one (Race for the Bomb --> Space Race --> Internet Race (race to develop the internet) --> Race to Mars). And this also combines with the military system, by researching units models. However, the WW2 stuff was rushed during the development of SR1936, and it seems the devs made no effort trying to add to this. (Seriously?! "Tank Designs '39?") The world war 2 tech is extremely shallow in comparison to the time periods of the Cold War and 2020.\n\nAnd WW2, what a disaster. The Chinese are an unstoppable, filthy rich, military superpower by the time the Japanese invade. (SERIOUSLY?! China wasnt even a country back then!) USSR is weak as hell, and gets annexed by Germany very fast. The USA never joins or trades with the allies, even after they declare war on the axis. Oh, and there is a global shortage of Industry goods. And Consumer Goods get random unexplained shortages as well.\n\nHowever I can have fun with this game, the many errors ruin the experience and immersion.\n\nAlso, this game is FAR from finished. Most of the errors I have listed have been reported as I have seen. And the developers have said time and time again they will look into and fix these issues. However instead of fixing these issues, they took the game out of early access! This is obviously a BETA product and is not at all ready to be released. Yet they did release the game. And what a massive pile of ♥♥♥♥ it has turned out to be....\n\nHere is a summary\n\nPros:\n-Diverse selection of start dates and scenarios\n-Much improved military AI\n-Very detailed world (2020 and cold war, not 1936)\n-Speeds are very good\n-Diverse technology\n-Diverse selection of units\n\nCons:\n-Same music, tends to get annoying with the same song over and over\n-The AI likes to turn the world into a massive love fest during the 2020 scenario. Allying random nations across the world, and barely starting wars\n-Economy is too broken to even be considered functional\n-Weather system does not actually do anything\n-World war 2 is terribly thrown together\n-USA and China are mega-superpowers during WW2?\n-Replacing Fresh Water with Rubber makes no sense\n-A nation with full friendly relations with you will often refuse to make any diplomatic deals with you (other than trading items for items/money)\n-The sphere of influence makes sense during Cold War, and kinda during 1936. But the whole sphere thing during 2020 makes NO sense, and will end up in ruining relations with other nations.\n-AI does not seem to react to you conquering neighbours, unlike in Cold War and 2020\n-Random shortages of resources that make no sense\n-Soundtrack recycled from other Supreme ruler games\n\nAll in all, i give this game a 6/10. Do not buy this game. It is not worth it, as the developers have released a beta product, and neglected to fix the game.\n\nTo shut people up: SOME of these things have been fixed, however I still do not reccomend the game to anyone","November 27, 2014","false","13.2"," 286 of 336 people (85%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","85","286","336","11","32"

I want to support games like this ...because it plays so close to what I like in games.\n\nMy preference is sandbox mode and this game is such a non event when you play this setting.

You are just going to wait until China or Russia attack (ie. If you are a NATO country) and then decide how long before you counter attack.  The AI will make you walk to Moscow or Bejing because it won't know to accept a peace deal at its borders once you have removed them from occupying a foriegn territory.\nEsentially the same game you have already in your Steam account .. just some different paint.\n\nSave your money, wait for a sale.\n\nMessage to developer - Please work on how the AI (other countries) work against or with you.  Never does a player feel connected to this world.  Perhaps more in game messages, maybe International news or something that highlights what is occuring in the virtual world.  Human players are way too disconnected from the rest of the AI to feel connected to the experience that we are ALL hoping for.  How are the players suppose to get a sense of the international community?  Everything a player does is reactive to the virtual environement with no real chance to be proactive.  It would be nice to know that China is focusing on certain countries or regions ... maybe I send over an aircraft carrier to send a message that may influence China ... one way or another.\n\nIf you develop any other games (and I hope you do) I will be waiting for reviews before supporting it.\n\nI have bought them all ... but no more.\n\n\nT.\n\nPS.

Have you ever wanted to conquer the world? Build an empire to rival the British? Watch your nation prosper (or fail) under your command?\n\nThis is as good as it gets folks.\n\nSR is a geopolitical grand strategy game set in the modern era, best described as a unique mix of Civilization and Risk. Play as any nation in six different sandbox campaign maps, or try your luck playing as one of the world superpowers through World War 2 or the Cold War (and beyond!).\n\nYou control your nation's military, logistics, finances, resources, infrastructure, diplomacy, and espionage while competing to spread your influence around the globe. If that sounds overwhelming, and trust me it probably is at first, your AI cabinet ministers can help manage some of those aspects for you (or with you).\n\nThere are hundreds of real-life units to research and build, and a whole range of futuristic-inspired units and technologies to expand games well beyond the year 2070.\n\nA few minor issues here and there, though nothing game-breaking (and if there is, they're pretty good about patching)... I've found hundreds of hours of enjoyment from this series, and I feel like I've just scratched the surface. That being said, the diplomacy is a bit simplistic, the economy is frustrating (well, that's probably not BG's fault), the AI has momentary fatal lapses of judgment, naval combat and pathing need a bit more work, and some things just generally feel unimportant and neglected (like aircraft carriers, but probably because the AI doesn't know what to do with them)...\n\nAll in all, this is an incredible sandbox game. It's extremely moddable (though tedious unless we get some proper mod tools), and there's a ton of settings to play around with and victory conditions to play on.\n\nThe choice is up to you, do you want to follow history as closely as possible, or completely rewrite it?","September 23, 2014","true","38.4"," 86 of 111 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","86","111","0","0"

If you enjoyed global strategy in the veins of Paradox grand strategy titles (Crusader Kings 2, Europa Universalis 4) you'll love this. You can play different campaigns starting with Nazi-Germany in 1936, US or Soviet Union in the Cold War era, up to the bleak post-nuclear future in 2020. In addiditon, you can take control of any country you like in Sandbox mode and try to shape the future.\n\nJust like with all the other grand strategy titles you love, your possibilities are amlost endless and the tutorials are barebones at least, so you will have to be willing to learn a lot by trial and error, but due to effective automization options your country will not disintegrate just because you don't know what you're doing. Simply delegate tasks you don't want to handle to your ministers and you can focus on the things you want.\n\nFrom what I've played so far I am really enjoying myself. The only issue I had was during the Germany campaign, when I attacked Poland, the allies did not declare war on me. This might be a bug - or alternative history in the making. Anyways, I enjoyed playing out what this alternative scenario means for Europe and the world.","September 19, 2014","true","13.5"," 57 of 70 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","57","70","0","1"

Not the greatest but definitely one of the best in it's genre.\n\n1. Performance issue. I have a high end pc with 16 gb ram and i7 processor but after several minutes of playing the game always gets slow and becomes UNPLAYABLE. I have Supreme Ruler Cold War (SRCW), SRCW does have performance issue as well but it's less severe compared to Supreme Ruler ultimate. This needs to be fixed asap.\n\n2. You cant choose to annex particular regions that you want. In March of The Eagles you have the ability to choose particular regions that you want to annex after defeating enemy nation which is absolutely a great feature.\n\n3. Auto annex territory after liberating or colonizing a country with certain regions that arent loyal to the country you conquered. This may confuses people who havent played the game, but for those who have played the game long enough will understand what i mean. Its pretty annoying that when i play as Soviet Union and liberated Turkey, region of kurdistan gets annexed automatically by USSR, my USSR does not need nor want kurdistan region and it messes up the map. It certainly looks ugly.\n\n4. Spreading your ideology (either Communism or Democracy) with nations other than Soviet Union (for communism) and USA (for democracy) is impossible. For example if you play as Cuba with communism ideology and spread your communism ideology to neighbouring countries will not make those countries join the warsaw pact sphere of influence. In every sandbox game i play, NATO will always dominate Soviet Union no matter what. I think they either need to add spreading ideology as another nation feature or add an option which alliance (NATO or Warsaw Pact) that will dominate in the game, neutral or balanced alliance option would also be a nice feature.\n","April 23, 2015","false","379.3"," 67 of 87 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","67","87","3","0"

It is a good game, but for the most part I do not recommend it, and here is why.\n\nLack of a real manual. The in game tutorial is badly done, and the manual they give you doesnt explain much. This game is complex and needs to come with at least a 100 page manual. Remember the manual in civ 3? 220 pages? I think the manual with this game is about 50 pages. And this game is more "complex". So you are flying in the dark. Your biggest friends will be forums and google, which don't really address the issues because well... Nobody knows. There is a lot of "Lets try this and see what works". This is the biggest problem with the game. Too much is an unknown. Even after 200 hours. Don't get me wrong. I now know how to play this game to a large degree. But am still unsure about a lot of other things. I have played very hard games with steep learning curves. The learning curve of this game is not the issue. I mean the game doesnt even have a tech tree. WTF! Their are 800 techs and there is no tech tree? Not even on google. It doesnt exist as of 11-12-2014. Their are some little player done tech trees but they dont address most of the techs before age 2020.\n\nI give it a 6/10. This game would be a 8/10 if there was a REAL manual. So infuriating.\n\nOh yea, I got a response from someone from Battlegoat Studios about why there is no tech tree. His answer is that it would be hard to make.....

It really does deserve a much larger fanbase. Anyway, it is an awesome game with a very small, but dedicated team.\n\nPros\n-Much larger unit base than any other comparable game. You know how Civ gives you a few units for each era? Well, this gives you hundreds, if not thousands.\n-Intensive combat system. Models many of the intricacies of war, inclusing missiles, a detailed supply system, and many more things missed in other grand strategy games.\n-Detailed economy. Models a decent variety of resources, all with profitabilities that fluctuate as supply and demand change, as well as your own country's internal economic factors such as inflation, unemployment, and infrastructure,\n-Large amount of researchable techs. This game offers a very large and detailed tech tree that has a wide variety of effects on your nation.\n-AI allocation. While this game has a steep learning curve, the game offers AI advisors that can pretty much run your nation for you. Their actions are hardly ever ideal, but it really helps when you are still learning.\n-AI military difficulty settings. This is really something I have to applaud them for, as it is the ideal for how such a system should work. When you change the difficulty up a level, you are not giving the AI units a stat boost, instead you unlock more tactics for the AI to use. On easy, they do little besides charge your positions. However, on the harder difficulty levels, the AI can pull off challenging strategic manuevers.\n-And many more awesome things!\n\nCons:\n-With the huge variety of units, there is a noticable amount that use ill-fitting models. For instance, the US marines will use AKs and Strykers use the LAV model.\n-Some military aspects are imperfect. Aircraft squadrons receive aircraft to replace lost ones, and since destroying an entire squadron in one go is difficult, you will occasionally run into situations where the enemy army is destroyed, but you cannot move up due to the concentration of enemy aircraft. This also occurs with artillery, but to a lesser degree and for a different reason.\n-The biggest gripe I have is the diplomacy system. My biggest problem with the system is that when a coup happens in a country you previously liked, your populace continues to like it. While you might want to attack it and reinstate the old government, you cannot without taking huge amounts of grief from your populace. The problem extends to when you liberate a country. You can rarely seek treaties with them because all of the civilians in both countries still hate the other.\n\nUltimately, while the game has quite a few bugs, I am willing to forgive it. The (sometimes serious) problems are simply a side effect of having a detailed and complex game.\nIt is flipping awesome, and if you like EU4 like games, then you will most likely love this.","September 5, 2015","true","586.2"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","33","37","5","0"

Recommended for Paradox players, especialy for HOI players. I have always wanted a modern warfare grand strategy game. With just one single action, you can drastically alter the course of history. For example create a world where the Axis won WW2, the US invaded Cuba during the missile crisis or the USSR put the first man on the moon. However it would be nice if you could choose from more start dates. Currently you can't choose a start date between 1947 or 2020. In EU4 you can manually enter a date and start from there.\n\nPros:\nYou can play as almost any nation that has existed in the last 80 years\nOffers interesting scenarios, such as one where all the nations have broken up into smaller provinces and regions\nReally deep diplomacy system. Most games only have a "offer alliance" button, but in this game you have the option to negotiate about mutual defense, transition and line of sight\nCons:\nAs you progress the game becomes slower and slower, because nations start to build more unites and your computers has to calculate the movements and actions of thousands of units.\nGraphics are sacrificed for the sake of performance, because of the large number of units displayed on the map.\nLots of micromanaging. Even though your cabinet members can fully automate everything, there are still a lots of things to watch.\nOverall this is an amazing game and one of the best strategy games I have ever played.

I have always like grand strategy within the modern eras of warfare.  Commanding soldiers has always been fun but with previous games I found them very restrictive.  Normally just giving you command of a squad or a putting you in one battle was just too restricting.  I want to command my nation send it off to wars I plan for.  Go against nations I want to fight and do it through the 30s to 2000s.  Well that game is this one.\n\nFirst off if your a fan of say total war but it now.  The map follows a very similar feel to total war with supply lines, economy maniging and building production.  There's even research that unlocks units although it's not a tree which would have been better to know what you should research when.  Unlike total war though the map is larger and it takes place within real time.  Politics in the game is fun when all nations hate you for building your empire.  Hell if you wanted you could play the game without any war but what fun is that.  Seeing hour defences on borders and battle lines is Aldo a lot of fun and there is a ton of opportunity for strategy.  Planning invasions is crucial, you need to know the land you plan to take and where best to fight, assault and land.  It's such an immersive game.\n\nBut does it have its problems. Well yes.  For example the game can sometimes grind to a slow pace as you build up more troops for a new invasion or if you plan to go peacefully for a while it can get little dull. Even on fastest game speed (which I highly recommend you play on once you knows what your doing) the game can be a little slow I'll sometimes just let it play while I go off and make lunch waiting for my new marines to be ready.  Also some problems occur with amphibious units disembarking on island and getting stuck there forever which is a huge pain in the ♥♥♥.  Also there is quite a learning curve and the tutorial is not as detailed as it should be.\n\nHowever for all the bad the game shines on.  I highly recommend getting this game it is such a fun experience being the command on high over a nation building it up to be the next superpower.  Oh and before I forget.  All nations from 1936 are playable.  Enjoy","March 10, 2015","true","39.2"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","21","27","2","0"

Updates and SLOW and commincation is bad. There are bugs that are still present from the 2020 version and issues that the players have been questioning for years but they still exists and get overlooked for some reason. It doesn't run so great either. A lot of slow down and very bad map scrolling.","June 12, 2015","false","2.7"," 27 of 39 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","27","39","0","0"

I have mentioned in a review for another SR game that I am unhappy with the way Battlegoat has handled new versions of the game (selling them as whole new games) because this game is basically just an updated version of SR 2020, SR CW, SR 1936, combined into one.\n\nThat said, If you have played any of the older versions, then you will certainly find this one to be the better experience. Anyone new to the series would also want to pick this one up too as there is little point in buying any of the older games in the SR series.\n\nI have found this game to be a very good Geopolitical/Military (more focus on military) simulator. It does have a steep learning curve, but when you figure it out, it is an amazing game for its scope and scale.\n\nYou can simulate yourself into the leadership position of any country in the world. You manage military, economics, research, and diplomacy.\n\nThe version of the game has many new and very much needed features from prior versions added. Being able to delete all the pop ups from one catagory in a single click rather then tediously one by one, as well as being able to easily select which units you want from a stack by simply holding left ctrl and clicking. Renaming your county, units and even cities new or old is a nice touch as well.\n\nThey Ai is seemingly much more intelligent in this version. They are actually reserving units they are not using and actively invading by sea, aggressivly and effectively this time.\n\nPolitics is hit or miss. The Ai seems to be doing a much better job making wars and alliances regional and relevant, rather then across the globe and logistically infeasible. I have also seen them make a cease fire agreement. Which I cannot recall happing much if ever in prior games. Aliiances are still a odd ball in the series. The AI wants a ton of them for some reason, but they do not include mutual defense like you would think.\n\nThe game does still have some issues, but it is a fun game either way. The worst issue I have noticed that hasnt been fixed yet is the merchant marines just willy nilly floating to their deaths. The Ai should recognize when its military is being sunk to the bottom of the ocean, but they dont seem to mind sending their entire army to its death.\n\nIf planning invasions and military operations on land or sea or across oceans is your thing, as well as organizing and commanding the operations, then you will probably enjoy this game. It has ministers to help you out while you get started, but I find the true fun to be in doing it myself.\n\nI picked it up on sale cheap for less then 10 bucks. At that price it is a good deal. If you dont want to pay full price, keep an eye on it for a good sale downt he road.\n\nHave a question? Ask and I will try and help in the comments.","December 30, 2015","true","46.6"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","5"

It has been in full release for some time, but there are some campaign mechanics and events missing like the civil war in China which leads to Japan's rapid defeat before the second world war proper begins. That said, the devs are very responsive to these issues and release regular updates.\n\nSo why is this a yes rather than no? Unfortunatley very few grand strategy games of this scope and nature are made. Other than Paradox (who published previous Supreme Rulers), Battle Goat are the only company active in this genre other than even smaller companies making smaller and more focused titles.\n\nIn terms of mechanics, the military units are well researched and there are many hundreds of designs to develop. Research stetches from the 1930s and past hypothetical future technoligies. Politics and diplomacy have been fleshed out with the ability to diplomatically annex colonies as well as liberating dead regions (unfortunately you can't liberate them as a colony). A faction system has also been introduced to model the Axis and Allies as well as NATO and Warsaw Pact. Economics is largely the same as previous titles, except water has been replaced with rubber with adds another strategic consideration which will become apparent during large scale warfare.\n\nOne final warning is that you need a decent rig to run it. I only have one computer to test it on but I believe you need a decent amount of RAM and pretty powerful CPU to handle the thousands of simultaneous calculations done by the AI. The devs have improved game speed since the last games but with my i7 2.7Ghz quad core (admittedly six odd years old now) the game slows down noticably after a decade. Still playable but requires patience. If your CPU is any less powerful I would do more research before buying.","December 7, 2014","true","47.9"," 25 of 37 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","25","37","0","0"

With a high end computer the game comes to a screetching hault after 10 to 15 years of game play.\n\nWhat they need to fix:\n- Move away from 32bit, and make this game 64bit. This game needs the extra ram and 4gb does't suit it.\n- Allow annexing specific hexes.\n- Problems that were in SCRW, two games ago, are still here. If you take over lets say czechoslovakia, it doesnt give you the option to colonize it. It simply just annexs it.

But once u play the game, things like stupidly moving or even worse inactive units of allies are simply totally useless...\n\neg. Ethiopia - Italy has tons of units but half of them not moving (and no they are not out of supplies) - so Italy is not getting anywhere down there for some years (I mean the history books show quite clearly with all Italian problems they had, it was a conquest of an uncivilized nation) - and Italy mainland would have all kinds of units for use but they r left motionless where they were deployed\n\nanother one: Japan - losing just a few months after they!!! declared war on China - they loose Manchuria and Korea - and same thing here again its like Japan has a underdevolped tiny army and the mighty and modern Chinese Army is finishing them off in "days".... (once more history books? or at least accurately balanced forces...) And of course japan mainland keeps heeps of units instead of maybe throwing some into battle... (once i gave them nearly half of the German army for free - and yet still they loose against China!!!)\n\nThe diplomatic system is at least questionable, so even if u influence other goverments (or the opposition) not much is happening, and even some potential allies dont change to ur side... no matter what ever presents u throw at them...\n\nSo all in all nice concept - bad implementation at least AI-wise....  Until they fix things - Go for Hearts of Iron 2 or 3, complexity is similar, much better AI and even though they keep the historical line quite good, u still can change things quite beliveable (when walking down different paths of history).","January 16, 2015","false","81.4"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","20","28","0","5"

This game engine has some interesting elements such as the economy but like 2020 it is limited; for example moving troops around and organising an army is painful.  The AI doesn't act in a logical way in terms of self interest and building alliances.  All in all, like the previous Supreme Ruler games, it is a good attempt but ultimately a frustrating game due to poor control/organisation mechanisms and terrible diplomacy.\n\nIf you want a WW2/Cold War game Hearts of Iron is far better.\n\n","October 19, 2014","false","13.5"," 66 of 114 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","66","114","0","1"

It combines the best of the previous releases, however it is not currently in a playable state just yet. I strongly recommend buying this game now to support this fantasic indie company, but hold off a bit to really enjoy the experience. Other long time players of the series can jump right in and find the game is everything you hoped it would be, other then a few noticable glitches and a general annoying slowness, the game appears to be in pretty decent shape. A few patches from now and some perofrmance improvments and we will be loving every second of game play!

This is because China is united, not broken up into smaller controlling factions.  HOI3 did a good job, SRUltimate is a fail.\n- Incompetent economic AI.

Its game mechanics are somewhat fixed. There are a few problems however. Atleast the game speed does not lag whenever 3 years pass.\n\nThe AI need some fixing when it comes to combat. For example, South Korea will take over North Korea easily, and then invade China. China will have hundreds of units lying around in forts and cities while Manchuria is completely overrun by probably 30-40 inferior South Korean military units.\n\nHowever, complaints of people saying the AI are not historically accurate are irrelevant. A main component for this game, and something I personally enjoy, is its alternate history options that YOU can control. When you can turn Haiti, a now poor nation with 80% of its population under the poverty line, into a massive superpower that owns Florida, all of Central America, the Carribean, Northern South America, and parts of Europe, you know this game can be fun. This game has unlimited opportunities. These opportunities can range from you being literally any nation in a time period's existence and doing whatever you want with it, wheither it be an expansionist, fascist Uganda, economic superpower of North Korea, or the USSR Part two, this game can provide for that.\n\nDo not expect this game to be a pulse pounding, call of duty action game, because it isn't. This is a hyper-realistic game on steroids. All factors need to be taken into account for in your economy.\n\nPlease remember that BattleGoats Studios is still working on this game to make it better for the players. This may have some annoying bugs, but they are expected to be fixed throughout the patches in the game.\n\n7/10 in my opinion.","November 12, 2014","true","196.8"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","0"

It has multiplayer which gives you a challenge during any time period (WW2, COLD WAR, ETC.)\nOverall it is a fun game and truly lets you control your country on how you want. Want to declare war on cuba as USA, go ahead! Want to take over mexico as USA, GO AHEAD! Want to nuke the bahamas because you want a testing ground for your nukes, GO AHHHHHHEEEEADDDDD!\n\nYou have the capability to build your army and your economy. It has a really cool infrastructure and resource gathering system. It is a very up to date game and follows a good timeline when it comes to resources. For instance, you dont see a huge amount of oil in the middle east during ww2 while during modern day 2020 you see tons of oil. This game also has a good trading (importing and exporting) system which can really make a difference on how your economy grows.\n\nArmy and millitary research and building are very accurate when it comes the time line of ww2 to modern day. British have challengers, US have abrams, and russians still have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tanks! :) (No Hate)\nI like the research system of this game because it lets you trade technology which can also big a huge factor to helping jumpstart or even saving your economy. Millitary has a huge influence on war justification on other countries and a huge influence on your world % on millitary approval, domestic approval, etc.\n\nOverall this game is a very fun game and is updated somewhat frequently. It can be confusing at first but if you are not willing to actually sit down and learn how to play the game, go find a simple game that does not require thinking.

It was a bit frustrating in the start because you had to learn all the controls. But after that it's a amazing! It's so much fun taking over territories in the name of whatever country you are. Really the only bad thing I can say about this game (as of yet) is that the combat is a bit boring. Seeing 2 or more units fighting with no animations or anything just explosions to show that they are hitting each other (and a big explosion to show that a unit has died). But if you are like me and have fetish for taking over territories you should definitely buy this game!\n\nEDIT:\nSo I've found some cons after playing this game a lot.\n\n- The amount of crashes is quite  high. I was in a game and I forgot to save, and then it just crashed. I can't explain how frustrated I was after that!\n\n- Your units doesn't prioritize your orders first. In the game you can let the AI command your forces when at war, and while this is very nice most of the time, I want to be the one in command without taking it off. Like if I order unit X to go somewhere it shouldn't stop even if the AI thinks it's a bad idea. I want to be in charge of my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minions. OBEY MEH!\n\n- Amphibious assaults is a pain in the ♥♥♥ to do. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. And most of the time it's only effective on weaker countries. And the A.I almost never figures out how to do them. I've only seen once that Germany was able to invade Great Britain. But if America declares war on a European country, it doesn't matter. While they are technically at war, they don't invade. They just destroy your ships here and there.\n\n- This is not very big or important, but still annoying. you can't delete save files in-game. You have to manually remove them from your folder. I think it's kinda BS.\n\n- A lot of nations are either way too weak or way too strong. I did a WWII 2 USSR game where I let Germany take most of Europe and then wait until they attacked me. I was stronger in numbers, technology and defenses. Still they beat me. I had to put everything on very easy and yank military spending to the max to beat them. Germany should not be this strong, it's not fun to fight against, and it's not fun to play as. Also, I had won a war with Japan so I already had their resources as well.\n\n- The economy is kinda of broken. I never really understood it. There are 2 major resources that you will not matter what, will be scarce later in the game, when you have annexed a lot of countries (assuming you are like everyone else and just want to make one big ♥♥♥ country). And that is Industrial goods and Oil. Not matter how many facilities you build you will always be behind.\n\n- I don't think there's any grand strategy game that has this, but as most others, this doesn't have the Swastika for Germany in the 1936 scenario.This annoys me very much, but nothing can be done about it.\n\nOverall I still recommend the game, just be prepared for these things.","January 21","true","146.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game is neither great nor involving. The UI is ugly, economy is simple despite lots of resources and production - the world always has money to buy and is willingly buying.\n\nAll in all the game is too simple where it would rather be more complex and too complex where it should have been simple - you just build facilities for what has good added value and be careful not to build too much and at the same time you'll ♥♥♥♥ up trying to move your armies. You might have 100s of unit types or you might have one type - it really doesn't matter.\n\nAlso I annexed the USSR by capturing Moscow. Maybe scenarios are more interesting than campaigns, but now I'm not really interested in that.

Theres nothing better to me in this game then starting of as a terrible countrey that today is still a third world country and bring it up and make it grow into such a power that its competing in the space race not with U.S.A or the USSR but by its self and its winning. That to me is enough to make me want to play this game over and over agin because you can change a whole history of events like what if Germany and there allies actually won world war 2, or what if the cubin missle crysis went hot would anyone survive. This game provides so many diffrent options that i find it hard not to like.

The posibilities are endless you can play from multiple campaigns at different time periods, or play sandbox start from differet scenarios like WW2, Cold War and modern/ near future. If your a history buff you'll deffinetly love this game, even the sanbox mode is historicaly accurate untill the point you decide to break from the time line and make history yourself. Do not be mistaken the game is not simply military conquest, you can try this but unless you're a world power its gona be tough.\n\nThis game has a great sphere of influence system, that can be manipulated from diplomacy, economic activity and military actions. One point that I with I knew before starting to play this game is that a good army is a supplied army, do not take supplies for granted always make sure every military operation is well supplied, if not you will see your modern millitary that you spent millions on shred like paper. Also some good tips is don't over build resource production, you will run your economy into the ground and create labor shortages.

It did initially feel a bit of a cheeky move releasing it so soon after 1936 (and to be honest before 1936 had been properly finished) but I appreciated the discounted price as compensation. To be fair I never really got into 1936 as I prefered the future setting of 2020. This version lets you play the 1936, cold war and 2020 games with the added benefit that the tech tree in a 1936 start will go all the way through to the end of the 2020 tech tree. To be honest in a normal game stretching the gameplay out that far would be pretty difficult, I have never managed it.\nAs it is my faveourite game mode the review is mainly based on a 2020 starting date. I found the 1936 game pretty tough due to supply shortages which I know are realistic but still it makes for a tough game for a lot of countries. I do on the whole enjoy this version however I find that at this stage of its development I honestly prefer how a game played out in the original 2020 version. My major complaint with this version so far is that the computer is far too free with alliances. After a couple of years the world becomes such a tangled mess of alliances that wars do not seem to break out that much between AI countries.  Unless you play as say China or Russia you will probably find most countries are friendly to you and probably have pretty similar allies making conquest a bit of a headache. It makes rampant warmongoring with the UK for example a lot more difficult than in the original 2020. As a lesser note some of the AI combat provides odd outcomes, in one go I played through South Korea conquered the whole of China and Pakistan conquered India. After that there were hardly any hostile enemies for me to target. You can fiddle around with the game settings to provide a different gameplay experience, at the moment I prefer Shattered World with very high volitility (no units can help to prevent some counter intuitive outcomes from wars) as a sanbox go.\nOn the plus side there has been a lot of incremental improvements to the game with a lot of issues I had on release being ironed out through patches so I am hopeful the game is only going to get better going forward.  Undoutedly the graphics are better and the tech tree has been improved so it is not simply just a nicer looking version of 2020.\nI do recommend giving the game a try, particularly if you do not have all of the versions included in Ultimate but I can't help thinking that in its current state I did used to have a lot more fun playing the original 2020.","February 21, 2015","true","58.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Sometimes it can work well and be fun, but it will take you hours to get a game going...\n\nHowever, this game is like no other game out there. There are hundreds if not thousands of different unit designs to choose from, from 1936 - 2020 and beyond. Its a great war simulator if you choose to use it that way, you can drag and click with mobs of troops or you can play tactically.\n\nThe AI in SRU is better than in the rest of the Supreme Ruler series, but it still leaves some to be desired. While the AI can be challenging to the player, generally unless they are a huge country with hundreds or thousands of units to send at you, you don't have much to worry about. The naval invasions are easily stopped by placing ships at your port because they don't send naval escorts. There isn't much of a naval AI, but I believe I have seen improvments in this.\n\nThe economy is fairly detailed, the world market reacts to how much resources there are in the world and the demand. So they generally represent the world economy, but i'm not sure what else to really say about it.\n\nThe world doesn't really seem to interact with the player in any real way, I often find myself just siting there not knowing really what to do but let time go by and then end up just going to war for the heck of it. If you are new to the game I recommend large countries to start but to really feel like you're in the game and to be actually doing something I recommend smaller countries as they actually need more attention.\n\nOverall the game is great and I recommend it, I have had a lot of fun playing multiplayer (And a lot of stress and wasted time) and I have a lot of time in Singleplayer. If you are looking for a good political simnulator, look somewhere else, if you're looking for decent economics and great warfare than you found the right game.","December 27, 2014","true","676.4"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

My opinions comparing it with SR:2020, the second best game in the serie.\n-Better economy than SR2020= When playing with bulgaria in sr2020 i had little problems in the start and a large amount of gold in 2022-2024; playing with bulgaria in SR:U is really "harder" why? Because there is not a real gain... you must watch for the trade costantly and in 2025 you are not as rich as in 2020 c; (this is realistic aniway)\n-Better Ally sistem= so... you are telling me that if you are ally with a nation and you declare war upon another country... this will probably help you militarly? ♥♥♥♥, THIS IS FANTASTIC!\n-More units= I don't know if this is really true but... playing bulgaria in 2020 was like: buy voodnik.... and build the same tanks forever... in SR:U there are more tanks and engeniers are updated (less op probably...)\nAll supreme ruler's ages= 1936,1941,1949,2020,Shattered world\n-Speed= so... you are telling me that i can do 5 years of game in... 2 hours? ahahahha... it was 3 days for 5 years on 2020 Emoticon smile\n-Puppets= Finally.... i will cry no more: i was bored of the fact that if you "stumble" in another country and you annex it... there is no point of return... so if you annex europe... you annex europe... ♥♥♥♥ it! In sr:u you can release nations,annex them and colonise them!\n-2020 is... pax and love?= My preferred age is 2020 but in the game no one does war... NO ONE! So i must force "realistic wars" by playing the interested nations in multiplayer (by pressing pause and declaring war...)\n-Improve relations= Finally you will improve relations without spending 333 billions!\n-You can buy allied units= in 2020 if you go in the "units" zone in the trade you can't see other country's troops... but in sr:u if this is an ally you can buy these troops.\n-You can really abuse of your colony: You can force to build something, to give you money and resources and many things a colony, just fantastic!\n-Better graphic but... does it really matter?\n-I'm just confused by the interface: some "important" things (like the pil) are now secretly placed in finance and other windows...\n-Updated situation= Putin that rules Russia... crimean government(russian colony), Modern libya...\n-Supportable rebels and colonies\n-Changeable names: you can rename bulgaria "♥♥♥♥♥♥ green nation" so... nice.\n-***Not confirmed, never tryed, only hope*** Better multiplayer.\n-Another supreme ruler... same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ colors... where is the problem in making a single color for every country? WHY CAN'T YOU DO THIS?\n-No more water.. bb saudi arabia Emoticon unsure\n-Now there is... rubber.\n-Better trade requests, embarking and wars (when there are wars...).\nI could buy this game 3 more times... if you add more belligerance and a way to gain casus belli (and by that... bots will do this in base of their esigences).\nSorry for english... and... ♥♥♥♥, i wasted a lot of time in this.","September 23, 2015","true","50.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

I am waiting for a good Geo-Political Grand Strategy style game to be released. This game had a lot of potential but fell short in almost every way.\nTech Tree 5/5\nPolitical Options 3/5\nPoliticial System 1/5 (politics are very buggy and broken)\nIntelligence System 2/5 (Fell short in almost every way, spies are almost usless)\nMilitary 3/5 (nukes were usless and battles felt broken, still playable)\nPolitical System 2/5 (almost non-existant ability to declare martial law, change government, etc... would be a nice addition as well as side efects to government ie Democracy means you can be elected out of office.)\n\nOn top of the things mentioned features to be added better satellite options, better intelligence options, better political options. WMDs that actually work, and have real effects on population and in the global opinion. Smoother battles, and a military heirachy that adds to command and organization.\n\nAll in all the game has very fun aspects its worth playing just fell short of what I was looking for.","November 14, 2015","true","33.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

I missed 2010 so I have no idea on it. This last version of the series had many improvements and the good thing it is still under development.\n\nFor just this version that I began to support it prerelease the modern maps needs some fixes but WW2 maps are OK. I still miss a 1914 WW I map but am happy with the cureent WW II scenarios. In my opinion it is the best geopolitical simulator if you like this genre and it is very addictive. Many newcomers may complain about things that they do not know how to do. For experienced players modern maps and economy needs fixes. Other than this the developers added many things that was absent in previous titles like unit trading with allies a must have future also caused me to stop playing earlier titles. On the other hand I must confess that this game is not for everyone.\n\nThis game has its own economical model that is quite different from modern theories although basics are same namely supply and demand is still major part of the economical side of the game but classical economical approaches may not help you a lot. This game has a very long learning curve that may discourage many but if you try you can have your own style. For example my strategy is same for any country I play with 1st Product self suffieciency, 2nd enough researching to get some good army technology and other useful civil ones, 3rd modernized small but elite army and finally after I have enough stockpiled war materials that in game they are petroleum and military goods used by your army in war. After that it is finally the world is yours. Many may say other but I prefer colonizing the world not annexing because if you keep annexing you cannot handle if your goverment is democracy no matter how experienced you are.\n\nI advice not to hurry on conquest but develop earlier then fight and if you are new avoid modern maps try WW II maps.","April 8, 2015","true","258.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

I could free other countries by Liberating them and making them my allies or just simply claim the land. Playing 2+ removes the option of Annexing, Liberating and Colonizing.\n\nWhen it comes to the haste of the game, we could understand that using "Fastest" as speed was only for singleplayer,\nas it makes your PC work at it's strongest will to make the game go at über speed.\nBut not even Very Fast was working as the game got Desynchronized, leaving us to send the savefiles over and restart.\nWe were stuck playing at Fast which... for a game likes this, feels very slow.

The reason for that is because I felt this game had a lot of potential, and offered something unique to the RTS gamer. However, after release, and a second release (Supreme Ruler Ultimate) the game still lacks logical or sensable content. AI constantly remain idol, or stuck in one time period, and lack any sort of diplomatic logic. The game uses a UN system, who's rating can never be changed or influenced but the rating effects all diplomacy and your economy. The Research system is full of dead ends and techs with absolutely no description/purpose. The challenge isn't even here. Starting at China in 1936 I have the military and economic might of 1990s China by the 1950s while other countries like the USA remain in a downward spin of debt, or research 1 new tech every decade. This game is a great trick, it looks very promising, but lacks the right content to allow the game to function. The game is still loaded with bugs, glitches, and crashes regardless of your system. Updates come once every month 1/2 or 2 and the content is to fix what you'd expect would have been done before release. To conclude this rant, don't buy this game for another 4 years, it will take them that long to add content and fix the bugs at their rate.","February 28, 2015","false","288.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Lots of people toss this game because they act like Democrats.  They spend tons of money on infrastructure.  They don't have industry goods to produce any of the facilities.  Therefore they import them driving the world market price through the roof.  They go broke.  Taxes eventually reach 99% as you run a full on socialist state.  Inflation goes through the roof as your government spends and borrows wildly at the whims of the rulers.  And because you.... the user.... has total control (ie big government) your complete mismanagement wrecks the entire nation for a generation.\n\nInstead..... focus the economy on GDP.  It's everything IMO.  Higher GDP equals more tax revenue.  You want the people to be prosperous.  I've tried many economic models and found most to be somewhat realistic.  I've use the common flat tax.  It's fairly effective.  The "fair tax" ie sales tax is an excellent model.  The citizens only pay taxes on goods consumed.  In a perfect world you produce most of what you consume..... and consume a lot.  Domestic profits are much higher than exports.  If you keep a healthy balance of supply and demand with a national sales tax of roughly 30%..... you're good.  GDP will go up.  You'll gain tax revenue everytime goods are sold to the populace.  And you get general revenue from the sale.  In the real world..... this is essentially a free market with a national sales tax (as the only source of income.)  People scoff at the idea because they think THEY would end up paying everything at the counter while the rich walk away unscathed.  Anyone with a brain knows that's what happens anyway.  Raise taxes on corporations and they simply raise prices to match.  A healthy business will always maintain a steady profit line.  Taxes are nothing more than a business expese.  Either way it goes taxes are always paid by the little guy.  Even now..... your employer is responsible for a large portion of your taxes.  People think....  "Great... the company pays that."  Except for the reality that it's simply a business expense considered under "labor."  Which means you.  Therefore you are more expensive to the company and get paid less.  Therefore you actually pay ALL taxes.  Because if they did not exist.... then a healthy competitive market would drive wages up to the current line anyway.  It doesn't matter who gets the money from the companies perspective.  Either the government.... or you.... cost X amount of dollars for one employee per year.\n\nAnyway if you choose to run a socialist economic model.... your goal is to export.  You want to drive GDP down.  In lamens terms.... you want the people poor.  Poor people work for nothing.  The end result of all socialist nations is poverty.  Poverty keeps you in business.  Look at China.  When their people become to prosperous they print a ton of money and devalue their currency by half...... essentially making the people 50% poorer.  The easiest way to make everyone poor.... is to jack taxes through the roof.  You can simultaneously raise services to maintain public order.  But the people will still be poor.  The lower their GDP.... the cheaper you can produce goods (ie China).... the less people of your own country can afford goods like electricity and water..... and you'll have a ton of cheap goods available on the market.  If they pile up.... simply do bulk sales with a minimal profit.  Technologies can also reduce the cost of production.  But GDP is a huge factor and you can crash it quickly.  As a socialist nation you will make tons of money off consumer goods.  They are always in demand.  They fetch a nice profit.  And the poorer your people are.... the richer you get.  ....  Gee.... isn't socialism great.\n\nOverall don't be afraid to raise and lower taxes.  The economy should be flexible.  Don't build it around one strategy.  Grow it in all directions.  Don't be afraid to shut factories down if you can import goods cheaper than you can make them.  Why pay your own people more money when another country can produce it cheaper?  Unemployment isn't that difficult to control.  (Higher unemployement also means less competition for workers.... which means lower wages... whicih means you can produce goods cheaper and drop GDP.)  You want a healthy balance of everything.  I typically start the game by building a few industrial goods complexes.  I want enough to sustain a war.  Then I identify the particular countries trade imbalance.  Try to produce goods rather than import them (unless producing them is more expensive.)  And eventually create a small surplus of various commodities for export.  I try to run about a 20% overall tax rate usually focussing on the sales tax.  You want the people rich and prosperous.

I have played almost an hour of this game, and have unsuccessfully spent the hour trying to figure out how to use the interface. Superpower 2's interface? Clunky, but logical. Star Ruler? Pretty much the same. The issue with this interface is that it just doesn't make any sense. There are fewer buttons and areas to manage than the above two, at least on the surface, but the ways in which the buttons are organized make no sense. Things that look clickable aren't, features aren't where you'd think they would be, and there is no pattern for organization. While the game looks feature-rich and has plenty of interesting mechanics, the UI is too confusing to make it worth most people's time. It sure doesn't seem to be worth mine.","May 1","false","6.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

My personal best is the 1936 and changeing the tide of wars that happened in ww2 Also you can just play as a side nation and chose your alliance or just be an independent nation until war begins. On other turns the AI in supreme ruler ultimate are abit on the turning side but they are greatly improving the mechanices that this game brings to running your country is near identical this game is definetly a game to keep and will be a game to be worth playing for a long period of time.","December 14, 2014","true","43.5"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

I was the UK and navies such as the Guatemalan Navy were wandering around my waters , which made no sense to me, but it doesn't affect the in-game experience too much.\n\nThere are plenty of different game modes , all of which are enjoyable.\n\nPlenty of playable regions,which makes for a varied playing experience. It is easy to immerse yourself in the game, it is highly addictive and you can expect to rank up the hours in the game.\n\nThe Campaign is a pretty time consuming aspect of the game. The scenarios are good , unfortunately,there is only 2 custom scenarios. The Sandbox is best for beginners, i am not a beginner and thats the mode i use most.\n\nThis game is multiple times better than the previous edition (1936).

The reviews looked okay, and the screenshots looked interesting. However, when I actually downloaded it and started playing, I discovered the game's true face.\n\nFirst off, the tutorial is laughably bad. There are so many complicated buttons that it doesn't explain how to use, and the objectives in it were incredibly vague. After I finished it, I still had no idea how to use the game. I'veplayed tons of RTS and Grand Strategy games over the years, like Civ and Paradox games, but I still had no idea how to play.\n\nSo, I decided to just jump in to the game and start playing. That approach usually works for me when I play strategy games and don't understand the tutorial. But even then, I didn't know what to do. There were so many useless buttons and icons, that they filled up half the screen! The game somehow managed to have poor quality graphics and lag at the same time.\n\nThis game sucks, for lack of a better word. It dissapointed me. The tutorial, gameplay, and graphics are all so, so broken. Luckily I got this game on a sale for $8.99, and didn't have to pay 30 dollars for it. To any kids like me who are thinking of getting this game, I implore you, DON'T!","June 3","false","0.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I really want to be able to recommend this game but, sadly, I cannot. Not in it's current shape at least. It is just way too buggy at this point for anyone to spend $30 on it. I did so in early access because I really enjoy the series and wanted to support the development of this game. However, I now feel somewhat betrayed by the lack of progress that has been made between then and now. The economic simulator in the game, which has always been the shining feature of the previous titles, is still utterly broken. In my last play though, I spent $98 million on a bulk purchase of electricity, only to have zero of it show up in my inventory.\n\nOn top of the general game play issues, and despite comments to the contrary I've seen from others, I find this to be the most poorly optimized offering in the series. My games often ground to a halt a couple of game months in, making the game completely unplayable.\n\nI am holding out hope that the developers are still intent on making this game into a workable, finished product. They have demonstrated great fidelity to their fans in the past by frequently updating and improving the other iterations in the series. If they do so here, I will gladly change this review. Until then, I can only advise you to go buy SR 2020 Gold. It's a heck of a lot cheaper and still one of the best (and most under appreciated) grand strategy games of all time.","December 12, 2014","false","18.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","2"

Can't quite recommend it.\n\nThe trouble is that you have to spend so damn long educating yourself in how to play the game, and when you've finally got a handle on it you find it's not as fun as you were hoping.\n\nAt first you go broke when you build a new research base and several factories, because you don't understand how much money you have. Then you master that but things get ugly as you realise you have high unemployment and a horrible inabiity to power your stuff. Then when you finally balance resources and the economy and things are going well you realise that inflation is running out of control. Then you have to learn how to manipulate taxes, production and social spending to control it. About 10 hours in you finally feel that starting a war might be on.\n\nOh dear. The game is so damn realistic that you can't just 'start a war'. I mean you *can*, but the international community will totally shun you unless you have 'justification'. I found some expensive ways of generating 'justification' but in some cases you pretty much cannot create it at all. (It's not like EU or CK where there are fun and satisfying ways of generating CB). So you have to align with Axis who do this kind of evil stuff all the time. That's great during the second world war but the rest of the time you get screwed. And then war itself is ridiculously complex and requires another 30 hours to learn properly.\n\nIt's a marginal not recommend - it doesn't give enough back for the incredibly steep learning curve.","July 12, 2015","false","13.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

The game has tremedous POTENTIAL.\n\nTech;  The game has a tremendously extensive tech tree.  Unfortunately too many of the techs only lead to other techs and yielded nothing in an of themselves.\n\nCommand and control of units;  While you're able to build battalions of ground units which is fine, there is no good command and control system.  For a world wide game battalions need to be in divisions with some command control structure.  HOI3 has a good system.  At least ships can be put into battlegroups which can represent fleets fairly well.  There are issues with the handling of air units as well.\n\nEconomy;  The game has an extensive economic system.  You have many tools to tweak your economy. Many cities are in the game with populations listed.  Here the game misses a golden opportunity.  Rather than use popuation to limit facilities built in a city, the game uses an arbitrary limit of 6 facilities per hex.  I'm sorry, but my home town which is in the game has no business having potentially as many facilities as the core hex of a major metropolis like NYC.\n\nThe game also has a very simple minded low unemployment rate equals high inflation rate. The economic system has many questionable aspects, but I don't consider those a game stopper.\n\nDiplomacy; There are many different things you can do, but there are a couple things that bothered me.  One is there is only 5 levels of relationships.  It needs more than that.  Trading goods is limited to 90 day maximum trades which to me makes no sense for a game that can theoretically go for over 100 years. HOI3 system of being able to establish the trade and keep it going until someone cancels it is far superior.\n\nThe developers seem to be responsive, but they may be biting off more than they can chew.","May 9, 2015","false","124.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The more units/building, the slower the game and eventual crashes when you have too much.\n\nAll this one is, is just a combination of all the Supreme Ruler games. It really doesn't add anything new. Pre-Steam, I have hundreds hours into the Supreme Ruler games (mostly 2020), so don't let my 12 hrs fool you.\n\nThe game is designed for you to play a more advanced country. If you play a smaller one, then all you'll get is a couple of different unit types and some tech and that's it. And eventually you get overrun by far more advanced units or get bored, more so the latter.\n\nDiplomacy is crap in this game. If the dislike you in the beginning, they'll always dislike you. Condeming or supporting an action makes no difference. Other thing I didn't like about the game is the Casus Belli. If you attack a country, every country gets a higher Casus against you, but if another country does the same thing, you don't get anything against them. Also countries will just attack you out of the blue for no reason other then that you share borders or not or it's a random event, like one of your units accidently attacked theirs.\n\nYou can conduct covert actions against countries. Most of the choices seem utterly pointless. Like funding opposing factions or supplying weapons. I have yet to actually get anything to work in this. Tested this a few times, funding countries for over 5 years at max resulted in nothing, just makes for a money sink. Spies are really only good for seeing what units are around in the area, I've never been able to sabatoge anything with them ever or anything else. If a spy gets caught, it'll automatically start a war every time.\n\nThe Devs couldn't figure out how to program the AI to load units onto transports, so you get merchant marines. They can land anywhere where theres a port and aren't affected by fuel, unlike your ships.\n\nBest to play with the AI controlling everything, since you can't be everywhere at the same time. Drawback to this is if you give a unit orders to go somewhere, the AI will countermand this order and if you remove the option for the AI to control the unit, I'll you'll have to remember where every single unit is. Good luck with that!\n\nThe AI will also make really stupid desisions for you. Like for ranged units, instead of positioning the unit just withing striking range, it'll move it right up to front lines to be destroyed. However it's funny that AI doesn't do the same for non-human controlled players. It also has a tendacy to move ships outside of their fuel range. So there's all your ships, stuck in the ocean, can't move, unless you manually move a supply ship on top of every each one. Talked about excitement there. Oh and don't forget to take your supply ship off of AI control unless you never want it to get there.\n\nIf you have planes, you have to constantly remember to move them always closer to the borders, the AI will never redeploy them, even if there are just too many at a base. Also if the base you're redeploying/moving them is out of fuel range, the only way you'll know that is if you see them crash. With the exception of radar planes, when you give them orders and they're out of range, they'll turn around, refuel, try again and again.......\n\nThe game has a weird bug that if you have too much in storage of a resource or you get too much money on hand, your cash will all of a sudden go into negatives (it's a memory issue). Populations will jump into unreasonalble levels and you'll stop producing everything. And at this point all you can do is try loading a save if you have one or start over. This has been ongoing since Supreme Ruler 2020 (pre-Steam).\n\nUnlike the original 2020 (pre-Steam), you have no control over bonds and repaying them back (amongst other things). It's at the whim of the AI, so most likely you'll always be paying interest on them, even if you have plenty of cash on hand, the AI simply does not repay them back so you can be debt free. I find this method really frustrating as hell. I feel I should be able to have control over everything for my country, not just certain things, what then is the point of being a ruler in the first place.\n\nAs you play, you'll find out that you're always out of Industry Goods. This is the games way of keeping you from over building/expanding. Of all the games I've played, I've never been able to get excess to stockpile regardless of how many building material building I've had or stockpiles. And if you forget to take it off from AI control, it'll sell it all and you'll never be able to build anything.\n\nThoughout the game, you'll get messages that some resources you're selling internally are priced too high and you need to reduce it. I found this message to be utterly pointless. I've had internal prices in the negatives and I still get these messages that the population is complaining about the prices. So in other words, you're making negative profit selling internally and yet the price is still too high, WTF!\n\nYou also have to keep a close eye on what the AI is doing. For instance it'll keep cranking the taxes up to well over 90%, which will cause your populatiry to go down and you'll get kicked out of office and have to do a military coup (if you can), and then at that point you have to keep the military happy. If not, game over, you lose.\n\nThre's also too much randomness for income, one days you'll be making profit and then the next day you'll be in the negatives and you'll never be able to figure out why.\n\nFrankly the UI for 2020 way out shines what you're left with here. I had a hell of a time trying to find everything and figure it all out (it's like going from Winxp (very user friendly) to win8 (WTF). Another game that's gone from good to terrible.\n\nTime to uninstall permanantly and never buy another game from these guys ever again.","December 9, 2015","false","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The year is 1936 and Italy has invaded the Kingdom of Ethopia. As the enemy army advances the army entrenches itself inside towns around the capital. The enemy attacks with tanks against the Ethopian concripts and calvary. The Ethopians charge against the enemy tanks. Rifles are firing and swords are clashing against the enemy tanks. One by one the enemy tanks explode and the out numbered Ethopian soldiers gain the upper hand. We launch our counter attack with infantry and calvary we push the enemy tanks, boats, planes, and infantry off the continent of Africa. This is not enough to sate our revenge against the Italians. We invade. We walk unhindered to their capital even as waves of tanks come to fight us and the Germans  join them as we declare war.
