Definitely interesting.\n\nIn A.R.M. you are a (possible) criminal locked up in a Mining Barge, and mining asteroids with a mech for as long as the system tells you to is your sentence.\nIf you try to misbehave, they come for you. If you try to escape, they come for you.\n\nYour mech has upgradable parts, and there's a modular damage system.\nThere's a really cool system by which you use the ARM tool of your mech to pick things, like bombs, wedges or other tools, and you can also activate a jet on the "hand" in order to propel whatever you're holding, or use it as a reverse thruster. Never seen that before - very interesting.\nThere's other simulated variables, like heat, oxygen, fuel, energy, battery, and newtonian flight.\n\nHowever, this is all there is to this game at the moment.\nWhen I first bought it, you couldn't even play for more than 5 minutes without something breaking.\nNow it's a little bit better, but all you get is a very little sample of what the game COULD be, with some weird gameflow issues.\n\nIn my own, personal and honest opinion, releasing a game this early is an horrible idea.\nThere's not even an actual clue to where the game is going - it could become a Sandbox game, or a linear story game with open-world elements. It doesn't seem like the devs have a consensus about it, either.\n\nARM is all concept, no game. I wish all the best for the developers, which seems to be a brand new company. They seem really interested in making something good. And for Early Access games, the developers matter more than the current state of their product.\nBut, again, you can't just release something in this state. It's more of a weird Kickstarter than an Early Access purchase. And as a reviewer writing for fellow gamers, I can't just pretend it's not.\n","January 6","false","1.8"," 103 of 116 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","103","116","3","1"

Kinda reminds of 2001 space movie.\n\nThen when I try to escape these Xterminator robots chased after me, warning me to return to the barge.So I disobeyed and tried to attack the barge and they blew me up!\n\nThe survial and managment of systems is really instersting, the devs did put a lot of work in the amount of things going on under the hood.\n\nCan I get to the planets? They seem far away, and the MRRM seems too damn slow...hopefully I can commender the Mining Barge and fly to the planet? How do you escape the jail, I can't find any materials for the lockpick?\n\nHope there are freaky aliens like xenomorphs or something\n\nThere are lots of bugs, guess because it is early access, although the devs seem active in fixing them. They also seem to care about what the community thinks about the future of how the game goes. I would much prefer it goes dark, and be more of a psychological horror game rather than a Mine Craft clone.\n\nLots of potiental from the indie team, excited to see what they could do once they recieve funding. Let's support them so that we can help them build this game even more, I think they will be in early access for the next year. Can't wait for the final version.","October 9, 2015","true","106.9"," 39 of 47 people (83%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","83","39","47","8","0"

(few things are still not fixed though)\nThis is very important. Devs have been updated regularly quite an acceptable.\n\nSo, now I can say what is appeal of this game\n1. Pretty horrible & dark ambience\n2. Extreme mining asteroid simulator\n3. Great optimization & constant 60 FPS\n\nUnacceptable price in current state I think. But it will be improved soon enough in regular update.\nI will keep watching this game and modifying review.","January 9","true","8.5"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","0"

The core game mechanics are there, the graphics are decent. Contols leave alot to be desired, and the fact that the tutorials hardly work (if at all) just makes it downright uncomfortable giving this game a good review.\n\nI feel this one needs more time in the oven. Like alot more time. Not worried so much about the storytelling or the writing, those things can progress natuarally as the game itself is fleshed out. I would recommend this game, but only after at the very least it gets a proper tutorial. The game already has alot of depth, there is already alot of content, alot of things you can do..... But now the game just needs to be able to teach you how to do it.\n\nIt is my hope that the devs continue to support this game, as there is really nothing else in its class.","October 25, 2015","true","0.3"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","17","25","0","5"

I went to the store page by accident and noticed the pictures do not match up with the ones in the game in the slightest.  You start in a pitch black room with stuff all over the place that you can not see, as you'll notice the pictures feature a brightly lite room.  You enter your mining craft and the interface is again completely different, very basic, the mining does not work particularly well, my drill and laser would hit the surface of asteroids, make noise, then stop making noise and nothing came from it but an empty battery.  Unless something was seriously wrong with my download/my steam was not updated despite multiple relauches and integrity tests, the pictures and videos are outright lying.","April 14","false","1.6"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Maybe that is user error but it's totally baffling to me.\n\nNo, I don't want to have to read some how-to outside of the game, either.  If the game doesn't present itself, them it doesn't.","October 11, 2015","false","0.9"," 35 of 65 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","35","65","0","4"

There is also a mesh missing when I landed on the landing pad.\n\nThere should be more asteroids, it would be nice to have an asteroid belt with many more sizes, and some mixed with both rocks and ice.\n\nWhen I bought the Hava for 300CR, nothing seemed to happen, how do I get the parts and materials for Ferris to craft new tools?\n\nAlso the player should be able to recover lost cargo once they die, losing all my cargo was frustrating.\n\nThe characters look really shiny and smooth, almost like plastic.\n\nOverall, pretty cool and interesting game, I would recommend it, even though it's early access, because we can still help the developer find bugs and make suggestions on how the game will turn out.\n\n","October 9, 2015","true","3.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","6","10","3","0"

Neat mechanics and a very nice space flight system.  Was easy to learn the controls and felt quite natural to fly and maneuver around with.

The story and setting is also very intriguing and am looking forward to seeing more depth evolve over time.","November 24, 2015","true","3.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

The developers are very active on the discussion forum, and are quick to help fellow prospectors, and so far have been releasing updates at a steady pace for what appears to be a very small development team.\n\nThe game is in it's baby stages, but I think that's all the more reason to buy it while it's on early access an support the developers. We have what can be an absolutely amazing space sim, but it wont get to be that if we don't support the developers.\n\ntl;dr: Extremely promising game with very helpful and active devs. Buy the damn thing already!","October 6, 2015","true","3.6"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","3"
