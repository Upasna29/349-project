The company has no customer support, no working forum or updated social media, yet they will still process your credit card.  They do not police hackers, which the game is rife with.  I encourage everyone to report this product as fraudulent and get it off Steam.  It is a black-mark against the platform, and should not be represented.","November 10, 2014","false","25.5"," 2,340 of 2,417 people (97%) found this review helpful 90 people found this review funny","97","340","2","90","30"

Until hackers took over. And it became Pay 2 Win. Seriously, back before i even got on steam this game had me loving the everliving s**t out of it. THEN it tanked. Crappy servers, as in no one online when i logged in, multiple times. And it was thoroughly unsatisfying with the whole pay2win scenario. I wouldn't recommend playing this game anymore, unless you have a time machine so you can go back to 2012 and play it when it was actually relevant.\n\nSo sorry for all you who downloaded this game at this point.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dacynder/recommended/107900/","dacynder","Despina Vadamus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dacynder/","159 products in account","This is a game that I thought would be great until I discovered it was created by the same people that made Infestation, which was War Z before the name change. This is completely a 100% pay to play AND pay to win game as you cannot buy any kind of weapon or gear nor open boxes without paying real money for the game. There are crates you can open with GP but the reward is so miniscule that it isn't even worth it. After playing this game you can have a complete idea of how horrendous and terrible Infestation is, or if you played Infestation and then played this then you can see why they made Infestation so horrible.\n\nAnimations are mediocre, textures are very bland, models of characters makes Half Life 2 look like a masterpiece for graphics (don't get me wrong btw, HL2 is an amazing game but their graphics are back in the 2000s), and overall this game is broken since there is no such thing as an anti-hack. Oh, I forgot to mention this game is also infested with hackers and the player base is under 50 making Call of Duty Ghosts look like a popular game (which I still believe is a horrendous game in its state).\n\nThe only positive thing I can even remotely say about this game is the fact that you have the option before you spawn each time whether you want to play 1st person or 3rd person.\n\nGraphics: 4/10\nSounds: 3/10\nAnimation: 3/10\nGameplay: 1/10\n\nOverall: 2.75/10\n\nAvoid this game at all costs unless you have money to spare and want a game that is just as bland and boring as Infestation.","October 28, 2014","false","16.5"," 470 of 514 people (91%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","91","470","514","23","0"

I met Steam with a warm greeting and it began to peddle its wares as is customary.\n\n"Just for you," said Steam, "this one is free." Steam then slowly dangled "War Inc. Battlezone" to and fro uncomfortably close to my face. At first, I was too disoriented by the nauseating smell of "pay to win" to clearly see the title of the game.\n\n"Wait a minute," I exclaimed as the title finally came into focus, "isn't that the free to play shooter I tried out maybe three years ago, hated, uninstalled, and then promptly pushed to the back of my mind?"\n\n"Look, you've been labeling a lot of games as 'Not Interested' lately. I'm obligated to recommend something" Steam replied while scratching its neck and twitching, obviously somewhat agitated.\n\n"I can understand that, but this is a game I previously played. I even wrote a negative review for it. Speaking of which, where is that negative review I wrote for it? Did I delete it for some reason and forget about it?" I questioned.\n\nSteam looked at me directly, a look that could only be described as feral "That's really not important, just download it. It's free, man. You just go ahead and get the download going, just kick back and wait for it to install... get in the downloading mood... maybe buy a game or two after that..."\n\nSteam's words began to fade out as its feral demeanor calmed and seemed to give way to classic opium nodding. Soon enough, Steam was unconscious. I fetched a pillow and blanket and decided to let Steam sleep it off. In the meantime, I decided to leave a new negative review here since I really didn't know where my old one went. Perhaps at one point in time I had been as impaired as Steam had been today and deleted it without remembering. It was so long ago that I made that first review for this game; I do not fully recall its content. Maybe some things are best lost to time.","June 23, 2015","false","0.5"," 633 of 712 people (89%) found this review helpful 791 people found this review funny","89","633","712","791","16"

Cut off the top half inch of the garlic bulb to expose ends of individual cloves. Leaving garlic bulb whole, remove any loose, papery outer layers. Place bulb, cut end up, on a double thickness of foil. Drizzle with the oil. Bring foil up around bulb and fold edges together to loosely enclose.

When garlic head is cool enough to handle, squeeze garlic paste out of the individual cloves.\nIn a food processor combine roasted pepper quarters and the garlic paste. Cover and pulse until combined, but still slightly chunky.\nIn a large bowl, combine tomatoes and serrano pepper. Add roasted pepper and garlic combination and stir to combine. Add diced avocado, lime zest, lime juice, and salt.

It was at a time where I was a bit burnt out on BC2, and decided to give this a try since it did have Third Person over the shoulder type playstyle. Having said that, I did play it for quite a bit, and I will say it was entertaining enough, but by no means a good game. Not surprised this game is dead as it seems the devs and whoever supported it moved on to the Abomination that is Infestation: Survivor Stories aka The War-Z.

Let me start off by saying it seems good. It's quite unique in the sense you can play in both first-person and third-person. Due to preference. Now that's a good feature. As well as there being some quite interesting weapons too. All seeming quite unique. But the cons in this case, definately out-weigh the pros.\n\nOkay, so the sound in this game, is awful. I don't mean the gunfire (though sometimes even if there are different weapons some sound the same) but the territory which you tread on. It feels so un-finished and like it's in some kind of testing stage. I thought this game would be good it seemed decent but no. This game is just completely ♥♥♥♥. You just go onto servers and there are either veterans, or noobs. And there are only ever about 2 servers active on exactly the same maps. And the sound like I said, can also be extremely misleading. For example, you don't even make some sort of splashing sound when going through water, and if you previously walked on some kind of metallic surface and then continued to walk onto a path which is dirt or grass, you hear the same sound until the game finally decides to correct itself.\n\nThe game modes and maps however, this game lacks them A LOT. It's been out for a good I believe, 2-3 years (I may be wrong) and still has an extremely limited variety. The starter weapons for each class are quite weighed out, but it just feels really pay-2-win. I'm not saying that it is, but it seems that the weapons overall are just un-balanced when you take a look at the stats. As well as the armour. You can do without all of those though, but it's still really stupid.\n\nIf I were you, I'd keep away from this buggy mess of a game. Oh also there are extremely misleading holes in some walls, that you can not shoot through. The terrain in the game is also just awful. The game presents itself to be somewhat high-quality though it is certainly the opposite.\n\nI'd advise everyone to keep as far away from this terrible game as possible. It's not worth your time, nor is it worth the 3-4 hour download +1 additional hour to install updates within the launcher itself.\n\nIf you disagree then please feel free to comment below or if I missed anything else awful about this game in particular despite that I have made this a fairly brief review. Thanks for reading and I hope I helped you out in some sort of way.","April 29, 2014","false","2.7"," 103 of 122 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","103","122","0","5"

Now the game revolves around pay2win tactics and hacking. Not to mention the non-existant recoil, its basically just point, shoot, get a kill. Also, whats with this first person/third person ♥♥♥♥? Third person allows you to watch around corners and look over wall/windows, where as first person is, well, first person. So techincally, the game gives you an option to play infairly, minus the pay2in aspect.\n\nIt seems to me that the developers did what they did with WarZ, the game got popular, got them some serious cash with minimal effort, and they ran out with everyones money, except with this, there will always be some rich little ♥♥♥♥, hacking until he cries of laughter and buys just about the entire store. This game makes Call of Duty look like a Bethesda or Blizzard title, and thats saying something.\n\nIf you are one of the few people who played this in its glory days(closed beta-open beta end), then props to you, because you're probably level 60 like me and now you can just let the fact that all that time you spent on this game has gone to waste.","December 22, 2013","false","0.2"," 116 of 145 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","116","145","0","0"

War Inc. Battlezone was probably one of the worst.\n\nWhile it may not be the worst of them all, it's down near the bottom. The main question is why?\n\nHaving a third person element to shooters has never worked out very well. You either have to set the FOV (field of view) to some console like snake around your neck, or deal with the fact that people can look around a wall. This doesn't allow for fair play.\n\nPhysics are not good, ragdoll simulations are some of the worst.\n\nThe game isn't all that bad however, it's a new spin on millitary FPSes.

Graphics are very dated (though not as bad as Combat Arms), and the sounds are just terrible. It is both low quality and footsteps sound exactly the same whether running, walking, or crouched. Other players sounds is not reliable in any way shape or form. Enemies can be right in front of you and you will not hear their rifle fire, but they'll be across the map and their weapons will sound like they are right next to you. Same with footsteps.\n\nThe map I did play was big, and textures were very bad. Players may have been very new to shooters, so that might be why they were really bad. Seems to be very little player activity on east coast servers, no west coast servers available.\n\nMy comment on the skill tree system, I chose medic, and until I unlock skills you start off as a standard normal fps shooter. Not a problem. What bewildered me was the lack of explanation on certain skills that i could choose to spend my skill points on, and what really threw me off is, as a medic, you would believe you heal teammates. But the medkit (skill to heal your teammates) cost 5 points, which was more than all of the other skills available to me. Just really didn't make any sense. I could grind out 5 skill points pretty easily from what it seems through leveling up, but that just really shows that your medics main job really isn't to be a medic. Anyways, bad game, feels like a new game but apparently this has been around for some time.","November 6, 2014","false","1.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Later on, it gets annoying. You'll see only a handful of populous servers, but those are primarily occupied by those who spend countless hours on the game in addition to tons of real money. Auto Team Balance is garbage. I just tried the game again because they were giving everyone free game money; the money you use to buy stuff you can't keep unless you want to use real money. Our team was starting to break through and take a lead during Conquest, even though we were short by two players. Auto Team Balance should've fixed that, but it wasn't until the other team started capturing more to the point where we had to scramble to defend our one and only capture that Team Balance decided to give us a player. People raged as it happened so we ended up short one player anyway. We lost.

Now, this game was a serious gem. It really required skill, tactics, and understanding of the maps and weapons you were dealing with. It wasn't like Call of Duty, where your guns kick like babies and as long as you keep your reflex sight on something you hit it, it had insane recoil, lots of spread, large variations in damage. All the guns were very diverse; none were the same, and excluding a few, they were all very balanced. The map design for the most part was amazing and well thought out. But no one gave this game credit for what it was, which in my opinion was probably one of the best multiplayer exclusive games ever created, just because of small issues like bad starting weapons, a pay to win system, and a few hackers. Eventually, because EA handed the game to a smaller company that co-owned it (EAsy), the community eventually started dying out and the game was shut down even after various offers to purchase it from players and other companies.\n\nThis game really does remind me of Battlefield Play4Free. I think it's incredibly fun, and the weapon balance, despite starting with mediocre weapons, is excellent. There are no two guns alike with one better in some way (like BF3, where the M16A3 trumps all) and all of them feel slightly different and behave differently. The map design feels relatively nice and there aren't any of those stupid maps where the center is a chokepoint/slaughterfest for either team. So far I haven't found but a few glitches and none of them have to do with abusing maps; mostly just audio and graphics glitches (i.e. fire a rifle and unscope and it doesn't go through the bolting animation). Please, I just ask of you, that if you happen to come across this review, seriously try the game, even if you don't spend much time on it. This community is slowly dying as well, and I don't want another amazing game to slip between our fingers.\n\nOverall Pros:\nVery good weapon balance\nFun, balanced maps\nGreat gameplay\nWeapons CAN be bought permanently WITHOUT spending any real money (Daily rewards, WP, crates)\nNice map and weapon diversity\nGreat customization system\n\nOverall Cons:\nSome hackers\nEnough WP to buy guns is harder to get than it should be\nClunky gameplay (but still fun)\nOccasional glitches\nSomewhat confusing user interface\n\nOverall, I think it's a great game. Please don't overlook it.","September 21, 2015","true","13.4"," 25 of 46 people (54%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","54","25","46","9","0"

Combat does not exactly feel smooth, to me, and weapon swap is...awkward. Usually, you get a nice animation of your hands taking-out the weapon or drawing it from some unknown area (a plus is when there is an animation for putting the gun away). Here your weapon spawns into your hands, popped-out from the Void. That was my...third clue, actually.\n\nMy first clue was the horrendous music. It consists, mainly, of brass and precussion. The music, while bland in itself, begins with such monotomy and noise that I turned it off at the first chance I got. The second issue I noted was the massive red boxes placed, seemingly, strategically over the icons for my loadout. What should've been a nice image of an RPG-7 was a red box.\n\nNow, back to the combat, the game's centerpiece. Shooting feels...odd. Feels like I am not shooting my rifle. That was until I looked at my ammocount. My gun that I'm using, the RPK...I have 51 rounds (fired-off a few). I have a curved magazine, defiantly, and I should not have that much. For those saying this is irrelevent, the game markets itself as\n\n"...is the most realistic, tactical, clan-based combat experience..."\n\nSo no, no it's not realistic (this is reinforced by the weapon-swap animation).\n\nNext you have the spawn....which was odd, to me. The enemy had captured one of our objectives. Cool, I mean, I'm all for that. But you would think that, with this capture, OUR spawnpoint would move. As far as I could tell, no. So I spawned behind enemy lines (as far as I could tell) and proceeded to die horribly (the game simulates, at least, the damage a bullet can do). What it does not simulate, however, is the RPG-7...which should've killed quite a few, but...for balence's sake, that can pass.\n\nOverall?

Haven't played the mod? Well, I will say that this game is grape. Yep, grape.\n\nYou start off randomly spawned in the area of Chanarus, most likely near the coasts. You are equipped with clothes, a battery, and a flashlight. Shortly afterwards you are hungry and thirsty.\n\nYour main objective is to find buildings and search for food and drink and then a melee weapon. Don't know where you are at? Find a online map of Chanarus and look for town signs and landmarks. Once you've found where you are at, make your way to the nearest town for supplies. Keep in mind your current clothes allow for very little inventory, so you'll want to look for new clothes in order to carry more items.\n\nOK, so you've managed to find a can of soda, a can of tuna, and some gloves. Good start. Now you'll want to continue... wait. Is that a zombie you hear? Yep. He sees you. Go back inside that house and shut the door. Everyone knows they don't know how to use doors because THEY CAN CLIP THROUGH THE FREAKING WALLS!!! AHHHHHH!!!\n\nAlright, after you've put down the zombie with a hammer, you'll want to take care of the warm red stuff squirting out from your body. Take off your shirt and rip it into rags. Now use the rags as bandages. Good as new. Carefully move on to the... What? Hungry again? But you just ate 3 minutes ago. Pull out the can of beans you found and... crap. You need something sharp to open the can. Keep looking. Maybe the guy rapidly coming at you screaming "HEY YOU! I WANT TO AXE YOU A FEW QUESTIONS!" can be of some assistance. Calmly face him and...\n\nYou start off randomly spawned in the area of Chanarus, most likely near the coasts. You are equipped with clothes, a battery, and a flashlight. Shortly afterwards you are hungry and thirsty. Is that some fruit on the ground? Oh lucky day! Pick up the fruit, dust off the mold, and take a bite. Feeling a little sick? It's probably nothing. Just keep moving...\n\nYou start off randomly spawned in the area of Chanarus, most likely near the coasts. You are equipped with clothes, a battery, and a flashlight.

You are equipped with clothes, a battery, and a flashlight. Shortly afterwards you are hungry and thirsty. You look up to find another newly spawned user who is disoriented but has a cool hat. You look down and find an axe. Now you have a cool hat and two sets of clothes, batteries, and flashlights...\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\nUpdate as of May 15, 2014.\n\nThank you to all of you who have commented and voted on my review so far. I have noticed a few similar questions and comments being repeatedly posted, so I am going to address some here.\n\n1. Does this game require ArmA II?\n\nNo, it is a standalone game, which is different than the mod, that requires no other purchases. When you buy the game, you can start playing immediately and after the full release.\n\n2. This game sucks.\n\nYou're certainly allowed to have your own opinion, but I happen to like it. Keep in mind that the game is not even in Beta, and there is a warning given before purchasing the game. It is recommended you wait for the game to be released or try the mod or even Rust. The mod is fun but I haven't tried Rust yet, so I cannot comment.\n\n3. Your review sucks.\n\nAgain, you are allow your opinion. This was mainly meant as a joke. I understand that some people will not get it. Thankfully we live in the age of the internet where you can easily and quickly find other reviews that may be more helpful.\n\n4. You've only played for x hours.\n\nI have 40+ other games I like to play plus other time constraints. Why do I have to always play DayZ? I like to play for a few hours here and there to see what updates have been applied to the game, and I will keep doing so until Beta or release. That is not an admission that the game sucks, it's just not finished yet and I like to switch things up.\n\n5. Will you be my Steam friend?\n\nI am flattered you would ask me but I respectfully decline. My Steam friends list is already out of control and adding more will not help me. Besides, the chances of you ever playing a game with me would be very slim. Thank you for understanding.\n","May 19, 2014","true","4.6"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","50","10","20","6","9"

With the horrible 2D muzzle flash and crappy graphics, this game features very few redeeming features.

The shotguns weren't bad, and probably the most fun bit of the game - and the most satisfying - but they literally lacked sights. Instead you are given a circle very similar to a hipfire reticule.

Fast-paced action.\n\nHowever, the game still lacks in several aspects and with the abandonment by the developers, I highly doubt we'll ever see this game meet its potential.\n\nObviously, the most frustrating yet reasonable element of the game is the inclusion of an in-game currency only attainable through real money. The game often becomes a pay-to-win game, unless you happen to have an equally powerful weapon. But of course, this trend has been recurring in majority of the free-to-play games on the market.

The game has very minimalistic pay to win. There are some guns you can only get by paying real money. However, every time you level up it gives you a certain weapon for a few days, some of them being payed weapons. Some levels let you try out everything in the store for a few days. The weapons you buy with money don't even have that much of an advantage over those that don't. For example, You can buy a barrett with money, compared to the best "bolt action"(will discuss later) it has slightly higher damage and firerate, and less accuracy. The obvious bolt action snipers(typically the ones with the larger max ranges) don't exactly bolt. They have a roughly 1 second time inbetween each shot(typically bolts in fps take 1.5-2), and it takes 1-2 shots from any bolt action to kill.\n\nThe buisness model is a little bit dissapointing, as you rent things out. For items such as grenades, abilities, Uav, etc. It takes roughly 1 decent game to buy it for a day, and maybe 2 or 3 games to buy it for a week. You cannot perm tacticals without the premium currency(basically you can't earn it without paying)\nWeapons are a bit different. Those you can buy with the soft currency typically can only be bought for 30 days or perm. Thirty days are... I'd say maybe 40 games depending on the weapon. Permanant is usually 10x more. Obviously I haven't gotten enough currency to perm a weapon, so I can't see if it has one of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ repair features.\n\nGameplay is pretty well done. There are 4 classes. Assault, sniper, medic, engineer. You unlock your class skills by leveling up, and putting skill points(1 per level) into a skill tree. Once you put enough skill points into the first row of upgrades, the second row will become available, and once you put enough into that, the last one will be available. I only have experience with the medic, who has 2 useful teamplay skills(He has others, I just chose not to purchase them) which is putting down a medkit which yourself and teamamtes get health over time from standing near. His other skill increases the range of one of the tactical abilities, which is regen teamates that are close to you.\n\nIt does have a decently slow TTK, you may put 10 bullets from an SMG to kill someone. It is satisfying to get a kill. You have very limited ammo, and with the slow time to kill, you could find yourself running out quickly. There is the option to go to an ammo crate on the map, but to refill you have to buy a key that costs real money.\n\n\nI know I've said a lot of bad about the game, but it really is fair. Definitely one of the better fps games IMO. It is a pretty good looker, and making the graphic setting minimal and using a game booster, I get 30 frames on my ♥♥♥♥ laptop\n(   Intel  Atom CPU Z3735F @ 1.33GHz  1.33 GHz  ) and it still looks decent.","August 11, 2015","true","18.0"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

After a while I was wondering where those shots came from, and I saw someone flying over the field, one in some kind of GodMode, perfect aim... and so on.. Devs really dont give anything about it, or at least they are not able to stop those cheaters, but they care about the money thats for sure.\nAsking money for such a game, weapons ,gear and more is a joke. But if you put enough of those games on the free to play market its for sure that someone will put some money in one of those futile games. And at the end all those little transactions (Micro Transactions) can make those pathetic people rich.\n\n","May 17, 2014","false","6.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

All the pay2win games started to come out and so these guys changed this game to one of them. It started to lose players. And at the same time Arma 2 mod Day Z was at its fame peak. so the Guys who made this game (back then they were Hammerpoint interactive (or somethign like that)) thought to make a Zombie survival game called the infamous War Z.\n\nWar Z (Infestation: Survivor Stories) was a bad game.... and I was so sad about it :C i had paid 25$ for it and I live in Euro country so it was only 19€ but lost the extra 6$ bacause it was wrongly priced... aaanyways. That game is completely P2W with buggy zombies and hackers. It didnt have the Graphics, the map and the features they promished from launch also they had the same textures and modes from The war.inc game. So it lost its glory and hype very fast. The devs even paid people to comment on youtube videos thath it was good.\n\nSo now these guys under a new name (I bet they are the same guys). Brought this game back to Steam. (6montsh ago i couldn't find the "old" War Inc in Steam.) It is still as bad as it was with just a minor graphical upgrade and same Models form War Z.\n\nIn summary:\nthis game is just a cash grab so don't waste any of your money on this game.\nEven those it is fun as a first game you get to your pc and its free the hackers and P2W makes it terrible for people who have played some little more higher quality games (movement, gameplay, mechanics, support and dev vise.)\n\nDo play this game if you don't care what you just read but do NOT support the devs. They are abusing Steam and are Evil.\n","January 21, 2015","false","12.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

All the pay2win games started to come out and so these guys changed this game to one of them. It started to lose players. And at the same time Arma 2 mod Day Z was at its fame peak. so the Guys who made this game (back then they were Hammerpoint interactive (or somethign like that)) thought to make a Zombie survival game called the infamous War Z.\n\nWar Z (Infestation: Survivor Stories) was a bad game.... and I was so sad about it :C i had paid 25$ for it and I live in Euro country so it was only 19€ but lost the extra 6$ bacause it was wrongly priced... aaanyways. That game is completely P2W with buggy zombies and hackers. It didnt have the Graphics, the map and the features they promished from launch also they had the same textures and modes from The war.inc game. So it lost its glory and hype very fast. The devs even paid people to comment on youtube videos thath it was good.\n\nSo now these guys under a new name (I bet they are the same guys). Brought this game back to Steam. (6montsh ago i couldn't find the "old" War Inc in Steam.) It is still as bad as it was with just a minor graphical upgrade and same Models form War Z.\n\nIn summary:\nthis game is just a cash grab so don't waste any of your money on this game.\nEven those it is fun as a first game you get to your pc and its free the hackers and P2W makes it terrible for people who have played some little more higher quality games (movement, gameplay, mechanics, support and dev vise.)\n\nDo play this game if you don't care what you just read but do NOT support the devs. They are abusing Steam and are Evil.\n","January 21, 2015","false","12.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

Not all games even if they have better weapons are pay to win.  Alot of games like this need the income to keep the servers running, as for graphics well.  ITS A FREE TO PLAY GAME!!!!!!!  Of course the games aren't gonna have the best of graphics I mean this game is older but I used to play it and really enjoy it.  I also loved combat arms, soldier front 2 and a few others.  Saying this game's graphics are bad are like saying half life 2 was a ♥♥♥♥ game.  Doesn't make sense.  In fact for someone like me this is a really good game I do not own a great or even ok computer.  My video holds me back heavily so these older titles that keep running mean a lot to me cause it lets me play still.  And do not come and give me a reply saying, oh but look at planetside 2 its free to play.....That game doesn't count mainly because it was made by a multi million dollar company, sony.  So in the end for me I give this game for what is a 7/10 not the greatest but trust me if you look past a few things which you have to do in free to play multiplayer fps's its not a bad game.","August 2, 2015","true","8.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, "If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately." Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- "Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.","June 23, 2015","false","11.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","0","0","3","3","0"

I'd say cs:go even took features from this game to add to theirs.\n\nAlthough it hasn't been updated since 2012, I stilled managed to get a game instantly in November 2014 and had many postivies\n\nPositives:\n♦ Matches a short\n♦ Matches are fun\n♦ Good Voice over when playing Capture the Zone to tell you when an enemy has caputred/started capturing a zone\n♦ Good idea to get crates from killing people which can be unlocked for a small price to get premium weapons\n♦ Definitely didn't seem pay to win\n♦ Epic level system and skill system\n♦ Balanced (I hadn't played since 2012 and I was getting first place... go figure)\n♦ Has ingame currency and premium currency\n♦ Free to Play\n♦ Fun\n♦ Lots of Achievements\n♦ Definitely no hackers from what I saw\n♦ Epic number of weapons and loadouts\n\nThe only negatives I saw are:\n\nNegatives:\n♦ No updates since 2012\n♦ Premium Weapons Expire\n♦ Not able to trade Premium Weapons and items on Steam like in cs:go\n\n\nOverall, in my opinion, the game is a really fun FPS concidering it was made in 2011 with no updates in 2012. Things are payable to get but don't need to be and don't give you an advantage over others who didn't pay for items. Really well built, love the level system and the ingame voice overs/crate idea. One of the best FPS's for todays times that I'd highly recommend.\n\nOverall, I'd rate this 3/5!\n\nPS: It'd be a 5/5 if it was still updated. Though it's still active and I didn't see any hackers. I got a game instantly as of November 2014 and I got First Place on my team and I hadn't played since 2012. Also, I have killed 96 players 10 levels higher than me... so before you say this review is biased or I haven't played enough... go figure.","November 8, 2014","true","5.6"," 10 of 24 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","10","24","0","0"

It's almost a "Bootleg Battlefield" game. The graphics are ♥♥♥♥ poor, all the sounds sound terrible, for some reason when you walk on rocks it sounds like you are walking on a metal platform. I'd like to say the weapon sounds are almost 100% taken from unity engine. Also the guns are ♥♥♥♥. Snipers do about 1-3 hits to kill someone, a normal secondary (ex; smg) will kill you in 0.5 seconds. The download in the client took about 20 minutes. Also, in the client and screenshots, there are girls. But I did not see a single girl in this game.\n\nALSO ALL THE RECONS LOOK LIKE GIANT SASQUATCHS.

The game misleads you into thinking that it operates off of a hybrid system where you can choose to spend money to take shortcuts to get gear quickly(through Gamedollars), or earn them legitimately through gameplay (Gamepoints earned from kills and other achievements like in CoD). The problem is that gamepoints are practically worthless, and actually don't allow you to buy any items but only rent them for a few days instead, and only from a small selection at that. It also gets harder and harder to get gamepoints. The only way to change your gear from what you began with permanently is to open your wallet.\n\nIt's a total piece of crap.

That game that's so bad it had to change it's name to Infestation: Survivor Stories...War Inc is from the same developers and it's just as bad as WarZ. Let's see...\n\nWar Inc is F2P third-person shooter with the usual F2P shooter stuff: play matches to get EXP and money, Level up your character to unlock new gear, customize your character and weapons, buy new gear, rise to the top of the leaderboards, etc... Sounds simple right?\n\nWell, this game is SO simple it hurts: Kill people, don't die...But the game can't even do that right. The weapons feel really bad, every single animation looks like crap, the gameplay is the most shallow and boring I've ever seen in a third-person shooter, and then obviously there's that other mistake usually committed by the geniuses that make games like these...\n\nThe cash shop... or should I say, the only kind of shop in the game, is the biggest joke ever! It's similar to theHunter: The player gets some basic equipment at level 1 and then the rest is all premium stuff. The difference between the cash shop in theHunter and War Inc is that in War Inc you need to pay in order to fire you weapons... Literally. In every map there's an ammo box where players can resupply to keep playing but to open the box you need a key that you have to buy with premium currency. Bottom line, if you don't get that key, you have to suicide every once in a while because all your weapons only come with a couple magazines and there's no other way to get ammo outside that ammo box.\n\nCrappy maps, crappy gamemodes, crappy everything. Another free robbery! This game is completely empty, no one plays it and no one really should... Another flop from the creators of WarZ or Infestation: Survivor Stories or whatever it's called now.\n\nScore: 1/5\n\nSimolius - June 2014","June 26, 2014","false","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is no point in playing if you can't even keep anything. O, you're going to grind for days?

I Understand they need to make money, but there are ways to do it and not destroy game progression. Why can't you open loot crates you find in battle? Those cost real money too.\n\nIt's not a bad game. It's just pointless with the current unlock system. This game isn't truely free to play.  It's pay to keep any progress.\n\nI first played this game when it first came out a few years ago, and yes you could spend actual money on it, but I remember being able to keep some stuff and open loot crates without spending real money.\n\nIt's sad to see the game developers get this money hungry.","November 29, 2014","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It also has an odd loading time, and I find that connecting to a server is hard. Yes the gameplay is fine for anyone who enjoys a good shooter, but on the other side it was a pretty bad game. The graphics were also pretty terrible. I suggest if your bored you install this game and give it a shot.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/--scatty--/recommended/107900/","--scatty--","scatty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/--scatty--/","71 products in account","Also....War Inc. ist ein F2P, also sollte man: - nicht zu viel erwarten\n- Pay 2 Win erwarten\nMan kann sich dort Waffen und anderen Gedöns für Ectgeld dazu kaufen. Die mit Echtgeld gekauften Waffen und Panzerungen hat man ganz klar Vorteile gegen über den anderen. Jedoch kann man auch ohne etwas zu bezahlen mithalten. Die Anfangswaffe, die M16, ist nicht zu unterschätzen! Jedoch ist sie jetzt auch nicht das Gelbe vom Ei. Ich finde es ein bischen schade, dass man wenige Waffen für Ingame Geld kaufen kann, und die die man kaufen kann sich mega teuer, so dass es eine Zeit dauern wird bis man das Geld zusammen hat. Der größte Minuspunkt sind die Hacker. Aber naja...Hammerpoint...Mehr muss man nicht sagen.\nFazit: Es ist ein netter F2P Shooter in dem leider recht viel gehackt wird und das Spielen so unmöglich macht. Wenn man mal ohne Hacker ist macht es doch recht viel Spaß, auch ohne etwas zu bezahlen.\n\nTipp: Spielt in der Third-Person- Perspektive. Das bringt euch einen imensen Vorteil!","July 24, 2013","true","44.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But that could have been a result of me being in the wrong country to access the servers.
