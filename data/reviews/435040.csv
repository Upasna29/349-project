This game in places requires some well thought out strategy even in relaxed casual (not timed) mode.  The biographies/profiles of the characters are worth the read.\n\nStoryline: Count Dracula decides to get modern and look for mate using an online dating system.  Having found "the perfect one" he goes to meet her only to discover she is nothing like her online profile. (That should be of no surprise! LOL) However, the Princess has matrimony on her mind and chases after Dracula, who runs away from her.\n\n45 levels in the main game, 15 levels in the bonus chapter, and 3 modes, normal timed, relaxed (not timed), and timed multi-click (This is where the player can click on as many items as are available forming an item pick up cue).  What makes this game different for others is 1) interactive tabs for potions. crafting, and magic (3 each by game end), 2) clothing with a bonus ability attached (awarded during gameplay), and 3) powerups used for increasing supplies which upgrade during gameplay.  Late in the game there is a powerup upgrade that allows for upgrading all supply buildings at once (That is so nice and such a resource saver).  There are also "finds" that occur over the course of gameplay (main and bonus): princess statues (60, one per level), gift boxes (30, gives in-game 'stickers'), princess posters (6), and black cats (13).  Plus there are 3 extra 'secret' finds - death's scythe, alien, and sheep-king - found somewhere in the game. (Yes, I know where they are, and no, I am not telling, that would be a spoiler.)\n\nMost, if not all, achievements can be earned during gameplay. (Note: Once a level is open the player can go back without having to play the entire game over).\n\nPlays well and fast, the upgrades keep the gameplay fresh, the "finds" are a fun extra, and the storyline is amusing enough to keep the player interested.  Excellent game.  I highly recommend it.","February 21","true","25.4"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","3"

Thus, when I heard of this game, called "Incredible Dracula: Chasing Love," I knew I had to play it. I expected a funny game and hoped for enjoyable gameplay. Much to my delight, it shot beyond both of those desires and kept me hooked for two days straight to finish all of the levels.\n\nLet me be upfront here: I have never played a resource manager game. I tend to be awful at real-time strategy games, and there is indeed a time limit for ranking purposes. Thank goodness it does not result in game overs, or I would have gotten frustrated with it. Instead, I found it a lot of fun to piece together how to best beat the levels and gather a ton of resources. This was my first experience with the genre, and I could not have asked for a better introduction.\n\nPros:\nHilarious dialogue and story-telling. Check out the character profiles for some really amusing writing. The story sections in each level are also quite short, so a few clicks can easily speed you through it if you don't want to reread it (or read it in the first place, but you're missing out if you do).\nFantastic tutorial that holds your hand for the first level, and then pops in to explain new mechanics as they arise.\nNew mechanics are introduced throughout the entire game. Many of them can be linked to old ones with a slight change, but others are completely new. Both are welcome changes when they arrive, keeping the game from getting stale.\nThere are forty-five levels with no two being quite the same. Fifteen more are added to the collector's edition, making for sixty levels total. This length is great, with it taking me about seventeen hours (of my current eighteen) to beat them all. People used to this genre could probably be quicker at it.\nRather than having to play through the game again to get to levels, you can choose to replay each level from the map. It's great if you missed one of the hidden objects or want to try getting a top rank for a stage.\nDespite being very easy to learn, it is difficult to master. I love games like this. It lets casual players have fun with simply playing it, and it has the difficulty needed to entertain those who want a challenge.\nIt ran smoothly for me without much lag. I played on Windows 7. It's not a huge game in terms of MB size, either, so that's a bonus.\nThe art is charming, and the graphics are pretty good. You even get some full-fledged art screens during important parts of the story.\nMost of the voice acting is great. The one exception for me is so hilarious that I forgive it by default.\nThere are hidden collectables in each level. With four different types to look for, and at least one being in every level, this is great for people who enjoy hidden object challenges (like me.) They are just for fun, so anyone who does not want to can safely ignore them.\nIf you need help, there is a very handy strategy guide included in this edition. I did not use it for my run, but I checked it out after I was done and found it to be quite useful.\nThe achievements are, for the most part, not too difficult to obtain. I enjoyed collecting them and am glad they are here.\nYou have a zombie butler named Rufus. Really, that should be the only justification you need for buying this game.\nNeutral:\nThere are only five music tracks in the game. I actually like all five. However, they can get repetitive at times.\nSome of the pop culture references could be seen as either amusing or groan-worthy.\nThe "man runs from woman because she is ugly" cliche could be considered present here. However, given the personality this woman has, I can understand why Dracula is freaked out by her. His fault for trusting a dating site.\nThere are no trading cards. Some people might care about that. I am indifferent to it.\nEDIT (2/24/16): Trading cards are now available! Props to the developers for adding them in.\nCons:\nThere is one gimmick where guards can delevel/destroy your buildings. I found this to be really annoying and not much fun. Thankfully, this only occurs in two levels and never shows up again.\nFor me, it is difficult to tell which ruined buildings are which without hovering over them. It is a small matter to be picky about, but it would have been nice to make it easier to tell them apart. That being said, I am not sure if many other people would have this problem.\nOnly a few scenes have the amusing voice acting. The zombie noises when you give them commands get tedious after a while.\nThere are no names for each level. It would help if they had names to make it easier to remember which is which, instead of trying to find "the one with crabs on strike" (no really) by number alone.\nOverall experience:\n\nI planned to play Incredible Dracula: Chasing Love about five hours to write a solid review. Then it kept throwing new mechanics at me. I felt it was only fair to see them through for the most accurate review I could give. But I also admit that I was glad for the excuse, because I was hooked. I even plan on going back to try and get some better ranks in the levels. I had an absolute blast with this game, especially with it having legitimately good humor.\n\nRating:\n\n9/10. No really, I tried to find a justification for rating it lower than that and I couldn't. That's how much fun I had. If you do not absolutely loathe resource management games, get Incredible Dracula: Chasing Love. You won't be disappointed.\n\nLooking for more great indie games?

However, as he is new at this dating business, he quickly finds out that the photo display on a profile may not be the real deal. Well, put yourself in his coffin! He expected to date a beautiful lady Vampire, not a human princess who is looking to steal his freedom! That would be a shock if your name was Dracula! In any case, Count Dracula has 45 days to rescue the princess from unrequited love. That’s going to be b.l.o.o.d.y hard!\n\nIncredible Dracula: Chasing Love Collector’s Edition is a Strategy / simulation type of game where you have to achieve one or several objectives in a minimum amount of time per level to claim three golden stars. Here, you will control count Dracula minions (or workers). They will have to pick up resources such as: food, logs of wood, stones, tools and money. These items will help you to repair run-down buildings like the famous hamburger place, “Blood Donald!” Also, the road will have plenty of obstacles to remove and it will cost you food every time you do so. Make sure you have plenty of this resource in your cape! You will have access to some special abilities -  to speed up building construction, remove obstacles – to speed up your minion movement or even stop the time for a little while, which will help you to earn your 3 golden stars at the end of each level. If you find a specific level too hard, you can refer to the strategy guide, which is really helpful and has great hints. In terms of modes, this game has three - Normal mode if you are an experienced player, Multi-click mode, which allows you to assign multiple tasks to your workers, and Relaxed mode, which does not have a time limit.\n\nOn top of that, you have to find and collect other items which are scattered within all levels. If you are like me, you probably hover over without noticing them, but look for gifts, black cats, portraits and statuettes.\n\nI really like the graphics and animations. I especially like Rufus listening to music while standing behind a lawn mower (first level), very funny! You will use your mouse to give an order to your minions or to Count Dracula. The soundtrack is good and reflects the game very well.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	45 levels in the main game + 15 in the bonus chapter\n-	Good graphics and animations\n-	Good tutorial & Strategy guide\n-	Fun Gameplay and challenging\n-	Achievements and trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Can be very hard to get the 3 golden stars from an early stage (normal mode)\n\nSometimes chasing L.O.V.E can bite you straight back in the bum. Just ask Dracula! Great game to have in your library!\n\n9/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

This such a game, but this game is actually way better.\nThe music and and the voice acting are so lovely and cozy, it's so comforting.\nThe tutorial is fantasticly implented, it's easy to learn and not even so hard to master.\nIt's a relaxing game to play after a hard day of work, or just for people that wants to relax with a game.\n\nI don't have more to tell so let's continue with the usual ratings:\n\n#### PROS ####\n\nDesign is really really nice, it's polished, it's finished, it's just great!\nMusic and voice acting is well done, it's cozy and lovely.\nGameplay is really nice, challenging, but still very relaxed.\nTons of content available\nA good bunch of achievements which keeps it fun after hours and hours.\n#### CONS ####\n\nAchievements are updated after you open or close the game, that's really bad to be honest.\nAchievements:\nI discovered that the achievements were not update real time and that was really a bummer for me as i really liked the reward of completing a level or a task in real time.\nI'm getting the achievements after i closed the game and that's working properly but that might be a good improvement.\nAnd now i can say at least one bad thing that could be improved, otherwise i would only have noted positive points as this game is close to perfect. Can't say anything negative except the achievements issue.\n\nSpecial effects:\nI added this later to the review since i changed my mind about no needed improvements, this game could be even more better if they could implent some more animations like mouse hoovering or more animations with special effects, that would make the game 10/10 .\n\nSummary:\nIt's a great game and it's amazing that it managed to have no negative points so close to release date, they made a good game and waited till it was the right moment to release this game.\nWe love it at ReviewExperts, I'm looking forward to more and more alawar games.\n\nHappy puzzling ! Happy Haunting hehe !\n\n\nPS: We got a free copy of this game provided by the developers","January 30","true","3.8"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","12","24","0","0"
