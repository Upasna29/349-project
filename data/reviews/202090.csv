And I do mean "ever".  Upon first glances it might seem to one that this is a MOBA.  It definitely has those characteristics, but I'd go so far as to classify this is an "unconventional" fighting game.\n\nLike a fighting game, you have to know and master your character's abilities--attacks, defenses, counters, etc.  Like the original Magicka, you are using 8 keys (QWERASDF) to create DOZENS of spells on the fly, although in this one there is only three slots for each element.  Also similar to a fighting game is the fact that there is telegraphing.  Each spell queued up is visible to your opponent for a split secdon, so he/she will be able to react accordingly.  This leads to extremely fast gameplay that requires some really good reflexes.\n\nThe downside is that this game is has a VERY high learning curve to anyone who never played the original Magicka.  You will need to devote as much time and effort to learning the spells and casting them (which just means you have to learn to type FAST) as you would any "conventional" fighting game.  This has turned off a lot of new players (just look at the steamcharts) because they either become frustrated or just don't have the interest in devoting that much time to a game.\n\nHOWEVER, to anyone who has taken the time to learn this game throughout, it becomes very apparent that the developers of this game are GENIUSES and that this really is one of the best most action packed 100% skill based PVP games that he/she has ever played.","November 19, 2014","true","966.5"," 118 of 131 people (90%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","90","118","131","11","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Argotha_MWW/recommended/202090/","Argotha_MWW","[TA] Argotha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Argotha_MWW/","93 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhat is a Wizard?\n\nThis game is all about skill. It is PURE skill. Said skill is demonstrated in real time via mechanical execution, muscle-memory, level-headedness, reaction, anticipation, situational awareness, adaptation, and mind games. It is the purest test of all-around personal, gaming capability. All of these are intricately tied to and driven by the first listed skill form: mechanical execution. Mechanical execution is the core of the game. It enables the test of level-headedness. Mechanical execution, and all other forms of skill, suffers when under pressure. Keeping your cool is necessary to not fumble spells. It is necessary to successfully cast the correct spell.\n\nIt tests a player’s personal muscle-memory potential. A large number of spells are possible. Because each of these must be cast extremely quickly at any given moment, muscle memory is formed and tested by repeated mechanical execution.\n\nIt perfectly tests reaction in both parts; reflexive speed and quick decision making. Using the correct spell in reaction to an opponent’s action is necessary for survival. Being able to successfully cast a given spell in reaction to an opponent, before said opponent can pull off an action or combo, requires fast and correct, mechanical execution. Warding !SES before an opponent can detonate SES is a perfect and common example of this in practice.\n\nExtending from reaction is situational awareness and anticipation. The possession of such ability comes from ascending beyond deliberately typing spells to effortlessly casting spells. This is a challenge on muscle-memory. When a player is focusing on how to cast a spell, that player cannot anticipate actions and that player has limited capability to “see” the battlefield; the mind is too consumed with casting that spell. However, when enough of the proper actions and reactions are truly mastered, a player can begin to anticipate things and think beyond casting a spell. One can innately know the next spell to cast in a combo, know the proper counter to it, know if the opponent will be able to defend in time, and, not only know what the opponent would potentially do to stop the player, but which action(s) that opponent is most likely to do in the current situation.\n\nBut, if muscle memory is needed to attain situational awareness, and by extension, anticipation, why not remove it so that players can immediately partake of and enjoy the “end-game”? The answer is that anticipation is a test of muscle memory, not that muscle-memory is a needless gate into anticipation.\n\nSo, how does anticipation test muscle memory? This is where adaptation and mind games come in. Certain common combos become expected. Rather quickly, a player realizes that SES is generally followed by back-pedaling with FFF. This is anticipation. By anticipating the FFF one might summon an !E to nullify that FFF, thereby preventing the detonation of the mines. However, that player may also anticipate said reaction and shoot QRS to detonate the mines. One may realize that player understands this concept and drops an EDF instead, overwriting some of the mines, blocking FFF if that player uses it, and blocking some of the ice if the player uses that. There are a handful of “correct” decisions that can be made in reaction to such a combo and there are a handful of ways to adapt that combo. All of these further test muscle memory and mechanical execution.\n\nPlayers must predict what each other will do and set up chains of attacks and tactics to throw an opponent off. This is the key. This is everything. This is the true test. By fighting an opponent that is trying to throw you off, you must be capable of casting the correct spells with which to defend against that player’s attacks. You must have more spells locked in your muscle memory to be able to throw your opponent off. Each opponent that takes you down offers you a lesson. You learn a new potential combo or attack chain. You use that knowledge against others and prevail until someone devises a tactic that negates it. And.. then you learn again.\n\nThis is what makes a wizard better than another wizard. The better wizard knows more spells. The better wizard can cast those spells faster. The better wizard knows which spells are best for each situation and knows how other wizards will react to those spells in those situations. The better wizard can probe the weaker wizard, feeling out that wizard’s style and skill level; a tendency toward an element, a tendency toward a specific spell or tactic. The better wizard can exploit that style, turning it into a weakness. When the same is done to the better wizard, the better wizard adapts and turns it back on the weaker wizard, throwing him off guard, thus putting him on the defensive. Mind games.\n\nWizarding is the truest test of pure skill and intelligence. I love it. Thank you so much devs.","October 14, 2014","true","638.6"," 82 of 93 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","82","93","4","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Keisensei/recommended/202090/","Keisensei","fuck games","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Keisensei/","51 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nHighly competitive fast pased action game, probably one of the best arena team games on steam along with dota 2.\nIt plays almost like a fighting game during duel mode because its 1v1 bo3, using mix ups, corner pressure, combos to punish your opponent, reads and defense with rock paper scissors, but the difference is everyone is in the same boat, with access to the same spells, the only difference is knowledge, speed, counters, damage combos and position and there is always someone better than you to verse. The skill ceiling is quite high you need to practice your muscle memory, and spell rotations in training mode, and to constantly think about how to punish your opponent for their mistakes, its very challenging and really fun.\n\nThe other mode is warfare which is basically the meat and potatoes of the game, its the team portion of the game and is played 4v4, the objective is to stop the opponents from respawning and kill them one last time, this is done either by reducing the tokens to 0 by capping spawn points, killing enemies and letting the tokens drain by maintaining spawn points, or to capture all the spawns on the map in your teams favor and killing them, because without it they cannot respawn. There are a few different maps, maps with 3 spawns, or maps with 4 spawns, as well as some with teleporters to move around the different sections of the map. Its rather simple, but like all good team games, there is lots of depths due to how you position around the map, and how you control your opponents. You and your teammates can come up with different ways to win, maybe by holding more spawn points, and pushing the enemy into an area of the map where they are trapped, or maybe you want to use your healing spells to push through and try to capture somewhere else, by rotating differently everytime, it can get quite complex, but it is really fun and i cant wait to see how the game shapes up in the future, with more maps, more magicks to use (which cost meter by killing people, capturing spawns and slowly going up over time by itsself).\n\nThere are different robes to customise your wizard with, and some are quite cool, and the rest rather funny, its Magicka after all. You can also team kill your teammates, which can be funny, and there is a time and place for it. Though it does help with the competitive nature of the game, because you have to be careful and to judge if its best to use particular spells or not.\n\nThe community is awesome for the most part, everyone of all levels if you stick around will become invested, and will get to know people who are serious about getting better at the game, or having fun (though this can be seen as negative because the community is so small with a lack of much growth at the moment)\n\nPros :\n8 different spells to master different combos\nindividuality with the weapons and robes\nfunny magicka humour\ncompetitive\nrefreshing new type of f2p game on the market\ngreat community\nhigh skill ceiling\n\nCons :\nhigh level of entry (you need to invest lots of time to get comfortable)\nbad netcode\nhigher skill cap that most games\nsmall community\n\n","January 30, 2015","true","906.3"," 70 of 76 people (92%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","92","70","76","8","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aetrym/recommended/202090/","Aetrym","Aetrym","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aetrym/","166 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is the perfect test of skill when it comes to videogames. It comes down to two things: muscle-memory and anticipation. In Magicka: Wizard Wars you use the keys QWER and ASDF to chain elements together. Once elements have been "Queued" up, you can decide whether to cast it on yourself, or in front of you.\n\nThere are many different "types" of spells such as mines, walls, beams, cones, and wards, and depending on which elements you choose and how you cast them, you could make a steam explosion around you, or a flame cone in front of you, or a geyser rock wall to seperate you from your enemies.\n\nThe basic Wizard Wars game is played in a map with two teams of four. The objective is to deny your enemies the ability to spawn by either depleting their spawn tokens, or capturing all the spawn points on the map, preventing the enemies from respawning. Matches can take anywhere from 2 minutes to an hour or more, depending on the skill of the wizards. Sometimes the fights just don't seem to end, because two players can predict each others moves so accurately.\n\nThere are endless numbers of magicka-style robes, staves, weapons, and "trinkets" to unlock for your wizard, their appearances ranging from "badass" to "pink" and "why?" There are even chances to get exceptionally rare items, like my golden merfolk robe that has a blue magikarp for the hood. Yes, as in the pokemon.\n\nEvery item gives you the opportunity to change your playstyle: Robes, Staves, and Trinkets alter your affinities for each spell, lending more power to different elements. Weapons offer different melee attacks, and sometimes have elemental properties, like adding flame or frost to your strikes.\n\nOverall, MWW is one of the best, most well-polished games I've ever played on steam, regardless of the early access tag. Nothing is overpowered, nothing is underpowered, Every match is a unique experience, filled with unique wizards. The only thing this game needs is more players. So please, give Wizard Wars a try. If you find yourself being pummeled each and every match, ask someone for help, or practice memorizing your favorite spells in the training grounds. You'll get it in no time.","March 26, 2015","true","46.7"," 67 of 72 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","67","72","4","1"

Wizard Wars is NOT a MOBA but is much more skill-based with complexity coming from combat rather than the items and levels that you see in MOBAs. Using Magicka's unique magic system (using raw elements in combo-presses for different effects), this game's combat is structured chaos with experienced players playing mindgames amongst each other within an inprejudice a storm of destruction. Robes, melee and staves can improve certain stats and elemental affinities but take away from others, which allows you to specialize but have to change strategy once the enemy realizes what you're up to by adapting, making the game completely balanced. It's a system where the player "levels up" as they play rather than the character, in true fighter fashion. I could go on about how much this game reminds me of an arena/fighting game but I HIGHLY recommend everyone buy this.

Now, two years later, Paradox Interactive has created an amazing PvP Spellcasting Action game.  This game focuses on a four-on-four PvP deathmatch with three control points that serve as spawn points.  This is where I think the weakest point of the game is.  If you can't spawn, you lose.  That means that you can win or lose the game in 2 minutes.  This is pretty bad.  But that's about the only thing I don't like.  Another thing that has changed from the original is that you can only have three elements active instead of the usual five.   This means that there is less spells availible, but works because this is a fast paced game.  Overall, this game is great and will be free-to-play when it is officially released.  9/10","November 25, 2013","true","34.3"," 48 of 55 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","48","55","0","0"

Now is your chance. It will be probably frustrating experience for few hours (as you can see, reviews section is full of ppl with 10 hours played calling this game "terrible"), but once you get quick on controls, and learn to properly counter, it will be very enjoyable experience. And once you mastered basics, you can start making your own combos, develop your playstyle, customise your gear to suit you the best, and throw various "specials" (as you kill stuff, they are fulfilling a bar located at the botton of the screen, once you reached some focus, you can cast special spells called Magicks) at your enemies.

Seeing it grow was an inspiring and grand thing to experience. While I never got the blue founder robes (thanks Obama) and there were clear balance issues, this game was astonishing. Even though my hundreds of dollars worth of DLC will soon vanish, and I sit in my green wizard robe, I still believe that money was well spent. I met friends and companions, and found myself in one of the most supportive and loving communities I've ever encountered. So much so that I memorized every single error code so that I could help new players run the game.\n\nVery early on, there was criticism about the ability to call up 3 rather than 5 elements at any given point. Then there were debates over whether an element was "death" or "arcane" (the answer is arcane). Next came issues with servers, as an expert was needed to fix the netcode. Then were concerns of the game being "Pay 2 Win," something it never was. Tragedy struck as wizards soon lost their precious snowballs, but were soon presented with a chest that always mocked my very existence. We lost our gems soon after, only to reclaim them in the end with a new crafting system and masteries. Despite what I know some in the community felt, I thought each update was a step in the right direction for an already masterpiece of a game.\n\nSo do I recommend this game?\nYes.\nEven when the servers shut down, and you can not play, I believe that this game is worth downloading. Having this game at all is something that you should be proud of.\n\nAnd to the dev team:\nYou worked long and hard to make this game, and even after this game ends I will not forget that. It may not have been the huge phenomenon that we all hoped it would rightfully become, but it was to me one of the greatest games I have ever experienced. I wish you all the best in the future!\n\nI guess the only thing I have left to say is this:\n\nglhf","May 26","true","785.3"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","23","23","0","3"

No lanes, no gold, no leveling, no warding, no mana, just eight elements that you can combine to your heart's desire in 5-10 minute games. There are also Magicks, which are similar to skills in other MOBAs, powerful spells that spice up the gameplay a lot. Usually because that one noob cast Meteor Shower on your entire team by accident.\n\nThis game is not pay-to-win. You can purchase in-game money with real cash and XP boosters but that's it. Your character gains XP after each game and when you level up, you gain Mastery Points, which you can invest in unlocking new robes, staves, weapons and Magicks. You can also buy variants of everything but Magicks in the store, as well as consumable Magick scrolls. Robes and staves each have an affinity. These boost your wizard's affinity towards an element(Or Health/Speed), while removing the same amount from its opposite. You could be an extremely effective Lightning wizard but fully charged 3xEarth spells take off half your health, making skill the deciding factor.\n\nTo beat your opponents you need to kill them. That seems easy and button-mashy but it isn't. You will die a lot when you first play this game. It's incredibly challenging and rewarding once you get the hang of it. A few basic things to know is when to ward(personal shield, self-cast shield and any two elements) and when to switch wards, when to fight and when to retreat, what spells to be using and at what distance you should be fighting at.\n\nIf you've played the original Magicka, it's a bit less chaotic and far more fair, with a couple of other changes. You can only queue three elements at once, Steam and Ice no longer appear as their own element in the queue when combining Fire/Water and Cold/Water respectively, Lightning now has priority over Life/Death, Self-Cast now doubles as AOE, sword enchanting is gone, and casting with no elements uses your weapon instead of pushing air.\n\nAnd for ♥♥♥♥s sake, don't use a life ward.","April 29, 2015","true","54.5"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","19","23","3","2"

I played during the alpha when the networking was different and much less penalizing overall for people playing on their "home" region. The new networking really emphasizes a terrible attitude towards and implementation of regional inclusiveness. It would actually be less bad if they didn't have those "servers" at all because at least they wouldn't be trying to trick people into a subpar service.\n\nAt some point during the alpha, the game was very close to balanced. Nowadays, the developers, for the most part, look like they have no idea what they're doing and bugs appear in situations that don't really seem possible and their in-game store sometimes leaks contents and causes game-breaking problems. Overall, although the game wasn't as stable, it was very close to balanced during alpha, but they kept changing things using a strategy that resembled "doing random things and hope people either stop playing or stop complaining about imbalances".\n\nRecently the developers tried to sponsor a competition that had the most broken format for a game I've ever seen. It was, more or less, "Magicka: Farming Simulator". The goal was to get the most points per minute on average across your team. It wasn't even sealed to be amongst only players competing. It didn't encourage skilled teams to confront each other, in fact it encouraged skilled players to dodge one another (because skilled players facing off would cause both teams to lower their score average), and to repeatedly fight new players and farm them for as many points as possible.\n\nAll-in-all, the game has potential but the developers are pretty much taking every move possible to make it as unsuccessful as possible, it's a project I regret being involved with, and is starting to seem like worse misuse of the Magicka franchise than Wizards of the Square Tablet.","September 8, 2014","false","804.9"," 61 of 106 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","61","106","2","2"

It is a fast paced and very reflexive game that is almost entirely based off of skill. In order to be successful in the game, you must conjure all types of spells and defenses to counter all of the actions your opposition is preforming. When you are playing with other players, however, teamwork is the most essential part of the game. To be successful, you need to resurrect and heal your allies.\n\n\nThere are 4 game modes in Magicka Wizard Wars. All of them are 4 v 4 with the exception of the Dueling mode.\n\n\nWizard Warfare: There are 3 or 4 control points on the map that function as the primary objective of the game. You must capture and protect them or the other team will control the map and corner you. They function as spawn points. If the enemy team captures all of the spawn points, your team can no longer respawn. While they are captured, they will also wear down the opposing team's "Spawn Tokens" at a rate that depends on how many you have captured. Once all of the enemy's spawn tokens are exhausted, the enemy team may no longer spawn. When all of the enemy team has been killed, you will win the game.\n\n\nTeam Deathmatch: This one is pretty self explanatory but... Team deathmatch is a mode which the goal is the eliminate all members of the enemy team. Once all of the enemy team is eliminated, your team will get a point and the game will restart. When one team obtains 3 points, that team wins the entire game.\n\n\nSoul Harvest: This is a unique game mode where the goal is the harvest souls from the monsters that randomly spawn all over the map. Once you obtain a certain number of souls, you may attack the enemy statue, known as an Effigy, and destroy it. Once the enemy team's effigy has been destroyed, you will win the game.\n\n\nDuel: This is a game mode where 2 players clash in a battle of pure skill. Once the game starts, it will position one player at each side of the map. Once it starts, the goal is to kill the opposing player. Once you kill the opposing player, the game will restart and one point will be given to the victor. When one of the players has obtained 3 points, that player will win the game.\n\n\nMagicks: Magicks are spells that you cannot cast with your normal elemental combinations. You need to activate them to use. They are extremely powerful and grant an element of diversity and complexity to the game. Some spells make massive meteorites rain from the sky to damage players, while others may just resurrect fallen allies. Spells have no cooldown, but rather use a focus bar as a resource which gradually charges as the match goes on. Although the magick's role on the game is important, getting new magicks is not a large advantage over the starter ones, and you can test out magicks you want to buy from the spell scrolls you get.\n\n\nWeapons: The weapons generally don't play a large part in the game, and are mostly just used for cosmetic appeal. However, you can unlock new weapons to gain new weapon abilities. None of the weapons' melee attacks are really better than other's, so the only reason to buy weapons is for the ability or for the looks.\n\n\nEquipment & Affinities: Equipment does not actually give you any defensive value, but increase your prowess in one area of magic. For example, if you were to buy a fire robe that increases your fire affinity, than you will get increased power with fire spells. However, there is a sacrifice for getting an increase in one area of magic; it will decrease your power in another area of magic. So if you were to equip a fire robe, it would make all of your arcane attacks weaker. Because of this, your equipment does not really play a large role in the game.\n\n\nLeveling System:\nThe leveling system is the only way to unlock new magicks. You can also unlock new gear with it. This is one of the major problems I have with the game. It takes an incredible amount of time to level up, but you cannot see anything about what you are unlocking. There are no absolute resources for the game to preview what you are getting, so essentially you will not know what tree you will be going into until you actually spend many many hours unlocking that tree.\n\n\nShop System: The shop is another major way to unlock the gear you want. You can buy new weapons and armor at the shop to increase your cosmetic appeal or specialize in an affinity. This is another problem I have with the game: you cannot know what you are buying from the shop until you buy it.\n\n\nI'm glad that none of the gear actually plays a large part in how you play the game... otherwise you could mess yourself up from the start if you picked a bad set.\n\n\nPro/Con:\nPros:\n-Free to play\n-Not pay-to-win\n-Fast Paced (can be negative depending on how you look at it)\n-Complex Gameplay: all of the counters and counters to the counters make this a very complex game to play.\n-Skill Based\n\n\nCons:\n-Mysterious leveling system and shop system: you do not know what you are buying.\n-Lack of exterior resources: the wiki is lacking in information and there is virtually no place to find info. about the gear you want\n-Leveling up takes an eternity","August 27, 2015","true","686.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Everything is to do with skill and muscle-memory. The matchmaking can be a little weird, but players are usually fairly friendly if you play by the rules. Team members can also be killed so be careful, remember to heal them if they are getting low, and they might return the favor. Everyone has access to all spells by combining up to 3 elements, so it is fairly balanced. There are 8 elements in total, Fire (F), Earth (D), Death (S), Lightning (A), Cold (R), Shield (E), Life (W), and Water (Q). Dealing damage to your opponents is important, but be sure to use wards (self-cast E with other elements) to protect yourself as well as walls & storms.\n\nDon't forget there is also a duel mode where you can battle 1v1 to strengthen your skills. You can also buy new robes; staffs; rings and trinkets to boost certain elements, but they will also reduce another element, so be careful.\n\nI've written a guide for beginners including the basic spells along with explaining the use of gear, and how to obtain new items via the Store, Mastery Tree and Crafting. If you are new to the game, I highly suggest you take a look at it or some of the other good guides.\n\nAlso, If your having technical troubles with the game which some people do experience, the discussions is a great place, Myself and many others are there to help. The discussions is a good place to just talk about the game too, as well as the official Paradox Forums, and the community is quite friendly.\n\n~ Cyan\nModerator for MWW Discussions, and a huge fan of the game.

If you lose there's no excuse aside from potential lag. The enemy's character wasn't a hard counter to yours, he didn't have an overpowered weapon or powerup, he wasn't camping in the same spot for hours, the game isn't pay to win and if your own team sucks you can choose to queue up to duel matches instead.\n\nThe gameplay is the same good ol' gameplay from the original Magicka with appropriate balance tweaks and it's fun fun fun. Unless you have a personal grudge against wizards or multiplayer pvp I would say there's no reason for you not to try this game.","October 6, 2014","true","52.3"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Something that alot of people would like to know if this is a P2W or a Pl2W game, i have to say its a Play to win game at this state as everything in the store that gives you a advantage in a certain element dosent give you a disadvantage on another element (basically you buy a fire staff it gives you +10 fire dmg but it will also give you -10 water dmg etc.) so theres nothing that is unblanaced in the store so put your hearts at ease if you just cant seem to get a kill then... (try harder! you will get one eventually i promise!) but something that i personally think that the game needs working is the price of some of the items in the store like the highest price i saw was 6.99 for a robe that looks diffrent but has the same stats as another robe in the store. Daymn! Somethings in the game are quite annoying but realistic such as friendly fire is on, which means that some troll in the game decides to freeze all his teammates in place with the ice element or set them on fire, and theres a revive skill (its a special ablility) you would think that this only works on teammates... BUT no you can revive your opposing team once i burnt a guy to ashes but my teammate died next to him and i revived him but also revive the other guy, so we had to kill him again but hey free kills! Anyways i would very much recommend this game i'll give it a 9.5/10 very well done for a F2P early acess alpha game","January 10, 2015","true","7.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","8","11","2","0"

Sure they grant you buffs for certain abilities, but depending on the opponent, you can doom yourself from the start by for example, weakening your earth resistance in order to not get electrocuted, and someone shoots a boulder at you. Of course some of the magicks are powerful, but say you try to set a guy on fire, and his robe is fire resistant. Sometimes the best weapon may turn out to be the defau- *ahem* "Staff of Dufalt"\n\nCompetitive: They really thought out the spell system well. There is a counter for almost every spell, so if you can figure out what they are attacking you with- HEY! What did I say about firing Arcane bolts at the Wizard Counselor while HE'S REVIEWING?!?!- sorry about that, now where was I... Ahh yes, so if you can figure out what they are attacking you with (before your guts go everywhere) then you can usually stop their attack and deliver one of your own.\n\nCooperative: As hard as it is to kill one Voldemo- oh wait, different game... Ummm, Grimnir, you have four of them to deal with running around and wreaking havoc and summoning Death upon your enemies. Thankfully, we were able to get my intern to hire three other wizards to help you kill them. Just remember. Magicks don't descriminate, so one bolt of Arcane in the wrong direction, and you can end up alone again. What? you think we hired the other four to kill you as well? D-Don't be silly! Just because we're testing weapons right now doesn't mean we're TRYING to lower the population of wizards!\n\nMayhem: If the first three words haven't convinced you, the speed of the... we'll call it gameplay for the sake of making you think you're not going to die, is only rivaled by the power of the spells at your disposal. 100 tokens to die may seem like a lot, but with four of you... eehhhh... let's just say you better have each other's backs. the good news is, the enemy has the same amount, so if you can kill enough of them, maybe you can fight again and die then instead.\n\nCheese anyone?\n\n**Disclaimer: This review was done in the style of Paradox's hilarity for the purpose of keeping in the spirit of the game.

Is your life lacking that special “magical” element? Well Magicka: Wizard Wars has a solution to your dilemma!\nMagicka: Wizard Wars is a MOBA where you can mix different elements to create different spells, in addition to a level system once that game is finish, gives the game a fun sense of progress, in addition to leveling you have different types of gear you can equip to boost different stats on your mage.\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  Oh no! Do you see all those mages with red names? They need to die, like now! What are you waiting for, melt their faces! Look, stories really aren’t applicable in MOBA; this game is tailored for PvP, that’s what MOBA’s do.\n\nGame Play: There are 8 different types of spells that can be mixed to create different types of moves. You can mix 3 healing/regeneration spells and then cast it to heal yourself, or mix together a shield and earth to create rock armor. In addition to the magic mixing, you also have 4 action skills that slowly recharge as you cast spells.\nThere is also a nice leveling system in place, so that win or loss you get experience towards the next level, and get rewards for accomplishing various matches.\n\nAchievements: No steam achievements for this game (At this time – The game is Early Access Game)\n\nPrice: Magicka: Wizard Wars is a free to Play game. There are things in the game you can purchase or grind to get better advantages… or simply aesthetics. That is where the game gets their money, so do keep that in mind.\n\nConclusion: I’ve played a number of MOBA’s, many of them are good, but they take a lot of time to get the hang of, and there is always that part of the community that is cut throat about skill level. I’m sure I’ll come back to this game later and play more, but at this point I just wanted to get the general idea for the game.\nIt ran smooth, was very easy to pick up and play with, has a bit of a unique learning curve… all in all, I enjoyed the game, and do intend to play more.","January 10, 2015","true","0.4"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","12","20","0","1"

Playing in the alpha testing phase the game requires a lot of self research. You won't find a game against another player if you just click Play. You have to figure out prime times in other regions and adjust to it by changing your region settings in the main menu. You should also join the Community Group and jump into the chat rooms to find a party/friends.\n\nAfter that.. the game gets so deep. The core of it's mechanic is based on "Yomi". Everything has a counter so you end up playing all sorts of mind games.\n\nThe game doesnt have much at this point. However, the core mechanics of the game is so good you will spend hours developing your skills to be a better player.

Look through the guides to get a grip om how it is played, maybe even some youtube videos. Why? Because it gets really intense, and it can help to have grasped the concept first.\n\nAfter that, I'm sure you'll quickly pick up the game mechanics, and can add a couple of elements to your repertoir, as well as learning to protect yourself/ward properly. Then just make sure you have an awful lot of fun with it :) Quick, intense games, awesome community with helpful, nice people (try the group chats, you probably won't have a hard time finding a mentor for example... :) )\n\nBuy it, try it, and love it :P","April 26, 2014","true","061.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Recent updates have fixed some complaints, but not all.\n\nMatchmaking doesn't seem to take any concept of player skill into account. I'm rather bad at the game, and I keep getting matched up against teams that dramatically outclass my abilities. It's certainly not an easy thing to keep track of, but because of the amazing depth of the mechanics, skill-based matchmaking system is a must.\n\nI previously complained about a lack of a PvE area, and the tutorial area provides the essential safe place to practice. However, it does little to prepare you for the insane rigor required to properly think on your feet and react and defend from enemy spells. I hope that eventually, this mode will evolve to include enemy wizard AI so that you can practice your defense and countering skills.\n\nIn general, the lack of skill-based matchmaking still makes this game very difficult to get into, but the tutorial level makes things much better.","February 5, 2014","true","9.6"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","9"

I call it a pay to alter more quickly game.\n\nThe most important factor is that it's fun and the community seems great too. I would recommend giving it a try.","June 23, 2014","true","993.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

At first you learn the combo's and it's fun playing with other people who are still experimenting with how to play. Once you've mastered some of the quick key strokes and your fingers are accostomed to the movements, then the game play can become more intense with some really fun encounters.\nThe long term game play tho needs some work. Eventually you start playing with people who take the game too seriously. After you've mastered the game as a solo player the next step is to join a team of other skilled players. A lot of people can see the problem with this especially since the match making doesn't pit an organized team of four against another organized team of four. The result is a planned team of skilled players constantly fighting against a random collection of players that have never play as a team before. In the end the planned team normally wins very quickly, and no one playing is happy about it. This especially happens alot on Sunday's when people are encouraged to play on teams as part of a leauge competition.\nI have had alot of fun with this game and I hope they iron out some of the player vs team balance issues. Still loads of fun and I encourage anyone to try it out. =`)","August 9, 2014","true","469.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The source is doing Paradox no good sitting in a damp basement, decaying.\n\nIf anyone reads this reveiw, just download the game before June 21, 2016 and play at least play a couple hours of a game headed straight to the graveyard. After that date, you can NEVER play the game EVER again. No new players will enjoy this game after that date.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LaggerCZE/recommended/202090/","LaggerCZE","Lagger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LaggerCZE/","137 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFinally, Magicka has a versus mode... which apparently ended up being even better because it's F2P.\n\nMagicka: Wizard Wars is a F2P game based around the combat system from the original Magicka. The concept is simple - You have several elements you mix in order to create a powerful spell, whether its purpose is to heal, burn, or crush enemies. Alongside with three other players and some weak meelee-only imps, you are sent to kill out another team of four players. After winning a match, you are given experience points and 'crowns' (Sounds familiar to me, hehehe) you then use to get different equipment to crush your foes more easily. And that's about it for the concept. Fast, simple, fun.\n\nOne of the main advantages of this game is it's F2P aspect. It really is truly F2P - you can't make yourself stronger by purchasing stuff for real money. That's because when you buy a robe, ring, trinket or stave, you exchange some strenght of one of your elements to increase the power of another one, or alternatively increase your speed in exchange for less health and vice versa. The elements make up pairs - you can mix several types of equipment to decrease several of your powers just slightly, or get a full equipment set to make yourself a master of one element, rendering the other one in the 'balance pair' useless. So not having any equipment beyond the default one is also a very valid strategy.\n\nOf course, the game requires you to reach a certain level before you can buy items with more drastic effects, while allowing you to buy them immidiately for real money. But this is also slightly countered by the 'daily chest' function - once per day, you can open a chest to get a random bonus, ranging from a little bit of coins or a crystal (more on that later) to a very valuable high-level robe. The chance of a valuable item drop is increased by winning Wizard Warfare matches that day.\n\nThe game itself then has two gamemodes: Duel and Wizard Warfare, both equally fun yet completely different. Wizard Warfare is a team-based gamemode where two teams of four players try to destroy eachother. There are also spawn points around, allowing you and your team members plus imps to respawn if they get a bit unlucky.  Both teams then have 100 tickets to start with, losing one anytime a imp or a player respawns and, if the enemy controls more spawnpoints than you, dissipating over time. Your target is to capture all points or have the enemy run out of respawn tickets so you can eliminate them forever. It is very important to cooperate and lay waste to both the enemy and their imps, as these usually eat up most of the tickets, while also trying to keep the spawnpoints secure and your teammates healthy.\n\nThe Duel mode, however, is played in four - two players fight in an arena, while the other two spectate, with all players trying to score six kills to win. The winner of each fight stays in the arena, and is given another player to fight, while the defeated is sent to spectate until is chosen to fight again. This gamemode is, however, kind of secondary - it's a good practice, you'll learn to counter and outcounter your enemies, but it's usually less populated and matches may end up being stalemate-ish.\n\n\nThe fight itself is based around spells and magicks. You may combine up to three elements to create a spell, and rest assured these always make sense - three flame tokens make your stave a flamethrower, three earth tokens make it throw a giant rock, when combining these two makes you shoot a fireball. But you can also use spells on yourself, for example, combining one shield tokens with two arcane tokens makes you immune to arcane damage. There are many possibilities, and I am quite sure you'll find your own playstyle soon.\n\nMagicks are then much more powerful than spells. In the bottom of your screen is slowly charging up your magick  mana , letting you use your four magicks from different catagories. Using your first magick catagory only eats up 25% of your mana , the second one uses up 50% and so on. The magicks are also progressively more powerful as they require more mana, using the fourth one properly will usually result in at least one guaranteed wizard kill. It also means you may use the first magick four time in a row if you have enough mana - very useful in the case of Haste, for example. There are several magicks within these four catagories - you may unlock them from bundles from the store (real money payment) or get more of them trough crafting them from crystals. You will need more crystals for better magick catagories, which drop every time you reach a new level, or from daily crates.\n\nLast but not least, your wizard is not only a magick user, but can also use meelee to eliminate foes. These are much more variable than other equipment options, and even though the damage and attack intervals don't change too much, each weapon has a different attack type - cleave, slash, freeze, dash, charge... fun stuff.\n\nAll this is packed into the now classical Magicka look with autentic feeling - the nameless and faceless wizard, the narrator with his lovable voice and sarcastic lines, puns in item descriptions, references to other games and movies, gore-filled deaths and the relaxing music in the backround all make the game feel even better. All this for free.\n\nActually, I don't know what are you doing here anymore. The game is free - so I hereby recommend it and am ordering you to play it!\n","September 24, 2014","true","30.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/YouthOfFreedom/recommended/202090/","YouthOfFreedom","+ Youth Of Freedom +","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YouthOfFreedom/","42 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nGAMEPLAY : 8/10\n\nMagicka: Wizard Wars is an innovative MOBA game where it takes spellcasting to a whole new level. This game has a combination of 240 spells totals.\n\nThe tutorials is poorly done that explains only few basic mechanics.\n\nThere is a total of 8 spells in your arsenal. Ranging from rock,water,ice,fire,shield,death,heal & lighthing. You also have 4 special actives which you can use if you fill up the meter with each attacks you perform. You can choose different special actives too given that you have the requirement crystal to unlock it ( leveling up gives you different type of crystal or you can buy them ). Different spells counters different spells too so you need to think strategically. Basically everybody is Invoker from Dota.\n\nIn a 4 vs 4 modes,there is a total of 3 base you can captured and each opposing teams have 95 respawn tokens. If a player dies or one of the team have more towers than the opposing team,it will slowly deminish their respawn tokens. Once it is finished,the game is over. Oh and also each of the base have imps that spawn to protect it.\n\nBEWARE !!! This game has friendly-fire so if a trolls come to your team,it basically gg for you.\n\nYou can also 1 vs 1 with other players too. It basically a test to see how good you are at spells combinations.\n\nEvery match you finish gives a random amount of gold depending on your score and if you win or lose. From there you can purchase different staves,robes,secondary weapon,trinkets & rings. You can also purchase real cash items which gives you different stats & looks. If you thinking this make the game pay 2 wins,you're wrong. It true that certain items gives you benefit but it also give you certain disadvantages. Your character have 8 elemental resistance attributes. Let say if you purchase a robes that gives you +20 rocks elemental resistance but -20 water elemental resistance. You most likely will receive more damage from water spells but at the same times you receive less damage from rock spells.\n\nGRAPHICS : 7/10\n\nWhile the game doesn't look spectacular,it pretty acceptable for the most part.\n\nThe visual fidelity and the artstyle is great as well as some of the spells particles.\n\nCharacter models is not bad either.\n\nAUDIO : 7/10\n\nSound effects for different spells is pretty well done.\n\nThere is not many in-game music but it ok for me considering it a MOBA games.\n\nLONG-LASTING APPEAL : 5/10\n\nThe game really lack some content. There isn't much modes and leveling up is not rewarding at all. The only good things is that you can experiment different spells with each match you plays. Apart from that the game is pretty much barebone. Hopefully they can add more during their final release.\n\nFINAL VERDICT : 6.8/10\n\nWould i recommend to people who likes MOBA games ? Not really,the game has a steep learning curve and if you can't managed to counter different spells,you most likely will get owned. Maybe people who master using Invoker in Dota shouldn't have problem with this game.\n\nI only recommend to those who are old fan of the Magicka games and people who really like some challenge and spellcasting fanatic.\n\nNew players could try this game but don't expect any in-game guides to help you a lot.\n\nGRADE : D ( Not Bad )","June 5, 2014","true","1.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

It is even more of a disadvantage if you haven’t played the original Magicka. But once you understand the many concepts this has to offer such as the elemental differences, the counters, when to use certain spells, the game starts to pick up, but that's only half the game right there. The other half consists off your reaction speed and ability to casts spells fluently and efficiently, doing so takes A LOT of practice, time and patience. Put that all together and you'll be a master wizard. BUT, with all that said, there is the aim of the game, in which you must captures points, play smart, and try to defend as well as anticipate enemy movements in this MOBA like scenario.\n\ntl;dr The game picks up the more you play it, would recommend 8/10\n\n*note this isn't pay 2 win, as there are available microtransactions that do scale.","July 8, 2014","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The only thing I want is they would somehow make this game become competitive, and more maps to play with.\nThe server is pretty laggy for some reason, I'm pretty sure that's not my internet problem. I hope they fix it soon.\nI also think they should add "luck" factor into the game somehow so the game would be even more fun, or again, something that would make the game become competitve.\nOne more thing, The game says something about humor but i'm not really see it yet. It is probably because the game is still on an early state, and I also think the humor factor can wait until the core factors of the game is online. Hopefully we don't have to wait for too long, because there are games that cannot get the hype back because it is in development for too long.\nLastly, I have a big hope for this game, I know it's not MOBA genre but I do hope this game will be level as L.O.L and DOTA2 in the near future.\nP/S: Keep up the good work team.","June 3, 2014","true","42.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In this game you fight as wizards in up to eight player matches where you have to combine magic types on the fly to use different techniques to squash your oppisition.\n\nGameplay: 8/10. Okay, already starting with a sort of difficult thing to judge, as the gameplay has multiple different aspects to it. At first, this game is a confusing mess. However, this is just do to the fact that there is SO MUCH to the gameplay that this can't be helped. However, once you begin to understand the game, it becomes much easier.\n\nTutorial: 6/10. The tutorial is not really that bad, but it SHOULD be much better. Once again, it seems that this is due to the sheer amount of info needed to be given. However, the tutorial is very repetitive. "Kill a goblin with this, now do it with this." It just seems unfortunate when you need to replay the tutorial so you can remember all of the different spells.\n\nCustomization: 8/10. There are several robes and weapons that also give you bonuses and drawbacks. However, you can't all the robes and weapons until you reach a ceartin level. The only thing that prevents this from being higher is the fact that you can pay money to get any robe or any weapon at any time. I feel this sort of ruins the feeling of getting things, as you don't have to work for it.\n\nReplayibility: 9/10. Pretty straight forward as it is a MOBA and they are designed to be replayable. There are enough maps and skills to play for hours.\n\n\nOverall 8/10: This is a really good game, for a freemium game. I recommend you get it now, in case it ever becomes a paid game.

While the GRAND WIZARD PARADOX!!!!!! Tinkers with the world around with the great and unknown spell called the PATCH. But alas, you have enemy's far worse than the little ♥♥♥♥ed up Gandalfs and the Richly named Imps combined! The enemy  that even the great PARADOX can't defeat! The server connection issues and bugs! And they have a new champion CODE MERLIN! That makes even the most bravest and courageous wizards unable to fight. But some little ♥♥♥♥ed up Gandalfs manage to sneak by their enemy's and they are met with very fast paced murder brawl action in which they kill their team mates by "accident" and kill the wizards who forgot all of the controls and are sitting still while 3 rocks get hurled at their face. And the ones who survived have a great time. So all in all it's a fun game with some issues.","May 30, 2014","true","35.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A mr or mrs kaneiba has pointed out to me that you can make yourself immune to elements I did not know this at the time but as I will point out in the original magcika you coul duse one and if you used more it would get bigger so I am just saying I liked that better)\n\n\nThe magicks are not the way they used to be,\nunlike in the original magicka magicks are now casted using a button press, as opposed to putting the elements in the way that you where supposed to,\nalso you may remember you had five element slots, in this you have three,\nalso your elements do not mix anymore unlike the first magicka where if you summoned say fire and water you got steam, in this game you can still cast steam but your elements only mix when you cast and not when you summon them like in the first one therefore making spell casting less efficent and more annoying.\nAnother thing magicks (a.k.a the spells that you cast in a specific way, say striking some one with a lightning bolt) are now a side thing, not one of your main weapons as opposed to the original magicka where they where one of the best things in your arsenal.\nThis game should not appeal to people like me who played and loved the original magicka, if you have played this game and enjoyed it I would recommend playing the orginal because you will probably enjoy it much more than this.\n\n\n2 Days after.\n\nOk so I gave this game another chance and I am acctually having a good time with it yes there are flaw but there are also upgrades the pvp is extremely wall balaced now and I have gotten used to the changes, The first part of this review was more of a first impressions and I was a bit harsh but some of my points still stand mainly the magicks but I am almost over that.\nSo at first I hated this game but now I see that I have gotten used to the changes it is very fun I will still play but I personally think that the first is better.\n\nThank you for reading.","May 27, 2014","true","18.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

In this game you fight as wizards in up to eight player matches where you have to combine magic types on the fly to use different techniques to squash your oppisition.\n\nGameplay: 8/10. Okay, already starting with a sort of difficult thing to judge, as the gameplay has multiple different aspects to it. At first, this game is a confusing mess. However, this is just do to the fact that there is SO MUCH to the gameplay that this can't be helped. However, once you begin to understand the game, it becomes much easier.\n\nTutorial: 6/10. The tutorial is not really that bad, but it SHOULD be much better. Once again, it seems that this is due to the sheer amount of info needed to be given. However, the tutorial is very repetitive. "Kill a goblin with this, now do it with this." It just seems unfortunate when you need to replay the tutorial so you can remember all of the different spells.\n\nCustomization: 8/10. There are several robes and weapons that also give you bonuses and drawbacks. However, you can't all the robes and weapons until you reach a ceartin level. The only thing that prevents this from being higher is the fact that you can pay money to get any robe or any weapon at any time. I feel this sort of ruins the feeling of getting things, as you don't have to work for it.\n\nReplayibility: 9/10. Pretty straight forward as it is a MOBA and they are designed to be replayable. There are enough maps and skills to play for hours.\n\n\nOverall 8/10: This is a really good game, for a freemium game. I recommend you get it now, in case it ever becomes a paid game. Now that may not happen (and probably won't) but it is still a good game that is a bit addictive","January 9, 2015","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was able to learn all the combos and such after only one day of playing. Another annoyance is the weird sense of player matching, I've gotten matched to people who are by far better and stronger than me and understand the game better, also I've been paired with people who have better gear.

The plays you can do with this, changes all the battle.\nThe Store in the game is very practice, and you have a lot of itens now, that changes your elements power, life and mobility, and also give you an awesome outfit!\n\nOne thing you can not appreciate, like me, is the advantage money can give you against new players, cause if u are one of these newbies, you will rage a lot until learn how to play.\n\nAnother consideration to do, because the game is still in beta, is about the maps and type of games.\nThe 2 maps already in game, are pretty good, without bugs, i expect they make at least 1 or 2 more, to extend the gameplay.\nAnd they can really make a "Last-Team-Standing" in this game, think it will change the way people play the game, and can make viable some competitive way.\n\nThat's all folks.","June 5, 2014","true","21.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The only thing I want is they would somehow make this game become competitive, and more maps to play with.\nThe server is pretty laggy for some reason, I'm pretty sure that's not my internet problem. I hope they fix it soon.\nI also think they should add "luck" factor into the game somehow so the game would be even more fun, or again, something that would make the game become competitve.\nOne more thing, The game says something about humor but i'm not really see it yet. It is probably because the game is still on an early state, and I also think the humor factor can wait until the core factors of the game is online. Hopefully we don't have to wait for too long, because there are games that cannot get the hype back because it is in development for too long.\nLastly, I have a big hope for this game, I know it's not MOBA genre but I do hope this game will be level as L.O.L and DOTA2 in the near future.\nP/S: Keep up the good work team.","June 3, 2014","true","42.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No? Then i shall tell you what it is, so hold on to your manliness because this is a story to move the last hair that your head will be able to hold.\n\nHeck, how should i even begin? It's Magicka, a game where you can play around with 8 elements and combine them at your own will, and wow has it come good, it's surprisingly good!\nNeedle-less to say, you will make lots of mistakes and panic... lots, but do not worry! it's everyone! Everyone gets seriously stressed when they do even a really tiny mistake, it can f*ck up everything!\nNew content comes out often so if you get bored of it you just won't if you give it another try.\n\nThis game is early access, yes, that's why i hate so much about it. Come out already! be a good game! The european servers in this are absolute poo, i can't swear on this steam review thingy or it will filter it and i want to do a beautiful text, there is people fighting against their region and going out to other regions, MASSIVELLY ruining the fun, seriously, you will see lots of high ping mages in this.\n\nOk, so out of technical to physical. You may already know what the hell this game has to offer so let's go to the point:\nYou can no longer combine 6, or was it 8? elements together, they have been nerfed to just only 3 elements.\nThe graphics are noticeably better with more three-dimensional 3D and more elemental elements. It's quite pretty actually.\nThe combat is something that has also amazed me, you could already fight in original Magicka bla bla bla, but nobody has friends on the internet, AMIRITE? I READ IT SO IT MUST BE TRUE.\nWe have been introduced to the 1v1 duel mode not so long ago, but it has been removed temporalially(?) just so we can come back to the sweet old 4v4.\n\nNo, this game is not a moba, but it feels like one, i would say it's an improvement over a moba, you will also need to use your brain or glue your fingers on 3 certain elements to make sure you use the right combination of butt kicking elements.\nThe elements have lots of variations between them, yes, ice and water will make frozen water that will send out spikes, and no you cannot combine water with fire, steam will come out of it, so the game is pretty balanced and i find that awesome.\nYou can  combine everything with everything and heck, even make it strategically!\nYou can combine heal+water to heal and extinguish a teammate that is on fire!\nBut it will also make them wet so they will be more vulnerable to lightning and also, won't be able to use lightning or else they'll shock themselves. Oh yes you can use fire and healing to take care of that but hey, he's going to burn!\n\nThere is already a great variation of weapons and robes, each of them giving you a different attribute advantage and what is the best thing? YOU ARE NOT PAYING MONEY FOR IT! IN-GAME CURRENCY ONLY!\nOh and also sometimes gems will drop and with those gems you can make unique Magicks that are holy ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ extremely powerful.\nAnd annoying, can't forget annoying (stupid teleporters)\n\nThe downsides? Yes of course if you ask for them i can deliver them.\nAs i have already mentioned, servers suck, matchmaking takes quite a while in europe but it compensates because you CAN search for a match during training, which i find more games should do this.\nAnnoying water-spammers, if someone sprays you with water you will be rendered useless because, wow, you will be splashing, and guess what? you are wet! they will just spray you over to a wall and suffocate you with ice spikes.\nOther than that i do not think the game has anything that let me down really, only really bad networking, but guess what! they are hiring! so if you are a network engineer please help us and go over at paradox north, you will save a country.\n\n\nHAVE YOU BEEN CONVINCED YET?\nOK, THIS GAME IS FREE.\nOH WELL IT WILL BE\nNOW?","April 9, 2014","true","15.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","5"

It's really well ballanced, you can dominate it even without buying anything fancy in the shop. Buying items only helps you to make your character more specialized in what you like using.

Learning all the new moves and combos and anti combos. Its not your typical MOBA where you simply use same skill over and over. On this game you get to use a different spell depending on what elements the other guy is using. Nice robes and they have a freakin lightsaber. Friendly fire is fun.\n\nWhat I don't like - too many quitters. There should be a penalty. We would have random people quitting games. I think that they should be penalized like minus crown and exp. The more they do it, it multiplies. I also don't like the match up system. You can sometimes get a match against guys who are level 308+ and your team consists of level 25 the highest level. I think it should be better - not dependent on level but on skills.\n\nWould like to see you there. This is not like DOTA2 or any other mobas youve played. Don't get frustrated.

I just recently started to play it and I'm sure that there will be again next time, at least until servers will close. I haven't explored worlds in Magicka 1 and 2 but even tho decided to start my adventure with this one. Maybe at begin I was confused and making spells to fight another wizards was hard, but after few matches I started to get into it. It's probably the best game with spellcasting, where only your gaming skills and how fast you can cast spells (and counter spells) are important. There are some levels, items you can unlock and wear on yourself. I really love hawaii robe! I also love that tips section when you are killed - it shows not only combination of spell enemy used but also how you can counter it next time. It's really fun multiplayer game, I didn't even had trouble finding people to play together.

The devs, Paradox Interactive, have said they will shut down the servers permanently on July 21st. The servers are too costly to keep up. As much as I love this game, don't download it. The amount of time you'll have to play is too short. I instead suggest getting either Wizards of the square tablet or Magicka 1/2. This is pretty similar to the orignal Magicka games (Wizards of the Square Tablet is still good, it's just a much different art style) however this is more arena based, where the Wizards fight each other. You do that in the other games, too, because there is friendly fire & stuff, plus healing spells work on your enemies. Anyways, this game is awesome but can't be played anymore.\n\nPros\n+You can heal enemies as well as teammates\n+You can damage enemies as well as teammates\n+Mix & Match spell types such as Death, Water, and Fire to create a freaking Darksaber beam\n+Get your own little summoned against it's will Imps and customize them\n+Different armours and weapons & stuff with different stats such as Immunity to Healing\n+In game crafting and leveling system\n+Masteries (Leveling) is similar to path of exile, and it's also a great way to get in-game gear\n+Lots of references, such as Mjolnir, Mines of More'ea, etc.\n+Melee combat as well\n+Hilarious game\nCons\n-Servers shutting down soon\n\n\nSo yeah, I guess that's it?","June 3","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Everything in this game is incredibly balanced!  There are items that can be boughten with real money and real money only, but these items are in no way better than the f2p items.  Items with good effects also have some debuffs with them.  There is a massive strategy involved in putting up shields to defend against certain spell combinations and massive ammounts of skill involving chaining spells to kill your oppenents. i.e. Using a water spell combination to get your opponents wet and then blast them with a freeze combination to brick freeze them, then satisfyingly smash right through them with your devastating blade.  This game is a must play!  It's free so it doesn't hurt to try.

The thing you can buy don't make you more powerfull, they reduce power of an element to increase another so it's not at all pay to win. The 1v1 mode is fantastic, very fun to play and the matches are quite short, first to get 3 kills wins. The 4v4 mode might be a bit confusing at first but it's also great when you get used to it and play together with your team. There even is a nice leveling system that gives you gems that can unlock new spells that you can customize(4 powerfull or usefull spells that charge ingame over time). The only thing I'll like to see is more maps, for the 1v1 and for 4v4, at this time there is only 1 for the duel and 2 for 4v4. Also maybe reduce the wait time for each round and game at the 1v1 mode or add more voice lines. A talent system could work nice, where you select a main role, like healer and you gain bonus healing power and shield for no reduction, or fire mage that increases fire and fire combinations, so everyone can play his own style withought buying things that decrease other element's power.","July 5, 2014","true","10.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It is best option if u have little time and need some fun in boring live :) But otherwise now player need less tactic and strategy skills then in DOTA2 - even playing with friends can give you only few combo options (usualy  water+frost+earth ).

Magicka: Wizard Wars brings you back to a time when things were really focused on game play and replayability and not merely on graphics and next-gen engines. A time when people were forced to actually make a good game in order for it to sell. There is no denying the graphics in this game are amazing, but at the same time Magicka flows by with ease, leaving you little time to ask questions and more time to practice. I can attest that the game is super addicting and has pay to win features. But those minor advantages can be stumped practice and effort. My one gripe with this game is that you can't get new magical skills (the 1234 slots) until at least level 12 which took me about 4 days of playing nothing but Magicka. I did buy some cosmetic gear (Anonymous minion from V) and a spear because I found myself somewhat lacking when it came to matches vs people that did buy that flamesword +1, All in all I'll admit this game has my undivided attention, I've even forgotten all about Smite and Dota2, and long so forgotten HoN, regrettably. I give this game 4/5. I would say a perfect 5/5 but the game clearly has pay to win aspects and, oh I almost forgot... You can almost guarantee your next match will be the same 8 people that were in the last match. This hints at the game not having a proper stat and or matchmaking system and thus giving us complete and utter chaos when it comes to noob teams versus people that play competetively with their own competetive friends.","December 16, 2014","true","63.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

There are only 2 modes and 2 maps (not counting duel mode's arena) so far, but the gameplay is sufficient to keep you entertained for at least a good few hours. There are eight elements that you can combine to create a variety of spells, from laser beams and ice projectiles to earth barriers and healing mines. In addition to that you have four magicks, which come in four tiers, which become available gradually as you fill the respective bar by killing enemies and completing objectives. These abilities can, if used right, become game-changers, especially the tier 4 abilities which deal immense damage over a large area. It can seem overwhelming at first, but the training mode provides a good outlet for experimentation and learning combinations. There are 2 modes at the moment: the 4v4 control-point style Warfare where you capture spawn points and the 1v1 Duel mode. Outside of matches, you can unlock or buy cosmetic items and alternate types of magicks. It's incredibly grindy, as some cosmetics require high levels while magicks require several crystals of various elements. These are given randomly as you level up. However, I haven't felt frustrated yet as the default magicks are sufficiently useful and fun to use, and the eight elements which are the core of the gameplay are all available right off the bat. I haven't seen enough of the unlockable magicks in action to determine if they're unbalanced, but the tier 4 Thunderstorm magick seemed slightly better than the default Meteor Shower in one of the matches I played, as unlike the latter there are no marks on the ground to indicate where the lightning will strike and it seems to have a 100% chance of striking you. Apart from that, what I've seems pretty balanced, with skill, reflexes and knowledge of combinations and counters determining victory or defeat rather than getting new gear and magicks. Some of the gear do provide benefits, but similar to TF2 they are balanced out by having negative attributes as well. Matches don't last for too long, usually up to ten minutes and sometimes even ending in a minute, making it suitable for brief gaming sessions while still feeling long enough to satisfy. If more maps and modes are added and the grind is reduced, this has the potential turn into a free-to-play gem. In it's current state, it's a good game that is definitely worth trying out.","June 20, 2014","true","14.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This game requires ACTUAL skills to play. You need to be fast, have the ability to counter your enemies, and need to put up a nice offense as well!\n\nTruth be told though, I don't play this game much anymore. Why? Too much addrenalin, I can't keep up. It's extremely intense and you feel yourself when in the midst of a battle getting drawn in. It's a fantastic game and I love playing it every so often just to get a little addreanalin rush.\n\nSo to summerize it all up. Eight spells. You can cast a combination of three at a time. There's defensive spells, barriers, attacks, and heals. You need to know all of it, and you need to know how to counter all of it. It's fun learning it too. Good luck young apprentacies, may the magik be ever in your favor.","February 5, 2014","true","115.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The spellcasting is great, allowing for devastating combos that are easy to remember. The number of elements you can combine has been reduced from five to three, but this only serves to streamline the combat and speed it up slightly.\n\nPlayers can switch between roles on the fly, as they become necessary. Long range fights? Start hurling rocks at the enemy wizards! They are now running away? Switch to a pure beam of death and stay on target. Are your friends injured? Heal 'em up with a quick blast from a healing beam and they'll be back in the fight in no time.\n\nFriendly fire is still very much 'a thing' and it is for the better. You can use your teammates to arc your deadly lightning towards the enemy, or just blast a boulder straight through them if they're in the way. Whenever you're about to complain after dying in a friendly Meteor Storm, just think back to all the times you cast that magick when two of your friends were within its area of effect. What goes around comes around, they say.\n\nAs you deal damage to your enemies and heal allies, you'll slowly charge your magicks. You'll get Haste, which simply boosts your speed, but what you're really after are the last two: Grim Reaper and Meteor Storm. The former summons a 'friendly' Grim Reaper, who will proceed to chase down an enemy player, and deal massive damage to him. Or if there are no enemies nearby, he'll just slice you. He's gotta make a living, you know! The latter, as the name implies, causes about two dozen meteors to rain from the sky and absolutely murder everything in a given area. In case anyone survives a direct blast, they'll burn to a crisp from the flames the meteors cover them in.\n\nIf you've found yourself bored with other multiplayer only titles and are now aching for something different and new, Magicka: Wizard Wars is definitely for you. And if you secretly hate your friends and wish to melt their faces off, you're in luck, as this game allows you to do that too!","October 20, 2013","true","11.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The bad things is, sometime you just can't find anyone to play, they should add some bot functionality to accommodate this, and maybe some lobby. But, while there's a hindrance like that.

This is mikeyoverhere just giving you guys a quick heads up and my first look thoughts on Magicka: Wizard Wars.\n\nFirstly, we all need to remember that it's still in its beta period so you have to be patient with logging in and finding/connecting to games. That being said, once inside a game, I have had no trouble with bugs or lags. Beta's that randomly kick you from games when you may be having the greatest game the world has ever seen make me want to sacrifice small children so it's a big plus to the world it doesn't do that.\n\nThe feel of the game to me is purely entertainment based. Every spell seems comical, the way the little wizards move is great and when they fall backward something inside me says cute? Still however Paradox North have managed to keep the combat top notch (but you would expect this from a PvP game). The style allows players to be creative with their spells and choice of murder weapon. I also like how it is not pay to win but there are options to fast track to better equipment by paying rather than leveling, they have to make money I guess.\n\nOverall, I have really enjoyed my first couple of hours on this game and can see myself playing long term. I would like to see some new game modes and new items to keep the game interesting and diverse, but other than that, excellent F2P and worth a download.\n\nmikeyoverhere (twitter)","May 30, 2014","true","6.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The fast paced action combat is always intense and never dull. I look forward to the true release and bettering myself against stronger and stronger opponents.

It has no ARTS elements, it plays more like an ARPG (which is logical, given the game takes its roots from the original Magicka, which was an ARPG). There is no micromanagement. Instead, the game focuses on killing enemies and capturing bases, of which there are three. No turrets, no jungle, no pets or followers (though there are AI minions).  It's like a MOBA version of SWBF2 with magic (so, like Dominion in League of Legends).\n\nItems are bought outside matches and stay with your character. But they cannot make your character an unbalanced Powerhouse bursting with energy. Each item has a tradeoff. Want that cool staff that deals +25% fire damage? Hope you're willing to let your ice/water attacks deal 25% less damage; Want to deal higher melee damage? You'll sacrifice mobility. So, even though you can pay for items, you can win using just the basic kit. Items are bought to suit your playstyle, but you will, without question, need to use some of the elements you sacrificed stats in. Shields in this game can negate a specific type of damage for a short time, so you cannot win a match just by spamming your boosted element.\n\nNot to mention, it's not demanding on hardware AT ALL! I was worried after the mess that is Magicka, but this game is perfectly optimized.

Also, all high level equipment are sorted by level, so if you can't buy it with ingame currency, it means specialising isn't a very good idea until you get to a higher level. Payable items don't have this restriction, so very powerful equipment can be put in the hands of new players. Keep in mind that all equipment has a bonus, but an equal penalty, making it not "powerful" in a linear sense, but if you specialise in a way that suits your playstyle, it makes you more powerful (but doing this early can bar you from changing your strategy and trying new techniques.)\n\nIn terms of gameplay, everyone is -mostly- equal, some more general and some more specialized, it depends mostly on skill. Some elements are more powerful than others, not statistically, but in usage and opportunities to cast with most effect.","December 6, 2014","true","327.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But unfortunatly after playing it for about 6 hours with a few freinds we realized that without buying the good gear you don't have a chance against the people who have.

It has no ARTS elements, it plays more like an ARPG (which is logical, given the game takes its roots from the original Magicka, which was an ARPG). There is no micromanagement. Instead, the game focuses on killing enemies and capturing bases, of which there are three. No turrets, no jungle, no pets or followers (though there are AI minions).  It's like a MOBA version of SWBF2 with magic (so, like Dominion in League of Legends).\n\nItems are bought outside matches and stay with your character. But they cannot make your character an unbalanced Powerhouse bursting with energy. Each item has a tradeoff. Want that cool staff that deals +25% fire damage? Hope you're willing to let your ice/water attacks deal 25% less damage; Want to deal higher melee damage? You'll sacrifice mobility. So, even though you can pay for items, you can win using just the basic kit. Items are bought to suit your playstyle, but you will, without question, need to use some of the elements you sacrificed stats in. Shields in this game can negate a specific type of damage for a short time, so you cannot win a match just by spamming your boosted element.\n\nNot to mention, it's not demanding on hardware AT ALL! I was worried after the mess that is Magicka, but this game is perfectly optimized. I'd totally recommend it.","July 1, 2014","true","9.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Its a bit hard since its a fast paced game (i call it Aim and Evade), but that what makes you addicted to it.

The spellcasting is great, allowing for devastating combos that are easy to remember. The number of elements you can combine has been reduced from five to three, but this only serves to streamline the combat and speed it up slightly.\n\nPlayers can switch between roles on the fly, as they become necessary. Long range fights? Start hurling rocks at the enemy wizards! They are now running away? Switch to a pure beam of death and stay on target. Are your friends injured? Heal 'em up with a quick blast from a healing beam and they'll be back in the fight in no time.\n\nFriendly fire is still very much 'a thing' and it is for the better. You can use your teammates to arc your deadly lightning towards the enemy, or just blast a boulder straight through them if they're in the way. Whenever you're about to complain after dying in a friendly Meteor Storm, just think back to all the times you cast that magick when two of your friends were within its area of effect. What goes around comes around, they say.\n\nAs you deal damage to your enemies and heal allies, you'll slowly charge your magicks. You'll get Haste, which simply boosts your speed, but what you're really after are the last two: Grim Reaper and Meteor Storm. The former summons a 'friendly' Grim Reaper, who will proceed to chase down an enemy player, and deal massive damage to him. Or if there are no enemies nearby, he'll just slice you. He's gotta make a living, you know! The latter, as the name implies, causes about two dozen meteors to rain from the sky and absolutely murder everything in a given area. In case anyone survives a direct blast, they'll burn to a crisp from the flames the meteors cover them in.\n\nIf you've found yourself bored with other multiplayer only titles and are now aching for something different and new, Magicka: Wizard Wars is definitely for you. And if you secretly hate your friends and wish to melt their faces off, you're in luck, as this game allows you to do that too!","October 20, 2013","true","11.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

GET IT all MOBA fans, this is the perfect game. Sure, you can pay to get better gear, but you can do that ingame, just need more experiece and strategy. And so much spells to learn, so much combinations to master, this game really does get you thinking more even after the tutorial. You cannot be a master in a few days, it takes weeks, months of playing and strategising to truly be a master. Sure, you can take the easy way and buy the best staff, sword, robe ext. in the game but even then a wizard with less gear can easily destroy you if they have the right skill. This game is not Pay 2 Win, it is extremely well balanced and is a great, GREAT game. What are you waiting for?

Friendly fire is sure to happen;). You can only combine 3 spells, which make the game quite balance. You can also customize the gear, although the model is not yet as much as Magicka. but the selection is quite good, there's a new store where you can buy stuff. The bad things is, sometime you just can't find anyone to play, they should add some bot functionality to accommodate this, and maybe some lobby. But, while there's a hindrance like that.

This is not a MOBA. This, THIS IS ♥♥♥♥ING BRILLIANCE! The original Magicka had some of the funnest gameplay ever, and I would gladly pick it up again. But, I don't have to! Because this brilliant art came along and said "♥♥♥♥ OUR OLD GAME, PVP REMAKE TIME!" And thus Wizard Warfare was born.  THIS GAME IS NOT P2W  The items you pay real money for have the same stats as in game items you'll eventually get through leveling up.  Unless you buy some of the founder packs, which I'm pretty sure do have the same stats, but have no other way to get.  It is similar to TF2 and MOBAs. I do not like MOBAs in the slightest bit  Okay, only a little.  But you don't have to be a MOBA fan to have fun with this game!\n\nBetter graphics, gameplay, jokes, amazing artstyle,  balanced for new players  and a GOOD COMMUNITY!\nEasily a 10/10 from me.","May 29, 2014","true","5.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The thing is that I love 1vs1 mode, because I don't have friends that play this game, and the matchmaking is pretty frustrating sometimes in the team mode, I don't like to depend on somebody to WIN. The bad thing is that sometimes, I have to wait a lot to play a 1vs1, I win every single game that I play, even when I get to play with somebody that knows very well the mechanics of the game as I do, and it frustrates me that most of the time I end up spending more time to find a match than playing it... If someone sees this post and plays a lot, add me, we could maybe play some duels or something. I play in the US East server, though I can switch to Europe (Frankfurt) anyways.\n\nBasically, if you like team games and/or have friends to play the game with, I think you would love this game, even more than I do.

You will be very disappointed with the lack of variety of spells this game offers. Not that it's small, but it's small compared to the "normal" Magicka, if you will. One thing that ruins this game for most Magicka players is the lack of variety previously mentioned and the ineffectiveness of spells that were effective. Using pure elements in this game is very effective, especially switching between cold and fire sprays, as opposed to using fancy combinations, that will deal underwhelming damage and be easily countered. Still, it is a good game to play if your friends don't play Magicka.\n\nNo?\n\nDownload it and try it for a few hours, it's free, after all. The game has a nice learning curve, not too steep, not too gentle, and experimenting new combinations feels satisfying, despite this being the one game in the franchise that mostly follows the "Awesome but Impractical" rule. Simply casting pure elements or very simple combinations at the right time is much more efficient, but that's more of an opinion. Anyway, if you like the idea, you will enjoy Magicka 2 a LOT, and Magicka 1 as well, even though they differ significantly from this game, as the concept is the same.\n\nTL;DR: The game itself is great for those new to the franchise, average for experienced Magicka players, and also free, which means that you will regret nothing if you don't like the game.","February 16","true","13.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The main objective of the game i that you must work as a team to capture all points on the map, when dying you will lose some out of the 100 tokens in your giving team when you run out of tokens, anyone on your team who dies will not respawn again thus making it a deathmatch. I would advise people who are new to the game to play the tutorial when stuck and dont know how to play. Each player has a number of elements that they can use, the controlls are show when playing and go from Q-F on the keyboard there are special abilitys that every player can use and they go from 1-4 and the keyboard. My personal favourite ability is to summon the grim reaper that can attack your team or the enemy team depending on where you place it on the map. This game features a pvp that can also be usedon you team not just the enemy so Basicly friendly fire is on which make the game more iteresting and fun to play. So get thi game is you think its good or just want to have a blast with your friends.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UncleNoggin/recommended/202090/","UncleNoggin","Gun_Shy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UncleNoggin/","134 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is SO good. It really makes you feel like a mage of awesome strength. There's no picking a few spells out of a list and having to use them the whole game, you just build them on the go from basic elements. And it allows you to cast them in numerous ways, with direction, or on yourself to produce an AoE effect, or provide a shield from 1 or 2 elements at a time.\n\nSometimes your fingers get a little confused on the keys, and cause you to cast spells you didn't want to cast, but I feel like that's kind of appropriate for a mage in the middle of a crazy battle. However, I would really like them to add a key that allows you to clear all current elements you have floating. I feel like that's something a powerful wizard should be able to do in an instant.\n\nThe synergies of all the magics and status effects are really good, but provided with a bit more depth, could put this game on the map a little bit more.\n\nReally, though, this game is RAD. It could use some TLC, most definitely, especially in the form of more maps (as it currently only boasts 2), and another game mode or two would be nice (Capture the Imp, anyone?). Even with only two maps, it's still super fun and engaging, has never gotten old or stale, and if you're good enough at the controls, you can go toe to toe with well-geared-out mages, even as a beginner, so it is certainly NOT "pay-to-win" at all. As far as gear goes, some more customization options would be nice (letting people choose the color of the robes that they buy would be a good courtesy).\n\nEven with the flaws, the mechanics and gameplay are so fresh, and they offer something (the exact something) that I've been waiting for in a game for years. These devs deserve your money, because this game has incredible potential. If anyone out there is saying that the game is boring after a few hours of play, then that means they just aren't creative or skilled enough to play the game right, so they blame the game. Can't wait to see what comes next.\n\nTo the devs: if by some crazy chance you stumble accross this comment, please be brave with this game, and show it some more love in the right areas. Work to its strengths. It's already an experience you can't get anywhere else. If you add even more depth to the already wonderful spell-casting, element synergy, and maybe some extra types of casting effects (like maybe bringing up a length of ice/earth spikes that moves out from the player. Sort of like a wall that's cast at length, instead of across), then I really think people will flock to this game. Give them so many spell choices that every combat is unique and riveting. THAT is what will make this game shine. Everything else is pretty much secondary.","June 25, 2014","true","51.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Well, I guess the Wizard Wars community was a pile of poo to them.

They keep their eyes open for any critical bugs?

The humor isn't quite there, but I expect them to focus on improving the game first.\n\nIt's also free now, and it will always be. Honestly was was glad to pay 15 dollars to be part of the development of the game. And no, this isn't another P2W. This is a free game and buying robes/staffs for money have the same stats that are available in the game after you have a certain level, Similar to tf2.\n\nAnd the community... Damn I haven't seen such a mature and modest game community like this in while. The developer(s) are very helpful and friendly, and even pop in on discussions in the forums. Hopefully it will stay like this as open beta is now available and the community increases dramatically.\n\nAs for the actual gameplay, the game is balanced(so far?) and it may take a while when you finally get the hang of it and become a pubstomping, as there is a big learning curve.\n\nAlso this art style is awesome.\n\nEDIT: After a few months, I expected this game this improved on and on, but apparently this game is sadly falling apart due to net code issues and balance problems.

The game is still in its Early Access “alpha” stages, Changes to the game may happen post this review.\n\nWizards wizards wizards, Paradox interactive is back with a new installment in the Magicka series, now in a more MOBA-Like format. The base game is still the same, you have 8 element at your disposal (water, life, shield, ice, lightning, arcane, stone and fire), to combine and cast as you please. But this time around you can only combine 3 instead of five of the elements, and you have 4 additional spells that you can cast using the 1,2,3,4 keys, these spells can be switched out as the player sees fit, before you enter queue and the battle.\n\nThe game itself is classic moba action; there are 2 teams with 4 players on each team. Each team has a certain amount of spawn points which goes down as players die and respawn. There are 2 ways of winning the game, one of the goals of the game is to capture the 3 spawn areas to prevent the enemy from spawning in, and when the enemies’ team has no players left on the field the game is over. The other way to win is to basically kill the enemy until you have depleted their spawn points, once that is done kill the remaining enemy to win the game. At the end of the game you are awarded Exp. And gold according to how well you have performed during the match. (Kills, captures, etc.) Gold can be used to purchase different weapons, staves and robes, different staves and robes have both buffs and debuffs. You are also awarded magic stones to purchase new magic skills with.\n\nThe game starts out with a short tutorial, to get the player familiar with the basics of the game, moving around, using spells etc. then the game begins you are free to queue up start an actual match. During match queue the first flaw will present itself, currently there is no ELO system implemented in the game, so you might be paired up against an enemy who has full gear and has played and gotten more familiar with the game then a newbie. There is supposed to be an ELO system implemented later on but is not currently in the game. You start fenced in with your teammates until the game is underway, you can either go up or down. The map can easily be compared to League of Legends Dominion mode, in both gameplay and map layout though smaller in comparison. The game time can vary from 1:30 min’s to 20 min. depends on how skilled your teammates are and how skilled the enemy is. This is where the game may differ from other mobas on the market; the game time can be supper quick, giving you the opportunity to get some quick games in, in your past time. Though it can be very frustrating sitting in a 5 min queue to join in, and when you finally get in, you just get steamrolled. The game itself can be hard to learn, takes time to truly master, though it seems like most of the better players use the same set of skills. That definitely can come off as spamming the cheapest and the best skill over and over again, which may turn off newer players from the playing game. Takes time to truly get familiar with the game.\n\nIt pays of to be quick on the keyboard, because this game is purely skill based. Healing is definitely an ability that is essential for the player’s survival, though there are tricks that make you heal almost all health over a very short period. This in my case comes off as a bit broken, as you almost can heal off all damage thrown at you. Also certain attacks seam very cheap to use, and just down right spammy. This has been one of my main issues with, my time with the game. just knock someone over  and throw an arcane-lightning-cloud over someone and they take quite the damage. Spamming rocks is also something that newbies might encounter but there are ways to counter that. There is plenty of room to outmaneuver your enemy with utility skills such as shield, speed, teleport and revive. Been playing a couple of games that involved a guy reviving teammates, over and over even though their respawn points had ran out, dragging the game out, this adds to the layer of play’s the player can make.\n\nThat being said besides that the gameplay doesn’t seem to have the same amount of depth as other mobas out there. There is room for regulating how powerful the spells are according to your gear. But that’s about it, no buying items as the game progress, no getting stronger during the match, you are as strong as you are, everybody is on equal grounds unless or would be, due to the lack of elo system. That makes the game seem dull the longer it drags out, and when you just get steamrolled, it makes you feel so underpowered compared to other more skilled players.\n\nOverall the game is fun and quick, takes some time to get into and master. Not too accessible for new players, definitely to people who is unfamiliar with the gameplay from the previous titles. Gameplay sometimes come off a bit chaotic, and more skilled players seem to use the same cheap attacks over and over again. Lack of elo system is a definite turn off, possibility of newbies to square off against other newbies would be ideal for this type of game. All being said, this feels like a Casual Moba-like experience, and a very good one at that. The game needs tweaking and balancing here and there, very big room for improvements though. The game isn’t finished yet but still in a very playable state, But would still wait till it turns F2P later on.\n6,5 / 10","January 16, 2014","false","12.5"," 53 of 108 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","53","108","0","7"

It will throw the game into your non-primaries, hiding 50% of the game, possibly including the settings area (as it did for me) which means you can't change to windowed mode - you're basically locked out of that monitor(s).

I worried that it would be just another series trying to get there "feet wet" in the MOBA genre, boy was I wrong. Wizard Wars might look like a MOBA at first glance but it plays true to the previous Magicka games with all the spell slinging fun, now with more friends than ever! There is a good amount of secondary weapons, staffs, Robes, and trinkets to unlock that can change your gameplay experience. Overall I hope we see Magicka: Wizard Wars have a successful future, and most of all I hope we get a ton more content! Try Magicka: Wizard Wars, its worth your attention, so at least give it a shot.","June 1, 2014","true","21.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The skill animations and effects are better I like the way you can customize your character to be good with some elements but at the same time bad with others so you can make your character based on the spells you like to use. I recommend this game only because I expect there will be alot of updates with new gamemodes more cosmetics more weapons and more magicks and spell combinations.","June 10, 2014","true","9.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
