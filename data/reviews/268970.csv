The first update was out in three days and they have a well thought out KickStarter that gives me confidence that they will deliver on this title\n\nand you can jump and do an action dive, I can't tell you how important it is to me to be able to mindlessly jump around while i'm walking in an RPG","June 7, 2015","true","2.1"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","14","16","4","0"

There are still a few bugs because it's super early access but the story is charming and engaging.","June 5, 2015","true","5.9"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","15","19","0","0"

Unfortunately the game still has some issues, including (in my experience) a choppy framerate and some other bugs. Since it is early access, I'd still reccommend it if you can go in knowing there will be bugs.","June 9, 2015","true","0.9"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

The final game might change significantly.\n\nThis game riffs the genre of JRPGs but it's mechanically closer to Legend of Zelda, at least at first. You solve environmental and logic puzzles. You do fetch quests for villagers (in one case literally). It's script is a fun romp through the bizzare rules of old jRPGs where we suspend or belief for certain things, though whether or not we should is an open question. It's also got some interesting themes forshadowed in the main story that I look forward to see pan out down the road.\n\nI really want to like this game, and sometimes I do. I just take issue with engine problems. The game will slow to a crawl during heavy action sequences. My laptop is a couple years old, but it can play Crysis and Dark Souls 2, games that demand a fast computer. Again, the game IS still in beta and I'm confident the developers WILL iron out these kinks by the time it goes gold.\n\nIf you're looking for something different, and you don't mind paying for a beta version, give it a try. Caveat Empor\n\n","October 2, 2015","true","0.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Not all the chapters have been included, nor much of the side quests, but the strength of this game lies very much in its 4th wall breaking humor where the players get the enjoy how silly the RPG genre actually is if you're living through a side-character's life.\n\nYou Are Not The Hero makes you feel like you're one of those characters that the Hero accidently affects but players would normally not notice as anything other than a 'background' of a party member. One of those major NPCs that makes things happen, but you would normally not see how much work goes into making those things happen.\n\nHowever, as I mentioned this is currently on very early access - I cannot recommend the game right now unless you intend to support the creators. Maybe when they release all the main storyline would I recommend the game as it is rather buggy and incomplete as it is.","June 6, 2015","false","6.8"," 12 of 34 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","12","34","0","0"
