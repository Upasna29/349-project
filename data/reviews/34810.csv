One of the better space fighter combat games I've played. The tech is obviously old, but it runs super smooth, doesn't look half bad design-wise, and most importantly, is actually fun to play. I have some gripes with it: The friendly AI is only useful for distracting enemy fire, so in escort missions (of which there are sadly many) you're practically on your own. Buildings and other structures have invisible walls around them, so even if you think you're nowhere near it, you will likely still crash into it and explode if you get close enough. I have actually been killed by buildings more often than enemy AI. There is also a sky box, which is understandable, but completely unfair considering the enemy AI can go further past it than you can, meaning sometimes pursuing enemies is a drag, with you waiting for them to come back down so you can take them out. Most of these can be put down to the hardware limitations of the time rather than bad design, so I've given these faults the benefit of the doubt and just gone with it, which made the experience more enjoyable. Without taking the game seriously, I was able to have fun with it. That, in my opinion, saves this game.","June 16, 2014","true","4.8"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

Well it's more a lowered down version of Free lancer, whats diffrent here you think? They take away all your freedom to do as pleased and instead you are forced on each mission but before you go out on mission you can choose which upgrade you want to get upgraded from the reward and the things you can level are Attack, Defence and Speed.\n\nYou can to select easyli what upgrade to take and sometimes you get your weapon /sheild / engines upgraded. For being 3€ on steam it's not to bad... but I would recomand this game to people who enjoys being a lapdog and forced doing mission for upgrades.\n\nOh yeah the lock on missels will miss 90% of the time so if you are lucky with it might hit.","December 10, 2013","true","0.6"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","21","30","2","0"

You get to upgrade your ship as time passes, but that's the only customization there is; minimal replay value due to exactly one campaign and no modding. Story's okay, voice acting's generally good but has a few terribad spots, mostly where the script obviously wanted characters to be interrupted but the devteam didn't bother making the pauses between different characters speaking have anything other than a fixed interval.\n\nBasically: It's good fun, and it's incredibly cheap at the moment (75 cents) so you don't really have that much to lose by buying it.","July 13, 2012","true","3.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

The graphics can be awesome - if you're into Mars geography, you'll wet yourself. Gameplay is fine, it's a general arcade shooter - no targeting, just shoot in front of you. Friendly AI actually do their jobs, getting kills, getting killed, and engaging enemies you're not engaging.\n\nPlot, music and voiceovers should be taken less seriously. The finale isn't epic, but it's still a fun game for a couple of days.\n\nSpace bits might reminder you of a stripped-down Freelancer (but it's a shooter, not sandbox), graphics might remind you of one of the X games, and the on-planet bits will definitely remind you of Rogue Squadron.\n\nP.S.

Sure, it's just brainless shooting, but at least its graphics are pretty good. And it runs on old graphics hardware too (albeit with low frame rates)! I'm making a mod right now, that's due in a few days. If you like to kill 20-minute chunks of time, and want a bit of difficulty, you'll like this.\n\nPublic review update: I still enjoy this game. Yes, the story is shallow, voiceovers sometimes annoying, and the missions all playing the same, but if you just want to shoot some baddies in space, it delivers. Every once in a while the in-game banter is funny. If you like messing around with game files, the game is certainly moddable. I've completed my mod a long time ago (see here: https://steamcommunity.com/app/34810/discussions/0/882960308802221978/), and although the models are in a proprietary format, I think I saw some 3DS/LWO loading code, so it's probably possible to introduce new models.\n\nGo pick it up on a sale.","June 2, 2011","true","12.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"
