Except for one design decision that is a deal breaker for me.\n\nMelee combatants are able to run straight passed each other (within each other's melee weapon reach) during their turn without consequences.\nThis leads to the absurd situation of enemy melee combatants running straight through your melee line and then attacking your archers/healers behind.\n\nI recommend the implementation of either of the following fixes:\n\n1) Zone of Control - Moving Combatants stop immediately if they move adjacent (within melee weapon reach) to another combatant. This would be an appropriate remedy for a turn based game.\n\n2) Opportunity attacks - You get to chop up idiots trying to run straight passed you with your melee weapon (a reaction attack.) I cannot recall when I last ran straight past an angry foe with a baseball bat (let alone a sword.) Regardless I suggest it would not end well.\n\nGiven this situation, I am unprepared to play this game in its current state.\n\nBest Regards and good gaming,\nAlter\n\nPS I have edited this review, given a developer's feedback that my original review was insulting to them, for which I apologise.","November 9, 2015","false","4.4"," 101 of 122 people (83%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","83","101","122","8","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/khelvan/recommended/351480/","khelvan","ScorpionTBC","http://steamcommunity.com/id/khelvan/","277 products in account","Age of Fear is, at its core, a turn-based tactical game about small unit battles similar in feel to Battle for Wesnoth. It has some RPG elements and a unifying story for each campaign, along with the occasional text adventure-like choice to make. The battle system is strong and well balanced. The game is not hex-based and allows for free movement. It takes a bit to get used to how you can effectively use melee units to block access to your ranged/spellcaster units, but once you get the hang of it, it is a thing of beauty.\n\nAs a single-player game I found it a bit short; I finished the campaign in about 15 hours on Normal. I would have liked to see more content; I enjoyed each aspect of the game (the battles, the ongoing campaign, text choices, unit recruitment and development, building up my heroes with items and such) but felt that I really wanted to see more of each. The concept and elements came together well, but I was left wanting more. I ended up purchasing this at full price (about $13) after playing through the Age of Fear 2 campaigns; the developers are retroactively updating AoF to match the AoF2 updates/patches, so it was worth it to me.\n","May 7","true","14.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/351480/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Let’s get one thing perfectly clear straight away. You’re not going to be pouring hours upon hours of game time into Leszek Sliwko’s fantastic Age of Fear series because of breathtaking graphics and incredible surround sound. The game simply lacks that. So if you’re a graphics and sound technology ♥♥♥♥♥ who has little appreciation for other aspects of games then you’re going to want to turn away now and find a game geared more for you. I personally found that the first Age of Fear game to be a fantastic game crying out to be played. It will hold incredible appeal to those of you who appreciate great game play mechanics and those of you who have a likening to well thought out strategy games that begin simple enough to allow you to learn the basics before gradually increasing the difficulty and mechanics of the game to the point that you’re enveloped in the games cocoon.\n\nThe game’s greatest strength is its AI. Many people could take pages out of Sliwko’s book on how to program artificial intelligence, well, intelligently. Many games of this nature fail miserably because the computer is not programmed to play smartly with the game often boiling down to understanding the basic idiosyncrasies of the game before they become a cakewalk. This is simply not the case here. The strategy required to be successful starts outside of the battle. You must select your troops and then evolve them – upgrading their talents and abilities – correctly to enjoy sustained success. Otherwise you will find that you are obliterated. The game’s AI is smart enough without the necessity to cheat.\n\nThe most significant weakness of the game was the, in my opinion, silly and unnecessary point to make players search for treasure chests after successfully winning a battle. I tried this a couple of times following fights but it is a tedious process that is unnecessary and takes away from the game’s strengths. This isn’t a hidden object game it is a turn-based strategy game where the aim of the game is to defeat your enemy and move onto the next round. While you do not have to find these extra chests it would have been much better to give them to the player for completing the battle or having a random dice roll or something based upon how well you did in combat rather than asking the player to spend extra time on a map following a fight.\n\nAge of Fear: The Undead King is not going to appeal to everybody. However, to those who enjoy it there is a likelihood that you’re going to find yourself returning to it again and again.\n\nFor more reviews similar to this one and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 8","true","5.6"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","13","20","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Imban/recommended/351480/","Imban","Imban","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Imban/","1581 products in account","A solid tactics game made by a very small team, I first played Age of Fear: the Undead King just under four years ago, just after version 1.2.0, the first graphical overhaul, was released. Since then it seems to have gone through multiple changes which reportedly added more RPG elements, slightly improved the graphics, and repeatedly improved the balance and fun factor of the campaigns and multiplayer.\n\nEven based on that old version, though, Age of Fear was already one of those indie diamonds in the rough, and one I could easily recommend to any fan of tactical games. It features two decently sizable campaigns (a 15-battle Human campaign and 14-battle Undead campaign, each with one secret, hidden battle) for singleplayer, as well as a multiplayer skirmish mode which I never tried out, a well-told - if not always the most well-proofread - storyline if you're up for reading huge blocks of text, and a fairly decent AI to test yourself against.\n\nAge of Fear isn't a game for those who need everything to be polished and shiny, because it's ... basically the opposite of that, but if you're willing to put up with occasional typos, fairly basic art, and a few quirks and idiosyncracies, I have to strongly recommend it.\n\n(My time is very low because, well, I just wrote this review based on the old versions I played when I beat the game, which were around 1.2-1.4. I need to play it again eventually now that it's got the RPG systems implemented.)","June 27, 2015","true","8.7"," 19 of 35 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","19","35","0","0"

Graphics would have been basic in the late 90s. There's lots of minor UI bugs. Even the story, while very good, is in places delivered with technically poor writing.  E.g. the section for the Faycastle mission has an extra ‘this’  - "The war didn't seem to have effected this them..."\n\nSo why’s the game so much fun? The grid free combat mechanics, while not without issue, create unusual tactical challenges.   More judgement than normal is needed to get the balance right between protecting your ranged units while not using such a tight formation that you hamper manoeuvrability.   The unit progression system is great; with individual named units you can upgrade over the course of the campaign. The best thing about the game is probably how all the elements cohere together.  The simple yet nicely plotted story. The primitive but often authentic sounding medieval music, which changes nicely to fit the mood. Basic yet well chosen ambient sound. Even the still art is nicely evocative.\n\nIf you’re not too bothered by a few minor bugs and would like a short and sweet fantasy medieval tactical combat game with retro presentation, this game is a great choice.","April 3","true","11.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","11"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/civilo/recommended/351480/","civilo","Venceremos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/civilo/","1569 products in account","Disclaimer:I have not played AOF2 since Nov. 2015, thus some points I put here might be dated since devs are constant improving the game. I'm writing this review after such length because I feel I have the obligation to let more people know what this game is good at, to let more to see its great potential as an indie TBS.\nAlso, as my first language is not English, expect mistakes, misuses and Chinglish and I apologize in advance. I'm writing this in English because review in English will not be filtered. Yes, simple as that.\n\nTL;DR version:+decent TBS\n-minimal graphic and music\nPersonal Verdict: Recommend\n\nAge of Fear (AOF and Age of Fear 2 will be refereed as AOF2) came later on Steam than AOF2. However, note that its development was prior than AOF2, so you can understand some drawbacks compared to its squeal.\n\nThey are:\nlinear campaign. Unlike AOF2, you don't get to choose your path here. This is a minor issue that you need not to complain about, i am just pointing out for you to see.\nWorse performance issue. (Note that I've not played AOF and AOF2 for awhile, it's based on my poor memory) AOFs are developed in Java, which is universal but also somehow primitive. Les (dev) said that he is working on geometry engine and native library in order to boost AOF2 experience, and since update for AOF2 and AOF are basically synchronous, so expect this problem to be eased in the near future.\nless minion diversity. There are, indeed, many different units just like in AOF2. However, their functions don't differ decisively and one often overlaps with another, and some are thus pretty useless.\nOkay, pretty much for its inferiority compared to AOF2. What it's good at, same as AOF2, is:\nGreat turn-based strategic combat.\nUnlike many other TBS games, in AOF series unit size can greatly influence the pace of the battle, and there are no tiles to limit your movement so that you can micromanage your unit position. Unit deployed can block others behind them and affect their movement significantly and hence, when and which unit you gonna move is important, so that you don's screw up. e.g. you may want to have a necromancer to move forward to raise a corpse, but to do so you need to have it exposed to enemy melee units, and you can't get your, say, ghoul, that would originally be behind the necromancer to cover him because it's path is blocked. So it would be up to you to decide, whether to expose a necromancer to fatal peril, or to delay or even abort your plan.\nAction per unit allowed executed per turn is limited. It's majorly against casters are ranged units. Most of spells are not allowed to cast after moving and ranged attack the same, and thus you will have to arrange your squad position carefully that your shooters can cover the desinated battle ground, your mages have your targets in spell range and your tank units can cover them, not to leave them to assulters like riders, so that all departments of your army are fully functional.\n\nThe drawbacks for AOF and AOF2 in common are:\nVery minimal graphic. But it doesn't matter.\nMusic is limited. But it doesn't matter as well.\nPerformance issues as noted above. It does matter, but dev is working on it.\nWeak story.\nMinor spelling and grammar mistakes.\nAbove, I recommend AOF. I would say this is an exemplar of how to make an indie TBS: Decent combat, deep strategy. I see some developers put money in fancy graphic and impressive music but the game itself turns out to be crappy, what a waste. Then I wish some people can have more budget to further polish their game. Like this.\n\nYou may want to pick up AOF2 and see if you like it, since they don't share a coherent story. And I would like to write more, but there goes my poor memory.","January 2","true","17.4"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","5"

But. Trying to give AoF a thumbs up or down is like tossing a coin in the air and having it land on its edge instead of heads or tails. It has its good points and bad. The storylines are pretty decent, the background artwork is very nice, the combat is okay but nothing truly innovative. Most gamers will get through the "good" campaign without too much difficulty on the standard setting. But it's when you attempt the dark or "bad" campaign that things become both better and worse. This is because the necromancer plays very differently, has a completely different skillset, and a level path that requires you to take a different but fairly specific approach. Unfortunately, this is where the RNG hits you hard and you will find yourself having to replay levels over and over just because you had bad luck with the rolls or completing them with ease because you got repeatedly lucky. As much as I'm enjoying this game and as much as I wouldn't call it a bad game by any stretch I'm going to push that coin over onto whichever side represents a thumbs down for the simple reason that there are better games in the same pricepoint - specifically Telepath Tactics. This said there's plenty of fun to be had here if you arent too picky. As is often the case I would rather have given this a more neutral vote but there we go. If you grab it in the sale (as I did) you'll likely be happy enough. It's also worth noting that the lead developer cares very much about his games and is very keen with responses to issues in the forums and continues to patch them when he can.\n\n*edit* Recent updates have done more than enough for me to flip that coin back the other way and the game is now well worth its full cost.","January 4","true","12.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","3"

The bowman is one exmanple, you have priests and mages(with upgradeble spells besides the other perks), knights melee infantry units. mass stone skin, an upgrade for a mage spell, rocks(pun intended). So you can see that if you can keep your units alive for a while they are gonna kick ♥♥♥.\n\nthe story is amazing, wont get in too much detail, but if you like to read(story is presented through text) you are gonna find yourself really immersed in the tale you are living. And there are 2 of them in each game. I know my retinue by name, i know i promissed the father of one of my infantry guys i would keep him alive, and i´ll tell you, this really wheights in my decision when considering which units to risk. when i realized that I was caring this much for the characters and the story I knew this game was a finding.\n\nWhat is left to add is what a nice and attentive guy the developer is. he aswers to all my questions, reply to all my ideas, just check other reviews or discussion threads to see how perfectly he handle even criticism from people who are expecting CoD graphics and can´t enjoy a great game with minimalist graphics, which are not ugly at all btw, i really like the way the game looks, and sounds.\n\nIn short, Buy it!! if you are not in love with the game in the first couple hours you can always get a refund.","January 11","true","15.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

It's not grid  based like other SRPGs, however your units have individual stats that you  manage throughout the gameplay in order to defeat more and more difficult opponents.\n\nCons:\n-No multiplayer matchmaking system, but has too few players/exposure.\n-The graphics might be an issue for some. For me, I had a lot of fun. Like they say, don't judge a book by it's cover. This game is deep and can be difficult.\n-The girl from the trailer is not in it.\n\nPros:\n-Unit management and advancement requires you to make smart choices in order to survive. You may get to the point where if you've made poor choices, you can't go any further or you lose the level and have to go  back to a last save.\n-Good story. A little minimalist, but again, this game is all about the game play.\n-Varied and balanced unit compositions. You won't get to the last level and not lose a guy.

I hope that they add to it but I haven't played through to the end so who knows, maybe there's more there than I think. I've only played it about an hour so far, so far the worst thing was that there hasn't really been any choices other than what men you hire, I hope that the whole game isn't linear. It's not very demanding on your pc either, it doesn't need to be top of the line.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198064012974/recommended/351480/","76561198064012974","Hackomatique","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198064012974/","72 products in account","This is a nice low-complexity indie turn-based tactical RPG, with a focus on overcoming tactical battles using a hero and a band of comrades. Graphics are functional top-down 2D graphics, which I thought were decent. Play choices outside of combat are about choosing which types of comrades to join your group, and how to develop their abilities as they gain experience. I didn't see any choices outside of combat, party composition, which special items to give to which characters, and which skills to improve with experience. So it's really a series of tactical battles with text and party management between battles - no other choices, no exploration, etc. Difficulty levels range from easy to Death Seeker.\n\nI bought it and played only on Death Seeker, because I'm hard core that way - er, actually because I like permadeath and permanent crippling wounds to happen - I might rather have played on a somewhat easier difficulty level, as I ran into situations I failed to overcome (since I accepted defeat and don't savescum). It could be seen as a problem that Death Seeker seemed not terribly hard but then led to a VERY difficult encounter, but if a player doesn't mind re-playing such a scenario, the game does allow shifting the difficulty up and down during a campaign.\n\nOverall I recommend the game if it's a type you might like, as the type of game is one I like a lot, and I mostly enjoyed the content. There are some things I would rather worked differently or were improved, but I'm an old-time gamer with refined tastes.\n\nThe Good:\n* Turn-based tactical combat with some interesting and semi-realistic elements, combined arms tactics, etc.\n* Fun to try to keep men alive and develop their abilities.\n* Ability to try various tactics, group types, and different character abilities.\n* Variety of tactical situations and opponents.\n* Well-written story linking the battles, which gives content and makes sense. (Few typos considering the devs are not native English speakers.)\n* The developers are steadily improving the game and they listen to player feedback - a formula which leads to some of the best games, in the long run.\n\nThe Medium:\n* If you're spoiled by graphics made by corporate games with million-dollar budgets, these are as seen in the screenshots. I thought they were fine.\n* I could wish for various improvements and changes to the combat system, but again I have rarified tastes. I like it more than 95% of computer RPGs, so it would seem somewhat silly to complain. With devs like these who listen, the thing to do is send them your suggestions, so I did.\n* I saw no option to turn off the random character voice comments when moving each unit, without turning off all the ambient sounds. I grew tired of those voices after a while. P.S. As you can see in the comments, this is an example of something the devlopers are listening to and will be an option to turn off in the next version!\n\nThe Bad:\n* Nothing I'd call bad.","November 4, 2015","true","6.7"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","2"

Interesting variety of units (many with special abilities that produce challening in-fight decision-making). The campaign throws a wide variety of mission setups at you. The AI is excellent (and doesn't cheat!).\n\nThe unit movement takes a bit of getting used to, as the game doesn't use a standard square or hex map. Ultimately the system works very well (and makes unit size matter in interesting ways), but because the system is different, it took a little practice to manuever my units effectively.\n\nGraphics are about what you would expect for an Indie game with a small team.\n\nHighly recommend to anyone who enjoys turn-based tactics.  At the time of this review, the primary developer was very active on the Steam forums and continues to make improvements to the game based on player feedback.\n\n","December 10, 2015","true","3.1"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

And that's kind of unfortunate because despite the very clunky UI and gameplay, this game seems to have a lot of story line and more content than appears at first. Despite that I'm going to vote no on this game. If it were early access it may have been a different story, but this doesn't feel like a game that should be marked "complete" just yet.

I have not finished a campaign yet but I feel it is an enjoyable experience regardless of how far you get. The enemy AI is fairly solid, so don't expect enemy calvary to charge in without support and get hacked to pieces. Positioning your army is everything and having the correct units up front is key. The story is acceptable but it's really the turn based combat which is the real drawcard here. The user interface is slightly clunky at first but doesn't take long to get used to. Best of all the game keeps getting better, the developer is patching it like crazy with new mechanics in the not too distant future.\n\nI would recommend the game to fans of games like Battle for Wesnoth and other old school games. If you only play AAA or modern games looks elsewhere for your fix.","November 10, 2015","true","14.6"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

It's easy to understand, but hard to win. Hardcore enough for those that like it that way, in the fact that unit lost is lost, but has enough saves to help you keep them alive, if you want to play it like that too. :)\n\nThe units' movements are very Warhammer like, there are no hexagons or squares, but you can't move and attack with ranged units, for example. Your units grow as the story progresses, and gain new abilities and perks as they survive (and participate) in battles. :)\n\nIt's cheap enough, and if you like tactical games, this is one of the best these days. :)","November 16, 2015","true","13.0"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"
