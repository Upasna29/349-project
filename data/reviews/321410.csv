You need to find some military geek in you to play this.\n\n\n\nFirst of all, take a look at the screenshots. This is all you will see. No fancy graphics, but a map full of symbols...\n\nI bet you get excited, didn't you?\n\nThis is not a game, it's a simulation. Very complex. Difficult. With steep learning curve.\nBut once you get into it, you will LOVE IT.\n\nUI is good, but _sometimes_ unintuitive and you need to get used to it.\n\nComplexity is mind blowing. Well, for example - algorithm that calculates radar reflectivity, besides many other factors, takes into an account speed of rotation of aircraft's jet engine fans plus angle of reflection from it. And everything is happening on your desktop computer. In real time.\n\nNo words can describe the emotions when you try to hunt down this bloody Sovremenny-class destroyer with your Kobben class submarines. Then, your girlfriend comes in and asks what you are doing. Well... how can you explain to her, in simple words, that you are ambushing Baltic Fleet with 4 Kobben-class submarines? (This is probably the biggest flaw of the game)\n\nI spent most of my time in the scenario editor. And it is not what you think. You can turn on time flow and play the scenario against yourself within the editor, switching sides from time to time. This is more like your sandbox and playground.\n\nI researched military power in my region, replicated all squadrons and units. Read dozens of wiki pages, followed twitter and facebook accounts of military units. And had lots of fun checking out my 'what if' scenario.\n\nI payed full price for this game and I would pay for it again.","May 12, 2015","true","110.1"," 158 of 170 people (93%) found this review helpful 45 people found this review funny","93","158","170","45","6"

If you have any doubt as to whether this is your sort of game, don't moan about the price, watch some of the Baloogan Campaign videos to decide whether it's for you or just don't buy it.  In context, it's less than the price of two new AAA games (or one AAA game plus DLC), and unlike AAA games you won't be done with them in 15 hours apiece, you could happily sink a thousand hours into this and never run out of things to do.\n\nCMANO is the spiritual successor to the Harpoon series, the grand daddy of modern naval command sims.  That means while the graphics are limited to maps and NATO symbology, the breadth and detail of units and capabilities represented is second to none, CMANO is capable of simulating pretty much any naval conflict from 1945 to near future hypothetical flashpoints.   This is at heart a serious minded simulation toolbox, rather than a balanced and scripted game.  If that appeals to you, then there is no finer product available, period.\n\nI bought this shortly after the first patch (1.01) about a year ago and since release there has been ongoing support from the devs, who seem to be in this for the long haul and it hs come on in leaps and bounds.  The long term future for this game is looking bright!\n\nWhat I like\n-Breadth of units, every post-WW2 unit I can think of is in the game, or will be\n-Global coverage, simulate any naval conflict post WW2 in any location\n-Community created scenarios pop up regularly\n-Ongoing dev support\n\nWhat I hope is improved\n-Beginners are somewhat left to their own devices, small scale scenarios are limited\n-Air combat is less well developed than naval combat (though this is improving)\n-Interface is definitely an acquired taste!\n-Sound is glitchy","September 27, 2014","true","46.4"," 217 of 251 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","217","251","4","0"

(Especially commissioned officers)\nActive or retired military intelligence officers.\nActive or retired military think-tank analysts.\nActive or retired employees of major defense contractors.\nIndividuals that are intellectually curious and possess a great deal of specific knowledge about modern military tactics/strategies and technologies. (Knowing how to play ARMA or Battlefield does not qualify!) You should at the very least, have a fairly detailed understanding of the modern fixed-wing combat aircraft utilized by the USAF, USN and the VVS along with their constituent weapon systems. TRUST ME, the more specific knowledge you have, the betterEvery prospective player must have a keen attention for detail, in terms of being intellectually curious about and willing to understand very arcane data.\n\nPricing\n\nMoney means different things to different people.  If you are one of these people that has a hectic work life, with at most, one hour of free time every day, then I would recommend waiting several months for a sale.  If you know that you can afford to spend several hours a day playing this game, don't mind spending close to 90 USD, know a lot about its incipient material and salivate at the prospect of playing it, then I think you might want to consider getting it sooner rather than later.\n\nIf you find yourself intrigued by this product, but don't have the highly detailed knowledge necessary to competently understand it, then I would recommend you do the following: spend the next few weeks or months reading up on as many fixed-wing combat aircraft, naval surface combatant warships and Soviet/Russian SAM systems as possible on the Internet or your local library.  I would recommend that you use this research to better understand the game in the interim so that you can then purchase it at a later date when it goes on sale.\n\nGameplay Dynamics\n\nThis game is 90% planning and 10% doing. You will in all likelihood, spend an inordinate amount of time looking at very minute data (ex - the maximum range of your aircraft's Fire Control Radar, the differences in your warship’s fuel consumption at Cruise as opposed to Flank speed, or the height of a mountain range’s slope at a point that is near a Mission Objective) in order to develop a proper attack plan. Once you’ve sent out your aircraft/ships/submarines, the suspense you will experience is unlike anything you will ever imagine. (This might seem counterintuitive judging by how simple the map icons look) Be prepared to feel drama, frustration, relief and suspense as the engagement of your forces vis-à-vis enemy combatant forces take abrupt twists and turns that will go either in your favor, or against you!\n\nLearning how to play this game is one thing, learning how to master it, is quite another.   The amount of tactics one could devise by making minute changes to your force’s plotted course, speed, altitude/depth  and the effect that will have on the outcome of a battle, are almost infinite. It is not an exaggeration to suggest that you could spend hours trying out different tactics on just one engagement alone.\n\n**The oft-mentioned database has arguably the most extensive non-governmental repository of data on almost every conceivable weapon of war designed by man since the conclusion of the Second World War.**  Enough said.\n\nInterface\n\nImportant Update  - The developers either: a) Do not think there is anything wrong with the UI and/or b) Make constant excuses for these self-evidant shortcomings!  Do not expect any attempt on their part to fix them.\n\nThis is where most of the simulator's weaknesses lie. To put it succinctly, you will spend a lot of time 'clicking, clicking, clicking'.  Allow me to give you an example.  The Weapon Allocation Window is used to fire weapons at hostile targets, but it is absolutely useless… Once inside the window, you have to click on a top right tab entitled 'To anyone' just to get a sense of which plane/ship/sub your selected unit is shooting at and then click on the bottom right tab entitled 'By anyone' just to get a sense of how many weapons all of your forces are using on a particular hostile unit.  You have to repeat this process EVERY single time on EVERY enemy missile, plane, ship or sub just to get a sense of what your using against them.  Couldn't they have found a more efficient way of delivering this info to me? Trying to manage massive battles using this process, becomes tedious and ultimately frustrating.\n\nAt no point are the shortcomings of this game made more obvious than when one considers its lack of streamlining. When you launch a naval or air attack, there is no way of pulling up a 'master display' that aggregates activity data from all of your forces. (Where are my forces going?  What is their speed or altitude/depth? What radar(s) have they activated?) The end result is, that you are quite literally forced to either remember all of this information 'off the top of your head' or manually click on each of your ships/aircraft and ascertain this information yourself.  This becomes almost impossible if you have dozens of units in a scenario.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAll things considered, even with its flaws, I believe this game will give its very small target audience (service members and hardcore military enthusiasts) hours of enjoyment and learning.  I would therefore be happy to recommend it.","July 15, 2015","true","048.6"," 182 of 206 people (88%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","88","182","206","8","6"

This is not for anyone that is a casual gamer, or thinks they can easily transition from an RTS or grand strategy game to this. This may as well be running on a pentagon computer as a simulation to game out attack strategies for the next major war. There is no "gameyness" here. Everything is modelled to the Nth degree. Radars, radar signiature, electronic countermeasures, nukes, weapon systems, sonar and sound propogation including CZ's, effects of weather... literally untold effort over years was poured into this, and not a minute was wasted on 3D modeling and lighting effects. The end result: You are the commander. You know what your ships and planes look like, you've spent decades around them. You've spent years training for a war you hoped would never come. Now, it is time to put the forces of your nation into action. This is the command center, and it looks like one.\n\nI can't reccommend this program enough.\n\nThis is the one game I cannot live without.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jobertv/recommended/321410/","jobertv","jobert","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jobertv/","713 products in account","This game is fun! Really fun! Right off the bat, after downloading the game, CMANO has monopolized most of my game time.\n\nThis game though is probably not for everyone.\n\nIt's for people who love simulations and RTS games. Those who are into action games, platformers, and shoot-em-ups would probably want to avoid this. If you enjoyed Warcraft, Starcraft, the Total War games, Civilization,  Warhammer, the Wargame series (EE, ALB and Red Dragon), then this game would be worth considering.\n\nAND, if you are an old geezer like me and have sneakily played Harpoon on the office PC during the late 80s/early 90s then this one is a no brainer.\n\nWatch Baloogan's YouTube videos on this game. I have spent hours watching his games and have learned a lot from it. His videos are what gave me the final push to get this game.\n\nFor some reason, Steam has a problem tracking my game time. My guess is that the initial loading screen is what it tracks (that screen stays on after loading the game screen which I turn off the first few times) and not the game screen itself.\n\nThe learning curve is a bit high but not too high that it becomes frustrating. For me, the difference between frustrating and challenging is that frustrating is when you just want to get it over with in order to move on and challenging is doing it again and again until you are satisfied while enjoying it each time.\n\nThis game is challenging.\n\nGraphics are basically limited to the unit symbols and the terrain map.. basically its your imagination (best to dl the image mods to have a mental picture of the units) that drives what you're seeing on screen. Reminds me of old Infocom ads in the 80s, how the brain is the best graphical processor around.\n\nThere are a lot of mission scenarios. The page says 40 but after downloading the community pack, I have another 177 (!!!) scenarios that cover engagements all around the world! And there is an editor where you can even make up your own scenario.\n\nTo give you an idea of the missions, the first tutorial mission was to bomb a couple of land targets that are protected by SAM installations. I launched a couple of F14s to patrol the area, set up Prowlers and Hawkeyes to monitor the area and jam enemy radar, then set up my strike force.\n\nI still haven't got a major victory (only a minor one; ran out of ordinance and had one bldg still standing). But I'll get back to this mission later. Going back to this mission and repeating it didn't feel like a chore to me.\n\nIn the second tutorial, I had to micromanage one submarine through 4 stages sub v sub, sub v boat, sub v boat with a helicopter patrolling the area seeking you out, and finally sub v land target.\n\nUnits are intelligent. Just send out the mission order, define the conditions and send them off. You can have them do the mission automatically or manually control and guide them.\n\nMuch has been talked about the price. I got it on sale but still it was a bit high for me that I really had to think five times whether I should or should not. I'm glad I did.\n\nI think about it this way, I have spent much more on games I haven't played yet and some that I never will play again.\n\nJust to set expectations:\n\n1. The first thing you'll notice is that the game rests above Windows UI (similar to how Excel or Word launches). This took me by surprise since I initially thought that it was a subpar game because of it.  But don't let it fool you, the game is top notch regardless. Plus using dual monitors is easy because of this.\n2. The graphics. Much has been talked about it but to quote Cypher from the movie The Matrix, "But there's way too much information to decode the Matrix. You get used to it. I...I don't even see the code. All I see is blonde, brunette, red-head"\n3. Sound. There is none to talk about. It's really basic that I just play it without my headphones on.\n4. The pacing closely resembles how the pacing would be in real life. Missiles takes minutes to hit targets. Your planes need time to be loaded up, taxi to the runway, and launch.\n5. Planning and strategy. When a scenario loads up, a pop up with mission details come up. It's best to read it and familiarize with the scenario. The overall strategy is laid out with some helpful tips but you must still have to plan out how to execute it\n6. The Database. Much has been written about its extensive database and boy, it really is. It's like a big technical manual of every weapon, vehicle, and even installations around; complete with its history, and the different versions and iterations around.\n7. No multiplayer. I really can't comment on this because I'm happy already with the way its set up but some would want to try this out in MP but sadly it isn't an option.\n8. UI comes out clunky and there's no immediate accessible keyboard control guide. After awhile though like most games you'll get the hang of it. But if I have to complain, it's the UI really.\n\nCommand: Modern Air / Naval Operations is 100% really about the gameplay.\n\nAnyway, not sure if this review makes much sense but I wholeheartedly recommend this for people who love the genre and are deciding whether to get it or not.","January 1, 2015","true","41.8"," 100 of 119 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","100","119","0","6"

There are lots of online video tutorials to help with the learning curve.  It is a virtual naval war college and it is managed by a team that is dedicated to its constant improvement (I've never seen such dedication to supporting any game in my 25 years of playing them).  They have improved the game non-stop over the last year,  It is insightful, flexible, versatile, and has a database that rivals the most expensive reference books like Combat Fleets or Janes.  I served in the USN for 24 years, and I can tell you that this game is priceless for understanding how navies operate and how modern air/naval warfare works.  It is the best simulation I have seen in or out of the service - and a useful tool for taxpayers who want to understand where their hard earned money goes.  It gives you 65 years of naval warfare across the entire globe with a multitude  of realistic and challenging scenarios, and a scenario editor that is relatively easy to use and which has generated an impressive amount of user content. If you have any interest in naval warfare you should buy it - I doubt we will ever see a game this good on naval warfare for the foreseeable future.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/waspus500/recommended/321410/","waspus500","Waspus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/waspus500/","105 products in account","So if you're thinking of buying this game, I beg you to get it on sale. If you're anything like me, if you want the game you'll ignore my review entirely and buy it at the ridiculously steep price of almost $90 it's offered at at the moment, but this review is coming from someone who bought it on sale for the low low price of $54.\n\nNow, I really can't recommend this game, but I'm not going to actively discourage anyone from buying it either. It feels more like a super-precise military combat simulator rather than a game, like something NATO uses to figure out if they could plausibly declare war on russia.\n\nHowever, the fact of the matter is, it's so expensive because it covers so much. I have yet to actually find a post-WWII military unit I can't build in the game. The search function may lead you astray because it *sucks*, but if you know exactly what you're looking for you can find the precise unit built in the exact year that you're looking for. And it doesn't stop there. If you pick a unit (This is most prominent with aircraft) it will let you select the onboard loadout. And I mean there are a *ton* of loadouts for every unit that carry every very specific missile made in a very specific year by a very specific company, and they have loadouts with 4, 5 and 6 of them onboard. I mean this game (simulator?) is seriously detailed.\n\nAfter you've spawned a unit, you can go into a screen showing you very detailed information about the unit. The game (Again, simulator?) feels like they had 200 people working 24/7 finding out literally as much information as they could get their hands on, and supplied these people with an IV injecting caffiene directly into their bloodstream. There is a mind-boggling amount of detail in this ame, as in more than you could find if you wrote a doctorate thesis about every one of these military units.\n\nNow, I do have some concerns about this game:\n\n- This is very trivial, however I have not yet found a way to turn down the ingame music volume so I can play (simulate?) while lisening to music.\n\n- It seems like they put waaaaay too much effort into detail and not enough into sound, because if you have a couple destroyers firing on an enemy all you hear coming through your speakers is the same monotone boomboomboomboomboomboomboomboomboomboomboom. I haven't checked, but in the game files I'm pretty sure there's boom.ogg and aircraft.ogg, because this game has like 2 sounds.\n\n- The game (simulator?) gets really boring, really fast. I can't really take this game in high dosage without getting bored of whatever I'm doing. Everything goes so slowly it gets very annoying after a while.\n\n- If you're not a military expert with several four-year degrees, this game is going to confuse the ever-loving hell out of you. You'll boot it up, find the only plane you know (Which is probably the F-18 or F-22), try to spawn one, and then sit there trying to figure out which convoluted loadout is best, and then just clicking one at random and finding out the one you picked has no guns.\n\nSo, to summarise my review for those who don't want to waste their time reading the entire thing:\n\nPEOPLE WHO SHOULD PLAY THIS GAME\n\n- NATO (Revising my review to note that BAE Systems actually uses this for actual, real-deal military applications)\n- People who are serious military geeks and don't think Wargame: Red Dragon is enough of an intellectual challenge\n- People who want to become serious military geeks and *really* like reading\n- People who kinda like military stuff with some money to burn\n\nPEOPLE WHO SHOULD NOT PLAY THIS GAME\n\n- People who play Supreme Commander and think this game is exactly like SupCom (It's not, in any imaginable way. Don't ask why, it's just not the same).\n- People who know nothing about military anything and have no desire to learn\n- People who want to play this game and not simulate this simulator.\n- People who have trouble paying attention for a long period of time.\n\nI'll reccomend some alternatives for people who want a casual-ish military simulator without having to alt-tab to wikipedia every 3 minutes:\n\n- Wargame: Red Dragon\n- Supreme Commander (Not the second one. The second sucks. Get the original)\n- Command and Conquer\n- StarCraft\n- SuperPower 2 (Good if you like running a country, but it does not have nearly as many units as C:MANO)\n\nTL;DR: Read the review.","December 13, 2014","true","7.6"," 89 of 108 people (82%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","82","89","108","11","2"

You have an impressive system here.  I call it a "system" and not just a game...I'll explain:\n\nFirst, if you are looking for fancy graphics and ultra-fast unrealistic action, this game is not for you.  This is a complex, battle simulation on an Operational and Tactical level of war.  It uses the NTDS symbology to plot unit positions on a map, much as you see on real world battle systems.\n\n(I feel like I am back in the Command room that I worked in years ago...only much improved.)\n\nSecond, I don't have to dig out my Jane's books to look up a range or specs on a particular weapons platform.  With a click or two you have that information available almost instantly.  The weapons database is one of the other reasons I call it a "system"\n\nThird, you must plan your attacks, or defenses with attention.  This is not the run in and gun type of game.  This requires thought and planning, considering terrain, resources and unknowns.\n\nFourth, you can create your own scenarios with units from the Korean War era to the near future.  Your imagination is not limited by the by the system but enhanced by it.  Oh, and by the way, there already is a large user community out there making scenarios for download.\n\nMy fifth and final positive point is that the developers are very engaged in this project.  Both fixing bugs and adding functionality.\n\nSome minor negatives:\n1.  Don't bother with the sound.  Turn it off and use your imagination.  There's no sound effects in the Command Room either, (Unless you count loud Lieutenants)\n\n2.  Some users have reported blocking bugs, but realtively few and the devs are actively working on it.  I have encountered none so far myself.\n\n3.  Currently no Steam Workshop support, but installing scenarios is no more complicated than unzipping and placing in the correct folder.\n\nA definate buy for the wargame enthusiast, but it is not for everyone.  If you have qualms about buying, do some research first.\n\n\n\n\n","September 29, 2014","true","79.5"," 71 of 93 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","71","93","0","4"

I paid full price for the game and I am satisfied.    It took me a few months to convince myself to purchase the game at full price so now I am committed to getting my money out of it.\n\nCons:\n\nPrice - It is very expensive for a game.   They are going to limit who buys or even considers this game because of the price... but maybe that's what the developers of the game want.\n\nLand Units - The game is called Command: Modern Air/Naval operations.  It's not called Command: Modern Air, Land and Naval operations,  I get that.   BUT,  really... you can't have marines, navy seals and other infantry units in the game and then put almost no programming to make the units useful in a scenario.   You can add marines or seals to an aircraft for deployment but you have no easy way to get them off the aircraft.   You have russian, UK paratroopers that you can select for a scenario but no US AB units.  You can't add specific infantry units to an aircraft for deployment.  The land units move around the battle field like aircraft in some cases.   Land unit gameplay could be better with a little tweaking.\n\n\nPros:\n\nThe air and naval side of the game is detailed to insanity.   You have to know your unit capabilities and weapon load capability to make it work.   If your jets fly over the enemy airfield and nothing goes BOOM... you did something wrong.  Check your weapon and load specifications.  If you are at 1000 feet but the weapon requires 10000 feet to be released.... it won't fire (lesson learned).   The game requires more then just a point and shoot mentaility.    You need to plan it out,  understand your unit and weapon capability to be successful.\n\nI won't go into submarine warfare part of the game because at this point I don't know what I am doing with it.   The details of the submarine gameplay are again, INSANE.\n\nScenario editor -  I love messing with the scenario editor and trying differnt event triggers and actions.  It's also a great way to learn more about units and weapons capability in the game.  The editor is what makes the game for me.   Most of my time in the game has been messing with the editor.    You can literaly build any operation or battle in this game.  The only limitation is your imagination and time.    Somene posted the game is 60% research,  30% scenario creation, 10% gameplay and that is about right.\n\nThis game makes you want to learn more about operations,  units and weapons.   It's required.\n\nSupport - I had an issue with one of the scenarios and support was there to help.  I'm always relunctant to contact support for any game because I know in most cases customer support is not a reality... but in my case the technician gave me a solution to my problem immediately.\n\nThis game has a dedicated development group that is constantly updating the game and listens to the players.\n\nThe game overall is a fun game to play.   As I learn more I'm sure it will get even better.

If yes to that, then answer: would you like to see what that stuff can do in a particular setting. If yes to the first, but not the second, just buy a copy of Jane's. If yes to both, then buy this.\n\nFor me, I was able to justify the cost, but in hindsight, I would have paid the full price (although who ever does that on Steam?! Oh, wait, me with Fallout 4) considering the sheer quantity of information available.\n\nThe gameplay is actually more intuitive than the UI might lead you to believe; although there are elements (probably whole swathes) I've yet to even discover. Imagine the fidelity of submarine control from Silent Hunter, combined with strategic nuking of DEFCON, combined with data reading of Papers, Please! combined with the field positioning of the Total War series (though with far inferior graphics - they really are poor, though you will soon see how irrelevant this is; chess didn't endure due to graphics!). Visually, watching a battleship bombardment closeup looks not dissimilar to a game of Missile Command - lines and expanding circles.\n\nWhat I have found most amazing is the way the "Friendly AI" keeps everything coherent and cohesive. Whilst a great deal of care must be used with mission loadouts etc, the game plays units smartly when you aren't tending to them.\n\nThere is a wealth of community stuff available - but the real gold isn't to be found on Steam. If you do pick this up Google for "Baloogan Campaign" and watch his YouTube video's - this guy takes it seriously and I ended up glued to his tutorial videos.\n\nDo I recommend? yes. Should you listen to my "recommendation" - with this title even I would urge caution; only a very specific mindset will appreciate it (it makes EVE look very simplistic by comparison for example).

Its good features could make for a gem of a game. However, its bad features deeply mar it. And, unfortunately, the bad features outweigh the positives BY FAR. I bought it from Matrix store one year ago and followed its evolution up to the current patch. Unfortunately I do not have good news.\n\nThe game is fairly functional, but the interface is crude and cumbersome with tremendous clutter in the single map that cannot be disabled.  The dearth of hotkeys is also noticeable as the player is forced to chase back and forth across the map with his mouse to accomplish the most basic and simple functions. The lack of a database editor for this game is quite significant especially in this day and age where the most successful games such as “ArmA” or “Crusader Kings 2” (not to mention “Harpoon” itself) actively encourage their user communities to create additional content and, more importantly, to tweak the existing one. “Command” users are limited to only those things that are already within the database since no new planes, ships, or submarines can be created nor can any pre-existing information be modified. You can mount American SSMs Tomahawks on a Soviet Kirov class cruiser, but players who like to tinker with known units (or experiment with hypothetical planes and weapons) are out of luck.\n\nThere is no multi-player option available at this time so players are limited to the AI opponent. The game is, in fact, primarily designed for players to issue general orders even for the friendly AI assistant to interpret and implement. Unfortunately, the AI is so weak that the users have to constantly follow what’s going on if they want to hope for success.  This means that the player is virtually compelled to micro-manage every single aspect of his battle.  Instead of the role of battle group commander, he is relegated more to that of supply clerk or bean counter as he almost has to fire each bullet or drop individual bombs from his aircraft.\n\nIf a daunting UI and awkward game functions do not scare you, then moving into surrealism maybe will. The “depth of research” and “the value of the database alone!” are the other items which are touted as “crown jewels” for this game. Then you discover that almost all planes’ speed is topped at 950kts. Planes capable of reaching MACH 2 on afterburner (about 1300kts) are out of luck. That these planes were designed for speed above anything else doesn’t seem to bother the “hard researching developers”. True, some planes, like the MiG-25 or its “heir”, the MiG-31 can exceed this “roof” and act as interceptors. But try to check an F-14, an F-15, an Eurofighter 2000 or even a Tu-22 “Backfire” (naval bomber, top speed 1,250kts): every single of them will have a top speed of 950kts.\n\nStill in the realm of surrealism is the weather model, which allows the player, via the scenario editor, to choose the weather for the whole world. A “true WWIII scenario!”, another possibility touted by the developers as the Second Coming or such (“Harpoon 3”, BTW, already manages thousands of units just fine) will see Russian ICBMs depart from their silos in a rainy Siberia, overfly a rainy North Pole (!) descend over the rain that pours over Canada from Montreal to Vancouver, follow the soaked Western Coast and hit a San Diego chilled by the low, rainy clouds. As a consolation, the people of San Diego can be assured that, in the meanwhile it is raining in Italy, Mumbai, Tasmania and the Marshall Islands. Maybe the developers were hit by the famous passage of James Joyce’s “The Dubliners” where Gabriel Conroy’s soul “swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead.” I don’t know. I love Joyce, but I never associated it with Tom Clancy.\n\nI had high hopes for fun from this game and excitedly followed its development and eagerly awaited its release one year ago from Matrix; but, even after the patches Command is, currently, too much of a chore to play.  It really is work to accomplish the simplest tasks.  Scenarios that might take 1 hour to play in similar games like Harpoon usually take 2-3 hours in “Command” due to the difficult interface. True, “Harpoon” players (the game “Command” will be most compared to) will be happy to know that many of the ìHarpoon 2/3 functions are replicated within “Command” thereby making it easy for them to quickly jump into the game, as the fundamental mechanisms are the same.  However, once in, they are likely to run into a wall of frustration as not all the helpful Harpoon 2/3 functions are available.  They soon begin to ask themselves “How do I do <<this function>> that I remember was so helpful in Harpoon?” only to find that it isn't possible with this new game. Why, just to give a simple example, I cannot designate an independent subordinate map for every area and/or group of platforms of interest, when ”Harpoon 2” managed to give us this opportunity in 1994? (!!) The sad truth is that every time I fire “Command” up, I start looking for something else to play within 10 minutes or so because the constant mouse-work required in this click-fest just isn't fun. The lack of basic game functions such as Multiple Maps and an easily functional or recognisable Formation Editor soon become apparent.\n\nCommand is like a "big box" of "shiny new toys”. A wargame like “Panzer Corps” gives you the whole War in Europe. You can (metaphorically) shake it and exclaim, "Wow! Ships! Airplanes! Land Units! Flame throwing tanks! Look at the beautiful map!” The same happens, for example, with "World in Flames" (yet to be published on Steam): "All the counters from the original war game! An enormous map! Video tutorials!"\n\nThe key question, however, is: "Do they work together to return a cohesive, fluidic, and fun game experience?" “Panzer Corps” does and it is a blast to play. "World in Flames", after a year, is BARELY functional, full of bugs, and lacks basic functions like an AI and multi-player capability.\n\nThen, a treasure like "Command Ops: Battle of the Bulge" comes along with its masterful use of real time, chain of command, and realistic control over troops in a war zone. A game worth every penny of its price But a lot of people will “shake the box” and say, "It's just the Battle of the Bulge! Where are the toys? I won't pay this price for only a Sherman and a Panther!"\n\n“Command” is a box full of "toys" ("Ships! Airplanes! Sensors!") which still lack cohesive and functional interaction. It is not "difficult to play" because it is supposedly realistic, but because the basic design still creaks BIG TIME. Ask any Admiral: their job is to fight the enemy, not the interface. And, maybe, the same Admiral will tell you that the sonar model is broken, but no one can do anything about it because the database is locked.\n\nDon’t be depressed if my comments sound negative! “Command” is delivered by passionate people. I can only see it to improve - hopefully to the point when you both have fun and your biggest challenge is to come up with a winning strategy. But, don't fall into the trap of, “Lots of toys + I need a degree in naval warfare = Masterpiece!" Games that help you learn while having fun: those are masterpieces worthy of your money. It doesn't even need to be a computer game. Even Chester W. Nimitz could have told you that.","October 7, 2014","false","9.8"," 98 of 144 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","98","144","4","5"

From it's seemingly endless and detailed military database to it's many scenarios that cover a period from 1945-2020 this is a military armchair generals wet dream. The game mechanics include a serious sensor/weapon gameplay in which an intricate amount of calculations are made akin to an actual military grade combat simulator. You want to see what happens when X forces attack Y area that has Z units? You will get a pretty accurate picture of how it would end up with this game.\n\nIn addition the editor seems to be a endless toolbox where you can exercise your dream military engagements and even create campaigns with some effort. There is a great deal of tools like triggers, events, scores, weather, time that help you create whatever scenario you dreamt of. The editor is where most of my time went to I tested hundreds of military hardwares in different situations. To give a few examples the S400 vs F35 or DF21D vs Gerald Ford Class Carrier. Both tests ended up having very interesting results.\n\nThere are some obvious downsides namely being the UI and Performance but those are not distruptive to the experience and have been improving ever since it's release with 9 big patches released so far. Kudos to the developer team for their continuous support of the product. As of the writing of this review I think the game has gotten very smooth on these two weak points.  In addition to those points I have to say out that the visual aspects of the game are weak since it features a world map but it maintains the modern Command and Control Center operator feel which is crucial.\n\nIf you think the price curve is too high for CMANO go get Command: Northern Inferno it's a smaller scale CMANO that features a 1975 Cold War turning hot campaign that will teach you how to play and will give you good a taste of the game mechanics.\n\nIn Conclusion I give this game 9/10.","October 24, 2015","true","149.1"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","32","38","0","0"

It provides a much more faithful model of modern air and naval strategy than any other game out there, vastly better than the Wargame series, and aligning with many other real sources. I don't think that there's any better simulation with both the depth and width of this.\n\nThere are a few issues. The UI is very hard to get used to (and the learning curve is rather steep) - while the interface looks like Google Earth, it doesn't work anything like it, and takes some time. The keyboard shortcuts are somewhat annoying to find, and are really, really nessecary to play well. It also requires something of a powerful CPU, as I'm running on a upper-mid-level notebook i7 and can't go much past 30x time acceleration.\n\nThe game certiantly is still under development. A number of features remain to be added, such as a time-on-target strike planner (what other game even needs one?) and "surge" air operations are forthcoming. However, the developers are very active and responsive, and the game constantly improves further. This is augmented by an extensive community of scenario creators that have done some fantastic work (I'm especially a fan of the Caribbean Crisis scenarios, where Venezuela invades the ABC islands).\n\nAll in all, I would highly reccomend this game. I think that the $80 I originally paid for it was entirely worth it, and the $60 price is more than justified. While I wish that they would reduce the price further, I think that if you have even a passing interest in modern military you should spend the money.\n\nEdit: Rewrote for more completness.","September 26, 2014","true","010.1"," 93 of 142 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","93","142","0","1"

Its cheaper than a subscription to Janes. There are a lot of decent scenarios written for this game.\n\nThat all said, this is still a game, when it could be a simulator (which is how it is advertised). It cant seem to pick between game and simulator - UI that makes life harder than it has to be, which is an absolute nono for a game, then a very realistic list of units to pick from - that do not follow realistic performance or tactics, especially the aircraft.\n\nIn fairness to the games developers, the game does handle ship to ship combat in the modern age, very well. Its aircraft still need a fair bit of love.\n\nThis is a game that for the longest time, I held hope that there was some chance that issues would be attended to - and if they were, the game still has that potential to be a fantastic military command simulation - but there is seemingly no interest in realism for the sake of reality.\n\nFor $30, this would be a fantastic game. At over 3 times that however, its simply not worth the money.\n\nEDIT - Having spent some time on the latest build of 1.07, Ive decided to revise my fair price upwards to $45. A number of very much needed improvements have been added since my last serious amount of in depth play, granting the player significantly more control over their units.\n\nAll other things being equal, one thing you cannot fault the developers on is their update cycle. Comparing 1.01 and 1.07 goes to show what an update cycle SHOULD look like. Many other small developers could take note.\n\nEDIT - With 1.10, Id pay $50 for this title. Controls are better, aircraft are smarter, a host of much needed improvements. Kudos again to the devs - literally the only thing at this point making this review a not recommended is the price tag.

Or, rather, gently rubbed at the surface, but I wish to state now that I thoroughly reccommend that you buy this game. There is one cabveat though. The price is very high. I admit this and I will say that I got it during the 50% off special sale here on Steam. I have been wanting to get CMANO since it was first released but just could not justify the cost.\n\nAnyway, what is so special? I played a game called Harpoon many years ago. I played each version as it came out. This is the spiritual successor to Harpoon. There are even the same people who were so influencial in Harpoon 2 and 3 working on this version. For example Ragnar Emsoy.\n\nWhat do you get for your money then?\nFlashy graphics with amazing 3d models of the ships and aircraft you control? No\nGreat voice acting? No\nGreat big explosions when your weapons hit an airfield? No\nA game of such depth and interest that it will keep you playing for years? Hell yes!!!\nA developer who is always looking for new additions to the game? Yes\nA developer who adds these new additions regularly? Yes\nA developer who fixes bugs quickly? Yes!\nLarge community who can help you get started? Yes\nThe ability to create your own scenarios? Yes\nThe ability to modify platforms with new weapons? Yes\n\nThe maps are basic, but then this is the point of the game. You are controlling groups and platforms from a command centre. you are not looking down on the world seeing Intruders and prowlers flying over mountains. You have NTDS symbols that move across the map following your flight plan.\n\nWhen creating scenarios you don't just have two sides to play with. Create multiple sides with different postures between various factions. No longer red vs blue. Want red vs blue with green who are neutral to blue but also are unfriendly to red? Easy to set this up.\n\nThis is not an easy game. If you want a game that you manually fly your intruder into Hanoi airspace during the Vietnam war, expect to destroy a missile park, (yeah, I've read "flight of the Intruder" lots!), and fly out again this is not for you. If you want to plan full alpha strikes and set up ingress and egress points yourself with iron hand missions going in first then this is for you. But this is not just a game set in the past. The platforms include the Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier, not yet in service. There are two databases available for the game, the cold war database and DB3000. This give you the choice of so many platforms with DB3000 giving platforms from 1980 to 2015 onwards. This is so brilliant!!!\n\nPersonally I think that I may as well remove most of my other games from my downloads as they will not get played a lot now.\n\nI will stop here as I have been writing this while waiting for my Seawolf to creep around an island looking for 2 Nampo frigates that are there somewhere. :-)","June 14, 2015","true","21.0"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","29","36","2","0"

Naturally, this is for passionate strategy fans with great demand for realism. Even though this game focuses primarily only on naval and air control, the degree of realism is quite high.\n\nAt first you can just launch some planes and order them to engage particular enemies with few buttons.... OR you can analyze characteristics and properties of your planes, naval units, their missiles, radar specifications, etc. etc. and use that to choose certain combinations of loadout and to control individual planes' movement, speed and other properties in high detail, even though without fancy graphics.\n\nThe game offers a range of scenarios, both hypothetical and historical, yet it remains a tactically-oriented strategy, rather than something global like what we see from Paradox or even other Matrix Games titles. Nonetheless, if that's what you're looking for, then you found something worth your while.\n\nLastly, performance can be an issue as the game seems to be quite demanding despite its lack of great graphics. Don't let screenshots deceive you - this game will weigh on your PC unless it's adequate enough to run some of the latest titles on ultra settings.\n\nOther than that 7/10. I'm sure there is a niche for this kind of games, and this looks like the most serious\professional strategy game ever made - a kind of game that NATO staff plays to exercise their strategic skills.

You don't know terror until you've heard the VAMPIRE alarm go off seven times in less than seven seconds as that ♥♥♥♥ing boomer you've been trying to hunt decided it's had enough of your ♥♥♥♥.\n\nCombine a game that probably could be sold to naval war schools (and probably *is*) with a database of military planes and weaponry from the start of the Cold War to the 2020's, and it gets even better. Add in a healthy amount of theoretical platforms such as the F-19 'Frisbee', the A-12 Avenger, a navalized F-22, stealthy anti-ship missiles, and more you can put in with the editor, and pretty much any concevible air to air battle can be portrayed by this game.\n\nDownside is the price. Get it on sale with Northern Inferno and have a blast. A nuclear depth-charge fueled blast. So satisfying.\n\nTL;DR 10/10 would cause global thermonuclear war again.\n","March 11","true","57.9"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","16","20","3","0"

I tried playing Harpoon before, but for some reason, its user interface kept leaving me frustrated and I didn't feel immersed in my encounters because of the struggle I had with the UI. C:MANO's user interface is better, and more intuitive, and right after I bought it I was able to immediately play and enjoy a scenario without reading a document or manual. The unit/weapon database is astounding in depth and surprisingly updated. It truly is a fantasy sandbox for anyone wanting to see how a scenario involving a particular set of units would play out. I recommend this game to hard core real-time real world military simulation enthusiast who will not be turned off by the fact that the game doesn't have much "Michael Bay" effects in it--only serious number crunching and fantastically accurate outcomes of scenarios and engagements.

Why? Well, here are some pros and cons:\n\n+Depth\nThis is something inherent to any good sim. To simulate a proper environment, the game must allow one to interact with the world to a huge extent. C:MANO excels at this. You can manage aircraft loadouts from a huge variety of options, decide the speed and height/depth each unit follows. Weapons can be fired automatically, but also can be manually fired if the player prefers an exact amount. Want your units to fire more AMRAAMs at targets automatically? If so, you can tweak that with an extensive ROE/EMCON/whatnot menu. This governs a variety of things from the use of nuclear weapons and evasive manuevering to what radar/sonar/ECM profiles your units follow. This can also be set on a unit to unit basis.\n\n+Editor\nThis is where I spend most of my time. While the game comes with a large variety of scenarios and the "Community Scenario Pack" contains enough that you will never finish them all, sometimes there are places where the player wants something else. Want to have a fight between two opposing carrier groups or test that weapon system against another? Well, you can do that. While I typically prefer to make shorter, less intricate missions, there is a scripting system in place for all of your more complicated ideas.\n\n+Database\nThis pretty much goes hand in hand with the editor. Without both, the game couldn't really thrive. Really, I am constantly surprised at how many systems are there. From supercarriers and hypothetical aircraft to obscure coast guard helicopters, the game has it. Ohh, and if it doesn't, it also has a huge weapons database. Want to give that arleigh burke a laser? Well, its pretty fun.\n\n+Active Developers\nSomething I find great about C:MANO is that, despite the release being, in my opinion, worth the money, the devs have continued to update the game, adding features that I never knew I would love.\n\n+Realism\nRealism is obviously going to be inherent in this type of game, but realism does not make a game great. However, when the other, above things are considered, it adds a lot of extra value. The effort they put into the ECM and Radar systems are truely astounding. It adds extra meaning when your aircraft have realistic sortie rates and your weapons have the proper ranges. It allows C:MANO to be beyond a game, and be a sim where one can learn about many technologies from the early Cold War to the near future.\n\n+-UI\nFrom a quick glance, it is easy to call the UI ugly and overall of poor quality. Sure, there are some things that could use improvement, but the UI is ultimately very functional. I actually like how it looks because it gives the impression of a more realistic program, something a more gamey UI could not provide.\n\n+-Learning Curve\nThat is one of the concerns about the game. Having a steep learning curve can be very annoying to new players and can easily scare off potential customers. However, while a difficult learning curve is hardly ideal, it is all but necessary in a game with as much depth as C:MANO. I recommend jumping in and playing one of the "First Contact" scenarios a few times. Sure, you will get demolished for a bit, but thats they way I figured out how to play, and I found it quite fun, slowly getting better.\n\n-Land Combat\nLand combat, if you couldn't tell from the game's name, is a very weak part of the game. Infantry platoons are always unable to kill anything before running out of ammo and vehicles behave in an unrealistic manner. As I have heard said before, land units in this game only exist to be targets. Another huge failure is the inability to disembark land units from landing craft, helicopters, and aircraft. Many scenario authors will teleport/create ground units to simulate this, but it is always very artificial and restricted. However, as I said before, the dev team is very active, and I wouldn't be surprised at all if land combat was fixed later.\n\n-Price\nOkay, the $80 price tag is very steep. However, I absolutely believe it is worth the cost. There isn't another game like it, and it is truely a gem. Also, I would like to point out that many people spend $60 on games of *much* less quality every year.\nI think its also reasonable to point out that Steam Refunds exist.\n\nAnyway, I think the last thing I should point out is that C:MANO isn't for everyone. It is a very time consuming game and even some of the shorter scenarios are quite long. Even if you do have an abundance of time, any possible enjoyment could be taken away by its slow pacing or lack of visuals.\n\nThanks for reading this, good luck with your decision-making. :)","October 20, 2015","true","270.6"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","14","20","3","0"

That said, this is like straight up military porn. Words fail to convey just how much I love this simulator, and I call it a simulator because to call it a game would essentially be like calling GabeN an unaccomplished nobody.\n\nSeriously though, this is not a simulator for the faint of heart, or for RTS gamers looking for cutesy 3D models, explosions, and hit points. Everything, and I mean EV-ER-RY-THIN-G, is modeled in excruciating detail with extreme care and thought at every turn, from individual weapons systems to radar performance to 1970s era warships. The only thing not modeled to an insane level are ground units, and by that I mean that this is not a simulator intended to play out a second Korean ground war or the fighting in the Ukraine. But for air and naval systems, the detail and amount of control are beyond anything else I've personally seen in either a military or civilian product.\n\nBe warned, the learning curve is extremely steep, mainly because there are so many options and variables to take into account. But if that doesn't scare you, or if you happen to be a fan of the Harpoon series, then look no further because you've found the last serious air and naval combat simulator you'll ever need.\n\nI happened to catch it on sale, but I'm completely serious when saying that $80-90 is not nearly too much to ask for such a deep, serious, and versatile simulation tool. Do yourself this favor and just buy it already so that years from now you can tell your grandkids 'sit down, kiddo, and let me tell you about the best damn conflict simulator I'd ever had the privilege of seeing in my life.'\n\nTL/DR: If you like Harpoon or excruciating detail and don't care about graphics when it comes to serious military simulations, then quit reading/being a cheapskate and buy this NOW.

It looked interesting and looked like it would be fun, but so far it is just too overwhelming and much too complicated to appreciate.  I may come to love it, but I'll most likely give up on it and go on to something a bit easier to grasp.  I find the gameplay isn't very intutive.  The UI seems antiquated and hard to manage.  I could see this game possibly being fun once you learned all the nuances of it, but that WILL take some time.  I think for casual gamers this isn't a good match.  I prefer games like war games like Hearts of Iron, Supreme Ruler and the ilk.  This game is not like those except in the broadest terms.  Those games have some complexity, but they aren't too difficult to figure out... they are intutive, for the most part, this game on the other hand is not.  My opinion may change if I ever take the time to get a complete understanding of it, but at present that seems a daunting task.  I think the game has a lot of potential and I love the specifics, details and all the minutiae the game provides, but I think the UI ruins the game.  The tutorials aren't very good and the graphics need updating.  I normally don't care too much about graphics, but this game seems to be lacking them almost altogether.  The price of the game is too high in my opinion.  I think the game is so high because of all the research involved.  Having a large database is nice, but I think the first goal should be playability.  The playability for this game is woefully lacking.  I wish I could trade this game in for another... they make a game that I think I would enjoy much more (War in the East).  I wish they would have offerred this for a free weekend so I could try it first... I bought it on sale for $59.99 (normally $79.99) and can already tell that it really isn't a game for me... and have only put in a couple hours or so.  I'm posting this review so others are forewarned, it's not what you MIGHT expect!  I thought it would be amazing considering the price and what I got was lackluster at best.  The game isn't horrible, but way over-priced for the casual gamer.  I think they are targeting a particular type of player and since they have basically no or little competition they can charge a lot for what they offer... so if you never played Harpoon or aren't a military junkie I would recommend giving this a pass.\nThey need to offer this for a free trial weekend, but I don't think they will.  They probably are afraid that if they did they would lose more customers that might give it a try when it was on sale (like me) than they would gain from those interested enough to purchase after a trial weekend.\nHopefully, I can get some enjoyment out of it... eventually.","October 25, 2015","false","3.2"," 27 of 47 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","27","47","0","3"

Also, i need to really know about the unit/s i am commanding. I need to know what they have in regards to all manner of things ranging from weapons to sensors.\nI need to think before i attack. Tactics. Real tactics. Guns blazing often gets you killed.\nAnd then there are things such as creating missions in a scenario. Instead of just directing my units by clicking on a spot on the map and hoping i find something i can set search patterns, or direct units to patrol. and the AI will actually do it without completely messing up by expecting me to babysit them all the time.\nAnother refreshing thing is the combat itself. The best thing i can compare it to is a tabletop wargame. It essentially rolls a virtual dice, in the background, for hits and misses, with modifiers that influence the outcome, of course. To me that represents something that some RTS's are missing, and thats individual skill. A bit like the UFO games with the people in your unit having their own skill sets.\n\nFor me, though, the icing on the cake is the scenario editor. I can create so much. I have recreated the Falklands War. I created WW3 I even created small scenarios such as pirate hunting. This is all done because there are so many tools at your disposal.\nNow, i know a lot of RTS's have mission editors. But not to this extent. At least none that i have played.\n\nI love naval combat. So this filled a niche that was missing in my game library. Dont get me wrong, the air combat is just as good. But i have a history of family members who were Royal Navy. So there is a bit of bias. I always loved hearing about tactics and ship types and so on...\nWhich brings me to another point, that may seem odd to some people but others may be able to relate to: I am unable to serve in any of the armed forces. But if i could i would. This provides me a small amount of satisfaction in that i can at least play act, in a way, i can feel like i am commanding a ship in battle or a wing of Air Force jets. Something no RTS has ever given me.\n\nAnyway, i could go on and on about this game.\nIt is a great milsim. Dont let the price put you off, its dear for a good reason. You are not buying a game that you will forget next week when the next AAA title comes out. Its something that will make you come back for more. Understamd, though, this game has a steep learning curve, and i urge you to read the manual that is available in the Forums section of the CMANO community. It helped me a lot. And also Youtube is your friend.\n","January 3, 2015","true","91.1"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Anyway I played the three tutorial missions (air, sub, surface) and enjoyed them. Then I played through a scenario set in Somalia where I had to protect some crash site for six hours ("Raven 21 is down"), and my experience was not good.\n\nTo sum it up, the interface is fairly terrible, the AI is very poor, and the game (at least the scenario I played) seems quite easy. Setting up "patrols" results in your AI unloading all their weapons at a crazy pace, so the game becomes a very slow, long exercise in micro-management. Anything related to land units seems broken - I had Chinooks with USMC dudes but I couldn't figure out how to unload them. The enemy had a Brigade of tanks and they drove off to the wrong side of the map rather than attack my two squads of SEALS. Enemy vessels just cruise into you - they unload a few missiles, then just keep on charging even though they have no weapons, right into my fleet of 7 US ships... who mightily screwed them up.\n\nOverall I think Janes Fleet Command is still a much better game, this new one is more detailed (adjusting weapon load outs etc) but it's just not that much fun, at least for me.\n\nWhen the game was over (after I had protected the crash site as directed and pretty much killed everything Soviet) the game gave me a score of zero - "average". Highly annoying after maybe 2 hours of playing the one scenario.\n\nSo fairly disappointing overall. Maybe there are some gold scenarios that are much better, but so far I'm unimpressed.

You could then sell the information to interested parties, I mean party, cough cough.\n\nThus, the price is completely justified.\n\nMake no mistake this game is pretty much like a flash game. It has no 3D graphics and almost no sound effects what so ever except for about 5 types of sounds plus basic music. Some would think it would be better to turn them off.\n\nI shall give more updated review once I have obtained return on my investment. Should you not hear from me again, I'm probably dead from trying to sell information gleaned from the game and my rather advanced consciousness or kidnapped by the North Korean government to help them with military intel.\n\nOr I got accepted into the CIA.\n\nIf you're adventurous or dangerous buy this game. If you're a sheep, stay away and buy the grass simulator.\n\nJoke aside,\nREVIEW\nThe gameplay isn't bad but I wouldn't say extraordinarily good because it's not. The game appeals to military enthusiats and hobbyist. It's not particularly difficult to understand the game but then again I'm pretty familiar with most military units and weapons.\n\nBuy it if you are a military enthusiast/buff or a thinker and buy it while it's on sale. The game needs a lot of your imagination because you hear little and see only NATO symbols on a 2D map.\nThe database of weapon systems is amazing and probably the most amazing thing about the game.\nIn that sense the game might last you half a lifetime through its database alone if you really like these kinds of games. I can foresee the developer updating the units into the near future as at the moment global naval powers see rapid growth and new units being comissioned like never before. The end of the cold war brought a hiatus in naval weapon system development but today, nations race to launch new platforms to service. The global powers are preparing for global scale war thanks to depletion of global oil supply, the melting of the arctic and the rising sea level due to global warming that the majority of civilians still fail to recognize.\n\nYou won't go crazy over the game but the appeal could be long lasting and you will probably come back now and then and get to experience a battlefield commander role in modern naval and air operations.\n\nWhile the vanilla game lacks pictures of units, a community mod helps with adding pictures to most units and it enhances the game quite a bit.\n\n\nUpdate:\nFIRST SCENARIO\nAfter playing several scenarios I can say the game grows on you, the tension is real. Watching two small Philippines corvettes duking it out with a Chinese frigate was pretty tense and enjoyable. The skipper of the first Philippines corvette did real good job of damaging the Chinese Jianghu frigate although his ship's weapons and displacement were outmatched by the Chinese. The second Philippines corvette didn't fare too well having his ship's engine taken out early.\n\nThe U.S. is racing to the scene and a Chinese surface group is fast approaching. I'm hoping the Virginia SSN would be able to put a dent to the group. Meanwhile I haven't found the Chinese submarine suspected to be loitering in the vicinity. The Helo I sent for an anti ship mission successfully struck the Jianghu frigate damaging it further real good.\n\nMy task force is approaching to deal the final blow to the now heavily damaged Jianghu frigate. She's on fire and suffers from severe flooding. Meanwhile, a yet identified Chinese military vessel is fast coming to help the Jianghu and I'm not letting that happen. Just hoping no Chinese sub or two will surprise me. The helo assigned to the ASW mission still hasn't found the sub. I just hope the waters in front are clear.\n\nThe F-18E squadron from Singapore is on transit and I'm going to send them to cripple the incoming Chinese surface group.\n\nLATER ON\nHowever, after the two corvettes under Philippines command had been sunk, things took a turn for the worse. The new U.S. LCS ships were taken out rapidly by the Chinese forces through a combination of long range anti ship missiles and 100mm naval gun (these ships didn't seem to be armored). The capable Arleigh Burke DDG was sunk by a torpedo launched by a Chinese sub. The Chinese sub was successfully prosecuted but at the cost of the DDG. The Chinese have won their first South East Asia naval battle.\n\nSECOND SCENARIO\nIn the second memorable scenario, the cold war had gone hot. A U.S. warship had been rammed by the Soviet. A U.S. landing group had just landed its marines in northern Norway and one of the landing ships was strafed by a Su-17 Fitter. Now the group has been ordered to make at best speed to a safe port to the south.\n\nA U.S. surface group is tasked with protecting the landing group. A Soviet surface group in the vicinity of John Mayen island is returning to Murmanks with the order to sink any encountered U.S. warship along the route.\n\nEarly, a military intelligence gathering ship of the Soviet Union that had been tailing the U.S. surface group was sunk.\n\nThe squadrons from the U.K. and Norway were launched for an ASuW mission to seek out the Soviet surface group which they did and sank a few of its ships. The U.S. surface group meanwhile is on the move to intercept the Soviet group. Unless the Soviets send in their long range bombers with standoff ASuW weapons it seems I'm going to win this engagement!\n\nDamn the suspense is good.\n\nTHIRD SCENARIO\n\nThe third memorable scenario is Raven 21 down. The U.S. has lost an aircraft near the Somalian coast. It has dispatched a rescue SEAL team to evacuate the downed aircraft crew.\n\nHowever, the somalians and the Soviets are bearing down the crash site with tanks, armored personnel carriers and military trucks. The Somalian air force that has benefitted heavily from Soviet assistance has also been scambled to support the operation in addition to several Somalian patrol boats.\n\nBut the mighty U.S. has a carrier battle group just off the coast. The many group flights of A-7 Corsairs and AV-7 Harriers, escorted by Crusaders and helped by artillery fire from a U.S. surface group near the coast decimated the Somalian and Soviet ground force bearing down the crash site. It felt good saving lives. Evacuation will finish in 5 more hours!\n\nON REALISM (Update, Jan 10th 2015)\nAfter playing more I began to notice the game is actually not that quite realistic. For example, one of my controlled submarine was able to detect the radar emissions from an enemy frigate while doing 9 knots! In real life this would not be possible because the ESM would break at more than 5 knots as detection of radar emission would require the sub to go to periscope depth and extend its ESM mast (maybe modern sub's masts could withstand 9-10 knots of periscope depth speed).\n\nOther thing I noticed was that as soon as my aircraft expended their medium radar guided missiles (the AIM-120B AMRAAM missiles), they immediately turned back to return to base but the AIM-120B requires radar lock until certain distance where it goes autonomous but this isn't factored in in the 'simulation'.\n\nSUMMARY\nThe game is well made. The gameplay is good for a grognard. However, the performance leaves somewhat to be desired on accelerated time as you would see things kind of rubber banding when there are a lot of things going on at the same time. That being said, I don't regret my purchase. It is a little expensive but they don't milk its buyers with ridiculous DLCs. It's a niche game hence the pricing. If you're a grognard and not too fanatic about realism, this is your game.","December 21, 2014","true","50.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","6"

It is also complex, but not in any unreasonable way. Some of the smaller scenarios are actually pretty simple once you understand the interface and the menus, but the player needs to be able to grasp how the game world is being presented, which means understanding the terminology and the symbols. You just don't decide to pick up this game on a whim and be good at it in an hour. However, the tutorials (as I remember them, it's been quite a while) were very good.\n\nWhere the game really shines is in the vast number of scenarios, both official and fan created. The player can pick and choose what interests him/her which makes the game easier to get into. And creating scenarios for one's own satisfaction is fairly straightforward. This is useful because it allows you to try out different features of the game and/or different bits and pieces of the hardware database.\n\nAnd the database is pretty vast. If your interest lies in the just post WW2 era, pretty much every piece of hardware, from carriers to patrol boats is there. If it's attuned more to near-future conflicts, same thing, pretty much all the hardware is there. And hardware doesn't just mean ships and planes, missiles and guns. It's sensors, radar, sonar, ECM, ECCM, ESM, the whole gamut of electronics. And don't forget the different types of ammo and fuels.\n\nIf there is a weakness to the game, it's that the behavior of the AI in the scenarios has to be scripted to some extent, and in some ways quite extensively. You are not playing a representation of another person who will play the scenario different each time. Although there are some tools in the scenario development to support randomness in deployment or actions, for the most part scenarios will play out in roughly the same way. This isn't a bad thing in most cases, as the official and the community scenarios are well constructed to give the player an interesting challenge, and there are a whole lot of them. Just don't expect to replay the same scenario over and over and find new, unexpected behaviors from the AI each time. Also, if you think about it, this isn't a weakness at all. If you are playing to learn as well as being entertained, you will want to replay a scenario more than once to understand what happened and why. Most wargamers (or at least me) play as much to learn about the hardware and the tactics as much as to just have fun.\n\nSo, overall, is the game worth the money? If this type of gaming is your thing, then yes it is worth it. The price is higher than the norm, but it's really a niche game that required (and still requires) a lot of support to provide those new features and the seeming constant updates to the database. And cost is relative in a case like this. Me, I've spent much more than the cost of the game just on one edition of Jane's Fighting Ships, or Jane's Weapon Systems, or the Naval Press Institute's Combat Fleets of the World, or what have you. It is *not* for the casual player or the impulse buyer.","October 9, 2014","true","1.0"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

I bought it full price about a year ago, I consistently go back and play it as you can see from my hours. The reason I go back to it is because I have not found another game like this out there. The amount of content and sheer size of this game is massive. Why the negative review? The reason "I consistently go back and play it" and don't continuosly play it is because it is EXTREMELY UNSTABLE and I can only take crashing so much before I move back to my other stable games. I literally crash every time I play in one way or another. The tech support is great and the community is very helpful and loyal, but that only goes so far and doesn't fix all the bugs. Editing missions is almost impossible if you want to work at a modern pace, if you try to work efficiently you will have problems. Playing the missions/campaigns at even 5x speed will cause issues as well. I will continue to go back and play especially when there are updates to see if things change and would love nothing more than to change my review to a huge thumbs up, but for now it's a no go for me. I wrote this review right after spending the day making a mission and I just had to stop and write this. Frustrating because it could be so good. Not worth the money in it's current state.

In case you haven't played those, then its an operational level simulator that has you commanding naval, air and ground assets. Its real strong points are naval and air combat, with ground combat being very much a secondary thing, in support of the other two. Its very well detailed, and with the mission editor almost any scenario can be created. It lets you have access to anything from an OV-10, to SS-18 Satans. Your imagination truely is the limit with this if you are a mission maker.\n\nEdit:\nThe maximum size of missions allowed by (my) computer and the software allows for the simulation of for example a few CVBGs attacking a small-medium sized country (say Israel or Iraq). Beyond size when it comes to active units it might get a little difficult. So you won't see a full on exchange involving all the strategic weapons (ICBMs, SLBM, strategic bombers, plus all the things hunting or protecting against them) of the US and USSR, things would probably get too bogged down. But you can simulate the initial stages of an invasion of Cuba, or possibly one of the Arab-Israeli wars if your computer is good enough.\n\nThe game does not force you to micromanage your units, you can give them missions and objectives, for example you can have one group conduct SEAD/DEAD, another conduct strike missions, and a third run CAP to protect the other two. However in some ways you may benefit from micromanaging some aspects like the strike missions if enemy AD is particularly nasty.\n\nSoftware stability is fine and except for perhaps some issues with optimization it runs well for me, even with most of the larger missions.\n\nThe game comes with two databases, a Cold War database which has units from 1945 to 1975, and database with units from 75 to now. The Cold War database has some WW2 era combatants in it, but I haven't examined it and the impression I have is that it is incomplete for the WW2 stuff. What there is is late war weapons and ships.\n\nNow its not for everyone, if you are to enjoy this you will want to have an interest in the subject matter, it would probably help to have some knowledge of it, and certainly you will want to have some curiosity and be willing to look at a map (there are no 3D graphics in this at all).\n\nGround combat it doesn't do well at all and as I mentioned before is very much secondary to air and naval combat.\n\nMe, I love it and have had it since it came out a year ago, but I'm a little weird.","September 27, 2014","true","341.6"," 16 of 31 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","16","31","0","0"

It's got enough stats to make the nerd in you smile contentedly and enough complexity for real Simmers to enjoy meddling until their hearts content - yet it remains totally accessible to plebs like me, who really would love to know how to play a game like this properly, but haven't the patience to learn it.\n\nJust a few re-runs of the tutorials, then dipping my toe in the Scenarios and I'm already comfortable enough to fly a sortie or two, travel undetected through enemy waters in a Sub or activate a Battle Fleet for full on Naval warfare. I've even been launching Tankers for refuelling and electronic surveillance planes for better Radar. That kind of logistical detail is the stuff I usually get lost with.\n\nThe best thing about the game is once you know the interface and the main enablers to get your icons rolling into the sky or out into the sea, the AI does allow for micro managers to step in or out of the action. I'm not a great micro manager so I just oversee them (to make sure the odd unit doesn't go off on it's own doing something weird, which has happened occasionally - turns out that's my dodgy Doctrine settings!).

There are no roads, there are no rivers and there are no cites as such. A T72 will roll across terrain that you know is marshland or mountains, it won't slow it down or effect it in any way. This game is expensive but also has a decent modding community.\nHOI3 lacked massively because you couldn't move your forces around very well, only from one region to the next, this game doesn't have that particular limitation but instead brings a dozen more.\nIn HOI3 you can easily (ish) control entire army groups due to a proper structure system, in this you'll struggle to control a division sized force. The logistics system (for ground units anyway) sucks pretty badly.\nThat said, it's still probably the best air and navy simulator on steam.  I'm a army person though and should have spent more time looking at reviews.\n\n9/10 for naval forces.\n8/10 for air forces.\n2/10 for ground forces.\n1/10 for the map and terrain when using ground forces.","January 13, 2015","true","3.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Like its predecessor, graphics aren't much, but you really don't need fancy graphics for something like this (if you do want graphics similar to Jane's Fleet Command, Global Conflict Blue may be more up your alley).  Has LUA scripting support.  Word of warning though: If you don't enjoy staring at tons of unit/weapon tables, this is probably not the game for you.  As of the writing of this, while naval/air combat is simulated quite well, ground combat really isn't there quite yet.  Important to note that the devs constantly update this game.  Regarding the price:  I bought it for full price, I've personally gotten more than my money's worth from it, but considering it's a very niche game: if you don't KNOW you'll get your money's worth out of it, I would recommend you purchase it when it's on sale.

There is a lot of detail in the game and the AI seems to work well. Although if you make a mistake in setting up your missions there is no assistance and so at first it can be a little frustrating working out why your missions don't go to plan. For example if you setup a plane formation and your allocated  group of planes does not have enough planes the AI will just leave some of your aircraft floundering. I think in that respect the interface could be improved in letting the player know where there is an issue. I believe the simulation is under constant development. There are different layers of settings or so called doctrines to control your own sides AI and that can get complicated. On first look the simulation looks very basic, no next gen 3D graphics here, and it is although it uses detailed world wide terrain maps. Note a fast CPU will help since I understand the AI decision making is detailed and so I expect a lot of units could slow down the game. I've not had any issues here but I've  only been playing relatively small scenarios. The instructions are basic and so the best way to learn how to play is to see people playing it and Bunyap sims has a nice set of Youtube videos. Baloogan also champions the sim and has his own supporting web site on the military database the simulation uses. The database is very detailed and the AI uses the info it contains for its decision making. You have to import most of the database images from a fan site due to copyright issues. There are a lot of scenarious included to play through although you can design your own scenarious.  Its a shame the developers couldn't reduce the retail price so people sitiing on the fence would buy it. I bought mine in a recent Steam sale.  If you are interested in military hardware and strategy from after WWII to the present you will like this game/simulation.","May 15","true","24.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

It’s a simulation that’s as close as many of us will ever get to real Pentagon simulation. C:MANO, as fans call it, is a real-time game that boasts an incredibly rich—and unclassified—database of the aircraft and ships of the Cold War and beyond. [...] I strongly suspect that this game won’t prove any less accurate than the government’s tippity-top-secret simulations.”\n\nUsenet (CSIPGWH) - Wargame of the Year 2013: “I had no idea just how epic this thing is.”\n\nEurogamer.dk – Best Simulation of 2013: “Command is already, in its v1.02 incarnation, not just a technical marvel, there are still rough spots, but certainly a technical achievement of admirable caliber, and admiration is not diminished by the fact that it is made by only four men. [...] If you look a little into the future, there is no reason why this could not be the ultimate operational and tactical sea and air war simulator on the market.”\n\nGrogHeads Readers Choice Awards 2013 – Digital Wargame of the Year and overall Digital Game of the Year: “Our Digital Wargame of the Year was certainly a worthy title holder, as Command: Modern Air/Naval Operations pulled in first place over several other acclaimed titles.”\n\nEurogamer.dk – Runner-up Wargame of 2014: “Command was Simulator of the Year for 2013 (we switched category). Since then its development, just as we predicted last year, has not stopped. All of the past year new free updates to the game have been made available that have refined and transformed what was already the high point of the genre.  With its latest 1.06 update, this stunning sea and air-land war simulator gets even better: in particular, there are new options for flight operations (Surge and Quick-Turnaround air operations) and an even more advanced scenario editor.”\n\n\n\n\n\nREVIEWS (v1.05 / WOTY)\n\nMartin Wiinholt, Eurogamer.dk : “CMANO: ‘Wargame of the Year Edition’ is a perfect-10 on the road from here: there is simply no other game (or simulation) doing what this game does. Whether you want to explore the current conflict in Ukraine, create a scenario that reveals aspects of a potential conflict between China and its neighbors over the oil in the South China Sea, or you want to try to see Israel bombing Iranian nuclear facilities, CMANO can handle it. For the last year it hasn’t left my hard drive. One can never never truly ‘finish’ it – whether you are studying military history at university or if you just love the intellectual challenge of strategy and tactics, CMANO delivers on all counts. It’s the gift that keeps on giving.\nFor this reviewer, CMANO is one of the most important wargames that have come out since the original Harpoon in 1989, and as such it should be rewarded: 10 / 10.”\n\nMaj. Erich Swafford MD USAF (ret), Wargamer.com: “Command: Modern Air/Naval Operations belongs in the library of anyone who has even a passing interest in Air/Naval warfare, students of warfare since 1945, and also just wargamers in general who like a fun game. Like Battles of Napoleon, Combat Mission Beyond Overlord, and War in the East – this is one of those classics that will never leave my drive.\nNo matter what new game comes out, I always find myself coming back to CMANO because of its unrivaled ease of use and its ability to simulate events which would otherwise be totally inaccessible. This is probably the most important wargame to come out since I started in the hobby back in 1979. It’s pretty much what we all dreamed about having back then, and to now have something this professional-grade available for home use is just nothing short of amazing.”\n\n\n\n\n\nREVIEWS (v1.00-1.04)\n\nUS Naval Institute : ““Command” will find a following not only among civilian gamers but might have value among military, government, and policy circles as a simulator of modern warfare. […] what time the designers did not spend making graphics and interface attractive were spent on building a game that depicts modern warfare on an unmatched scale. […] [This] is a game with broad appeal for everyone from casual gamers to government users looking to model unclassified, informal simulations. It likely will be the main choice for hard modern warfare simulators for years to come.”\n\nSimHQ: “the interface is full of thoughtful details which add up to a very easy-to-use system that’s both intuitive and powerful .[...] I started playing the other night at 8pm, and my wife angrily tracked me down 4 hours later. I told her I thought I’d been playing about 45 minutes, and I meant it. She wasn’t amused, but I sure was. The game pretty much grabbed me and hasn’t let go. [...] If you’re into modern military hardware, what-if matchups or historical conflict analysis, this wargame is definitely what you’ve been waiting for. [...] Command is, if you’re into the subject at all, an investment in something which you will quite likely still be enjoying for many years.”\n\nOut of Eight Reviews : “The powerful yet relatively easy-to-use scenario editor includes a map of the entire world and essentially every plane, ship, and submarine used by any country the past sixty years; it’s a tool that should be fully embraced by the community. [...] The flexibility to manage what you want and automate the rest certainly expands the appeal of this realistic military simulation. The AI does a good job following directions and behaving intelligently, and provides a good opponent for the battles. [...] The exhaustive unit research, flexible scenario editor, handy automated mission system, and relatively accessible interface will make Command: Modern Air/Naval Operations appeal to any fan of realistic military strategy games.”\n\nArmchair General: “To sum up: Although the price tag might seem a bit much, this game is well worth every cent of it. If you have even a passing interest in the subject matter, then this game is for you. Command: Modern Air/Naval Operations is, without a doubt, a seriously fun, intense, involving simulation of modern naval combat with nearly infinite replay value. It is a more than worthy successor to Harpoon.”\n\nHub3r.com: “The amount of content provided with the game is baffling. I was blown away by the amount of details, customization to our fleet, how I could control every aspect of the scenario without ever feeling overwhelmed. That was mostly due to how the user interface works. Sure, it still needs some work when assigning missions but overall it was a pleasant surprise. Last, but not least, community help and how Warfare Sims handles it. Tons of new scenarios in a matter of months! New database stuff, its amazing! Overall, Command: Modern Air/Naval Operations is one of those games that I will pick up five or ten years from now and it will still be awesome to play. Definitely one of the best strategy / wargames released in 2013.”\n\nCoiler at Amazon.com:“Conclusion: Since 1.01, the hardworking developers at WarfareSims have improved upon their already spectacular product. Version 1.04 of C:MANO takes a base game that was incredibly adaptable and makes it even more so.”\n\n","February 21, 2015","true","475.6"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","5","11","2","1"

The Good, the Bad, and the downright Ugly.\nFor additional detail, see: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=323634285\n\n4.0 / 10.0 rating\n\nThe Good\n\n1. Many game functions and commands are compatible with Harpoon3. H3 veterans will easily grasp the basic game concepts and controls and be playing within an hour.\n2. A physics package will ensure that most units will observe the Laws of Physics.  This means no more instantaneous acceleration, turns, dives, or missiles fired 'over-the-shoulder' at a pursuer.\n3. Sensors and weapons report very detailed resolution through comprehensive messages that show the various modifiers and variables. These messages can be disabled if they turn out to be too much information.\n4. A Scenario Editor allows for scenario writing so that players are not limited to the 39 official scenarios that come with the game.\n5. Third-party modifications to images, sounds, and icons are easy to add.  Many images for the aircraft, ships, and submarines have already been added by the user community as well as a speech and ambient sound module.\n6. Color-coded messages make for ease of reference by the player.  Hostile action reports appear in Red, while other administrative reports appear in white, green, or yellow.  The colours quickly catch the player's eye and help him categorize those reports that require immediate attention.\n\nThe Bad\n\n7. No multiple player capability exists.  The only opponent is the AI, which can be easily tricked once it is understood.\n8. The Event Engine produces strange results from teleportation of units instead of the more recognized deployment from aircraft or ships.\n9. A crude Formation Editor capability means that the solitary map is cluttered with unnecessary icons and symbols.  Confusion quickly ensues when aircraft assigned to protect the carrier group cannot easily be distinguished from those assigned to expeditionary missions.  Most other games have independent window displays to control formations so that units can function as organized groups.\n\nThe downright Ugly\n\n10. No database editing capability exists.  The database is locked.  The current items, equipment, and systems can be shuffled, re-arranged, or re-combined, but nothing new can be added nor can the performance of any current system be modified.  Players are forced to accept false perceptions of reality.\n11. The UI is severely overloaded, cluttered, and user-unfriendly.  The dependence upon a single map to display all the units and functions means that the number of icons and other data displayed is extreme.  Coupled with the inability to turn off some information, this means that the player is easily overwhelmed by the data, much of which he probably did not want to see in the first place.\n12. Direct player control is difficult to exercise due primarily to the single map display.  The inability to differentiate between units at a distance or high altitude means that the user must constantly zoom in and out to locate units for his orders and targets.  This awkwardness triples the time and effort necessary for the most simple and basic orders and truly makes the game a chore to play instead of a pleasure.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nThis game is theoretically functional, but could easily have used twelve additional months for optimization and polish. As it currently stands, MNO is a hodge-podge of ideas haphazardly thrown together. It is good that MNO replicates many functions from NWAC and Harpoon3. It is too bad that many bad ones are also duplicated while helpful ones were forgotten. Features such as the Formation Editor and Event Engine are prime examples of good ideas for functions that were poorly implemented and badly integrated. The awkwardness of the UI makes the game a chore to play instead of a pleasure. A thorough re-examination of the overall design phase might be prudent, especially considering how some features generally considered “standard” within the naval wargame genre are conspicuously missing.\n\nThis is version 1.05 and, hopefully, improvements will come in the form of game Patches instead of “paid patches” (a.k.a. download content or DLC). Should this game be meaningfully patched in an expeditious manner, an update of this review is certainly possible.","October 7, 2014","false","9.8"," 22 of 56 people (39%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","39","22","56","2","2"

Graphics virtually non-existant.  Sounds are weak and very minimal.  I was fooled by the  virtual voice overs that seems to add some excitement to the game.  They don't exist to my knowldedge.\n\nHuge learning curve which one would expect in a modern high tech sim.  I spent hours reading the tutorials, manuals, watch some videos etc. and it's still can be daunting trying to learn how to deal with all the tech and weapons platforms etc.\n\nExtremely boring combat as you simply wait as missiles approach your ships, while yours fly towards the enemy.  After an exchange of missile hits, etc, and even with a few ships on the screen (which you never see other than a bland icon) you have to read through a bunch of text to see what happened and even then it's difficult to figure out exactly what's going on.\n\nYou never really "care" for the ships in your fleet or the virtual sailors on board.  This game is lacking something magical that brings it all together.\n\nI really wanted to love this game but I am afraid it's just not going to happen.  In fact, I have come to really dislike it.  I have installed this and uninstalled a few times because I was hoping somehow I would come to enjoy it.  I am afraid it's coming off for good now.","April 20","false","35.2"," 17 of 49 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","17","49","0","40"
