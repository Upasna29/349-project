My comments here are based upon both the original Rampart game and Castle Chaos as it's own unique game.\nThe Good:\n+ Very similar to the original Rampart\n+ Fun to play by self or elbow to elbow with comrad\n+ 4 players, not 3 like Rampart\n+ The gnomes add a fun and irritating element to the game\n+ No huge investment of time needed to learn and master\n+ Most of the gameplay elements are easily adjustable from main menu\n+ Statistics feature\n+ Catchy theme music is a perfect compliment to the original\n\nThe Not so Good:\n- The odd psedo pixilization of the wall shapes makes it difficult to visually manipulate each piece when repairing or building walls.  Ie: the pieces blend together and appear as one while moving them next to one another.  The original Rampart the pieces were simple solid colors.   An option to use solid color shapes with outlines would be my preference.   This issue alone is nearly a deal breaker for me.\n- No online mulitplayer capability (yet)\n- Only ONE map?  really?  The original had at least 2 or 3 as I recall.\n- The clouds don't appear to have any purpose other than asthetics.  I could be wrong here.\n- No mouse support.  I understand the unbalanced advantage a person would have if playing a local battle with friends with only 1 person using a mouse.  At least in single player battles the mouse should be an option.\n\nSuggestions:\n* A detailed recap of how the score is tallied up after each round.  This would be helpful so players know where their points are derived and what they might focus on with the next round.\n* Rework the graphics overall.  Either make them 8-bit, 16-bit or semi modern.  The current look is a mish mash that isn't pleasing to the eye, IMHO.\n* The game just ends after the last round isn't much of a spectacle.  Maybe there could be some sort of a bonus round or double points thing, or maybe a target round shooting at moving targets.  Just ranting on how to kick it up a notch here.\n\nOverall the game is fun and definetely worth the pricetag, especially if you catch it on sale.  Kudos to Odd Comet Games for rehashing an old classic with a few new twists.","February 20","true","1.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I am looking forward to seeing what additions the makers add over the coming months.  At this point the game is a bit expensive for the full price of $8 (so I nabbed it on sale), but maybe down the road maybe that opinion will change.\n\nAside from online play and some of the other interesting potential additions to the game, an option to have the singular hanging castle pieces and lone pieces removed after each round would be nice.  I recall the arcade Rampart did this.","January 4","true","10.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It was just released, but I feel as though I cannot fully enjoy this game without online multiplayer. The gameplay is just like rampart, which is a game I love. I have tried playing multiplayer with remote access, which works, but it has a delay. I want the game to do well so the developers add content. People don't really play local multiplayer on computers unless it is LAN.","December 14, 2015","true","0.7"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","3"

This game is quite similar, but with much less impressive graphics and sound.  It should be easily possible to meet or exceed the graphics and sound of a game that is 25 years old.  Keep going, make it as cool as the arcade game!  Add some flashiness, some excitement to go with the core gameplay!\n\nHere is a link to the arcade game which is still much flashier than this steam game (buy it anyway, encourage the developers to keep improving it):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvxcW3aXwjw\n","December 11, 2015","true","0.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","2"
