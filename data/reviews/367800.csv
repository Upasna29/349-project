It's quite challenging and puts a great twist to a side-scrolling platformer. It gets frustrating at first since you're just trying to learn how to use the freeze mechanic, but when you do get the hang of it, it's satisfying.","August 3, 2015","true","2.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

It took me forever to understand it due to inadequate tutorials.  Once it clicked, I started having more fun but it still frustrated me.  Overall I had an ok time but more frustration than fun.","August 25, 2015","false","1.8"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

It crashed on me but that may have been the fault of my computer.  Still dont think id recommend because there it doesnt really bring anything new to the table.  Was hoping for something more like Shovel knight","July 27, 2015","false","1.1"," 7 of 22 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","7","22","0","0"
