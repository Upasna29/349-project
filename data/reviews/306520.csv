Team Racing\nIt is a good feature towards the game to switch to different cars while in gameplay and get the team up to enough points to win the race\n2. The Graphics\nThe graphics are ok for the game at its time so dont try to judge it by that\n3. Comfortable Controls\nYou can't change the controls so they better be good which they are.\nCons:\n1. Lack of cars\nThere are only 18 cars in the game and 6 in 3 different classes however if you get the XR Edition (Which is the better verison of this game) you get 22 cars. However the XR Edition is the not available for PC\n2. Display Options\nNONE, literally no display options in this game. Which surprise me because Ford Racing 3 has a better display option than this game which is made by the same company and this game came out a year after Ford Racing 3. So you have to play in this medium size screen.\n3.Repetitive Gameplay\nIt literally gets boring after two hours of playing this game. It only says I played 0.7 hours but I had the ps2 verison of this game and beaten the game. You beat the game and there nothing for you to do but just race the cars.\n4. Annoying Music\nThe Music is not that good in this game. Ford racing 3 had a better soundtrack\n\nThis is pretty much a downgraded verison of Ford Racing 3. However, its only 5$ so i say give it a try. Ford Racing 3 is more recommended though. Have Fun!\n","November 15, 2014","true","7.2"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","23","25","0","0"

But renember back in the day this was quite a desirable game i liked it alot when i was a kid never found it on the shelves of stores in the uk.\n\nGood side:\n1.You get to play with ford cars in an illegal street racing scene.\n2.changing colours of the ford cars which is all legit\n3.Graphics are pretty ok for an old game\n4. Arcade Rage Racer physics\n5.Fords of all shapes and sizes up to 2009 ish\n\nBad side:\n1. Lack of customization options\n2. No realistic physics at all it is a arcade game after all that used to be at the amusement arcades\n3.Ai can be alot faster then you at some points these cars are usually at the front which i call "hulks" of cars meaning they are a very finely tuned ai that can be a bit too good but you can beat them with a little bit of cheating cutting corners and some agressive driving can take em out or just outsmart them by using your racing experience or copying the ai by driving behind them a few laps.\n","September 13, 2014","true","12.6"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","21","26","0","0"

Why? Very simple: even though this game is more recent than Ford Racing 3, I will straight up tell you right now that Ford Racing 3 is a lot more fun and will give you a lot more great times than this game ever will. If you already have FR3 and you're a Ford enthusiast (just like me), then step right up! If not, then you'll regret the 99 cents you'll spend...\n\nPros:\n- Cars are quite beautiful and well designed\n- City races give you that "street racing" feel (but not nearly as much as, say, any Need For Speed game)\n- The whole "swapping cars" mid-game is actually kinda nice\n\nCons:\n- Game gets repetitive (unlike in FR3)\n- There aren't nearly as many racing types as in FR3\n- Doesn't have as many cars as FR3 has\n- Doesn't have as many races as FR3 has\n- Campaign isn't as fun as FR3's campaign\n- The whole Team Racing features don't make up for this game's price value\n\n\nOverall, I'll give it a 5/10. But honestly? Get Ford Racing 3, it's much more fun (something I made quite explicit in this analysis, I know)","December 26, 2014","false","0.2"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","69","18","26","8","0"

Flatout two has   Street racing included as well as   a lot more, plus the graphics,  the modes of play and the destructible environments knock spots of this mediocre game.  I couldn't play it for more than 15 minutes or so  as it  also made me feel  sick and  the backs of my eyes  ached.   In this game you have to play and win various solo levels to  unlock new tracks, new vehicles, new race types  for example  time trials and elemimination rounds.      Car damage was evident after crashing a few times, but  it didn't detract from the  game play and there didn't appear to be any consequences  for damaging your vehicle.\n\nAs with the other two Ford games, I was  very disappointed in this game.   The  same poor graphics  especially compared to other games released around the same time and the poor vehicle handling.  Drifting was almost impossible, which led me to crash around  some of the  steeper corners (unless i slowed down significantly; at which time, I'd be over taken by every car in the race, even if I was first at the corner.\n\nI really can't recommend  this or any of the other  Ford games.  I do hope they don't release the  earlier releases (Ford Racing and Ford Racing 2) on Steam later.\n","September 9, 2014","false","0.6"," 35 of 64 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","35","64","0","3"

That doesn't matter though, this game is a fun arcade experience with really basic physics but the vehicles are fun to drive and there's something about the team racing element that is sort of unique and adds another layer to the game.\n\nOverall, it's not the best looking game but it's a great arcade experience with some unique ideas and some interesting car models, I recommend picking it up if it's on sale or even full price.\n\nEDIT:\nQuick note, the playtime that I have on Steam isn't the total play time I've had seen as I've been launching the game from the .exe as it's the only way to play the game in 1440p","March 14, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/the1observant/recommended/306520/","the1observant","the1observant","http://steamcommunity.com/id/the1observant/","40 products in account","I was looking for this game and I'm glad it's on Steam. I've played it before and thought it was cool then, and you know what?... It's still cool today.\n\nIt's challenging to unlock the cars, circuits, and special challenges. Most of my favorite Fords are in this game.\n\nThe graphics are not super, but it's plenty good considering the age of the game. It does include making burnout and skid marks on the pavement and ruts across grassy areas, so it's got a thumbs up from me on that. There is also a little particle effect going on during vehicle collisions, and some sparking effects as you rub against other metal surfaces on the other vehicles. So, it's not too skimpy on the graphics since that is there (minimal, but still there).\n\nI love the sound effects. They have that certain muscle car sound you don't normally hear in other games, especially the Classics. It's a rugged gas guzzling rumble with clear sharp tuned hums and explosions as you hit the gas. Any racing game that does that is okay in my book.\n\nThe hard-coded physics in the game are not as accurate as the new stuff, but it's pretty close. At least you get the basics of squatting rear ends, hill cresting, leaning, weight shifting in the turns, and proper redirection when colliding with other vehicles. You still get the feeling you are driving a heavy piece of metal in the smoothest way possible, and that's what really counts. - Also, the tires do behave like they are actually rolling on something. You can pick up on this by paying attention to sidewalks when you roll across them to cut corners, and the car will bounce and drop like you would expect it to do. So a plus on that too.\n\nThe game doesn't focus a whole lot on damage, but the appearance of damage is there. Broken lights, paint scratches and flaking, twisted and crumpled metal, extra smoke, and just your basic appearances you might assume to see. Actual physcial damage does not occur, but that's ok because this game is about travel accuracy, not demolition accuracy. If you want demolition, then buy a demolition game.\n\nCollision detection with the other vehicles seems to be okay to me, but they didn't put much effort into colliding with track objects. Like you can hit a newspaper dispenser and fling it into the street, or across the street, but if you hit a pole then you'll just get the sound effect and pass straight through the pole as a ghost. You'll still slow down and have to fight to make up for lost seconds though, so it's not like you'll want to hit any of the poles much anyway.\n\nNormally I'm just a solo racer, but Ford Street Racing also implements Team Racing with 2 or more vehicles. Team controls are easy to use. I like being able to switch cars during a race. I also like being able to give team commands for blocking and drafting. If you do it right, then you can pretty much play hopscotch and walk all your team vehicles to the front on the first lap. Easier said than done sometimes in the Expert difficulty, but it can be done with practice.\n\nFSR does have some multiplayer features, but I'm not into multiplayer games, so I haven't tried them and I have nothing to say about that.\n\nThe game is good enough to recommend and it's worth at least $5 (my honest opinion).\n\nNOTE: Steam did not include a link to the game's configuration manager. You have to do that yourself manually. To make resolution / graphic / sound / control setting changes, naviage to ...\n\n"C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\common\Ford Street Racing\CONFIG"\n\n...or wherever you have your steam apps installed on your PC... and use the "syscfg.exe" application to make adjustments before starting the game. You'll find everything you need right there to make it look better, sound better, and control better.","January 10","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
