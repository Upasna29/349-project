"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ahoopyfrood/recommended/24980/","ahoopyfrood","AHoopyFrood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ahoopyfrood/","366 products in account","I think many that level bad scores and a list of complaints at Mass Effect 2 have fallen into the trap of looking at games purely as a collection of mechanics. Sure, it's another cover shooter, which taken alone is merely decent. They're right that the RPG elements are simple and at times are obtuse and too black and white. You can, at least partially, break the upgrade system by grinding resource collection. Given all that it would seem there is no reason to even play this game but you'd be wrong. This game, and the whole series, is trying to be more than just mindless entertainment. It's trying to to tell a deep, rich story, trying to get you to really care about it's characters, and it's trying to get you to think beyond the mechanics, beyond the game even. By no means is this just a story with some game attached, but the story and how your decisions effect it and it's characters are a huge part of this game.\n\nWhen you play this game, because to be clear, you should play it, I would urge you to try and actually role play the choices. This game brings up some pretty serious issues in some of it's choices. Issues that should stop and make you think, not just about how this will effect your game but about how you would actually feel about this in your everyday life. You can always go back and play it again and make all the "good" or "bad" choices but at least once you should really put yourself in Cmd. Sheppard's shoes, make the choices you would be comfortable making outside the game. Don't worry about what the game says your moral score is, play it to learn something about yourself.","November 25, 2013","true","134.7"," 656 of 695 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","656","695","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/onceinathousandyears/recommended/24980/","onceinathousandyears","TreiseV","http://steamcommunity.com/id/onceinathousandyears/","364 products in account","Did you know there’s a game where you can come back from death, blow up prisons, take on three factions of mercenaries, deal with wars between species, survive a Suicide Mission and get in a relationship with the hot alien you want? Nominated as the best game of the generation, winning 150 awards of Game of the Year of 2010 and building so much hype that its sequel couldn’t be more than disappointing, Mass Effect 2 is a game you have to play.\nEven if you didn’t play the first one, you won’t be left in the dark, people will tell you what’s the deal and the codex has all the extra details. If you played the first one, then you’ll enjoy the fact that your choices carry over and have some weight on what’s happening.\nThe combat involves 3rd person camera, using your class specific abilities and guns and giving commands to your squadmates and it has an interface made for PC. There are 6 classes and each of them are varied enough for every playthrough to feel like a fresh experience. Some are more power based, other weapon focused, but all of them do damage and are awesome and you’ll definitely find your type, whether you like to make shockwaves in the enemy lines, hack the robots, pull them in a singularity, cloak yourself and shoot them in the back or simply slow down time to shoot them while they wonder what’s happening with them. There are difficulties that vary from casual from insanity, so whether you play games for their story or want to dominate the dominators, you’ll find what you want.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=312867227 Many will say the story is great. I say it’s a good one, but that its characters make it to be one of the best. 80% of it you recruit team members and gain their loyalty(only if you want to). They all prove themselves to be interesting and you’ll have enough dialogue options to find out what makes them tick. On your ship, there is going to be the hyperactive mad(ish) scientist, the hot secretary, the crazy all powerful ♥♥♥♥♥, the assassin with regrets, the best friend who took a rocket in his face and is 99% of the time in the middle of some calibrations, a lizard hulk who calles himself “Grunt”, the gun expert that does 663 abs each day,  the cute engineer whose face you’ll never see and some more. You’ll have the options to get involved in their lives. Some of them will argue and you’ll be the one to settle the conflict.\nDepending on your gender, some of them are available and open to ideas.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=308178738\n\nThe last mission a.k.a. The Suicide Mission is what makes everything in the game pay off. It’s the place where the catharsis is unleashed. The place where your love for this game will be cemented.  Whatever you’ve done, there will be consequences and by that time, you’ll care.  If you’ll fail hard, you’ll cry hard. But if you’ve upgraded the ship and made the smart choices throughout the game and in the last minutes, you’ll be overjoyed and feel like you’ve won 1 million dollars.\n\nAll in all, Mass Effect  2 is a great experience, when you’ll play it you’ll live your second life, one where you’re saving the galaxy you enjoy being into.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=311505611","November 23, 2014","true","50.8"," 436 of 460 people (95%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","95","436","460","31","10"

You wont be lost as to whats going on, as long as you check out the codex section on the in-game menu. This game is AMAZING and the story line, voice acting, graphics and overall gameplay are all impressive. This game is ahead of its time, dont miss it.\n\nFrom the ominous opening music, until the final decisions through the Omega-4 Relay are made, the perfection builds every step of the way. Sure, there are many cinematic games that play like a novel and are fantastic but Ive never been pulled into a game with a "need to play" like ME2 has done.\n\nThe diversity of the characters and backstory make you feel as if this universe has been developed for a long, long time, and you are only now being introduced to it. The characters make you care about them with their depth, and this increases moreso as the game goes on. I've never experienced anything like it, and Bioware really set the bar with dialogue and character interaction. The "choices' you are given never feel like lines from a bad movie, like so many games, but are believable and accurate to the story and what you intended to say.\n\nThe game itself is an exciting RPG/3rd Person Shooter. When you start you can choose from a few classes. Some are excellent at biotic powers and some are just for shooting things the old fashion way. I chose soldier and because of that I had very little biotic powers. I could slow down time but that's about it. The biotic side of the game for me was my crew mates. You level them up along with yourself when you gain squad points. As you add skill points to a skill it becomes stronger until you reach full potential then you have two versions of it to choose from. The gunplay in the beginning of the game was a little boring but it became really fun once you were able to upgrade and get new versions of your weapons. That added a lot of depth to the combat. There are also different types of ammo to use that increases your weapons attributes. Nothing is more satisfying then freezing an enemy an watching them implode.\n\nWhen a game ropes you in, like this one did for me, and creates that yearning to play, the developer has done their job. This game plays like an epic film, but one that creates a universe that I think is on par with any of the great space-epic movies and tv series, and that alone is something. This game is a pivotal point for me in regards to gaming, and it has changed the way I will evaluate and appreciate all games in the future.\n\nSimply put, one of the best game I've ever played...","December 30, 2013","true","68.9"," 322 of 356 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","322","356","2","27"

I intend to prove them wrong.”\n\nI still have vivid memories how, on that fateful day in 2010, the delivery truck pulled up at my home with this game deep within. No ordinary truck, this one was holy white, and the gold delivery logo sparkled like a thousand suns, reflected through shards of the purest ice formed with unadulterated water collected at the beginning of the universe.\n\nThe driver, clad in a robe, coloured in the softest and purest white I have ever laid eyes upon, floated towards me on a cool fog of a hundred fire extinguishers. He smiled benevolently, like a father looking down upon his only child, and handed me a package wrapped in gold, beaten thin to the point where you could see through it.\n\nAs I touched the package, our eyes met and my soul was filled with an unearthly serenity, never felt before in my short and humble life. Suddenly we were standing in space, surrounded by the debris of countless destroyed ships and asteroids.\n\nAt the far distance was a gigantic black hole and I knew with every fibre of body, that this was the destination I had to reach to fulfil my mission. The next moment we were back on Earth, and I did not have to sign, because this angelic being could see within my heart, and knew that – as paragon of the good – I was pure.\n\nUpon opening the package, an angelic choir started to sing, and reached a crescendo as I placed the DVD into the drive of my PC. Instantly, my antiquated equipment transformed into the latest state of the art technical marvel.\n\nThe game knew where to go, and installed itself within a blink of an eye into the right folder without any help from me – all the while, the choir sang praises to the almighty digital god. With trepidation, I clicked on the ‘play the game’ button, and was instantly immersed in one of the most impressive action role-playing games I have ever played, with a brilliant atmosphere and memorable companions, all within the framework of a fantastic science fiction setting.\n\nAmusing quotes:\n\n“It's so much easier to see the world in black and white. Gray? I don't know what to do with gray.”\n\n“Have killed many, Shepard. Many methods. Gunfire, knives, drugs, tech attacks, once with farming equipment. But not with medicine!”\n\n“What could I possibly be suggesting? I mean, a young woman gets rescued by a dashing commander who lets her join his crew and then goes off to save the galaxy? How could she possibly develop any kind of interest in him?”\n\n“Doesn't matter who you are - you got a gun in your face, chances are good you'll do what the other man says. Only two types don't buckle at that point: trained killers and psychopaths. Lot of people can't tell the difference.”\n\nAchievements:\n\nThe game has no Steam achievements.\n\nChronology:\n\nMass Effect 3 (PC)\nThird-person action role-playing game\n(Science-Fiction) – 2012\n\nMass Effect 2 (PC)\nThird-person action role-playing game\n(Science-Fiction) – 2010\n\nMass Effect (PC)\nThird-person action role-playing game\n(Science-Fiction) – 2008","September 25, 2014","true","77.7"," 283 of 316 people (90%) found this review helpful 83 people found this review funny","90","283","316","83","13"

It lost a little bit of the RPG feeling, however, with the combat improvements, it makes up for it greatly. The cover system is a lot better and the skills are just a lot easier to use, especially when it comes to the squadmates. The player would just have to press Q or E to make that specific squatmate use a power. The music is stunning, as always.

(Giant robots with lasers, you have to play the game to understand.)\nYou truly get to form your own personality in the game, do you assert and be a badass, or do you show compassion and be a hero? as you advance in either direction you unlock new dialogue options and actions, ranging from giving someone a hug to kicking someone out of a window.\n\nEvery crew member has a very devloped personallity, and you will feel attached to most of them, you can even develop relationships and they aren't limited by species or gender (Sadly, you can't be gay, only lesbian, this confused me a little).\nYou can do them personal favors to make them loyal to you, increasing your chance of survining the suicide mission at the end of the game, I have seen some of my beloved crewmembers die in my first playthrough, I was actually crying over the death of a fictional character.\nBut Mass Effect is still a game, not a futurustic dating sim, you can choose to skip the romance entirely, and you don't have to recruit certain crew member sif you don't want.\n\nThe gameplay is solid, sometimes the 'one-button-does-everything' system gets confusing, running, taking cover and interacting with things is all bound to one button, which can lead to confusion sometimes.\n\nWhen you start the game you get to choose a class, some specialize in weapons, others in tech (this means you get to use combat drones, tech to drain shiles and incinerate or freeze enemies from a distance, and others in biotics (space magic, you get to lift people of the ground, or throw them a few feet away or you can spawn tiny black holes), most of these powers are well balanced and satisfying to use, some of them feel a bit silly though. (I'm looking at you, shockwave..)\n\nYou can explore a lot of different star-systems, you can scan planets for resources and you may just find a secret side-mission, these do feel a bit cheesy sometimes though. (you enter a hidden facility and the merc leader just keeps saying 'you shouldn't have come here, prepare to die').\nWhenever you investigate a planet you get a little information about it, like the surface temperature, atmospheric pressure, even travel advisory sometimes, and some even have traces of past civillizations who were space-faring long before that fish with legs on earth crawled out of the water to eventually become a monkey.\n\nMass Effect 2's soundtrack is great, the music in the main missions really made me feel like I was in a dire battle to save the galaxy from detruction, the music that plays during the suicide mission is just.. damn, I still get goosebumps from it, it's truly an epic piece.\n\nSadly, Mass Effect does have it's weak-points, as missions can feel a bit repetitive sometimes, hub-worls are smaller than they were in Mass Effect 1 and DLC is obtained in a very annoying way, you have to make a Bioware account and buy Bioware points with real money, these points you can then spend on the DLC, I would prefer to buy DLC directly through steam without using these Bioware points.\n\nIf you want to play DLC you need to be online when you launch the game, otherwise it simply won't load or show up.\n\nThere are also a few annoying bugs that never got adressed, sometimes I run into an object and get teleported on-top of it, then I either have to wait until I die or I have to quit to the main menu and then load the save again, sometimes during conversations characters are facing the wrong person or are doing some really weird stuff with their head.\n\nMass Effect 2 is an epic game, and I would reccomend every RPG or Sci-Fi fan to give it a try, there is a whole galaxy full of different races, friends and foes to explore!\n\n","March 26, 2014","true","240.9"," 98 of 106 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","98","106","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ninalakicin/recommended/24980/","ninalakicin","ninalakicin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ninalakicin/","60 products in account","BEST. GAME. EVER.\nEDIT: I never expected for my review to get to the top of the reviews section of ME2 store page, thank you fellow gamers! That's why I'm adding a few more things to it and separating it in sections. English is not my native language so please note that I'll probably have a ton of mistakes here, and I also have a very limited vocabulary. I'm trying my best. Also please note that you'll probably lose more time reading this review than actually playing the game. :)\n\n*** **** ****\nIf you played Mass Effect 1, then I'm pretty sure that you'll like this one even better. Also, if you played ME1, you know the story. If you didn't play it, go and play it. NOW. It's a game that everyone should play atleast once in their lives.\n\nI could write a review as long as  "War and Peace"  is about who's your character, what are you up to, what kind of weapons do you have and similar, but still I feel like I just couldn't say everything. This is one of the games you can't experience by just simply reading about it on wikipedia or watching walkthrough videos or reading reviews and deciding is it good enough or not - you just need to feel it.\n\nBugs and gameplay I experienced zero bugs ! , and I can't say that for the first part. Obvious improvements are made. And finally that annoying elevator music, news, conversations and scenes are in the past! And no more exploring planets by that stupid unstable Mako thing. Combat is improved, much easier, you can use cover much easier, and squad power usage is simplified and very easy to use for fast combo kills.\n\nDecisions and storyline The importance of your decisions! I think that's what makes this game so good. I imported a ME1 character and loved how decisions I made affected almost everything I did in ME2. There is almost no right or wrong in this game. You should just play and make decisions the way you think you would if it was real life, and see how would that turn out. Also, ME1+ME2 decisions make a HUGE impact to storyline (main and DLC too) in Mass Effect 3. Unfortunately ME3 is not available on Steam.\nThe story of this game is simply breathtaking. This time story doesn't develop that much around Shepard as it develops around his squadmates and crew members. ME2 is more personal, more sentimental than ME1. Relationship between Shepard and his squadmates is deeper and more complex. Also there are more romance options, and they are great!\n\nDLCs Unfortunately by buying Digital Deluxe on Steam you don't get much DLCs. Also only way to purchase the DLCs that are not included in the DD are through Bioware Blog which is super annoying and super expensive. For example, DD cost me 5 euros, and just the  Shadow Broker DLC  costs 8 euros. If you plan on buying them,  Shadow Broker  is pretty much worth the money. Also  Arrival gives  you a new perspective of the story.  Kasumi's Stolen Memory  and  Zaeed's The Prince of Revenge  are okay, if you want a new squadmate with new combat abilities, but can't develop a relationship or romance. Other DLCs offer alternate appereances, weapons and armors but are not very necessary nor important for the story.\n\nSummary You know it's a good game when the game makes you feel that you want it to be real and to be a part of it, no matter the cost. Well, this game made me feel that way.\nOnly thing I don't like about this game is that it ends. This is, by far, one of the best gaming experiences I have ever had. I even dare to say that it actually is the best.\n\nP.S. I am not a very good writer, but I am very passionate when it comes to games so if you want a great story, decent shooting/killing, good graphics, want to feel like a hero and save the galaxy once again, then this is the game for you.","April 29, 2015","true","52.0"," 76 of 82 people (93%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","93","76","82","8","0"

Steam is unable to offer any such deal because Mass Effect 3 was hosted exclusively through Origin.\n\nAdditionally, Origin has a much more convenient system for getting a hold of the DLC, especially if you purchase the trilogy as a set (which includes the two DLC packs for the original game, which have compatibility issues if installed any other way).  There are three large packs of story DLC for ME2 - Overlord, Lair of the Shadow Broker, and Arrival, which amount to around 10-15 hours of additional gameplay depending on your difficulty setting.  Additionally there's a bonus mission in which you [SPOILER ALERT] explore the crash site of the original Normandy. [SPOILERS END HERE]  There are two DLC companion characters, both of which appear in the third game if they survive, and several weapon, armor, and companion customization packs.  None of these are required, though at a minimum I recommend buying Lair of the Shadow Broker and Arrival due to the impact they have on setting up ME3.\n\nYou should absolutely buy this game.  You just have to decide whether or not you want to go with Origin.","October 13, 2014","true","120.0"," 78 of 88 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","78","88","0","0"

I've probably played through it 4 or 5 times on console and just had to do it again on PC. This game is absolutely incredible. You're seriously cheating yourself out of a great game if you pass this one by.\n\nThe graphics are amazing, even for the continous progress of graphics in newer games. The soundtrack is unbeatable. Jack Wall did a terrific job on this game and everything you hear fits the atmosphere and intesity of whatever given situation you're in nearly perfectly. The story is inspiring and as deep as you care to make it. I don't want to reveal content, it's best to experience on your own and take it is as you go along. Aside from base story, every character has their own personalities, dialouges, and loyalty missions. You really grow connected to your crew and want to get to know them, and ultimately survive with them. I don't really think you find this degree of character connection anywhere else. Bioware really nailed it. If you haven't played the first game, I recommend it, but it isn't at all necessary. Story is filled in early on and you shouldn't feel confused or lost at all. On top of all this, Mass Effect 2 is completely replayable with different courses of action and character builds. My 22 hours were only a single completion run, and there is room for much more entertainment than that from this game.\n\nIf nothing else, give this game a try.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunaril/recommended/24980/","Lunaril","Lunaril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunaril/","880 products in account","Mass Effect 2 was the first game in the Mass Effect Universe I ever played. Perhaps as a result of this, it is also my favorite in the entire series. Without spoiling anything for anyone who has yet to play the series, I won't talk about 1 or 3, neither will I discuss the plot, other than to say it is epic, amazing, and drew me in the way Millions were drawn in by Harry Potter.\n\nWith that little disclaimer out of the way, Mass Effect 2 follows the story of Mass Effect 1, including whatever choices you made, as the consequences are felt while playing Mass Effect 2. If you did not import a save from 1, don't be afraid, you will get some of the backstory anyway. The playstyle, reminds me a lot of Knights of the Republic series in some ways, as you can slot weapons with upgrades, have various types of weapons to choose from, and so forth. Leveling up works in much the same way.\n\nVisually speaking, I think the graphics are excellent with Mass Effect 2, though I played it on the PS3 and not the PC yet, so I am unfamiliar with any graphical differences. As you progress through the story you acquire new members to your crew who can be chosen to form your team when landing on planets or going on missions. You are able to explore the galaxy using Mass Effect gates, and can go to individual planets within star systems, as well as moons, ship-wrecks and more. There are hundreds of side quests to do, as well as personal quest chains for each companion you acquire. Your ship, the Normandy can also be upgraded with the resources you acquire. These upgrades are not mandatory, but remember, every choice you make impacts the story in the end.\n\nIn all, I would say Mass Effect 2 is a fantastic game and should be a part of anyone's library who loves First person, story driven, sandbox universe action. I highly, highly recommend playing the series in order from the first Mass Effect, so that you can have a story carried over through the end of the series based on the decisions you make. This will enhance your immersion in the game and is worth the cost of buying all three. I hope you enjoy this game as much as I have.","October 2, 2015","true","0.5"," 32 of 40 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","32","40","2","0"

Mass Effect 2 is the best of the three for me. I can't explain just how much I honestly love this game. I originally played this on xbox360 and later PS3, so obviously I had to play it on PC also. I've lost count how many times I have finished ME2 ^_^.\n\nIt has amazing story, fantastic voice acting, emotional characters that feel real and you will care about, lots of conversations where you make the choises, space exploration, different species, the gameplay is just really amazing and of course there's one hell of a epic OST that will give you so much feels omg.\n\nBuilding your team and meeting new people is done very well. It has everything that makes a perfect experience imo. The story of ME2 starts with a jawdropping moment and ends in one of the most epic ways possible, that will surely blow your mind everytime...\n\nMass Effect 2 maybe belongs in my top 5 games ever.\nI absolutely recommend this whole trilogy for anyone who like Sci-fi,  RPG genre and unforgettable characters+story !\n\nFew bad sides are that there's no full DLC or achievements on Steam version, Origin's release has the achievements I think. Digital Deluxe Edition don't contain all DLC, but the rest of DLC can be bought from Biowares website using points. Also ME3 is digitally available only on Origin for PC, which is a shame that they couldn't release it here too.","October 12, 2015","true","58.8"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","20","22","3","0"

This Game is by far one of the best games here on Steam and everybody should play it!\n\nThis Game has features of the Tell Tale Games but with actuall consequences. Unlike the tell tale games, choices here do matter. Which gives this game a huge replayability. You can also choose to be either way male or female and the outcome with all the characters will be different. So go back and play it again to see what you can make different this time!\n\nThe Gameplay itself is very good and responsive. Altough sometimes I got a bug where I got stuck and couldn't go anywhere else. What this bug looks like you can see here ->  Mass Effect 2 Bug  But this hardly happened only 3 times I believe. To fix it simply reload your latest save or restart the mission.\n\nThe Voice acting was rather impressive and the music as well. I also enjoyed very much that I could devcide what outfit my character is wearing and which color it should have. The Ship and Guns/Armor are upgradeable which makes it alot of fun to farm for rescources.\n\nI am personally not a very big fan of space game and doubt that I would off liked that game, but after giving it a chance I just fell in love with it and couldn't stop playing, Everything on it is wonderful and I could not find anything negative at all on it.\n\nI can recommend this game to anybody for its full price.","November 9, 2015","true","29.7"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","19","21","2","0"

Getting to know everyone and then learn everyone's background is such a great idea. Most players can find a connection with each character. You really care for them and it's devastating if any one them dies. The story itself wasn't really good, but it's these characters that made the story work.

Oh, dear Miranda...\n\nMass Effect 2. You've had to have heard those words at least once in your gaming life. Whether if it was a Youtube video, or maybe just chatting with a friend. You had to have heard of this legendary title. Well, I'm here to say that Mass Effect 2 is EASILY one of the finest games of last generation.\n\nI'll start with the visuals. I have to admit, the visuals in this game are still very impressive, even after nearly four years. If you are a friend of mine, you would probably notice that I frequently take screenshots of in-game stuff, usually something about it's beauty. Now, I've played numerous games that are really stunning, but I haven't taken this many screenshots for a game since Skyrim. I'm HIGHLY impressed with this game's graphics.\n\nThe gameplay is a very strong point in the game. Mass Effect 1 was more tactical and people didn't like that, along with squadmate abilities, some in-game choices, and more. However, Mass Effect 2's gameplay was much smoother, even if lots of ME1 RPG elements were taken out. The gunfights were heated and awesome. Choosing squadmates and using the abilities they have make the game have a slightly more strategic approach. However, when you could actually have an option to do something else. In one mission, one of my squadmates said that we could sneak past the enemies, but when I attempted to do so, there was no way of actually sneaking past them without triggering the alarm, thus making some missions pretty linear.\n\nThe story is a step down from the first Mass Effect and even the third Mass Effect. It goes completely off topic. But, there's a reason why I'm praising the game in the "story" section. It's simple. The lore in this game is INCREDIBLE. When you search planets for resources to survive missions, you need to scan the planet and send probes to retrieve your materials. Before you do scan though, there is a decent sized blurb that describes life on the planet and lots of facts about the planet. There's lots more, too. However, you'd just have to buy the game so you can be amazed by that. Also, the CHARACTERS. The best part about this game is the CHARACTERS. Tali is a little clumsy, especially around me. Grunt has an aggresive attitude and lusts for bloodshed. Mordin is crazy, and seems like he cares little for death, and talks in an extremely fast pace. Should I describe anyone else? I didn't think so. Although the plot was rather off-topic and poorly done, I praise this part of the game highly for lore and characters.\n\nThe audio is just alright. It seems like A. The same music is played over and over again or B. All the songs sound the same. This is probably the weak point to this unforgettable RPG. Even friends of mine agree, the music in this game is just meh. However, I do think the voice actors did a strong, strong performance for their roles.\n\nThe replayability is actually pretty good. Beat the game? Play as a Renegade, or maybe play as a heroic Paragon. Play as the opposite gender. Side with someone else. "Do it" with another romance option. There's lots to do, and there's even some DLC you can download. You have quite a bit to do.\n\nThe key problems to this game include the following: Lots of glitches, the space bar seems to be overused, making cover/run/interact/etc a bit clunky. The game is somewhat linear. That's about it!\n\nIn the end, Mass Effect 2 is one of the best RPGs of last gen, but also one of the best GAMES of last gen. It's amazing, and I highly, highly, highly recommend it. Go "do it" with Miranda, would you?\n\nGraphics- 9/10\nGameplay- 8.5/10\nStory- 10/10\nAudio- 7/10\nReplayability- 8/10\n\n**GANDHI GAMING PERSONAL PICK**\n\n.:9.4/10:.\n\n+Amazing characters\n+AWESOME final mission\n+Lots of lore\n+Good gameplay\n+Stunning graphics\n+High replayability\n-Relies heavily on space bar, makes controls a bit clunky\n-Numerous glitches\n-Somewhat linear","June 18, 2014","true","35.7"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","14","18","2","0"

You've been warned.\n\nIt is, with some caveats, a masterpiece in writing, cinematic presentation, character design, middle-entries-in-trilogies, world-building and tight, focused gameplay.\n\nFor the most part, it's also pretty and varied in its art style and variety of environments, the only rough bits to look at are the splotchy textures on a few things that look like they're from ME1.\n\nThe soundtrack is incredible and memorable, and I count it as being among the best game soundtracks. Perfectly matches mood and builds suspense.\n\nFair to note at the outset I've got 130 hours logged on this copy and an additional 130 on another copy, so a little over 250 total.\n\nShooting and cover are responsive and enjoyable. While ME2 lacks the cover-rolling and melee maneuvers of ME3, I'd argue that the health systems, enemy types and level designs make for much better shooting and gameplay in the 2nd title than the 3rd.\n\nME3 segments enemy health into blocks or chunks, ME2 displays it all as one bar continually draining, the same applying for your health and shields. Very clear how much progress you're making towards killing a target.\n\nMore importantly though, most of ME2's engagements can be handled with methodical patience and careful use of cover and squadmates -- it makes even the hardest difficulty a joy to play on all but some of the collector missions.\n\nME3, on the other hand, is filled with missions involving reaper-type enemies that run at you and force you out of cover and involves more luck than it does method or thought. It was only after running through ME3 a couple times I realized just how well-designed ME2's experience is.\n\nYou'll get more frustration-inducing kind of difficulty out of ME3's experience than you will the kind of careful, well-designed and enjoyable difficulty you'll get out of ME2.\n\nOf course, one can also look backwards and respond to the opposite complaint about this game's sheer divorce from ME1's RPG mechanics. If you want to argue ME2 has departed from ME1, you'll hear no argument from me.\n\nGiven what an awkward, bumbly experience ME1 was though, I don't think it hurts ME2 at all being a responsive, well-designed third-person shooter with RPG elements. I'd rather it was that than ME1 -- a third-person shooter that isn't sure if it wants to be a shooter or an RPG and just ends up doing the shooting, cover and RPG elements wrong.\n\n(Hey, I can see those fanboy tears welling up in your eyes! Before you start writing some inane comment telling me just how wrong I am, I recommended ME1 too.)\n\nI mentioned caveats, let's cover those. For those who did the majority of the side quests in the first game, you know that Cerberus is an evil human-supremacist group willing to do horrible things to achieve their ends.\n\nIn a fantastic writing twist, that same group decides to recover Shepard's body after he dies and reconstruct him, bring him back to life, make him into an effective tool both for humanity's interests but also their organization's.\n\nIn a not so fantastic writing twist, Shepard seems pretty chill about this. The player is given some opportunity early on to object but for the most part Shepard seems pretty okay with cooperating.\n\nGiven Shepard's history with and knowledge of the group coupled with his loyalty to the Alliance and affinity for not being a terrorist, you might think Shepard might look for more ways out or the game might present the player with such an option. At a minimum, it seems strange that we are basically funnelled into this path with little recourse in an RPG.\n\nThere are compelling reasons why Shepard might cooperate. They might feel, rightly, that they owe a debt to them for resurrecting him and they might also be tempted by that shiny new Normandy and the support of former allies Cerberus recruits. They also might agree, as the Illusive Man argues, that Cerberus is the only organization that recognizes the reaper threat at the moment, and will help him/her investigate and stop them.\n\nThat's all fine and dandy, but the player is mostly left to decide whether they accept these reasons in their head, There's not a lot in conversation and dialogue involving Shepard that makes it clear Shepard understands or accepts any of the implicit or explicit reasons for accepting their present situation.\n\nHowever, that all being said, ultimately the choice the writers made to take the narrative in this direction pays off. We're presented with a complacent and careless galactic government that won't acknowledge countless colonies dropping off the map.\n\nCerberus recognizes it though, and has given you the resources and people to investigate. They suspect it's the 'Collectors'. A mysterous race that most have never seen that dwells beyond the equally mysterious Omega 4 relay. Of course, no one has ever returned after going through this particular relay.\n\nOnce this is all confirmed, the game sets you into a broader framework of building a team, one that is in it to go through the relay and stop the Collectors.\n\nThe team you build must be perfect, include the best, most committed and skilled operators the galaxy has to offer.\n\nThe Council has pretty much disavowed you at this point, and, even if you're nice to them, don't really want to see you poking your nose where it doesn't belong in Council space.\n\nAll of this sets things up perfectly for the game's setting: an adventure through the dark, criminal underworld of the galaxy. It gives the writers opportunity to flesh out new characters, species and places. Stark tonal shift from the first game. It gives them, basically, an opportunity to hugely expand the depth and breadth of Mass Effect's world. And this they definitely do.\n\nMissions span hubs like Omega, Illium and the Citadel to war-torn Tuchanka to mercenary-infested Korlus to distant, hazardous Haestrom. Many more. You're introduced to a lot of corruption and dirty, self-interested politics and characters. Mercenary groups. Extortion. Racism. Murder. Not that you participate in these things, but you see them happening.\n\nThis dirtier, darker galaxy immerses the player quite well and really sucks you into the subplots of the places and people it affects. You'll care about the people and places of this world.\n\nMany more varied places and situations to discuss, not enough space here to write about them.\n\nIn the context of these dark, horrible places, you're introduced to characters new and old and even the old ones are given new stories, as time has passed since you last saw them. You see characters evolve, change attitude and outlook. Great writing.\n\nPast the old characters, the new ones are compelling and interesting. Everyone loves Mordin. Okay, not Jacob. He sucks.\n\nEach potential team member is given their own mission with a completely unique level design, objectives and context surrounding their recruitment. Missions are varied and replayable.\n\nThe team that you build though, after all this world-building and character development has occurred over the better part of the game, is meant to undertake a suicide mission in going through the relay.\n\nTo say BioWare excellently builds up to this climax wouldn't do it justice. Your choices and the amount of time and effort you invest into the team you build play a decisive role in the outcome of the mission and you get a strong sense about how everything has built up to this point.\n\nThere are few moments in gaming that I can think of that compare to ME2's suicide mission.\n\nThere's so much more to say about this game and how amazing it is, but Steam recommendations have character limits.","April 28","true","130.3"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","0"

After that though it feels like an unnecessary chore.\n\n- Expensive DLCs  (Arrival and Shadow Broker being the only ones worth buying in my opinion).\n\nOnto the positive bits -\n\n- Texture pop in and frame rate issues resolved.\n\n- Much better gameplay and combat compared to ME1. Cover system vastly improved.\n\n- Removal of ME1's huge and cluttered inventories is satisfactory.\n\n- Story has excellent pacing and feels nicely written, (though in context of the series it does  seem a bit insignificant).\n\n-The addition of new species and characters provides lots of excitement as you build your squad.\n\n- Lore-rich Codex entries and planet descriptions make for interesting reads.\n\nOverall, the strong game narrative, engaging characters and immersive lore make this series and game one of my favourites.\n\n9.5/10","July 21, 2015","true","91.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

It's the best thing created by a human ever. Except for Breaking Bad. Both are amazing...not convinced? Damn. Well, let's review Mass Effect 2 then.\n\nA hundred and fifty years in the future, humanity has figured out FTL travel and has found their place in the galaxy among the numerous alien races. A rogue Spectre nearly brings on the end times by summoning giant robots that wipe out all life called the Reapers, barely being stopped by another Spectre (yes, that is you and yes, this took place in the last game), proving humanity's worth. You play as Commander Shepard... until he or she gets spaced. This isn't really spoiling since it happens in the first five minutes. But a group called Cerberus decides to bring Commander Shepard back to life to fight the Collectors, a mysterious race of aliens who have been abducting human colonies. Shepard agrees to work for it, though he or she is a bit hesitant since Cerberus is barely a step above a terrorist organization. The story then follows you recruiting numerous people with various talents for a Suicide Mission against the Collectors, where your decisions there and your team decides whether everyone lives or everyone dies. Good luck, Commander.\n\nGameplay is fantastic. The combat is a lot better than ME1, instead of the overheat system, you get the traditional gun system, and I like this more than the overheat system. There's also now a reason to use powers, even if you have awesome guns, you'll still need to use them on some enemies, compared to ME1 where once you got some good guns, it didn't really matter if you used powers or not. Squadmates are also a lot more useful, the 6 in ME1 (5 in the end... sometimes 4... spoilers?) gets boosted up to 10 (12 if you have the DLC), all of which are very good and have distinct personalities. Plus you can bang some of them, so that's nice.  All hail dat Quarian booty!\nThere is also a good upgrade system, although in order to get the materials to do so, you have to do a kinda boring scanning minigame, which is not that fun to do. There are six classes (Soldier, Adept, Engineer, Sentinel, Vanguard, and Infiltrator), all of which are a lot more distinct than in ME1. I for one prefer Vanguard, but all classes are overall decent from what I hear. There are multiple conversation branches, a Paragon/Renegade morality system that is affected by dialogue and interrupts that you take, and loyalty systems, which once you do a mission for a character, they become loyal, making them more likely to survive the Suicide Mission and gets that squadmate a new loyalty power. Gameplay is fun, that's all that matters.\n\nCharacters are likeable for the most part. Shepard is customizable, letting you choose his/her looks, gender, and backstory. The squadmates you'll get, Miranda, Jacob, Garrus (returning from ME1), Jack, Grunt, Mordin, Tali (also returning from ME1), Thane, Samara, Legion, Zaeed (if you get the Cerberus Network DLC) and Kasumi (if you get the Stolen Memory DLC.) Your pilot Joker, played by Chris Griffin (Seth Green, but I call him Chris Griffin), is basically comic relief, however he and the banter with the AI is actually pretty funny. You'll encounter your previous ME1 squadmates who won't join you, Liara, Kaidan/Ash, and (if he's alive) Wrex. Wrex and Liara have some good scenes, but Kaidan or Ash... don't. The Illusive Man, who's the head honco of Cerberus and awesomely played by Martin Sheen, is probably one of my favorite villians of all time. All the characters are well written, are well voice played, and I can't really hate these characters. My personal favorites are Garrus and Tali.\n\nCriticisms? There are some kinda baffling plot details, Shepard's revival making no sense being my biggest complaint. The scanning minigame I mentioned earlier isn't very fun. There's hacking, which I hear a lot of people hate, I didn't... that much, at least, but I see where people come from when they say it's lame. Also, there aren't very many weapons, which is kind of lame, to be honest.\n\nStill, this is an awesome game that everyone should play in their lifetime. 10/10, if you have the money, buy it. Now. Get the other two games in the trilogy as well, ME1 is on Steam as well, but you have to deal with Origin for ME3.","March 5, 2015","true","73.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","8","9","2","1"

Never before in the history of gaming has an individual had so many different choices as to what kinds of extraterrestrial to have sexual relations with. Although the romance stories are quite engaging and emotional, and the cut scences leading up to the implied intercourse quite titilating, I am always left scratching my head. It is not explained thuroughly enough how said conjugations works. How do the parts fit together? Can  commander Shepherd become pregnant? Why are the aliens so attracted to women while I am not? These are questions that are left unanswered. My first love was a krogan, and he will always be closest to my heart. But inspite of my intimacy with Grunt, I was ultimately confused by the biology involved. I understand that krogans posses four gonads but what isn't explained is how large or what shape their members are. One thing I know for sure is that the krogon would likely be on bottom as their sheer mass may very well crush the human involved. The previously mentioned questions perplexed me so much that I wrote my term paper in Human Sexuality class on them. Inspite of it being excelently written I recieved very sharp criticism from both my peers and my mom, who's help I enlisted in editing my paper. Innovators will always be persecuted and misunderstood by the thralls of the ignorant. Love is free. The rules of biology should not limit one's sexual desires. Just as the Supreme Court ruled for marriage equality, one day I would hope they will grant rights to those of us who wish to share physical intamacy with those of another species from another planet. Until then I will fight on with pride in my heart, knowing that being a xenosexual is not a sin, nor a lifestyle. And knowing that is more important than knowing how a krogan's parts fit with a human's parts, and in that lies the true value and lesson in Mass Effect 2.","June 29, 2015","true","35.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","89","8","9","9","0"

In seltenen Fällen stört der für diese Engine gewohnte, übermässige Glanzeffekt, welcher selbst an Stoffen auftritt ( aktuelles Beispiel: Batman Arkham Knight bei Joker's Verbrennungsszene ). Beim Missionsdesign bemüht man sich im Vergleich zum Vorgänger um Abwechslung - insgesamt gelingt das auch, wenn man mal von dem Planetengescanne absieht. Mich persönlich hat es nie gestört.\n\nWas dieses Spiel so herausragend macht, ist die grandiose Inszenierung. Die Story ( die gemeinsam mit dem ebenfalls empfehlenswerten Teil 1 ein großes Ganzes bildet, welches im März 2012 seinen krönenden, aber auch kontroversen Abschluß mit Teil 3 fand ), das intuitive Kampfsystem, die eingstreuten Zwischensequenzen, der ohrwurmverdächtige Soundtrack & die liebgewonnenen Charaktere, das alles fügt sich so gut ineinander, dass man unbedingt wissen möchte wie es weitergeht.\n\nBeim ersten Durchgang habe ich Mass Effect 2, abgesehen von den Collector´s Edition DLCs, ohne jeglichen Zusatzcontent gespielt, den es mittlerweile gibt & die Story ergibt auch so 100% Sinn. Man verpasst also nichts. An Spieldauer werden einem rund 30 Stunden geboten, wenn man nur strikt der Hauptgeschichte folgt.  Allerdings verpasst man dann vieles von den Quests der Nenebchraktere & wird das große Finale je nach Verbesserungen des Schiffes relativ einsam bestreiten müßen.\n\nAber: Man muß sich, wie auch schon bei Dragon Age: Origins, mit seinem Bioware- bzw. EA-Account einloggen , um die DLCs nutzen zu dürfen. Mass Effect 2 bietet sogar einige kostenfreie DLCs, welche insgesamt unterhaltsam sind & die Story bereichern. Gerade die DLCs, welche einiges an Story mitbringen ( Kasumi, Shadow Broker,)  sollte man gespielt haben.","June 25, 2015","true","150.5"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mynch/recommended/24980/","mynch","Mynorchie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mynch/","134 products in account","I don't even know where to start. At first I thought I'd get a typical space adventure with laser beams and stuff, but what I actually got was beyond all my expectations. First of all the story is great. It keeps gradually developing between the games and keeps the player intrigued at all times. We all have played at least one of those games that keep you wide awake through the whole night, and this truly is one of those. Even after finishing the game there are loads of fascinating lore waiting to be read and trust me, it's worth it.\n\nSadly if you're not interested in talking to people wholeheartedly or just don't care about the dialogue that much, you'll miss most of the game's charm since most of the important stuff happen during conversations. Some things tend to get complicated really fast if you decide to skip even a few important dialogues. And sometimes just listening to random NPCs was enough to keep me entertained, even if it didn't have anything to do with the mission itself. The amount of work that has been put into the dialogue really pays off, and I barely remember times when talking with someone didn't put a smile on my face.\n\nProbably the thing that made the game for me were the characters. I found something intriguing in all of them (even if Kelly Chambers deserves death for "you have new messages" when there are none) and I couldn't wait for getting to do their loyalty missions and actually making them my friends rather than just comrades during the war. Only some of them started to grow on me. The more I talked with them the more I started to love them to bits... especially Tali, Garrus and Mordin. I actually started to feel like I wanted to keep them alive and protect them at all costs, and that's when you know they're well made.\n\nAfter playing the first game the controls feel so smooth and not complicated at all, so there's nothing to complain about. During combat the only flaw I found was that at times Shepard seemed to be unable to follow the instructions and just died without jumping over a simple obstacle, but those things happen. Also the AI might seem a bit idiotic, but that probably can be corrected by choosing a higher difficulty setting.\n\nAnd oh god, the replay value. The possibilities are almost endless when it comes to how you want to play. Different classes, gender, decisions, romances... everything can be played differently and affects things in different ways. In most games the only thing you can affect is whether you want to be the good samaritan or not, and that's it. This is the first time I've ever felt that by replaying I might actually achieve something I didn't the last time I played, even if it'd take another 30 hours of my life.\n\nThe graphics were really good too, even if Bioware still tends to overuse the blur effect. Overall the game is pretty and really pleases the eye. There simply aren't reasons why someone shouldn't at least try the game out - except if you aren't ready for the bumpy ride Mass Effect 1 first wants to offer you.\n\ntl;dr Awesome calibrating simulator. 95/100","March 18, 2015","true","80.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

The gameplay in ME2 is much smoother and will make ME feel really dated and clunky in comparison imo. Many people like the more RPG aspects and upgrading of weapons in ME, but I found ME2 to be more streamlined and perfectly fine. The gameplay and combat I defintiely like better. I fell in love with all of my crew and couldn't wait for ME3. I also highly recommend the DLCs for Kasumi, and the Shadow Broker DLCs as they add a decent sized quests for SB, and add a phenomenal member to your crew with Kasumi, not to mention one of the best weapons in the game.\n\nNote that if you want to play the Mass Effect series you really should start at ME and go through all 3. The games are tied closely toether with decisions from previous games and to get the full experience you need to actually partake in it from the beginning! From people that you save and will remain with you until the end, to romances you have that can chancge the way crew members feel about you. If done properly things you did in ME will shcarry all the way over to ME3. It truly is an amazing accomplishment I think for this series and as a gamer consider it a must play series. Of course you can find save files around the net that can be placed in the game folders to pretend that you played MAss Effect already with the decisions you wanted, but that's pretty lame isn't it? haha","October 25, 2013","true","325.0"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/24980/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","The original Mass Effect was something of an enigma when it came out in 2007. Then an Xbox 360 exclusive, Bioware’s tried and true Knights of the Old Republic character development formula mixed with an action-oriented shooter setup. You could spend time grinding, and yet it still boiled down to aiming a gun and pulling the trigger. You could pump all the points in the world into increasing your health, but forget to take cover and it’d all be for naught. While most hybrid games lean a little bit more in one direction, Mass Effect stood stubbornly on the fence between shooter and RPG.\n\nIt seems that the complaints – which were at the time, minimal – about Mass Effect‘s indecisive design really got to Bioware. Nearly every issue the community seemed to have with the game has been fixed. The number-crunching RPG elements are gone. The floaty Mako driving segments are gone. The barren side-quest worlds are gone. The indecipherable inventories are gone. The cutting and trimming has left Mass Effect 2 in a rare situation: a genre shift. Granted, at first glance everything seems to be in order; however, when the rubber hits the road and it’s time to play, the game feels very, very different.\n\nMass Effect 2 is no longer an RPG. At least, it’s not an RPG in the sense that the first one was. There is now a simple skill tree system instead of a fully blown stat sheet, and the action now plays out like a third-person tactical shooter. What remains of Mass Effect is the excellent conversation system. The already impressive presentation has also gotten an upgrade, leaving the first Mass Effect behind in a trail of dust. It’s really quite bizarre to see a sequel to a game so well received to change so much.\n\nHonestly, though, for as many things Bioware changed, the game still feels solidly planted in the universe Mass Effect presented. Even if the gameplay is different, everything has a sense of familiarity, right down to the synth-infused soundtrack and 1970s aesthetic. Mass Effect 2‘s story picks up two years after the end of the first game. By default, Shepard’s choices left the Council to die, putting humanity in control of the galactic government. Importing a save from Mass Effect is a much-touted feature; however, the timespan between the two games makes the impact of Shepard’s earlier choices fairly minimal. It might be nice to see an old friend or two, though.\n\nInstead of continuing the story directly, Mass Effect 2 is the start of a new conflict between Commander Shepard and a new enemy. After being attacked by an unknown vessel in the fringes of space, Shepard is killed while attempting to save his crew. Brought back to life by The Illusive Man, the leader of a human-supremacist organization called Cerberus, Shepard is tasked with unraveling the mystery behind The Collectors – a race of aliens that are showing up in human colonies and stealing away their inhabitants. It makes for a much darker adventure than the first game, taking you to planets around the ♥♥♥ end of the Milky Way to construct a team of the best possible warriors to confront this threat.\n\nThe characters are the game. Building this team isn’t just one quest; it’s the lifeblood of Mass Effect 2. Each one out of the twelve (thirteen, sort of) characters has a lengthy story to tell, and there are dozens of side characters with almost as much detail. The game builds a rich history for each person, making the time spent with them much more interesting than the original six party members from Mass Effect.\n\nIn action, the game plays like a story-oriented tactical shooter, funneling Shepard and his entourage through conversations and choices before plunging them into firefights and chase sequences. Shepard can take cover behind walls and other objects, popping out to blast a few rounds into enemies before ducking back down. Instead of Mass Effect‘s infinite ammunition, Shepard’s guns take “thermal clips” of energy that effectively work like magazines in any other shooter. Different types of ammo can be loaded into guns, tailored to damage different kinds of enemies. Biotic and Tech powers are now hotkeys that can be pressed to unleash instant attacks on foes, ranging from physics manipulation to active camouflage.\n\nOff the battlefield, The Normandy spaceship has received an overhaul, acting as much more of a hub than it did in the original game. The huge cast of characters can be spoken to, and some will offer suggestions for ship upgrades, or reveal personal missions they’d like Shepard to take them on. The Normandy feels more alive than it ever did in Mass Effect, thanks in part to frivolous additions like Shepard’s quarters and bathrooms, as well as background characters that provide endless chatter. It’s the little details that count; even the elevators are gone, replaced with – shocking, I know – loading screens, which take about a third of the time to complete than any lift ride did in the first game.\n\nStill, with all of these atmospheric expansions, it’s clear that the actual game has been trimmed quite a bit. Instead of allowing Shepard to hop into the Mako buggy and drive all over random planets, Mass Effect 2 only features a mining minigame, used to find minerals to upgrade various weapons and ship parts. Occasionally, the scanner will yield an anomaly, which translates into a side mission; but for the most part, the planets are there strictly to be combed for resources.\n\nWhile the choices Shepard made in Mass Effect don’t have too much weight, Mass Effect 2‘s own array of decisions are always interesting, and some may lead to intense consequences in Mass Effect 3, if Bioware keeps its word. While the line between Paragon and Renegade is still quite clear, there are many situations where the Paragon sense of charm can be used to do Renegade-ish things, and vice-versa. Shepard can use his charm to convince hostage-takers to drop their weapons in exchange for their lives, only to blast them anyway as soon as they do; likewise, players can threaten prison guards to force them to stop beating a helpless convict. The progression of each conversation feels much more natural in this regard, creating a grey area that Mass Effect often lacked.\n\nOn the PC, Mass Effect 2 really shines. The interface is slick, allowing players to hotkey their powers; the control scheme is also quite simple by default. It also looks fantastic on PC, and scales fairly well to older computers. At its highest settings on a good gaming rig, the game is a total joy to watch in motion. The gorgeous character models animate perfectly, and the overall direction has taken a step up from its already admirable presence in Mass Effect.\n\nMass Effect 2 is quite clearly the middle game in a trilogy. The actual story takes a backseat to character development, spending 25 hours introducing a motley crew before wrapping everything up with a jaw-dropping final mission and cliffhanger ending. The experience is worth playing through at least twice for the Paragon and Renegade choices; maybe more for those who want to explore every nook and cranny of the game. Mass Effect 2 is a triumph of an action game, blending satisfying shooter levels with dark themes and hours of heated debate.","January 1, 2014","true","50.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The story and character development is rather jarring compared to the first as well, but is totally self-redeeming and very much worth it. In the end, this game somehow managed to finish with even more of an addictive quality than the first. The thing that makes the series really great is how important it makes your actions feel. They have weight, you get to see their effects, and the story remains very engaging and powerful.","October 17, 2014","true","199.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

An action RPG that does everything right, any gamer should at least give this one a try.  (Since EA won't put Mass Effect 3 on Steam, let me just say that it too is a great game.

Each one specializes in different abilities, skills, weapons and each class feels distinct.\n\n\n+ The combat is excellent as each weapon feels different, the controls are tight and the third person cover and shooting mechanics are solid.\n\n+ Both artistically and technically the game is visually appealing especially when you visit outdoor locations. I particularly like how each of the major cities in the game feel distinct from one another. The bright/light colors of Illium contrast the dark red hues on Omega for example. Just by the appearance of certain locations you can easily get an understanding of what the place is about and what to expect.\n\n+Like the first mass effect, the scope of game is equally impressive. Everything this game has to offer, the characters, races, locations, missions, cities, etc is designed to make you feel like you are part of an epic science fiction adventure.\n\n+The story is more self contained than the first and third game, it certainly doesn't feel as big in scope to the other entries but that doesn't make it is any less interesting or fun. The story focuses more on individual characters rather than a grand narrative and because the characters are so good it makes the overall game better.\n\n+Bioware's strength is writing detailed, interesting characters and this game is no different. The NPC's that you find and join you are some of the most interesting characters you will find in the entire series. Speaking to them and learning about their lives is interesting and adds an extra layer of believability.\n\n+Arguably the single greatest improvement over the first game is the side quests. This time around they are varied, fun , provide interesting back-story to many of the characters and locations and overall make you feel like you are part of a much larger universe. Side quests come in two types. The first is loyalty missions for your crew aboard the Normandy. These missions flesh out more of the characters history and most of the time involve you shooting many enemies. The second type involves you scanning planets to find an anomaly which leads you to the planet's surface to investigate. Most of the time these mission are self contained, however sometimes these types of missions will lead to other side missions.\n\n+Soundtrack and special effects.\n\n\nThe Average:\n\n\nProbably one of my bigger disappointments with the game is the lack of rpg elements. Rather than improve some of the mechanics of the first game (inventory, UI, exploring planet on vehicle etc.) Bioware simply removed them completely. Even the character classes themselves have been streamlined with each class only have 4-5 skills. The game could be considered a third person shooter with some rpg elements rather than a full blown rpg.\n\nIts great that your choices from the first game carry over. It adds a bit of continuity to the story. The problem however, these choices don't really amount to anything other than a few changes in dialogue. In would have been nice if the choices you made had a much bigger impact in the following games.\n\nThe citadel is suppose to be the major hub of the galaxy where all the trading and races come together, yet the design of the citadel feels small and cheap compared to the first game. The citadel is a few floors consisting of shops\n\nThe series STILL lacks of controller support\n\nA few crashes\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- This is more a fault on EA than the game. Under normal circumstances, when you buy a game on Steam with any dlc or bonuses everything gets downloaded at once, at least that is what I thought. Not with this game. In order to get any of the DLC, you first have to create an account with EA, log into the bioware social website, download each individual piece of dlc and then install each one separately....Thanks EA.\n\n- The game introduces planet scanning to find resources. These resources are used to upgrade weapon damage, biotic powers, upgrade the Normandy etc. This itself would not be a problem except for the fact that scanning planets is repetitive and boring. You are commander Shepard savior of the galaxy, speaking to different races, saving people, exploring planets, fighting dangerous missions... and all of that comes to a grinding halt when you have to stop and scan planets to upgrade anything. It sounds like something that was good on paper but failed in execution.\n\n-I found it odd that the only way to compare weapons is by reading the weapon description. There is no way to compare weapon damage, rate of fire, reload speed, etc.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is a worthy sequel to an already great game. I just wish they didn't have to sacrifice so many RPG elements to make it.\n","February 14, 2015","true","28.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Where ME1 was concerned with the almost extinction of all sentient life in the galaxy by an ancient evil force, ME2 is about some kind of splinter remnants kidnapping a few hicks on the outskirts of space AND ONLY YOU CAN STOP THEM.\n\nMore than that though, the structure of the story is a bit too straightforward. The game is about recruiting people in your team, and then going to kill the bad guys. That's basically it.\nIt's a bit unfair to simplify the game as such, as there is some decent writing concerning your ship mates (some of which return from ME1). And the presentation and emotional investment of the final mission in the game really is quite an experience.\n\nThere's plenty of content to be had, with my blind insanity playthrough being almost 50 hours. However this is including all the side missions, which consists of exploring lots of boring empty space for a blip on a radar, that leads to an underwhelming and somewhat pointless mission (usually just give you some negligable amounts of money and xp)\n\nAs a sequel, the game is a fantastic continuance of Shephard's journey, but on its own merits as both a TPS and an RPG, it may leave some people wanting.","December 21, 2013","true","49.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

The grittier feel extends to all areas, including a shift from 'futuristic blue' menus to 'diarrhea yellow' menus. The simplified mechanics are a mixed blessing.\n\nMass Effect 2 is very much the 'gritty second installment' of the Mass Effect series. Think The Empire Strikes Back compared to A New Hope - the whole game takes a darker tone, from the locations you visit, the characters you meet, the urgency of the story and the significance of the choices you make. A warning, though - there is much more language and blood/violence.\n\nDue to a surprise attack by an unknown spaceship at the beginning of the game, you are forced to work for the pro-human activists Cerberus. Remember those guys from the first game? They did genetic experiments on aliens and killed a pro-alien human officer who got in their way. Things are a little awkward as you, erstwhile saviour of the galaxy take up arms alongside the space-Nazis.\n\nHaving defeated the lone Reaper in the first game, the Council believes that the Reaper threat is over, and refuses to acknowledge there are more out there. However, since they are sending their minions to capture human colonies, Cerberus sends you to investigate. In the course of your adventure, you visit all sorts of places, from the poorer areas of the Citadel to the Krogan homeworld, the corrupt but glamourous Asari world of Illium and even the notorial criminal capital of Omega. You recruit a new team, composed of some of your old comrades, but also a whole host of new characters. Some of the new characters are not as developed as the old ones, but on the whole, the calibre of storytelling is consistent.\n\nThe combat system has been completely revamped, and the controls alone can take a couple of levels to get used to, but overall, they're mostly an improvement, as things are generally simplified. The loot/inventory system has also been changed. Instead of picking up millions of useless weapons, you research new types at your ship, which can then be used by anyone. The weapons are all subtly different, even within a certain type - ie, instead of each successive sniper being marginally more powerful, the first is a standard rifle, the second is a higher capacity one which fires 3 shots at once (useful for groups) and the third is a slow firing but amazingly powerful anti-material rifle.\n\nA new feature is research. In a special lab in your ship, you are able to research upgrades for you and your squadmates weapons, armour and abilities. Armour upgrades are different, in that you can switch components like your helmet, shoulder pads, leg armour, etc for ones with different bonuses, rather than the whole suit at once. You can also buy research from shops, unlike the first, where I never used a shop at all!\n\nResearch takes minerals/rare metals, and this leads us to one of the worst elements of the game. Mining. You take the ship into orbit, and fire probes at a planet until it's depleted. Over. And over. And over again. I preferred the Mako.\n\nThe game has also been divided up into 'hub' type areas, where no enemies ever appear, and 'mission' areas, where everyone you meet is an enemy. I feel this is a bit of a step backwards. Fortunately the tactical combat part of the game is significantly better, so fighting is much more enjoyable.\n\nOne of the best bits of the game is the final mission. it, again, follows a general storyline, but depending upon choices you made during the game and during the last mission itself, there are any number of interesting variables. One interesting thing is that you can die and still beat the game...I've not seen that often in video games.","October 17, 2014","true","172.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The many possibilities of playing this game is what makes it even more amazing, you can build your own story ina  positive or a negative way.

Apart from the introduction of the "Collectors", there's isn't much added to what has been learned about the reapers in Mass Effect 1.\n\nMass Effect 2 is best enjoyed with an imported save game, giving away bits and pieces about what happened to all the colorful persons the payer met in the first game.\n\nCombat has been drastically simplified, giving way less emphasize on building the character and outfitting them with gear. With speed of the encounters picking up, the tactical impact of squad utilization has been dropped seomwhat in favor of putting the player's reaction time more into focus. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but won't appeal to those who wish for a less hectic approach to combat.\n\nWhile enjoying ME 2 greatly at the first time, I personally didn't find the second playthrough of ME 2 as rewarding as it felt for ME 1, because of the rather thin story development. While building relationships with the NPCs feels rewarding, it comes somewhat short in terms of depths. Less squad mates with more character development would have been preferable.\n\nBottom line: Essential to (re)live the trilogy, but feels slightly like a stretch for those who already know about the dramatic developments of ME 3.\n\nPS: Don't miss updating the game with a HD texture modification! Due to technical limitations the developers did include low res textures only! The screenshots I have taken showcase HD textures for all squadmates.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\nDespite being published by EA, Mass Effect 2 DOES NOT require Origin to play. BUT: You are able to register your Steam copy of ME 2 at Origin as well, which enables you to download the DLC you're already eligible for by purchasing the special edition of the game.","January 13","true","98.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aizawaa/recommended/24980/","Aizawaa","crowbAr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aizawaa/","341 products in account","rating: worth buying at full pricescore: 10/10 - masterpiece\nsimilar games: Deus Ex, The Bureau, Dragon Age: Origins, Spec Ops The Line\ntags: story-rich, action packed, epic, character development, choices\n\nMass Effect 1 was an okay game, it had dull gameplay but a good story and cool characters. Mass Effect 2 does not simply improve everything ME1 did, the devs completely overhauled the whole thing like they build it from scratch, this time with much more budget and a longer deadline. Whats impressive about this is the size of the game and the quality of everything. It is very rare that a big game like this, an open world game or RPG, is so well designed in every area. If you think about it there is always something which is not really fleshed out in some game you think are great, of course they are just small things, but that is the difference between a masterpiece and a very good game. For example look at the trading system and shops in most RPGs. Probably the shops will sell random equipment and you can sell everything you find there, and you probably will get tons of loot you never need.\nIn Mass Effect 2 you get no loot, except money and resources. There are only some moments in the game where you find an upgrade or an alternative to an existing weapon. Giving the player tons of loot like in other games (also in Mass Effect 1) just doesnt make sense, because it does nothing except wasting your time because you have to compare it to your existing loot to see if its worth it, if not you will sell it. That also breaks the balance of money the players gets in most games and to counter that the developers balance the shops in a way that you rarely find something useful to buy. Because the money you get in ME2 is more controlled and shops have only specific items they sell only once (you only need them once), everything gets better. Exploration and hacking is more rewarding, because the money you get is more useful. Visiting shops is worth doing because EVERYTHING you can buy is worth it, you just need the money for it. And it opens more flexibility for the devs to design their missions, or just small things like giving you opportunities to get discounts which wouldnt be worth getting in other games. All that is just a tiny fraction of the game, I just want to explain to you to how fleshed out and well designed this game is.\nBioware didn't care about genre conventions or did things only because this game is supposed to be an RPG, every decision they made is because it makes sense for the game, nothing else. Another example for that is the inventory system, you have no inventory actually. You only need to find one copy of a weapon, it will be available for all squad members. That removes the really annoying fiddling around with the inventory crap in ME1. They also moved the ammo upgrades from the inventory to the skill menu, which means they are skills now and every crew member has maybe 1 or 2 ammo upgrade available to him, which also gives you more criteria to pick your party-members. There are also other criteria to pick party-members apart from who is the coolest, which was really the only criteria in ME1, skills of your crew didn't really matter. Every party member has set weapon-types he can use, set abilties and strengths which can synergy with others or be redundant.\nAlso there is a mission every crew member will have for you. Doing these will not only make them loyal, they will also unlock an extra ability for them and also matter for the story (no spoilers), but its not just "doing" these missions, you can fail them and then they are gone and you have to live with the consequences.\nIn Mass Effect 2 you get your crew members much faster than in ME1, which is good, because it gives you more variety early on and there are more crew members in total, all of them very different and interesting in their own way. There was only 1 character which I hated and is cliche in my opinion (Jack). Actually the conversations with the crew members were the most fun part about ME2 for me, the dialogues were really interesting but not just exposition or alibi character development and all of it is optional, which is great for several reasons. There are many things in Mass Effect 2 which are optional, I think if you do only the must-do things, you could finish this game in 5 hours or so. It took me 25 hours and I know that there were easily 5 more hours I could put into it, but I don't recommend doing everything you can, it could get tenacious. Luckily unlike ME1 where every side-quests was obvious filler, every side mission in ME2 is unqiue and meaningful and you get useful rewards for them. They even managed to make the exploration of planets fun. In ME1 you just clicked on every unexplored planet and you got some text. In ME2 you have a scanner and have to scan the surface manually to find resources. That process is not boring because it is presented very nice and it is very rewarding, because the resources you find are crucial to get upgrades, and the upgrades themselves are also crucial. Still you are not forced to do these scans if you don't want to, there are enough upgrades you can buy and find and you also sometimes find resources on missions.\nThe combat got the biggest overhaul, it is actually fun and challenging now. The AI is improved greatly compared to ME1, but your party sometimes still does stupid things, but you can control them much more easy now and still more flexbile just with 1 button for each party member, and managing them is more important now, because of their powers. Shephard also has powers now depending on the class you pick, most of them you already know from ME1 (they are still cool), but there are also some new powers. These are not only useful and necessary, they are also really fun to use thanks to really good sound-design, animations and hit-feedback. Bioware also proves that you can make satisfying gunsounds for sci-fi/laser weapons. Enemies aren't bullet sponges anymore, if you know how to bring their shields down, they react to your shots, fall down, scream because you burn them or if they are mechs they loose an arm or something. Your shots just have more impact now which makes combat more fun overall. The only thing which could be improved is the enemy design, the enemies are cool and there are a good number of enemy types, but the tactics you fight them with are not much different. With more diverse enemy types the combat could have more variety, which it does not really need though. I'm not a fan of regenerating health, because it makes the outcome of a fight irrelevant for the next fights, it only matters that you win the fight, but regenerating health makes sense for this game and works.\nI don't want to talk much about the story, because I don't want to spoil anything. What really surprised me was the amount of elements which carry over from ME1 and how many choices you have in general, these not only have impacts on small side-stories, but also on the ending of ME2. The ending alone of ME2 is a masterpiece. There are so many variables in the ending it easily surpasses the amount of choices you have in other games, and in most games your choices don't really matter anyway. I'm really eager to see how the consequences will affect ME3. There were parts in the game where I really had to think about my decisions, rarely the choices are black and white, sometimes you might not even notice that something is a "choice". Especially one decision kept me thinking for a very long time, and I still don't know what the right thing to do was (probably because there is no simple right and wrong for that question).\nThe story is much more engaging and the dialouges much more interesting than in ME1, because they properly animated the cutscenes this time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abedsbrother/recommended/24980/","abedsbrother","AbedsBrother","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abedsbrother/","525 products in account","Mass Effect 2 is just a great game, with very few draw-backs. If you haven't played the first Mass Effect game, go play it! If it weren't for the b*llsh*t DLC situation, Mass Effect 2 would easily be worth the standard retail price.\nYou can view the opening of the game here.\n\nPresumed dead by the Alliance, Shepard is given backing by the human-first extremist group Cerberus to investigate a strange phenomenon: whole Alliance colonies are simply disappearing.\n\nInvestigating the disappearing colonies and a strange new enemy are the primary missions of the game that stretch from beginning to end; it's the core narrative that makes the game work. Within that framework, you as Shepard put together a combat team of the galaxy's most elite operatives - literally a sort of intergalactic "Dirty Dozen." Each team-member has a recruitment mission (required if you want them in your squad) and loyalty mission (not required, but ignore at your own risk!) The final mission is a masterpiece of programming and pacing. You'll want as many squad-mates as possible. Who is loyal and who isn't is a crucial factor in determining who lives or dies. Choosing the wrong squad-mates for support duty as Shepard and 2 others fight the (very creepy) final boss can result in more deaths. Decision making and laying the groundwork (ie loyalty) are crucial. Choices made throughout the game were never more consequential.\n\nThe graphics still look great for a 2010 game. The music soundtrack is superb. There are some new minigames, like hacking wall safes and datapads. Both are fairly easy and don't slow down game-play that much. Scanning planets for resources, quickly devolves into a chore; you have to do it, though, to research improvements for your ship, guns, and armor. Planetary exploration from the first game is gone, which was disappointing to me. There are a LOT of side-missions, which are great if you just want to tool around the galaxy looking for stuff to do. And, yes, squad-mate romance is back. An added bonus are some fantastic actors to voice important characters, including Martin Sheen as The Illusive Man (yes, THAT Martin Sheen!), Yvonne Strahovski as Cerberus officer Miranda Lawson (from the TV show Chuck), and Carrie-Ann Moss as Omega gangster / ruler Aria T'Loak (Trinity from The Matrix).\n\nWhile the first Mass Effect was a great RPG, Mass Effect 2 focuses more on story and action at the expense of customization. It's like watching a favorite movie play out, except you are IN the movie, making the choices. A great story-based and combat-based RPG / FPS hybrid with high replayability. One of my all time favorites! Because of the DLC situation, though, only purchase the game when on sale at 75% off.\n\nA note about DLC:\nThe DLC situation is, frankly, b*llsh*t. Once the game is fully assembled it is truly superb; but save your money and get the game on sale, because to acquire ALL the DLC will cost around $40 at this point.\n\nThe Digital Deluxe Edition includes the Cerberus Network Add-on. The Cerberus Network provides access to the following DLC:\nZaeed - The Price of Revenge\nFirewalker Pack\nNormandy Crash Site\nCerberus Arc Projector\nCerberus Weapons and Armor\nThe Cerberus Network requires that you to create a profile on Bioware's Social website. Once your purchase of the Mass Effect 2 Digital Deluxe Edition is verified, you will be provided links to download .exe files (hosted on EA's severs) that will install the DLC. These will work on a Steam installation, and do NOT require the installation EA's Origin software. Purchasing additional DLC (which can be done on the Bioware Social website) follows the same pattern.","September 25, 2014","true","93.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The game itself does storytelling right, by starting off with a high-octane beginning bordering on cliche. This is where the game differs from most other games, where others would continue with the cliche beginning of starting with your charecter dying, then revert back to the present with some sort of prophecy garbage. On the other hand, Mass Effect 2 rolls with Shepard dying and bases the game behind this trillion dollar man, creating a exiting beginning that leads into a solid mid-game. The way they present the beginning story means that the player is independant to the council's wishes, in contrast to the previous game, meaning a greater degree in this open RPG. The choices you make in the mid-game regarding charecters, items, and ship upgrades influences how the game ending will proceed.  The late game provides a final mission, no spoilers for you, that all I can say is epic and worth you playing throught his masterpiece to see.\n\nBesides the way the story is told, the game makes many changes from the previous game which include: a revamped weapon system, a simpler level up system, a planet scanning mechanic instead of the mako vehicle mechanic, fully customizable armour, and no mako vehicle sections of the game, plus many more. The game also changes on the graphical front, with higher resolution testures than the previous game, that still run very well on lower quality machines.\n\nThere is much more I can say regarding this game, from the charecter progression, the amount of content, the pitched battles in the game, the fitting and well-done soundtrack, the fixed combat system, and many, many more. This game is one of the  best games I have ever played, from a production values persective, to a content and personal perspective. I give the game 93/100 an A+, plus the CDFW seal of approval, I highly recommend it to everyone who likes good video games.\n\ntl;dr : Buy this game, it is good.","March 17, 2013","true","113.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Well now you are in EA Presents Bio BeWare Mass Effect 2: Axe Effect. Take on the role of commander Shepard and be you in space. Or be Shepard in space. It’s whatever. Best friend of waist high walls, you shoot your OWN path through predestined story missions. Talk to some bros and listen to banter in space in this Sci Fi mans shooter.\n\nIn space, all of the shooters are mans. There are aliens that don’t look like mans but they don’t shoot thank goodness. I really get to feel like it’s cold blood murder in space and the action is visceral even when poor humanoid robots shoot me. To be fair there are also space spiders and space dogs so geeze I guess it’s not a total copy and paste skeleton job!\n\nThe gameplay is cover man shooting but it is also talking to people in towns and making numbers get bigger. You will be playing an RPG sometimes, but then you are working for the establishment  and gunning down mens next thing you know. What genre of game are you even playing? We’ve all played a game before so the rest of this review is not about gameplay.\n\nThe star of the show is codex talk man. At any time you can pause to stop playing the ♥♥♥♥ing game and go through menus to listen to a smooth talking gentleman chat about the game. You may be familiar with codex from Drag on Age or Final Fantasy XIII 1-3. but this time the codex is the highlight of the game as you sit back and get read the game to you. Over the course of the game you will get more bros for your ship and redder guns but the new codex entries are what pull the player along.\n\nFor all you creepers out there you can have a romantic relationship with all sorts of space dudes and ladies. But not dude on dude because that is gay. In this Mass Effect no one is gay in space. Except women sometimes. But that’s not gay in space.\n\nResource farming minigame? Lockpick minigame? We got it all here folks! Why don’t you slide up behind a turret or bap some heads off? But before you say seen this and peace out you get psychic abilities. If you are Vanguard (only be Vanguard folks) you can flip guys up to slow motion gravity and be goku instant transmission across the battlefield in space. You get some slaughterpals like Space Mad-Scientist Frog and Bald Girl Wanna Kill Things just to name a couple murderbuddies.\n\nMass Effect 2 has a revolutionary choice-O-meter. You are red or you are blue and you cut yourself off from future opportunity just like in the real world. You can scratch the code off of your Doritos (™) Shepard’s Favorite Chips On The Citadel (™) chips to get more empathy points to spend on your dating harem if you choose to play the game like a weird alcoholic space pimp and not a serious professional going about saving the galaxy. Paragorn Mountain Dew for blue bloods.\n\nSo strap on your watch which is a computer asap at your your local Valve Steam store. You are the telekinetik undead military captain rockstar and everyone loves you when you pull the trigger in space. Big Man OR Big Woman power fantasy in the hot game on a spaceship in space: Mass Effect 2: The Mass Effects.\n\nHas:\n- The Choice. The Impact\n- 18 DLCs.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brutaljones/recommended/24980/","brutaljones","Brutal Jones","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brutaljones/","178 products in account","I have a hard time speaking in a balanced manner about Mass Effect 2 because it's one of my single favorite video games of all-time. There are so many good things to gush over, but the bad pieces are really, truly bad and do a lot to ruin the experience of actually playing the game. The most concise way I can describe it is 'flawed masterpiece'. It's a game propped up by fantastic art and sound design and far better overall writing than the much maligned Mass Effect 3, but at the same time, the gameplay is nowhere near as tight and the overall design is way rougher -- To the point where I'd criticize the combat as being unfinished.\n\nTo start, the graphics and the engine run pretty smoothly on the PC. It runs easily enough -- I see around 110-120 FPS on my 120hz 1440p monitor, but the textures are often muddy and low-res, a curse of the title being designed with far outdated consoles in mind... Even back in 2010. I had a similar experience with the first Mass Effect, though that game is even rougher-looking than this one is. The textures here are, on average, higher res. It helps that the lighting is far better designed than the first game (goodbye, ham-fisted lens flare!). There are a great many visual bugs, though. Far more than the console version. Glitches with the eyes, characters model inexplicably spinning, etc. But it's saved mostly by the beautiful art design. The use of colored lighting really adds a great touch, and the environments are unbelievably vibrant. There's a lot to 'feel' here just by looking at skyboxes. It's indicative of good art design and adequate design on the technical side to support it. The art team is the MVP here.\n\nThe sound! Where to start? Jack Wall is absolutely fantastic, almost up to the level he was in the first game. He's at his best when he's laying down eerie music for the tense missions (Collector Ship, anybody?), buit he does a great job with handling the huge change in tone from the first game. Mass Effect 1 was carried by a super-techno, futuristic style soundtrick, whereas this one has touches of futurism but mostly just feels brooding and dirty. It fits the art direction of the game perfectly, and even a minimalist track like the droning that plays during the loading screen really does a fantastic job to impart and augment the overall 'feel' of this game, which is a big part of what I find so enticing about Mass Effect 2.\n\nThe writing is probably the games single strongest aspect. I don't mean to exaggerate, or to gush too much here, but there are some of the most well-written characters in any video game I've ever played. It's clear that Walters, Karpyshyn, and the rest of the writing staff were going for a Dirty Dozen, Wild West type feel with the characters and settings here, and they've succeeded in spades. There are a lot of characters that might even fit into a cliche, but the dialogue is so well-written and the voice acting is so superb that the game manages to skip that pothole and cruise along. Thane Krios, the spiritual, regreatful assassin, is a stand-out among a cast of solid personalities. His discussions with Shepard and his dealings with his son Kolyat are excellent. Garrus is far more fleshed out here than he was in the first game (in which I found his character to be disappointingly underdeveloped), and the writing here creates a bridge to his being so likeable in the third game. Legion, a character who arrives unfortunately late in the game, is another stellar twist and an amazingly well-written and impresses in unexpected ways. It's hard to go into detail without spoiling anything, but suffice it to say that his obsessive 'complex' is wholely unexpected and goes on to completely destroy any expectation I had when I initially learned of the characters presence in the game.\n\nThere are some pitfalls here, unfortunately, mostly in the form of Jacob Taylor. He always came off as completely unlikeable to me, though that's more a personal feeling and not a general criticism. I think he's a poor character simply because there's not really much there to dig into. He's got some father issues to deal with that feel crammed in mid-game and seem to hover around the outside of his character rather than fleshing out his core, like so many of the other characters side missions are intended to do.\n\nNow that I've gushed over the good things, let's talk about some of the bad.\n\nThe game plays as if its half finished, particularly during combat. There's a nice idea and an adequate core design here, but it seems like it could have used far longer in the QA process than it actually had. The core mechanics of taking down the enemies shields/barriers, armor, and then health are really excellent. Each is weak to a different type of weapon, ammo, and power, so each encounter becomes a sort of puzzle where you're evaluating which enemy is the most threatening and thus must be dealt with first, and by using which power or weapon to do so. It's incredibly complex but relatively simple to learn, and getting through some of the more difficult encounters on hardcore or insanity difficulty is amazingly satisfying.\n\nSounds great, right? Unfortunately, while the game is at its best on the two hardest difficulty modes, it also suffers the most on those modes due to extremely buggy cover mechanics and unbelievably poor friendly AI. I really can't rag on the friendly AI enough. It's absolutely abysmal, and if you want that Insanity trophy you better be ready for some frustration. It's necessary to completely micomanage your allies by controlling where they're taking cover at all times. The problem with cover also manifests itself here, as there are many times when allies simply refuse to listen to you and wade out into enemy fire only to die immediately. It's so frustratingly idiotic that I find myself wondering how the game ever shipped in this fashion. It's a mess, and having to babysit your idiotic, suicidal squadmates really destroys what would have been an otherwise fantastic gameplay system. The general design is there, but the technical execution is utterly terrible and enough to make you bash your head against a wall. It's much more passable on Normal and Casual, but if you're gunning for Hardcore or Insanity, get ready for a headache.\n\nThe overall design of the game, despite these poorer aspects, is excellent. The episodic style of gameplay in which you're recruiting allies just feels right, and the game feels far more organized and direct than the first game ever did. On the harder difficulties you really get a sense of it being a race against time. You've got to plan out what missions you're doing at what time, because upgrades are incredibly important and if you find yourself trying to take on Horizon or the Collector Ship without the good ones, you can actually get completely stuck and be forced to start over. While this sounds frustrating, it actually does a good job to suck you into the situation that Shepard and the crew find themselves in. They've got to get all of this done, and quickly, because the Collectors are on the move and they aren't waiting for you. This episodic style is paced perfectly, and you never seem to experience any of the drag that you see in the first game when you get dropped onto the Citadel after Eden Prime only to find yourself immediately bogged down with a huge area to explore and dozens of sidequests to tackle. It does a far better job with making sure you never feel overwhelmed than the first game. It's open-ended enough without stranding you in a sea of objectives -- You've always got a handful of options of what to do next, and it's up to you to decide which seems to be most important.\n\nAll of the gameplay here comes to a head in a fantastic final act that sees everything you've done so far in the game build up to one massive conclusion. The suicide mission is truly excellent, and caps off a must-play game for everyone interested in RPGs.","July 21, 2012","true","79.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","5"

The syfy part is really intersteting and every planet has its description. You have many many choices during the game which, for most of them, does truly matter for the rest of the game. There are many possible classes, though as I just ended the game with one of them I can't really talk about it. Though, I suspect it is a good point. And way, much more... ^^ (such as hacking, bypassing... Reminded me of Alien Isolation, loved it) The bad points will take me more times, but it's because I don't want to spoil any of the game. I insist this is a wonderful game, I rarely end my games and I'm about to do it a second time. It's just that I found intersting to explain what can be bad, for two reason. First, because it's important for you to know if there are thing you can't live with (but I doubt it'll be the case here), and second because other people will be able to contrast my opinion. ^^\n\nThere are some bad points too. Glitches, damn I was almost at the 400th save cause even when no battle was excpected, I feared to start flying or to get stuck in wall or similar weird behaviors. These does not happen often, but as there sometimes are no way to get rid of them if not reloading a previous game, it can be really really annoying. (It has never been for me as the first time it happened to me I started saving as I was breathing, but no doubt it can be) Another glitch which is quiet weird but is not a problem at all is that sometimes characters don't have their proper voices (and no, I'm not talking about mike going weird, there's that too I know it's normal), this isn't exactly a bad point as it's even funny sometimes.\nAnother bad point is the money. You're limited in money by the money you get from your missions and this isn't enough to buy everything, I think it's possible through new game+ though, I'll see that soon enough. Quiet the same, but some people will probably prefer it this way, it's not possible to level paragon and renegate to the max. It's though probably to have one to the max if you foccus, but you can't try to have always all choices, or if it's possible, I clearly missed something. (If that's the case, please tell me that, without telling me what this is, wanna find out by myself)\nAnd there is that keybinding that made me mad more than once. the SPACEBAR which became LEFTSHIFT to me is used to, well, everything. Interaction, picking up, talking, hiding, crouching, running. This is conveniant, but also very annoying. You're just trying to running from those enemy of yours, you just slip for a bit on the left and there you're now hiding in plain side which is a suicide move. And there lots of other ugly situation this is causing. Another thing, and if you've never play the game it's important you hear that, the tip at the beginning of the game ain't dynamic. So if you change you're keybinding's settings these will still point you to the default settings, so be sure to remember really well after changing you biding that you'll be able to know how to use them.\nAnd one hell of a bad point... You can't have a lesbian relationship between Shepard and Miranda. (damn! xD)\nOh another bad point I'm starting to experience, I yes I know manipulating the file it is possible, but you cannot skip the long, long introduction of the game. And when you wanna restart it, this is becoming a real pain in the <3. ^^\n\nI'd like to add that I didn't play Mass Effect 1  (yet :p), and this isn't really annoying, the game kinda "remind" you of what happened in the first game, though I think it'd be better, but that doesn't have to stop you.\nAbout difficulty, this isn't a realy hard game. As I said, I started the game with the insanity difficulty with no previous experience in the mass effect franchise and I managed to keep it isane 'till the end of the game. Not that insanity is not hard (it is ^^), but the game is quiet intuitive, it's easy to find how to handle a battle and if you're not to bad at aiming, this isn't that hard. I can't advise any difficulty as I only know insanity (and a bit of casual now).\n\n\nI'm disappointed there's only a "yes/no" notation on steam, I'd like to put a ten to this game! :D","July 22, 2015","true","74.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Not that it is particularly great - in my opinion, it doesn't measure up to its predecessor nor to the trilogy's finale - but it's a necessary part of the story and it's definitely worth playing.\n\nThe second part of ME franchise puts greater accent on squad interaction. In fact, you can get as much as a dozen companions, and missions related to their backstories occupy most of the game. It might be a turn-off for some, but if you felt immersed in the first Mass Effect, you should find most of those characters and missions quite enjoyable, at least during the first playthrough. I promise you're going to love some of your new squadmates, who will make you laugh and cry, and it seems that your old friends haven't forgotten about you after all.\n\nThe main storyline is consequently even shorter than in ME1, though with all the other assignments it shouldn't be a problem. One's for sure - I'm not going to spoil the climax, but it's as epic as the battle with the Sovereign. Mass Effect series didn't lose its scale and there are still moments that make you turn up the volume and sit at the edge of your seat. The ground battles have a whole new quality to them (finally Mass Effect has elements of a proper shooter - ducking behind cover and shooting seems more real and exciting than in the first part of the series), though perhaps you're going to miss the Mako.\n\nA few words about the equipment system - it's much simplier than in the first game and I personally consider it an improvement. If you enjoyed comparing stats, shopping, and painstakingly equipping every single member of your squad, you might be disappointed, but if not, here's good news. The whole equipment system has been replaced with several items of weaponry, a few customizable elements of armor for Shepard, and a variety of upgrades giving bonuses for Commander or the whole squad. You may like it or not, but it's definitely easier to deal with. Leveling system has been simplified as well - maybe even too much - but it's now more intuitive, and it doesn't take 40 levels to get you the skill you want anymore.\n\nMy biggest pain with this game lies within DLC-s, which cost more than the game itself (especially when it's on sale), but when you finally play them, they seem essential to the story. It might be a pain in your wallet, but the sad truth is that some content has been apparently cut from the game and sold in separate bundles. Mass Effect 2 is still a fairly good game by itself, but it feels somehow incomplete without that additional content.\n\nThat said, it's still Mass Effect, and thus it's a part of one of the greatest stories I've been immersed in. Don't forget to check digital deluxe edition available here for the same price... and have fun!","January 30, 2015","true","162.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The only problem - Mass Effect 1 exists.\n\nNarrative: I just finished Mass Effect 1 and started playing 2 and I like it less because the story is so fast paced. I'm not thinking about the dangers of the reapers or what could happen later and how I will plan for it, I'm thinking what will this next mission throw at me. And connection and feeling for characters have decreased greatly; if they gave me a choice between Grunt and Jack, like on virmire, I'd play eenie meenie miney mo, I wouldn't think of about the personality of both characters and where our friendship was headed - frankly because I hardly care.﻿ The narrative of Mass Effect 1 is probably the best I've ever experienced in a game, but Mass Effect 2 is "just" really good. The story in Mass Effect 2 is too fast paced, it doesn't really give you time to smell the roses, to admire how glorious the game could've been.\n\nCombat:The combat is significantly better, even with the not so great addition of thermal clips and controls worse than the original game. It looks better, but doesn't feel as good as the original, almost entirely because of the controls (which can be edited in the settings) but even after changing them to the original game's controls it doesn't feel right.\n\nMass Effect 2 is just kind of awkward compared to Mass Effect 1, but still a great experience.","November 30, 2014","true","18.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I intend to prove them wrong."\n\nChances are that when asked about games you consider to be classics or personal favourites, you have a handful that you fondly remember and can still pick up and play even today. As such, Mass Effect 2 is, by no means, a perfect game nor the "greatest" game. It suffers from issues that have polarised many in the community, from the supposedly awkward combat to the infamous elevator rides. Yet even after nearly 5 years and dozens of playthroughs, (across multiple platforms), it still remains a personal favourite.\n\nThough released under the thumb of everyone's favourite publisher, the period around the release of Mass Effect 2 also saw the equally excellent Dragon Age: Origins appear, marking the triumphant return of BioWare and Western RPGs in a whole new way. You are once again placed in the boots of Commander Shepard and are weeding out the remnants of indoctrinated Geth when a new threat, known as the Collectors, reveal themselves, turning the tables on you and your crew in an incredible opening sequence. Abandoned by The Council and now working under the orders of the pro-human extremist group Cerberus, you must once again build yourself up from nothing, gather your crew, prepare yourself and travel through the Omega-4 relay to end The Collectors once and for all.\n\n"We're all asking you to do the impossible, Shepard. No pressure."\n\nA heavily stylised and cinematic experience, BioWare's so-called space opera features some of the best writing around, easily quotable and frequently amusing. Regardless of your opinion of BioWare and the controversies in recent years, it is difficult to deny the depth of characterisation and investment that the studio has brought to the Mass Effect series. From the opening titles all the way to the end credits, Mass Effect 2 has a quality that others still aspire to and fail to achieve. You will grow attached to your crew but in different ways compared to other playthroughs, especially with the romance and loyalty mechanics. The game allows for what can only be described as true role-playing, in a more accessible medium than that of pen-and-paper.\n\nFrom the character customisation to the dialogue wheel to the open-ended Paragon/Renegade morality system, you are free to shape your Shepard however you wish and determine the fates of not only your crew but the galaxy itself. With the addition of the import save file feature, playing through the series carries further weight as for every choice there certainly is a consequence; many of which are severe and often unexpected, especially in the final mission where everything and everyone is on the line. Successfully pulling off the aforementioned Suicide Mission without a single death is truly epic and will stay with you long after the credits roll and Jack Wall's excellent soundtrack finishes.\n\nAs it is action-oriented, the squad-based gameplay features an impressive range of enemy types and classes, six of which are available to Shepard and complement specific weapon loadouts and cross-class abilities with your team of four per mission. Although the game goes to great lengths to encourage experimentation with a good range of weapons, you'll most likely have a loadout well and truly established for each character within a few hours, with exception to the researched upgrades later in the game. Finite magazines have replaced the overheating component of previous weapons, which significantly affects the style of combat between the two. You'll be taking cover and pausing more often, relying more on biotics than the first especially to get through the various layers of protection.\n\nThe tactical UI has been cleaned up a bit and there are other significant changes from the first game. For one, there isn't an inventory or loot system. At all. The top-of-the-line weapons are simply found, bought or researched. Weapons are assigned prior to missions and medi-gel is frequently littered throughout levels, now used only to revive teammates. Shepard's N7 is the centrepiece in terms of armour, featuring modular customisation, but other parts and sets can be found or bought. Over all, combat is certainly more streamlined then the chaotic firefights of the first game, but feels more realistic and enjoyable. Shepard no longer feels like a demi-god, instead like the lone soldier fighting tooth-and-nail against all odds that they're meant to be.\n\n"The Collectors are about to find out what happens when you ♥♥♥♥ me off."\n\nThe galaxy map and vast array of missions will take you from the heights of glorious Illium to unsettling space stations to the seedy underbelly of Afterlife and Omega. In terms of graphics, Mass Effect 2 isn't the best looking game for its time, choosing more of a gritty, contrasted artstyle that BioWare's heavily modified version of Unreal Engine 3 allows for but still looks great all the same.. even when wandering around the Normandy for the umpteenth time. AI is surprisingly quite good, significantly better than a lot of other games, with only the rare kamikaze or doorway block. There were occasional minor framerate drops and in terms of bugs, I encountered some clipping and camera issues but nothing significant or game-breaking. A quick reload usually fixes most of the few that remain. Having played this for hundreds of hours on the PlayStation 3, the experience has been pretty good on both platforms.\n\nThe only major criticism here is due to the Steam version, rather than the game itself, and the lack of DLC. Already having owned all the available DLC on console, the Digital Deluxe edition contains the "Cerberus Network" DRM, (which, at the time of writing, apparently has been shut down), with the only meaningful addition being Zaeed Massani as an additional companion. The best content, like the Lair of the Shadow Broker, Kasumi and The Arrival, costs more than twice the initial price of the Steam edition, let alone when it's on sale. Besides the fact that this is overseen by Electronic Arts, the fact that DLC costs more for a game that is over half a decade old is unacceptable.\n\n"Just once I'd like to ask someone for help and hear them say, "Sure. Let's go. Right now. No strings attached."\n\nDo I recommend Mass Effect 2 for everyone? No. In fact, I know many people who hate it with a passion, and that's fine. It certainly isn't for everyone. But this is a Steam review, so let's continue in the not-so-objective manner.\n\nIt is a captivating ride from start to finish with thousands upon thousands of lines expertly delivered by the cast, bringing Shepard's crew and the complexities of the alien worlds and relations to life. The triumph of Mass Effect 2 is that it captures not only the sci-fi epic but the humanity that underpins it. The love and effort that BioWare have put into crafting this is second-to-none as the game constantly drives you into exploring and, above all, determining how you play.\n\nFor a genre that is so overused, parodied and often mishandled, Mass Effect 2 is a truly epic example of a game done right and the pinnacle of the BioWare RPG. How much enjoyment and investment you get from this ultimately comes down to personal preference, though coming from someone who knew nothing about the series going into their first playthrough, I'd ask that you give it a chance. Even just on sale, it's worth it.\n\nThough I'd recommend that you experience the trilogy from start to finish, this also stands proudly amongst the best in its own right. This and Dragon Age: Origins may be a far cry from the days of Baldur's Gate or KOTOR but still remain a personal favourite.\nJust like old times.\n\nCheers for getting this far, reader, as this review is certainly long enough.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IWearLeatherShoes/recommended/24980/","IWearLeatherShoes","Tundra Scorpion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IWearLeatherShoes/","185 products in account","The direct sequel to the blockbusting science fiction RPG hit by Bioware, Mass Effect 2 picks up on and improves everything that made ME1 so memorable.\nJust like the first game, Mass Effect 2 has a very high immersion factor thanks to givin the player every opportunity to step into the shoes of the now legendary Commander Shepard, a completely customizeable protagonist in whom the player can all but become the savior or the scourge of the galaxy. Thanks to the save-file transfer system, all the major and even a few minor choices the player made in the first game will carry over into this game and change how the galactic community views you and the human race.\nThe story has evolved quite a bit and at this point in the series is beginning to unfold into something grand and sinister, upon learning that your quarry from the previous game was nothing more than a mindless puppet being used by an even greater threat, the Commander has had difficulty convincing the council of this looming presence (ah yes, "reapers") and is instead being sent out to clean out the remaining synthetic soldiers used by Saren. Until a massive twist in the form of what looks suspiciously like a floating space turd attacks your ship and kills you in the process, but fear not, because you are revived at no small cost by Cerberus, an extremist pro-human organization that is officially labelled as a terrorist group. They explain that the space turd that killed you is related to a systematic series of abductions of human colonies, they believe something greater is at work and that you are the only one who can do anything about it.\nThe combat mechanics have improved tenfold since the previous game, the cover system is much more fluid and dynamic and gunfights are intense, fast paced and mind boggling. The gameplay factor has also been completely amped up by the removal of the Mako and the horrendous inventory management system that plagued the first game, simplifying the inventory system and adding resources to collect via exploring the galaxy that can be used to research upgrades for your ship, armor, weapons and abilities.\nLike the previous game, the dialogue is highly varied, offers different outcomes based on your behavior and adds a good replay factor to the game. Being respectful or a complete jerk adds to a "paragon and renegade" score that can unlock further dialogue options that can make certain missions go a lot smoother, as well as adding a paragon-renegade interrupt indicator during conversations which can make the commander perform a heroic deed or a reckless decision. The choice, and consequences, are completely up to you.\nThe squad has increased dramatically, with DLCs maxing out at 12 squadmates to choose from on missions. Each squadmate also offers their own personal mission which when completed earns you that particular squadmate's undying loyalty and unlocks a new ability and outfit for them.\nHowever, Mass Effect 2 also has more than it's fair share of graphical bugs that can break the immersion, as well as the occasional game-breaking glitch where the commander floats up to and gets trapped in the ceiling for no expliciable reason, forcing the player to reload their game and avoid the area where it occured. The level design is also far more linear than the previous game, and feels like a bit of a hand holder throughout as a result.\nAll things considered, with a large experience that can easily max out at over 15 hours per playthrough depending on how much you want to experience the game, Mass Effect 2 is a deserving addition to the series and remains one of the best games I've played. Highly recommended.","December 4, 2013","true","163.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

The possibility of creating your own character and dictate it's decisions and personality provides for one of the most immersive gaming experiences you'll ever have. This is what games should always be, an interactive media where, instead of just inputting action, you're writing your own path and telling your own story, molding the framework the developers created into your liking. This is what a true interactive media should be like.\n\nMass Effect 2 is a masterpiece, filled with the most interesting characters and settings I've ever seen in a video game, stellar gameplay, amazing storytelling and music and the most rewarding - and thrilling - choice mechanic. I cannot praise it enough.\n\n\nA true masterpiece that shows what video games are capable of as a true artform, building upon cinematic language and adding interactivity and the instrument of choice to become the ultimate storytelling medium.\n\nTo sum it up, don't waste an opportunity to experience Mass Effect 2 at least once in your life.\n\n(P.S.: I recommend this specially to Star Trek fans, trust me on that one)","December 29, 2014","true","22.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Simply watch a video or read the lore to get the story of it, and jump to Mass Effect 2 right away!\n\nMass Effect 2 is in every single way better. It's smoother, game-play feels a lot better, the game mechanics are pretty damn solid now and the story, is a blast.\n\nThe game is very good at making you feel in control of the crew, the ship and last but not least, control of your character. You feel bound to the people around you, you feel their pain, happiness and suffering.\n\nWhile you progress the "main" story arc, you will get multiple "side-missions" that will not only give you rewards and experience, but also in some ways, make you feel more connected to the planets and galaxies, giving you a higher incentive of beating anything in your path, anything for humanity and the safety of the galaxy, you clearly show, no matter who's in charge, you will get the job done.\n\nAnd with the help of people you meet along the way, recruit, talk to, consider your closest allies, you can take down even greater threats.\n\nAlong the story arc line, your companions will ask you for help, doing so will make them more "Loyal" towards you and what you stand for, but it's not all a cakewalk, you get to see some dark sides of certain characters that change the view of them completely, they can put you in hard spots, do you do as they want? Do you keep them from doing something stupid? What is right? And, what is wrong?\n\nIn the end it's all up to you to decide, and it will reflect on you, and your ship crew.\n\n\nSo the question then is, should you play this or not? Is it worth the price?\nHellyeah it is, the game can get picked up for cheap and nothing now, Mass Effect 2 is a huge improvement over its predecessor, not only in the way the game looks, but the game mechanics in general are a lot more smooth, feel good to use and best of all, no more irritating screens that pop up and take hours away.","September 4, 2013","true","46.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

The game is now a bit more shooter-oriented/action-oriented, but still packs an incredible storyline.\n\nSome events in ME2 will depend on what you did in ME1, assuming you import your characters/saves from the previous game.

The combat is very fun but not what makes Mass Effect so unforgettable.  The highlight is the characters, the way you interact with them, and the choices you make.  The characters are fully fleshed out and many of the game's missions are dedicated to gaining your allies' loyalty and learning more about them.  The ways you interact with them and decisions you make in the game, or have made in Mass Effect 1, have consequences both grand and subtle.  They combine to make the game one of the most personalized gaming experiences out there.\nMany triple A games aim to deliver an epic experience, and I won't claim that they fail.  But Mass Effect 2 is probably the most epic game I am familiar with.  Its epicness cannot be overstated and in fact its epicness is quantitatively thrice as large as the epicness of other triple A games whose epicness is the main selling point.  Yet despite the incredible epicness of Mass Effect 2 (and I am in no way discrediting the power of epicness), it doesn't neglect to add incredible depth to its characters and choices.","December 31, 2011","true","131.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

At first.\n\nThe base game for Mass Effect 2 was devoid of almost everything that made the original great. Each mission was nothing more than killing some guys with no option to do anything else. Inventory management was completely removed from the game and the gameplay became that of a shooter - choose mission, go to instance, kill guys, cutscene.\n\nBut, - and this is a big but - the DLC does a lot to fix this game. Where the base game was devoid of anything but the main mission, the DLC adds much-needed hand-crafted content - and just enough for me to recommend this game (with DLC).","May 2, 2014","true","35.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The atmosphere is unique and the overall univerese is just so diverse and fleshed out. The conflict is great and the choices that have to be made are crucial and important.

Simply watch a video or read the lore to get the story of it, and jump to Mass Effect 2 right away!\n\nMass Effect 2 is in every single way better. It's smoother, game-play feels a lot better, the game mechanics are pretty damn solid now and the story, is a blast.\n\nThe game is very good at making you feel in control of the crew, the ship and last but not least, control of your character. You feel bound to the people around you, you feel their pain, happiness and suffering.\n\nWhile you progress the "main" story arc, you will get multiple "side-missions" that will not only give you rewards and experience, but also in some ways, make you feel more connected to the planets and galaxies, giving you a higher incentive of beating anything in your path, anything for humanity and the safety of the galaxy, you clearly show, no matter who's in charge, you will get the job done.\n\nAnd with the help of people you meet along the way, recruit, talk to, consider your closest allies, you can take down even greater threats.\n\nAlong the story arc line, your companions will ask you for help, doing so will make them more "Loyal" towards you and what you stand for, but it's not all a cakewalk, you get to see some dark sides of certain characters that change the view of them completely, they can put you in hard spots, do you do as they want? Do you keep them from doing something stupid? What is right? And, what is wrong?\n\nIn the end it's all up to you to decide, and it will reflect on you, and your ship crew.\n\n\nSo the question then is, should you play this or not? Is it worth the price?\nHellyeah it is, the game can get picked up for cheap and nothing now, Mass Effect 2 is a huge improvement over its predecessor, not only in the way the game looks, but the game mechanics in general are a lot more smooth, feel good to use and best of all, no more irritating screens that pop up and take hours away.","September 4, 2013","true","46.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

It's been argued this game has the best plot out of the three games, and I'd say that's a fair statement. They really liven it up compared to the first Mass Effect. That being said, you'd be doing yourself a great disservice if you didn't play the first game before this one; you won't understand what ANYONE is saying. More importantly, you'll be missing out on crafting your very own story, making those important decisions in ME1, and that's what really stands out about this series. The gameplay is more refined, and smoother than the first, but dumbed down. A lot of the RPG'ness is sucked out of this one, which some people like. You can't customize your weapons or armor as extensively as you could like in one, but it isn't a complete loss; the game is still utterly fantastic and worth your time. All in all, this is an important step in the story of Commander Shepard, and until you beat it, you'll be absorbed.","January 28, 2014","true","275.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is obvious the time and energy that went into the computer entrie surrounding the alien races, their homeworlds their history and even their prejudices FAR outweighed the time and energy spent on other things. Not to mention the energy spent on making the communities you encounter seem vibrant and alive.\n\nThat being said there is ALOT of regurgitation from KOTOR especially the second.  When I first watched the Ebon Hawk... errr I mean the "Normandy" land on Omega my jaw dropped (the whole scene, it seemed to me, was ripped from KOTOR 2).  Till I realized that ME2 was made by Bioware. Still if video game developers were more like writers half of the cutscenes and characters would come with a disclaimer in the corner *Reproduced From An Earlier Work*.  These things mostly lead to loud guffaws from me as I watched something that seemed so unnervingly similar to somthing I had seen before...... felt like I was playing a KOTOR 3 that lost the rights to use the Star Wars I.P.\n\nThe other thing about Mass Effect is the constant similarity to Star Trek.  The whole thing with Shepard falling onto a planet, project Lazarus (sounding like a nod to Project Genesis from "The Search for Spock") even the Geth being ideologically near identical to the BORG.\n\nTwo major negatives are the semi-dependance on ownership of the first Mass Effect to get crew members and certain side quests (nothing major really just unfortunate to me) and the fact that I found this in the RPG genre when really it's not.\n\nGood for a nice sci-fi vacation but don't expect it to break much from the KOTOR mold that it was obviously pressed from.","November 20, 2014","true","41.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I personally recomend playing the first one as that is still a great game unless you are more a shooter fan than an RPG fan in which case I woudl start here.  The combat is perhaps the biggest improvement and brings the game up to par with lots of other action games.  The characters and side quests were also improved over the original.  The main downsides are the story which very much has that "middle chapter" feel but is still good and the rpg feel which was dialed back too much for my tastes and may turn off other rpg fans.  But especially at today's prices this would easily be one of the first games I would point you to if you were looking for a great sci-fi game to play.","May 12, 2011","true","207.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While I do believe that this second installment is a bit over-praised, it is still an incredible game that builds on the successes of its predecessor very well.\n\nI do believe that most components of the combat system are improved. The only small detail that I don't personally enjoy is a matter of personal preference and doesn't really bother me, as it is present in most shooters anyways. The visuals are obviously much more impressive as well and make an impact on immersion in this case. Overall, the gameplay mechanics have been vastly improved as far as fluidity and functionality.\n\nWhat truly matters when evaluating this title, however, is the narrative and the ability of the game to make you care about its characters and its stories. While I personally believe that the first Mass Effect did a better job of making the player care about each and every character and his or her story, Mass Effect 2 still retains the important features that characterize the NPCs and make the story memorable and cannot be criticized for a lack of story; my personal opinion shouldn't have an impact on the validity and inspiration of the title. The fundamental RPG elements of Mass Effect 2 make it stand above virtually any other RPG on the market today.\n\nMass Effect 2 is an amazing game and is undoubtedly a must-own title.","September 13, 2015","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Where do you begin? With the superb graphics, that stand with the best today? Do you go with the gameplay that feels a thousand times more polished than the first with absolutely tons of available sidequests as well as Downloadable content? Maybe with the fact that this is the first story game that has allowed a player to carry over player-made decisions onto another game, and with this comes a promise that the character you crafted to YOUR expectations would be waiting for you in this story. (That alone is something that gamers like myself have been waiting years for.) And don't even get me started on the story and where the team at Bioware is taking this series. Not only are your character relationships you made in ME1 still intact, but now they have new and truly exciting avenues that they can take. This is doubly true for the Lair of The Shadow Broker DLC with character Liara T'soni. (Highly recommended, along with all the other DLC) Then there is Shephard. The hero who has a bit more personality than before, is forged through player decisions that can alter the state of your party dramatically. And forging him or her is another matter altogether. How exactly do you craft a character who is the most important human in the galaxy? And more, a character who knows it? These elements are sheer brilliance and the amazing experience gifted to us in the first is grossly intensified. The action feels real and livid. The romantic stories feel romantic (particularly with Garrus, Thane, Jack and Tali Zorah, who seem the slightly less than obvious choices) And the music (yes, I'm yet again, going into the music) composed by Jack Wall fits the situations of the game even better than the first entry. Some take issue with the mining and doorlock minigames because of their repetitive nature. To me, it is small potatoes considering the rest of the experience. By the end, you feel the weight of your decisions and their consequences on your shoulders, be they good or bad. The brilliant thing, though, is that you've felt this all along.\n\n10/10","March 31, 2013","true","290.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Like Mass Effect, Mass Effect 2 is a story-rich 3rd-person FPS where you play as Commander Sheperd. However, the story was not as captivating as ME1 and it seemed that I spent more time assembling and gaining the loyalty of my crew than on the main campaign, which in retrospect was pretty short and straightforward.\n\n2. The combat system was an improvement from ME1, where it was much easier to utilise abilities (both yours and your squad's) by binding them to the numerical keys. However, combat got really repetitive after a while. The hacking/ bypassing system was also an improvement, although mostly unnecessary and also repetitive.\n\n3. Anyone who played the original game would remember the dreadfully long elevator rides. Thankfully, ME2 had smoother transitioning and also higher quality cut-scenes which were very enjoyable.\n\n4. Like in ME1, it was possible to flirt/ develop relationships with a number of crewmates, although you would have to complete your target's loyalty quest before you could express interest. However, I was disappointed when Liara (ME1 character) could not be recruited into my squad, even though she did make an appearance in the game.\n\nI gave ME1 a rating of 9.5/10 only because of the elevator rides. While ME2 was a good game, it seemed to be lacking in story and also its descent into repetitiveness.\n\n8.5/10","June 27, 2015","true","21.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This iteration has that weird alien dude called Mordin (probably the only character I've ever liked), boring planet probing for resources instead of boring lore-filled vehicle sections (you have to collect most of the resources for the best toys, so pucker up), more cover shooting, and while it fails to be compelling... well, I sat through the entire thing.

When it hit the scene early in 2010, it was a major step up from the already great Mass Effect. Combat, characters, overworlds, storytelling, atmosphere, Interface, sound quality, choices and side-quests, all of it was greatly improved with this game, and still stands strong to this day.\nThe story follows two years after the events of Mass Effect 1. Due to reasons I will not reveal in fear of spoilers, Commander Shepard (the character you play as) has gotten off the public eye and is working with the pro-human organization called Cerberus, to deal with a threat the authorities choose to ignore. In order to do so, squad-mates must be recruited for a Suicide Mission to get rid of the threat.  And that's where you come in. Throughout a lengthy 35-40 hour campaign, you will travel to distant and varied worlds, making tough choices that can have devastating outcomes, to gain enough manpower for your campaign.\n\nThe main plot of the game is actually really simple. Like, REALLY simple, close to shallow. All you do is find out where the threat comes from, assemble a team to deal with the threat, find a way to get to the threat and then destroy it. The real meat of the game is actually with the squad-mates, in fact there are far more missions centered around recruiting characters and later gaining their loyalty through other missions. It's more of a character study than a traditional RPG (though you still get to explore fascinating locations and all that good stuff). And it works, because these are some really great characters. They're layered individuals from fascinating cultures and backgrounds, with believeable and complex motivations, striking personalities and involving arcs that really invest you in their struggles and the galaxy they inhabit.\n\nIt also helps that the conversations have been much improved from the previous game. In ME1, as well as other games, during dialogue characters would tend to stand completely still, maybe move their arms a few times with a bit of a stern, not very emotive face. That still happens from time to time, but often characters will now walk around the room while they talk, or maybe the camera will move around, focus on something or give interesting angles. The much improved camera work in this game is really welcome. Here they use shadows and light, colour, as well as other things to better create a mood, which really improves the quality of your interactions.\n\nThere are a lot more things I could say about this game, but what it boils down to, is that I think this is a fantastic game that you should give a try if you are interested in a character-focused game that touches on very real and difficult themes and issues in a very mature and smart way. I recommend that you import a save from ME1, since choices you made there will show up again, either to shake your hand or kick you in the balls. It greatly increases your ability to create your very own Shepard with a unique history, and that is a great experience.\n\nScore: 9.8/10","July 2, 2015","true","205.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Dude, this game is one of the best games out there. The Mass Effect trilogy is, in my book, the best one in the entire gaming history. By far.

I personally recomend playing the first one as that is still a great game unless you are more a shooter fan than an RPG fan in which case I woudl start here.  The combat is perhaps the biggest improvement and brings the game up to par with lots of other action games.  The characters and side quests were also improved over the original.  The main downsides are the story which very much has that "middle chapter" feel but is still good and the rpg feel which was dialed back too much for my tastes and may turn off other rpg fans.  But especially at today's prices this would easily be one of the first games I would point you to if you were looking for a great sci-fi game to play.","May 12, 2011","true","207.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Become a paragon or renegade through your choices in quests.\n+ New locations to explore, each filled with numerous side missions and content relevant to the main narrative.\n+ Interesting characters (won't add any spoilers), each with their own personal quest lines.\n+ New range of weapons and upgrades, you can even reinforce the Normandy with state of the art equipment.\n+ Great graphics, a massive step up from the original title.\n+ The game has been streamlined, making it more sleak and professional in appearance compared to the first entry in the trilogy.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- Although Mass Effect 2 looks a lot more refined and stylish than its predecessor, it comes at the expensive of its RPG characteristics. Leveling has been dumbed down a bit, but still plays a role in the game (thankfully).\n\nOverall Score: 9/10\n\nMass Effect 2 is an incredible RPG shooter which is very fun, keeps your attention and attaches you to characters through great storytelling.

Where do you begin? With the superb graphics, that stand with the best today? Do you go with the gameplay that feels a thousand times more polished than the first with absolutely tons of available sidequests as well as Downloadable content? Maybe with the fact that this is the first story game that has allowed a player to carry over player-made decisions onto another game, and with this comes a promise that the character you crafted to YOUR expectations would be waiting for you in this story. (That alone is something that gamers like myself have been waiting years for.) And don't even get me started on the story and where the team at Bioware is taking this series. Not only are your character relationships you made in ME1 still intact, but now they have new and truly exciting avenues that they can take. This is doubly true for the Lair of The Shadow Broker DLC with character Liara T'soni. (Highly recommended, along with all the other DLC) Then there is Shephard. The hero who has a bit more personality than before, is forged through player decisions that can alter the state of your party dramatically. And forging him or her is another matter altogether. How exactly do you craft a character who is the most important human in the galaxy? And more, a character who knows it? These elements are sheer brilliance and the amazing experience gifted to us in the first is grossly intensified. The action feels real and livid. The romantic stories feel romantic (particularly with Garrus, Thane, Jack and Tali Zorah, who seem the slightly less than obvious choices) And the music (yes, I'm yet again, going into the music) composed by Jack Wall fits the situations of the game even better than the first entry. Some take issue with the mining and doorlock minigames because of their repetitive nature. To me, it is small potatoes considering the rest of the experience. By the end, you feel the weight of your decisions and their consequences on your shoulders, be they good or bad. The brilliant thing, though, is that you've felt this all along.\n\n10/10","March 31, 2013","true","290.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The characters, the story, the gameplay - it is pure fun. The cover-based squad combat works great. The downsides to this game are that you have very limited options when it comes to choosing weapons- there is often one clear weapon to choose over another when picking a shotgun, pistol, SMG, etc. Also, the game seems to get into the end-game very quickly- just when you think you're just coming together as a team, you hit the last level. Finally, it seems that choosing different squadmates has a very small impact on gameplay- it makes little difference who I choose to bring with me. They all do about the same amount of damage- the only thing that changes are your abilities, which means that teammates with the more useful abilities should ALWAYS be chosen over those that don't have useful abilities. Other than this, everything about the game (except for the mining mini-game. Don't get me started on that) is phenomenal- there is a universe here that is meant to be explored, and boy is it fun.","August 6, 2015","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Would strongly recommend playing ME1 first to get the full experience!\n\n+A decent cast of characters.  Some old friends from ME1, and some really cool new guys (MORDIN!)\n+Great universe, rich with lore learned from the characters as well as supplementary information from the Codex\n+Lets you make important choices through dialogue, and also quick time events (aka "interrupts") during dialogue!\n+Nice variety of weapons that are distinct from each other, and no hassle of inventory management\n+Combat is fun, with the option of pausing at any time to give orders to teammates and cast abilities\n+As before, a nice variety of abilities ranging from tech, mass-manipulating, and pure combat\n+Gotta love the humor in this game.  Some of your teammates can get rather snarky.  Even the dialogue between no-name citizens changes whenever you pass by them, and they talk about the darndest things.\n+Do your choices matter in the long run?  Are your teammates' opinions of you really that important?  Trust me, they are.  Try not to cry.\n\n-Resource gathering minigame for upgrades, etc. is boring.  Most, if not all of it should have been accomplished in missions\n-Level design is linear, and can get somewhat boring.  Some of the major planets were quite disappointing because of how they limited your travelling to only mission-designated areas.\n-One of the dumbest plot holes I have ever seen in a game. It deserves its own bullet point.  I'm referring to the part where you and ALL YOUR PARTY MEMBERS decide to fly off on a shuttle for absolutely no reason whatsoever, leaving the ship vulnerable.  Seriously, such lazy writing.  Only for that part, though.\n-While some of the new characters were interesting, others felt like re-hashes of characters from the first game, or just plain bland.","January 15","true","19.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Missing these important game-changing dialogue can really change the outcome of your gameplay, so watch out! This is the major selling point for me. Other than the great squad-based combat, Mass Effect 2 has a great, immersive story with interesting characters who each have their own unique history and past. The atmosphere is unique and the overall univerese is just so diverse and fleshed out. The conflict is great and the choices that have to be made are crucial and important. So, if you're looking for a game with a great story, a colorful cast of characters, strategic combat and crucial choices, then Mass Effect is the game for you!!!\n\n-Yumi","October 11, 2015","true","51.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You see, EA forces you to use their mega-crap software origin for downloading the DLC belonging to this game.\nAnd as all EA games they have employed someone suffering from brain hemorage to design it. You need to register an  origin account to get your stuff, then you need to download your DLC from a browser, then you need to run every DLC as a seperate EXE file.\nAnd that is not all, every time you start up your game, the origin crap-good-for-nothing built in client fails to connect to their demonic servers so you need to manually insert your origin credentials every time you want to play this. And modern things like cut and past for those of us who use password managers, nope, forget about it, and using 90:s era things like tabbing between form boxes, nope, cause EA don't know about that.\n\nI recommend this game but will rather drink from a toilet than to buy an EA game again.","June 14, 2015","true","48.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's not perfect, but the story, the universe and characters are generally well done, and the third-person shooter gameplay is quite satisfactory.  Would strongly recommend playing ME1 first to get the full experience!\n\n+A decent cast of characters.  Some old friends from ME1, and some really cool new guys (MORDIN!)\n+Great universe, rich with lore learned from the characters as well as supplementary information from the Codex\n+Lets you make important choices through dialogue, and also quick time events (aka "interrupts") during dialogue!\n+Nice variety of weapons that are distinct from each other, and no hassle of inventory management\n+Combat is fun, with the option of pausing at any time to give orders to teammates and cast abilities\n+As before, a nice variety of abilities ranging from tech, mass-manipulating, and pure combat\n+Gotta love the humor in this game.  Some of your teammates can get rather snarky.  Even the dialogue between no-name citizens changes whenever you pass by them, and they talk about the darndest things.\n+Do your choices matter in the long run?  Are your teammates' opinions of you really that important?  Trust me, they are.  Try not to cry.\n\n-Resource gathering minigame for upgrades, etc. is boring.  Most, if not all of it should have been accomplished in missions\n-Level design is linear, and can get somewhat boring.  Some of the major planets were quite disappointing because of how they limited your travelling to only mission-designated areas.\n-One of the dumbest plot holes I have ever seen in a game. It deserves its own bullet point.  I'm referring to the part where you and ALL YOUR PARTY MEMBERS decide to fly off on a shuttle for absolutely no reason whatsoever, leaving the ship vulnerable.  Seriously, such lazy writing.  Only for that part, though.\n-While some of the new characters were interesting, others felt like re-hashes of characters from the first game, or just plain bland.","January 15","true","19.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Read with caution.\n\nShort Plot Synopsis: Mass Effect 2 takes place weeks after the first game, starting with Commander Shepard (Mark Meer or Jennifer Hale) and the crew of the Normandy searching through a sector where three ships have gone missing within one month. After spending four days finding nothing, the Normandy is attacked by an unknown ship, ripping it apart. The crew evacuates, and Commander Shepard tosses Jeff "Joker" Moreau (Seth Green), the ship's pilot, into the last available Evacuation Pod. Shepard is thrown aside from the pod to a control panel, where he closes off the Evac Pod and sends Joker to safety. However, an explosion damages Shepard's suit, causing a breach, leaving Shepard to ultimately asphyxiate and fall into the nearby planet. Shortly after death, a company named Cerberus, that has a bad reputation for extremist behaviours to secure the fate of Humanity, recovers Shepard's body from the surface of the planet. Cerberus then creates and begins the "Lazarus Project", the act to revive Shepard. The process takes two years, and Shepard's awakening wasn't pleasant. When he finally awakens, alarm bells are going off in the Research Station. The ship's own Security Mechs have turned rogue, and the ship needs to be evacuated. This begins Mass Effect 2.\n\nFeatures:\n- Re-take the role of Commander Shepard, defeater of Saren and saviour of the Citadel, and control him through the events of Mass Effect 2.\n- Carry off from where you left off; Choices from Mass Effect 1 affect Mass Effect 2. You can also import your previous character. You are also able to import your Mass Effect 2 character into Mass Effect 3, where your decisions will affect the story and your crew. Though it involves a little bit of work, details later on.\n- Every choice matters; Whether it's delaying a mission, or helping out your crew, every decision will influence your outcome and determine your crew's fate.\n- Personalization; You can shape Shepard into your own view of them, making Shepard either Male or Female, and having control over their looks, personality, armour style, class, abilities, and weapons.\n- Moral System; The Mass Effect series has a moral compass with two sides; Paragon and Renegade. However, unlike numerous other moral compases that determines being either one or the other, Mass Effect brings a new idea to the table. It tracks both your Paragon and Renegade sides at the same time, meaning if you choose to spare someone, but extort someone for a discount, sparing that person will not balance out your moral compass. Unlike Mass Effect, there is no more Charm or Intimidate skill. They are now determined solely by your Paragon and Renegade standings, respectfully. Having enough Moral Standing points, you can then use special dialogue options, as well as a new feature introduced in Mass Effect 2 called "Interrupts". These are special dialogue options used when other characters are talking, activated with the mouse buttons. Using these can cause impacts on the story, such as calming down two characters before they end up fighting, point out other characters immoral choices, or even assault a character entirely. Another interesting feature is your moral standing affects Shepard's appearance. If you choose a Paragon path, Shepard's scars from the Lazarus Project will heal and start to disappear. However, if you choose Renegade, those scars will deepen and show more.\n- A wide crew, made of different races. Your personal squad, who will assist in battle, is interchangable, and comes with the ability with choosing their loadout and abilities. If you do your squadmate's loyalty missions, they will gain a unique ability, and this will help with the end-game.\n- The ability to use your teammates abilities when you want to.\n- Unique, original plot, with lots of mechanics you can't find elsewhere.\n- The universe is vast, full of interesting species and races, each with their own quirks and personalities.\n- You are able to create relationships with your crew members, that will affect the story in the next game.\n- Has a Planet-Scanning mini-game, where you search for different minerals and possibly side-missions on different planets.\n- New hacking minigames, including connecting Matching Pins and selecting matching pieces of code.\n- New Game+ Mode.\n- And many more features.\n\nPros\n+ Many customizable character and armour features. You are able to shape Shepard into your own image of him/her, choose your own class with their own set of abilities, choose your backstory, personalize your armour with different material and patterns, and mix-and-match armour pieces. Each piece of armour also has different effects, meaning one helmet could grant extra health, while another could improve accuracy.\n+ Deep story, with a fair amount of lore. The developers specifically noted to make the side-quests as deep as the main story.\n+ Every choice matters, each with their own consequences. Will characters agree with your actions, or frown upon them?\n+ Many new characters, each with their own detailed backstory.\n+ Brings back old characters from Mass Effect 1, with their own story of what they've been up to since Shepard had died.\n+ The ability to import your Mass Effect 1 character into Mass Effect 2, with all the decisions you have made in the first game affecting the story in the second one.\n+ The ability to import your Mass Effect 2 character into Mass Effect 3, though this comes with a little bit of work. Again, I'll explain further in.\n+ The outcome will be entirely determined on the player's decisions.\n+ Able to interact with and get to know your crew. You will be able to do specific missions for them, to gain their loyalty, unlocking a specific ability for them.\n+ Like I said in the features, Mass Effect has a very unique plot and story, with mechanics found hardly anywhere else.\n+ Nice graphics, even for a 5 year old game. It even runs smoothly for the amount of effects it has.\n+ The Mass Effect series has had a Heavy influence on lots of sci-fi games.\n\nNeutral\n+- You won't find yourself short on Credits anytime soon. Every mission is funded by Cerberus, and will include at least a 20,000 credit payroll at the end of the mission. You can also find additional credits on PDA's, Terminals, Wall Safe's, and (for some reason), Medi-kits. However, Purchases are evened out to higher prices to even this out.\n+- "I'm Commander Shepard, and this is my favourite store on the Citadel." You can endorse numerous stores on the Citadel with this line, which could technically create conflicts. It has no effect on the game though. However, this isn't a good way of laying low if you choose to tell the security guards at the entrance you would prefer the records to state that Shepard has died. Again, endorsing numerous stores has no effect on that choice.\n+- It requires a little bit of work to transfer your ME2 save file to ME3, due to ME3 only being available to Origin.\n\nCons\n- The game has DLC, but it's not available on Steam.\n- If Shepard dies in the end-game, you can not import your save to ME3.\n- Mini-games can get repetitive.\n\nFinal Decision\n\nI highly recommend this game. Mass Effect had a large impact on the Sci-Fi genre, and for good reason. I'll admit I had to cut a few points due to character limit, but I covered most of it. This is a fantastic game series, 8.9/10.","June 23, 2015","true","33.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Where the first game had the best story(imo), this sequel greatly expanded upon the gameplay elements. But dont let that fool you. Mass Effect 2 still delivers an epic story where as old faces return while new ones are introduced. Where the first game was clearly a rpg, this sequel has been labeled as an actionrpg, to reach out to a broader audience. Many would say that this is a bad thing, but the game is more fluid as well as some of the rpg elements have been toned down. That isn't necessarily a bad thing as this was often quite grueling in Mass Effect 1. So overall it expands on its predecessor when it comes to gameplay, lore and characters. Even though the story in Mass Effect 1 was better(again imo), this sequel still got an epic storyline as it is a continuation of the first game.","October 26, 2013","true",""," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I just had to continue the story and get ME2.\nIt's such a great idea to be able to import a savegame from the first game in order to have some continuity with shepherd (if necessary, google for a guide on how to do that, it's so much more immersive to "use the same Shepherd", as this is a continuation of ME1)\n\nThe game DOES feel different than the first part. Sure, the graphics are quite a bit better, and stuff like shooting from cover works better this time around... I am encountering way less problems with that than I did in part 1, where sometimes, you'd try to shoot but couldnt.\n\nHowever, some of the changes take a while to get used to. Reloading (better reload before the clip is empty, otherwise you might run out of ammo while you use a chance to fire off a long burst at an enemy) and collecting ammo (yes, you can actually run out of ammo, so you need to switch weapons or use powers), and also, you really have to be more tactical even on the easier settings this time around. No "stand outside of cover and shoot away", you'll die quickly. Fortnately, health and shields recover quickly once you're in cover again.\n\nAt first, I wasn't sure whether I enjoy the changes to combat (on harder settings, you REALLY need to use your team-commands and special powers, even though the AI of your team is working pretty good, apart from some silly moves sometimes), but eventually, I started getting into it... when you win a battle, it does feel more satisfying, and the fights are quite a bit more immersive altogether imo.\n\nThe story...what can I say? Just as immersive as part 1, and a great continuation to it. SOme of the decisions you have to make will make you think hard, and the writing reminded me of great SciFi-shows such as Babylon 5 (and I do think the devs DID watch that show, as the collectors remind me a LOT of the Shadows, visually)... I really wanna see how the story develops, where it leads. That's one thing that Bioware totally nailed with these games.\n\nThe team is really cool, so are the dialogues, and I found myself smiling a lot at some of the cut scenes and team-comments.\n\nGraphically, its obvious this is a few years old, but it does look better than ME1, and I don't mind the slightly dated graphics at all.\n\nPros:\n- Graphics are better than ME1\n- Story is even more immersive than ME1\n- Combat requires a more tactical approach, which makes it more immersive and "realistic"\n- Did I mention the great writing?\n- Digging the characters\n- Great music by the guy who composed "Requiem For A Dream"\n- Gathering resources for upgrades is fun, MUCH better than ME1...no more driving around with Mako, you scan the planet from the Normandy, keep an eye on a graph, and once there are peaks, you fire a probe. Not difficult, but much less grindy (IMO!) than ME1\n- Some familiar faces from ME1, starting early on!\n\nCons:\n- Some changes to combat, ammo, etc. So if you "binge play" and go from ME1 to 2 straight away, some adjustment time is necessary\n- You MIGHT not like the combat as much if you loved ME1, as it's a bit more difficult, yet I did give it a chance and it won me over, feels more satisfying IMO\n- No more Mako. If you liked that aspect of ME1, it's gone, but thats ok.\n- UI sometimes feels a bit clunky (accessing journal, codex, achievements), and research can be a bit confusing\n\nVerdict: ME2 picks up where ME1 stopped, continuing a VERY well-written and interesting story, making you feel very immersed. The game has quite a few improvements, even though not all changes are for the better IMO. If you liked the story in ME1, you owe it to yourself to continue and see what happens next.\n\nEDIT: I just finished the game. Game time is 20 hrs, yet I didn't do quite ALL of the side missions. I did a LOT of them, and all loyalty missions, didn't get into any romance-situations.\nAnd I am changing my rating from 9.0 to a 10.0. The story picks up even MORE eventually, fights become even more fun, and the storyline, dialogues and cutscenes are totally AWESOME.\nI was on the edge of my seat throughout, I was laughing quite a bit at some of the snarky comments by my team mates (Joker rules), I was saddened when I lost a member of my squad (even though I predicted it).\nBoth ME1 and 2 have hteir merits. I still love the first part a lot, but this one is even better, if you can deal with the changes made to the gameplay.\nDon't miss out on this, and even though it's been said a lot, if you can, play the whole series.Installing ME3 while typing this.\n\n10.0/10","July 23, 2015","true","21.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've seen other reviews for this game, and I gotta say - It actually is completely story-driven. Sure, there is gameplay, but mostly cutscenes, and that was suited well for this game. The optional character progression in "Loyalty Missions" provide extra play time, getting to know the people you recruit, gaining their trust & their respect. All in all, the story takes turns & provides new enemies to come in contact with.\n\nSoundtrack:\nI love the electric-orchestral vibes Mass Effect 2 brings to the table with its soundtrack! Every soundtrack definitely fits the mood for what's happening in that current situation, truth be told. The sound of electric synths with bashing drums really gets you in the mood for destroying those damn Reapers!\n\nCharacters:\nI absolutelyLOVE each character that you recruit/meet. I couldn't seem to find a flaw in any of them, each character is written so well!\n\n1.Mordin\nThe smarty pants of the crew, very cute as well, he learns mostly about each species he's around. As you continue through the story, he will help you with Armor, Weaponry, and squad upgrades - as well as your enemies information. Mastered in Biotics/Support.\n\n2.Garrus:\nLet's start off by saying that I do know Garrus was in Mass Effect 1, and meeting him in Mass Effect 2 was a huge suprise for the players. Anyways, he's pretty much the badass good-guy of the group. Caring, understandable, and pretty much down to earth savior! Mastered in Snipering.\n\n3.Miranda:\nMy second favorite squad mate in this game, really really interesting, as well as her accent! Her excellent shot & biotic powers are damn good. Cerberus Officer for the win! Mastered in Leadership/Biotics.\n\n4.Thane:\nQuiet & swift, like the night, he prays before he takes the kill & afterwards as he lays down his enemies body. Thane is truly a poetic character, the vibes that come from his life makes you think how much will power you'd need in order to survive such events as he did. Mastered in Support/Snipering.\n\n4.Grunt:\nBrutal & large, this huge Krogan has a taste for violence & bloodlust. He joins Commander Shepard to satisfy his love for violence & to redeem himself as a true Krogan! Mastered in Fighting/Battle.\n\n5.Legion:\nHowever you firstly see it as an enemy, t provides very useful information to help stop the Collectors from defeating Humanity. Just becareful what it does around Tali, you must have high enough Paragon/Renegade to have successful cooperation between the two. Mastered in Hacking/Engineering.\n\n6.Tali:\nSuch a sweetheart, very religious & royal. Tali is a long time friend from Mass Effect 1, as you meet her early on in Mass Effect 2, she will state that she cannot help you at that very moment. Later in the story, you must work together to fight the Collectors. Mastered in Engineering.\n\n7.Jack:\nSeen as a huge threat to the squad at first, but gradually they get used to her. Jack's attitude rides from stealing, killing for fun, to fighting with Commander Shepard. Dark past with this character, very saddening. Becareful how she re-acts to Miranda, you must have high enough Paragon/Renegade to have successful cooperation between the two. Mastered in Major Biotics.\n\n8.Jacob:\n"I'm good Shepard, ready for anything, if we win, we'll get loud, spill some drinks on the Citadel!" Ah, I love Jacob. He's my favorite squad mate, truth be told. Some people dislike him for his doubtful attitude, but I've seen through that, and if you get his loyalty, he's pretty much your best friend in Mass Effect 2! Mastered in Leadership/Support.\n\nVoice Acting:\nThe VAing for Mass Effect 2 is pretty awesome, I noticed some familiar voices from other video games, which was a great suprise, honestly. The only complaint I have about the VAing is that sometimes the voice does-not match the character's facial expression. But I assume that's an engine problem, not a big deal.\n\nConclusion:\nI gotta say, this was an amazing experience, definitely pulls on your heart strings as well!\n(EDIT), Woopsie, forgot Samara. She's a very useful & royal biotic trained killer!\n\n10/10. ♥","December 14, 2014","true","70.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

A Suicide Mission.\n\nWhilst Mass Effect 1 had you travel through civilized communities throughout the galaxy, Mass Effect 2 takes you into its dark underbelly, where crime, slave trade, corruption, mercenaries and drug trafficking run rampant and freely with no ill will on the criminals part. This gives the galaxy a more intimidating feel as you travel to recruit many of the Soldiers, Scientists and Mercenaries that will assist you throughout the game.\n\nOf course, recruiting people for a Suicide Mission isn't as easy as it may sound, Missions in this game are nicely structured and area enviroments give each mission a differant feel, what makes the missions so fun is the revamped combat system and classes, combat feels satisfying, reliable and fun and the differant player classes are reason enough to replay the game, Soldiers and Vanguards are seriously a blast to play with.\n\nEverything you do in the game is building up to the Final Mission, throughout the game a sense of foreboding looms around you as you get one step closer to passing through the Omega 4 Relay, in which everyone on your ship may not return from, as your decisions throughout the game will have impact upon Suicide Mission.\n\nA highlight of this game is that each crew member has their own loyality mission, your crewmate will ask for your assistance to help resolve a past, or present issue, allowing you to bond with said crewmate and learn what makes them who they are and how they tick, the assasin character is more than just an ruthless killer, the scientist is more than just a book worm.\n\nDLC is also some of the best I have ever seen in a game, the Cerberus Network houses free Downloadable mission packs and even some bonus weapons, there are some priced DLC but all is worth picking up, if you can only choose one, Lair of the Shadow Broker.\n\nAll the praising I give this game, there are only 4 issues I have with it.\n\nWeapon selection feels very limiting, alot of the customisation was removed, streamlining the experiance for better or worse, without DLC packs, you have pretty much 2 choices for each gun type (Save for 5 heavy weapon choices) with a powerful version you can obtain later on in the game.\nAlthough extremely rare, it is possible to get stuck in the enviroment, but this does not happen often enough to ruin or tarnish the experiance.\nWhere Mass Effect 1 was fair in its Renegade and Paragon options, this game might as well force you to be one or the other, as I don't see this much as a spoiler, but I would say it is mandatory to be pure hero, or pure badass.\n\nThe last point I can make a paragraph about:\n\nDo I recommend this to those that haven't played the first game?\nNo. Alot of the revelations that will occur in the game will not go over strongly with you if you havent played the first in the series, I would strongly recommend that even with Mass Effect 1s problems, you push through it, as your decisions in the first game will be carried over into Mass Effect 2, making the story feel so much more personal to you and you alone.\n\nWith all that said, Mass Effect 2 is an astonishing achievement, Winning over 90 awards and Game of the year 2010, It's graphics still impress me making the aliens and the galaxy around you feel so alive and real, The soundtrack is superb with special mention going to Suicide Missions theme itself, it's fast, fun combat with class based powers is vastly entertaining and story grips me each and every playthrough, if Mass Effect 2 isn't my favourite game of all time, it's Top 3 for sure.\n\nThey say it's a suicide mission, you should prove them wrong.","April 3, 2014","true","277.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Indeed, this game is about choices, and the wrong choice can lead to some of your members dying. ME2 has an amazing storyline, which is 10 times better than what the first was, with lots of replayibility even after you have completed it. Just everything about this game is amazing! Even though the first Mass Effect was in my top 10, it has now been replaced by this. It made me feel really bad with some of the choices I made so I had to go back and replay it to change what I had done.

The best one of its trilogy, this is the prodigal son where everything really really works together. Gameplay is a blast! You can pause it without feeling like it numbs down the tension. It's great to look at for a game its age and the story... oh, the story. You just keep playing "just one more mission" for hours and hours. There are SO MANY supporting characters that I was really impressed as how they managed to keep me interested on the background of every single one of them, taking my time away from the main plot without actually feeling like a side quest. And I'm the chick who HATES side quests! And sandbox games, anything that takes too much rambling to get me to the main point of the story line.\n\nThis game is a delight.

I don't understand why they suddenly decided to remove the shortcuts for inventory and skills, the crouch feature, the weapon switch hotkeys or even why they decided to merge cover, use and sprint into ONE SINGLE KEY (they deserve a medal for that one....).

I’m glad to say that most of those flaws have been eradicated in ME2. Gone are the endless slow elevator rides. Gone are the tedious, bouncy buggy rides on dull, lifeless planets. And gone is the ridiculously complex HUD. What hasn’t changed are its strong points, which remain in the storyline and RPG elements. Once again there is a detailed and compelling story along with many side plots and missions, which are more diverse and creative than those in ME1. The voice acting is excellent throughout as are the character models and animations, which are fluid and naturalistic. Graphically it’s very good for a four-year-old game, although there’s little in the way of physics, which is a shame. The combat has also improved, although it remains rather clunky and lacklustre compared to other games. The Mass Effect franchise is clearly about providing a rich and developed universe in which to place the player and to give that player a full-bodied RPG experience peppered with combat and action along the way. And in this respect ME2 really delivers. If not for the so-so combat I would have given it 5/5, but as it is I give it 4/5.","June 15, 2014","true","41.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I personally am still on the fence about the changes to combat.\n\nBut its quicker, more actionny than ever. Also you can only use one power at once since other powers will be put on cooldown once you activate a power (In the first game you could maybe use 8 powers at once but had maybe a minuter cooldown).\n\nThe question is though, is it fun? Oh hell yes, the combat is fun. It also makes it more interesting trying other classes and trying out different choices in the first game in order to see what will change in the second game.\n\nStorytime eh? Yeah yeah.\nThis time Shepard will be summoned by the corporation "Cerberus" and is tasked to find out why an alien race called the "Collectors" are kidnapping humans, so its up to you to find a new crew on you voyage amongst the stars and find out the grim truth about the kidnapping of humans...\n\nOne thing is sure; this game is more grim than the first and third game. No dance on flowers here.\n\nWhile the story to me is not good as the first but the interactions with the crew and characters keeps this game going. They also cut out the unnecessarily exploration bits (Love it or hate it) and major loot collecting has been removed entirely (Although you can do some cool research/upgrades in your lab).\n\n**And yes,i need to put this into here; Mass Effect 3 mini-review!**\nMass Effect 3 is the last game in the Mass Effect Trilogy. While the combat was the best out of the three (According to me), the story took a major backlash thanks to the ending.\n\nBut, while the ending in the third game is absolotely horrible i can tell you one thing; The journey is a good one.\n\nThe sad truth though is that if you want to play Mass Effect 3 you have to buy it elsewhere than on Steam...","December 28, 2010","true","152.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Above and beyond Mass Effect 1. Buy it if you enjoy science fiction and engrossing stories!\n\nYes, there's more action in Mass Effect's sequel, but with the better streamlined skill trees and in-combat control, it ties in very nicely with the overarching milieu's story and lore. And it's the story that really seals the deal here. The persistent characters, the evolution of your story and consequences from choices (arguably cosmetic, they still feel tangible to me),\n\nThey took everything that worked in Mass Effect 1, pared off what didn't, and made it better. It's extremely seldom that sequels are better than the originals, but Mass Effect proves exceptions do occur.\n\nNot to be left out and this isn't intended to TMI or unncessary but merely an endorsement -- this is the second game I've played (ME1 being the first) that allows for romances that I actually participated in and enjoyed.

Many new interesting NPCs in addition to recurring characters from the first game. The missions are more interesting than the previous series because the levels are better defined compared to ME 1 where the interior of any building looks very similar.There is wider selection of squad members so you can employ many different tactics according to a mission's need. The squad members also have unique personalities and history that they can share with you, given you spend some time to talk to them. The loyalty missions, squad members confrontation with each other and romance really adds flavour to the game. Squad members can die in the final mission (dubbed as the Suicide Mission) resulting from failing to secure their loyalty, not making ship upgardes or choosing non-ideal person for a task in the mission. This forces the player to carefully plan and prepares for the mission. The were so many different way the game progress and ends, even the main character may be killed in the suicide mission. This gives the game a very high replay value and the player did get a bonus to the character and resources should we choose start a new game after finishing one.\n\nOverall, Mass Effect 2 is a story rich game that continues the greatness of the first game. If you want to play the game, I suggest you finish ME1 first and carry forward your character into this game. Forget about wikis and walkthrough (except when you completely stuck of course) and just follow your heart and be yourself when making decision throughout the game and you will find out the Commander Shepard you're playing really reflects the person you are (Paragon and Renegade choices). You always can play it again later if you want to experience another options that you missed before, or choosing different character to romance or whatever different options the game can offer. But remember, the outcome of the decisions can be carried to Mass Effect 3.

The most important advise is, Play the original one before Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3. or in the other hand, you'll be getting a deep confusing combiner in a very unlimited rich story like this. The whole franchise requires a great attention for every single moment for not suffering from the story. Known as, "Complicated". Try not to be only an observer, try to figure out/question yourself to retrieve the lost given information that you've forgotten them lately same try to do with indications feels like "valuable" for the storytelling hint yourself alot by "Why". try to have "faith"(I understand WTF but...). Mass Effect story explanation can be explained through asking yourself "Why", "How" and "What".

It's adapted to appeal to a wide audience of gamers while still bringing the charm of Bioware's old-school RPGs. While Mass Effect 1 (in my opinion) feels like it could have been more if the studio had more time or budget to fully develop the different worlds which could be explored, Mass Effect 2 feels complete and gives the player satisfaction in the limits of the game. Mass Effect 2 marks an important transition of Bioware from KOTOR-esque DnD storytelling (which brought Bioware to the living room) to the new era of cinematic gameplay which can be enjoyed by anyone.\n\nTL;DR: This is the game EA wanted when they bought Bioware.","November 25, 2013","true","38.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

A Suicide Mission.\n\nWhilst Mass Effect 1 had you travel through civilized communities throughout the galaxy, Mass Effect 2 takes you into its dark underbelly, where crime, slave trade, corruption, mercenaries and drug trafficking run rampant and freely with no ill will on the criminals part. This gives the galaxy a more intimidating feel as you travel to recruit many of the Soldiers, Scientists and Mercenaries that will assist you throughout the game.\n\nOf course, recruiting people for a Suicide Mission isn't as easy as it may sound, Missions in this game are nicely structured and area enviroments give each mission a differant feel, what makes the missions so fun is the revamped combat system and classes, combat feels satisfying, reliable and fun and the differant player classes are reason enough to replay the game, Soldiers and Vanguards are seriously a blast to play with.\n\nEverything you do in the game is building up to the Final Mission, throughout the game a sense of foreboding looms around you as you get one step closer to passing through the Omega 4 Relay, in which everyone on your ship may not return from, as your decisions throughout the game will have impact upon Suicide Mission.\n\nA highlight of this game is that each crew member has their own loyality mission, your crewmate will ask for your assistance to help resolve a past, or present issue, allowing you to bond with said crewmate and learn what makes them who they are and how they tick, the assasin character is more than just an ruthless killer, the scientist is more than just a book worm.\n\nDLC is also some of the best I have ever seen in a game, the Cerberus Network houses free Downloadable mission packs and even some bonus weapons, there are some priced DLC but all is worth picking up, if you can only choose one, Lair of the Shadow Broker.\n\nAll the praising I give this game, there are only 4 issues I have with it.\n\nWeapon selection feels very limiting, alot of the customisation was removed, streamlining the experiance for better or worse, without DLC packs, you have pretty much 2 choices for each gun type (Save for 5 heavy weapon choices) with a powerful version you can obtain later on in the game.\nAlthough extremely rare, it is possible to get stuck in the enviroment, but this does not happen often enough to ruin or tarnish the experiance.\nWhere Mass Effect 1 was fair in its Renegade and Paragon options, this game might as well force you to be one or the other, as I don't see this much as a spoiler, but I would say it is mandatory to be pure hero, or pure badass.\n\nThe last point I can make a paragraph about:\n\nDo I recommend this to those that haven't played the first game?\nNo. Alot of the revelations that will occur in the game will not go over strongly with you if you havent played the first in the series, I would strongly recommend that even with Mass Effect 1s problems, you push through it, as your decisions in the first game will be carried over into Mass Effect 2, making the story feel so much more personal to you and you alone.\n\nWith all that said, Mass Effect 2 is an astonishing achievement, Winning over 90 awards and Game of the year 2010, It's graphics still impress me making the aliens and the galaxy around you feel so alive and real, The soundtrack is superb with special mention going to Suicide Missions theme itself, it's fast, fun combat with class based powers is vastly entertaining and story grips me each and every playthrough, if Mass Effect 2 isn't my favourite game of all time, it's Top 3 for sure.\n\nThey say it's a suicide mission, you should prove them wrong.","April 3, 2014","true","277.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ArmoredWhales/recommended/24980/","ArmoredWhales","F I R E ♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ArmoredWhales/","172 products in account","WOW!\n\nStory:\nLet me start off by saying that this was the first Mass Effect I've ever played(Yes, I regret not buying ME1), it was simply beautiful in so many ways! I've seen other reviews for this game, and I gotta say - It actually is completely story-driven. Sure, there is gameplay, but mostly cutscenes, and that was suited well for this game. The optional character progression in "Loyalty Missions" provide extra play time, getting to know the people you recruit, gaining their trust & their respect. All in all, the story takes turns & provides new enemies to come in contact with.\n\nSoundtrack:\nI love the electric-orchestral vibes Mass Effect 2 brings to the table with its soundtrack! Every soundtrack definitely fits the mood for what's happening in that current situation, truth be told. The sound of electric synths with bashing drums really gets you in the mood for destroying those damn Reapers!\n\nCharacters:\nI absolutelyLOVE each character that you recruit/meet. I couldn't seem to find a flaw in any of them, each character is written so well!\n\n1.Mordin\nThe smarty pants of the crew, very cute as well, he learns mostly about each species he's around. As you continue through the story, he will help you with Armor, Weaponry, and squad upgrades - as well as your enemies information. Mastered in Biotics/Support.\n\n2.Garrus:\nLet's start off by saying that I do know Garrus was in Mass Effect 1, and meeting him in Mass Effect 2 was a huge suprise for the players. Anyways, he's pretty much the badass good-guy of the group. Caring, understandable, and pretty much down to earth savior! Mastered in Snipering.\n\n3.Miranda:\nMy second favorite squad mate in this game, really really interesting, as well as her accent! Her excellent shot & biotic powers are damn good. Cerberus Officer for the win! Mastered in Leadership/Biotics.\n\n4.Thane:\nQuiet & swift, like the night, he prays before he takes the kill & afterwards as he lays down his enemies body. Thane is truly a poetic character, the vibes that come from his life makes you think how much will power you'd need in order to survive such events as he did. Mastered in Support/Snipering.\n\n4.Grunt:\nBrutal & large, this huge Krogan has a taste for violence & bloodlust. He joins Commander Shepard to satisfy his love for violence & to redeem himself as a true Krogan! Mastered in Fighting/Battle.\n\n5.Legion:\nHowever you firstly see it as an enemy, t provides very useful information to help stop the Collectors from defeating Humanity. Just becareful what it does around Tali, you must have high enough Paragon/Renegade to have successful cooperation between the two. Mastered in Hacking/Engineering.\n\n6.Tali:\nSuch a sweetheart, very religious & royal. Tali is a long time friend from Mass Effect 1, as you meet her early on in Mass Effect 2, she will state that she cannot help you at that very moment. Later in the story, you must work together to fight the Collectors. Mastered in Engineering.\n\n7.Jack:\nSeen as a huge threat to the squad at first, but gradually they get used to her. Jack's attitude rides from stealing, killing for fun, to fighting with Commander Shepard. Dark past with this character, very saddening. Becareful how she re-acts to Miranda, you must have high enough Paragon/Renegade to have successful cooperation between the two. Mastered in Major Biotics.\n\n8.Jacob:\n"I'm good Shepard, ready for anything, if we win, we'll get loud, spill some drinks on the Citadel!" Ah, I love Jacob. He's my favorite squad mate, truth be told. Some people dislike him for his doubtful attitude, but I've seen through that, and if you get his loyalty, he's pretty much your best friend in Mass Effect 2! Mastered in Leadership/Support.\n\nVoice Acting:\nThe VAing for Mass Effect 2 is pretty awesome, I noticed some familiar voices from other video games, which was a great suprise, honestly. The only complaint I have about the VAing is that sometimes the voice does-not match the character's facial expression. But I assume that's an engine problem, not a big deal.\n\nConclusion:\nI gotta say, this was an amazing experience, definitely pulls on your heart strings as well!\n(EDIT), Woopsie, forgot Samara. She's a very useful & royal biotic trained killer!\n\n10/10. ♥","December 14, 2014","true","70.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

They have personal stories and views to share, rather than exposition. A lot more character development happens, and the romances are more satisfying.\n\n-The movement and combat are much smoother.\n\n-There is more variation between the classes, making each one feel truly unique.\n\n-The weapons are varied, having different firing types and ranges, rather than just different stats in Mass Effect.\n\nNot-Pros:\n-The story seems to veer away from where the first game was heading. It’s still neat, but ultimately you’ll care more about the personal missions of your squad rather than the main campaign.\n\n-You need to purchase a large amount of DLC to really get the full game, especially if you want to continue to Mass Effect 3.\n\n-Thermal clips. In the first game, weapons heated up when fired, and you had to let them cool down. In this game, that mechanic has been replaced by thermal clips, which function similar to magazine in other shooters. This limits the “ammo” you have for your weapons. The old system was more fun, and made more sense from an in-universe perspective.","December 29, 2014","true","460.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The characters have depth, the graphics are amazing, and the story engulfs you.  Importing your player and their decisions from the first Mass Effect really helps you connect with the characters and their choices.  I felt a loyalty to my crew that I haven't felt since Cortana in the first 3 Halos, yet I am even more attached to these characters!  I haven't felt this emotionally moved since watching Doms tragic tale from the Gears of War series.  This game is a masterpiece.\n\nPro: Immersive story (take the best story you've ever heard/read and coat it in gold, dip it in diamond, and slap your arch\nnemesis with it).\nLots of side missions to keep you busy (not too many that it gets boring).\nFantastic character development.\nYour choices actually make a difference in character's lives (you will literally make life or death decisions).\n\nCon: Changing of the skill point tree (less options).\nAmmo is now required (spent a lot of time making sure I had picked up all the ammo I could).\nRemoval of loot (although the weapons they give you almost makes up for this).","December 4, 2013","true","33.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

Mass Effect 2 improves upon the gameplay from the first game and further expands the narrative of the Mass Effect universe. No longer is exploration or managing equipment a tedious task. Instead the focus of Mass Effect 2 purely lies in the story that continously builds up to Cmdr. Shepard's "Final Mission." The gameplay still revolves around shoot 'n cover tactics, but the game's enhancements allow you to direct your squad making it more of a tactical third-person shooter than just a standard RPG. The story, gameplay, characters, graphics, locations, etc. make Mass Effect 2 THE GREATEST game I have ever played. Mass Effect 2 features several DLC packs that are available at Bioware's SocialNetwork and are well worth the investment for the full experience. Should be noted that Mass Effect 2 won the Golden Joystick's "Ultimate Game of the Year Award."","November 27, 2010","true","63.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I personally am still on the fence about the changes to combat.\n\nBut its quicker, more actionny than ever. Also you can only use one power at once since other powers will be put on cooldown once you activate a power (In the first game you could maybe use 8 powers at once but had maybe a minuter cooldown).\n\nThe question is though, is it fun? Oh hell yes, the combat is fun. It also makes it more interesting trying other classes and trying out different choices in the first game in order to see what will change in the second game.\n\nStorytime eh? Yeah yeah.\nThis time Shepard will be summoned by the corporation "Cerberus" and is tasked to find out why an alien race called the "Collectors" are kidnapping humans, so its up to you to find a new crew on you voyage amongst the stars and find out the grim truth about the kidnapping of humans...\n\nOne thing is sure; this game is more grim than the first and third game. No dance on flowers here.\n\nWhile the story to me is not good as the first but the interactions with the crew and characters keeps this game going. They also cut out the unnecessarily exploration bits (Love it or hate it) and major loot collecting has been removed entirely (Although you can do some cool research/upgrades in your lab).\n\n**And yes,i need to put this into here; Mass Effect 3 mini-review!**\nMass Effect 3 is the last game in the Mass Effect Trilogy. While the combat was the best out of the three (According to me), the story took a major backlash thanks to the ending.\n\nBut, while the ending in the third game is absolotely horrible i can tell you one thing; The journey is a good one.\n\nThe sad truth though is that if you want to play Mass Effect 3 you have to buy it elsewhere than on Steam...","December 28, 2010","true","152.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Refer to my previous recommendation for Mass Effect 1 for general thoughts on the series (short version: get it). Continuing on that, Mass Effect 2 takes everything that was great about ME1 and makes it better, and at the same time completely fixes everything that was wrong. It's the perfect sequel. The only slight misstep in ME2 is the tedious planet mining mechanic. But aside from that, I really have no complaints about this game at all. It's an absolute must-play if you have any interest in the upcoming ME3. One of the coolest aspects of the series is that all of the choices you made in ME1 carry through to ME2, and will further carry through to ME3... and there are many choices to be made. It becomes a very personalized game. I should also mention that there are a number of DLC missions available as well, which are worth checking out (especially the last one). And with that, I shall say no more, as this is a game that must be played, not written about.","October 24, 2011","true","67.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

While this game does add a lot of things like more exploitable cities, more companions, and a much bigger ship. They also removed some content as well like exploring uncharted worlds with the M35 Mako, the 60 level cap, a lot of talents, and worse of all the ability to talk to your companions at any time.\nThis game does have some pros like the story is still good and the companions are well written and voice acted. The gamEplay is still the same as the prequel but now their is ammo and weapon restrictions. The cons are mostly all the things that Bioware removed from Mass Effect but a big one is that this game is far more linear than ME1. Now you can recruit any companions that you want and you have to wait for specific points to recruit your favorite companions. From all the negitives that I listed you are probably wondering why I am still recommending this game. Well while this game is not as great as Mass Effect it is still a good game and I recommend playing it.","April 12","true","71.2"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","0"

You definitely get to be deeply attached to the characters in the game, and know their background story. The soundtracks, the missions, the stories, the lore... Everything is just amazing.

I have more like 60 hours as the internet went out for a while as oppossed to the 40+ that is shown.  I have played through the game 2 times once (and most recently) as a male Shepard and another as a female Shepard.  Copnstructive critism is wlcome as well as advice because I plan to review some of the other games I have.  So please, enjoy.\n\nDisputably, this is the superior game in the Mass Effect Series.  Personally I hold this opinion, but do NOT just buy this game.  In order to get totally immersed in the story and develop connections to the characters, purchase the original Mass Effect and possibly Mass Effect 3 (but use Origin at your own peril).\n\nThe story itself is extremely engaging.  Traveling the galaxy and assembling a suicide squad is interesting as each character is found in different places and missions associated with the character's loyalty to you are also unique.  I never once came across a moment when I thought "I've seen this before".  While enemies are mild repeats (you will be fighting armored aliens, sheilded ones, boss ones, and various types of mechs), the NPCs are always very interesting even if they are flat.\n\nThe role-playing aspects of the game are handled well.  When starting the game, you can choose between 6 different types of combat styles which range from being a pure biotic (using magic), an infiltrator (turning invisible), and being a soldier (regular combat grunt/bad***).  Each of those classes have 5 upgradable abilities that either give you interesting ammo mods or special attacks like slamming a person to the ground or turning invisible for a short time.  On top of that once you chose your character class, you can select another special ability from a list.  Every time you level up, you recieve one point for spending it on abilities.  Initially, all of them cost 1 point and once they are upgraded, they incriment (go up) by 1.  At the end of the skill bar for each skill you can chose a significant bonus ability.  For an ammo mod, this could be giving yourself an upgraded form of it or allowing your entire squad to partake in it.  The latter thing I find most useful because I tend to hang back and pick off enemies from range and let my squand soak up most of the enemy fire.\n\nSpeaking of combat, I love this 3rd-person style.  It leans heavily on cover and utilizing the abilities of your allies.  You can direct your 2 squad members simply pressing a key (one per member).  To use your abilities and your squad member's, you hold down a button and select the ones you wish to use.  Your team can deploy at most 3 separate abilities (one per person).  Aside from that, regular combat with guns is point, aim, shoot.  You can hold a maximum of 6 guns, however this depends on which class you pick in the beginning.  The adept class doesn't even carry weapons while the soldier can hold all 6.  You can have a sniper rifle, assult rifle, shotgun, speical weapon (missile launcher,mini-nuke launcher, etc), pistol, and submachine gun.  Acquring of these weapons range from finding them in levels, recieving them, and making them. There is melee combat, but it is rather sloppy.  If you were to use it (which I don't) you leave yourself open to enemy fire which will destory you if you aren't in cover even on the easiest difficulty.  The enemy A.I. is capable of flanking, putting down suppressive fire, and charging indescriminantly, so it always keeps you on your toes.  Sometimes the enemies get stuck behind obstacles, but the pathing for them are solid.  They use cover and can go through your suad members quickly.\n\nThe graphics are exceptional even for a game from 2010.  The textures are good, but in combat it really shines.  The laser beams, mass-effect bullets, and ammo mods are a sight to behold when they are flying everywhere.  The sounds are also good.  The soundtrack is also pretty good.\n\nThe place where this game falls short is the map system.  Like from the previous game, you travel across the galaxy using Mass Relays.  That is carrried over, but the actual physical exploration of planets and moons from the previous installment is scraped in favor of a mining minigame which is tedious to do for an extended period of time.  It is also worthwhile though as the resources you get from mining is used for upgrades which are found in the course of missions and from purchashing them.\n\nThe upgrades are rather significant improvements which range from increased damage to reduced cooldowns to even additional equipment for the ship.  I highly recommend consulting your team for ship upgrades because they will make the difference between life and death in the late game.  Some do cost a lot of stuff, so you will get aquainted with the mining monstrosity.\n\nHowever, this is overshadowed by the characters you interact with.  While I briefly went over this in the beginning, I feel I must describe how great it is.  Every character on your ship have a story, opinions, and remarks about your progress.  And yes, the infamous romance options are back and "better" than ever.  I will let you explore them to see for yourself because I have not explored them yet.\n\nThe lore is wonderfully explained to you through the codex, accessable via the pause menu.  As you interact with more things, the condex articles explain everything.\n\nOverall, I give this game a 9 out of 10.  The strong character customization/upgrading system teamed with the strong graphics, good teamwork elements, and the immaculate NPC collection are what make this game a must-own for Sci-Fi fans.   If you are bored by generic first-person shooters and want a more engaging combat system, this is a good game to look into.\n\nI know that there is a multiplayer to the game as well, but I have not exlpored it.  I would suggest skipping it.  To me, this is a single-player experience through and through.\n\nSo long and good luck.","August 14, 2014","true","54.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Huge respect for Bioware/EA for creating a Universe this rich, immersing and believable. But as with nearly all Bioware games, characters and writing from heaven meet mediocre at best gameplay, so if you're looking for an interesting gameplay experience, you're dead wrong here. This is a typical cover-based third person shooter and nothing else. But the stories it has to tell are so great that I've replayed this game over and over again and can call it my favorite game ever. Buy this game.\n\nNow I will ramble a bit about the story. While I try to keep it spoiler free, you should skip this part, if you want to start this game absolutely blind.\n\nCommander Shepard, the player-created main character from the first installment of the series, ends up working together with Cerberus, a pro-human organisation that often crosses the lines of morality to achieve what it regards as good, to stop the abduction of human colonists by a mysterious alien race called the Collectors. The games theme is darker and grittier compared to Mass Effect 1, and you're really free to handle any situation the way you want. And while you can't part from your boss, it's your choice to become a good guy or giving in to your dark side and getting the job done no matter the costs. Both sides of Shepard are so well written that he/she is easily one of the best video game characters ever.\n\nYour Party members are even better than the already very well written one from the first. And while some characters don't seem very interesting/likeable at first, digging further through their pasts unveils deep, twisted at times, personalities that bleed quality. Also they have different views and opinions about you, your employer and the mission. While some are fanatically loyal to Cerberus, others hate the organisation with the heart and soul, which leads to interesting conflicts.\n\nI'm sure you've heard about the train wreck ending of Mass Effect 3, even if you have no interest in the franchise. Well, the ending of Mass Effect 2 is absolutely fantastic. Doing side missions and upgrading your vessel really has an impact on   the outcome of the final battle, which is something great. And the way it was presented to us is so good, my jaw literally fell to the floor when I first played it.\n\nSPOILER END\n\nFrom the technical side, the graphics have massivly improved compared to the washed out, low-detail textures of the first game, although the overall texture resolution is really bad from time to time. The art style of the game is great and easily as memorable and immersive as Star Wars or other behemoths like that. And the fact that Bioware created a Universe that can rival franchises that feature books, movies, comics and more over three decades, just for a video game franchise is simply amazing.\n\nSo buy this game if you're interested in a amazing story with the option of choice and rich, memorable characters, if you can stand yet another stereotypical third person shooter.","December 15, 2014","true","294.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

For context reasons, I always recommend playing the trilogy in its chronological order though. Despite that I find the game excellent, there's a few points I need to criticise:\n- Squadmates. There's a lot of possible squadmates. My problem with them is not that they are hallow, barely fleshed out characters (none of them are, really), but the number is just too impractical. You never get to choose all of them often enough because you can always just choose two at once.\n- Gun variety. While the first title technically had lots of different guns (although they handled all pretty much the same), the amount of different weapons in ME2 is very limited and therefore fairly disappointing. You know there's a lack of content if you end up using the same pistol endgame that you had at the beginning.\n- The amount of DLCs and their price. Most of the DLCs are solid story additions and a must-have for anyone who wishes to experience the ME universe to its full extent. They are, however, pricey and numerous, and while I bought most of them legally for ME2, I went for.. less conventional ways in the 3rd title simply because I cannot support this 'DLC fad' of the last years (1st day DLCs are the pinnacle of intentional content restriction in order to milk more money from customers, I'm looking at you, EA)\n\n9/10.","July 8, 2014","true","57.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you liked the first one, you will love this. There are reoccurring characters from the first game and the ability to import your ME1 character, along with all the decisions (and consequences).

The storyline, voice acting, visuals, and the 3rd-person combat system with a sci-fi twist work flawlessly. It is a masterpiece of our generation, to say the least.\n\nIn this sci-fi action RPG the player takes on the role of Commander Shepard who must save the world once again, this time from mysterious beings called “The Collectors”. Before they destroy humanity, Shepard must travel the universe and recruit a team of humans and aliens, gain their loyalty, research the enemy, and stop the Collectors at all cost.\n\nIn many ways Mass Effect 2 embodies what Bioware is all about. Players will appreciate not only the top quality storyline and voice acting -- Martin Sheen steals the show -- but also the lengths Bioware went to listen to their fans and improve on the flaws of the previous game. One example of such improvement is the switch from the cool-down weapons to the traditional magazine-reload weapons. While many developers would have kept their old “innovative” system, due to either pride or laziness, Bioware went the extra mile to make the changes -- and it paid off. Other changes such as simpler weapon customization and tighter combat controls make for a more satisfying experience overall compared to its predecessor. The save file from the previous game carries over as well, which is another welcome trademark of Bioware.\n\nThe presentation of the game is flawless. Including everything from visuals, audio, and writing, Mass Effect 2 does not fail in the “epic experience” department, the most impressive aspect being the characters themselves. Bioware has taken the time to create such compelling characters that I had no choice but to care about every single one of them. The universe of Mass Effect 2 is deep, thoughtfully-crafted, and engaging, just like its predecessor, which is full of codex entries that pull the players deeper still into the futuristic world. Add to it the attention to detail such as the great soundtrack and the subtle biblical references throughout the game and you get yourself an unforgettable experience.\n\nThe 3rd-person combat is very satisfying as well. Not only is the gunplay improved compared to the previous game, but the use of special skills has tightened up as well, giving much more incentive for the player to try out classes other than the gun expert Soldier class (being an Adept with telekinetic powers is incredibly satisfying, not to mention all the other classes).\n\nIronically, the weak point of this game is also its selling point -- the morality system. Yes, it does have a morality system that very much controls the tone of the playthrough; but it lacks the complexity and the ambiguity that makes such systems… well… so delicious (Dragon Age, a Bioware game with such deliciousness, comes to mind). The player’s choices are always presented in a very clear manner that just boils them down to “good” or “bad” in the end. In my first playthrough I was interested in what Sheperd would do in a given situation but after a while I found myself just clicking the “good” option (as I was playing the “good” character) without even reading the actual response, which made me much less appreciative of the morality system. Other weak points include the sub-par vehicular DLC “Firewalker Pack” and the shallow and two-dimensional “romance” system.\n\nMass Effect 2 is one of the few games in which I began a second playthrough immediately after the first one. It is a game I’ll revisit at least once a year, like a classic book that gets better each time you read it. Is it the morality system that changes the tone of the game? Is it the compelling characters that I can’t keep away from? Maybe it is the engaging combat with multiple classes to choose from. Or maybe it is just the sheer polish of the script and voice acting. Whatever it is, there is no denying that Mass Effect 2 is something special. Even if you are not a sci-fi fan, even if you are not an RPG fan, or even if you are not a third person shooter fan, it would be a damn shame if I didn’t recommend this game with all my heart.","July 3, 2014","true","240.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Alright, alright. The combat basically plays like a cover shooter and the RPG elements are severely lacking. But, buuuuut. If you like story driven immersive games then you will love Mass Effect 2. You don't need to have played the first Mass Effect because most of the lore is transferred through dialogue and codex entrees so you'll be just fine, but if you have played Mass Effect 1 you will feel alot more connected to the world and to Shepard's companions. On the point of companions, the characters in this game are just great, they are excellently voice acted and by the end, hell by the middle of the game you'll feel genuinely connected to your companions. The choices made throughout this game kind of matters in the game but if you play the whole trilogy from the first Mass Effect then you'll see the real effect of your choices on the galaxy.

There is a character for everyone, whether it be a crazy psycopath littered with tattoos, or a reformed avenger (among others). Action is more heavily worked on, and makes it feel better compared to the first game. Conversations have been improved on, and interventions from Shepard can take place in most situations, whether you want to push a guy off from a high building, or give him a chance to give you some answers.

Let me just start by saying that when I first tried it, I disliked it. I started it directly after the original Mass Effect and I noticed several changes. The RPG-ish system from the first Mass Effect game changed a lot. The game is more shooter-like, the inventory doesn't exist anymore, you suddenly need "ammo". All these changes made me very bitter about this game. But I continued playing and soon began to get used to this system, maybe even prefer it. You don't have to freak out every time you're nearing the item limit for your inventory like in the original ME. The combat is more intuitive and requires less franctic running around. The ammo thing, you can get used to it, at least the weapons don't overheat anymore. The only downside I found was the overly simplified skill system. Not bad, but I preferred the original one.\n\nStory-wise, the game is superb. Not because of the main plot (which is also quite good), but because of the characters. I rarely find any games that include characters this life-like and believable, with great voice acting and consistent character. The customization options for your character (Commander Shepard) are also very good, no complaints there. Music is also very well-done, atmospheric and memorable.\n\nThere is only one thing I dislike very much about this game - the DLC system. Unfortunately, you can't buy the DLC here so you have to use Origin. And the DLCs are quite expensive and essential for the story.\n\nTo conclude - buy this. I don't think there is any other game on Steam I would recommend this much. For 20 Euros, you will get a memorable space adventure with rich story and characters and a great gameplay and music.","September 6, 2014","true","75.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Amazing. This game deserves it all. One of the best purchases that I have ever made on steam. I would lie if I said this is not my favorite RPG game of all time. EVERYTHING is up to the player. Who lives, who dies, what happens, how you play, how you approach a situation, how to fix it? (Or not fix it because you decide to be a ruthless a**hole) it's totally up to you! What I like most about this game is that you don't choose only the small stuff, no. You get to change the entire storyline. You definitely get to be deeply attached to the characters in the game, and know their background story. The soundtracks, the missions, the stories, the lore... Everything is just amazing. Each choice you make will have reprecussions, and this time, I mean it. Even in the sequel! The choices you make in the game WILL have a very huge impact on your gameplay in ME3, so choose wisely!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arakangara/recommended/24980/","arakangara","Arakanga.Ra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arakangara/","583 products in account","I've been thinking what to write about this game for a while. Let me just start by saying that when I first tried it, I disliked it. I started it directly after the original Mass Effect and I noticed several changes. The RPG-ish system from the first Mass Effect game changed a lot. The game is more shooter-like, the inventory doesn't exist anymore, you suddenly need "ammo". All these changes made me very bitter about this game. But I continued playing and soon began to get used to this system, maybe even prefer it. You don't have to freak out every time you're nearing the item limit for your inventory like in the original ME. The combat is more intuitive and requires less franctic running around. The ammo thing, you can get used to it, at least the weapons don't overheat anymore. The only downside I found was the overly simplified skill system. Not bad, but I preferred the original one.\n\nStory-wise, the game is superb. Not because of the main plot (which is also quite good), but because of the characters. I rarely find any games that include characters this life-like and believable, with great voice acting and consistent character. The customization options for your character (Commander Shepard) are also very good, no complaints there. Music is also very well-done, atmospheric and memorable.\n\nThere is only one thing I dislike very much about this game - the DLC system. Unfortunately, you can't buy the DLC here so you have to use Origin. And the DLCs are quite expensive and essential for the story.\n\nTo conclude - buy this. I don't think there is any other game on Steam I would recommend this much. For 20 Euros, you will get a memorable space adventure with rich story and characters and a great gameplay and music.","September 6, 2014","true","75.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

For context reasons, I always recommend playing the trilogy in its chronological order though. Despite that I find the game excellent, there's a few points I need to criticise:\n- Squadmates. There's a lot of possible squadmates. My problem with them is not that they are hallow, barely fleshed out characters (none of them are, really), but the number is just too impractical. You never get to choose all of them often enough because you can always just choose two at once.\n- Gun variety. While the first title technically had lots of different guns (although they handled all pretty much the same), the amount of different weapons in ME2 is very limited and therefore fairly disappointing. You know there's a lack of content if you end up using the same pistol endgame that you had at the beginning.\n- The amount of DLCs and their price. Most of the DLCs are solid story additions and a must-have for anyone who wishes to experience the ME universe to its full extent. They are, however, pricey and numerous, and while I bought most of them legally for ME2, I went for.. less conventional ways in the 3rd title simply because I cannot support this 'DLC fad' of the last years (1st day DLCs are the pinnacle of intentional content restriction in order to milk more money from customers, I'm looking at you, EA)\n\n9/10.","July 8, 2014","true","57.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you liked the first one, you will love this. There are reoccurring characters from the first game and the ability to import your ME1 character, along with all the decisions (and consequences). A really nice touch.\n\nMy only (minor) gripes is that the inventory and level-up system seems even further dumbed down compared to the first one. A definate con for those of you that like customisation in their RPGs. The galaxy map is also a little silly (and pointless). These however, are nit-picking an otherwise superb game - a game that it probably on my top 10 games of all time. Everyone should play it.

The storyline, voice acting, visuals, and the 3rd-person combat system with a sci-fi twist work flawlessly. It is a masterpiece of our generation, to say the least.\n\nIn this sci-fi action RPG the player takes on the role of Commander Shepard who must save the world once again, this time from mysterious beings called “The Collectors”. Before they destroy humanity, Shepard must travel the universe and recruit a team of humans and aliens, gain their loyalty, research the enemy, and stop the Collectors at all cost.\n\nIn many ways Mass Effect 2 embodies what Bioware is all about. Players will appreciate not only the top quality storyline and voice acting -- Martin Sheen steals the show -- but also the lengths Bioware went to listen to their fans and improve on the flaws of the previous game. One example of such improvement is the switch from the cool-down weapons to the traditional magazine-reload weapons. While many developers would have kept their old “innovative” system, due to either pride or laziness, Bioware went the extra mile to make the changes -- and it paid off. Other changes such as simpler weapon customization and tighter combat controls make for a more satisfying experience overall compared to its predecessor. The save file from the previous game carries over as well, which is another welcome trademark of Bioware.\n\nThe presentation of the game is flawless. Including everything from visuals, audio, and writing, Mass Effect 2 does not fail in the “epic experience” department, the most impressive aspect being the characters themselves. Bioware has taken the time to create such compelling characters that I had no choice but to care about every single one of them. The universe of Mass Effect 2 is deep, thoughtfully-crafted, and engaging, just like its predecessor, which is full of codex entries that pull the players deeper still into the futuristic world. Add to it the attention to detail such as the great soundtrack and the subtle biblical references throughout the game and you get yourself an unforgettable experience.\n\nThe 3rd-person combat is very satisfying as well. Not only is the gunplay improved compared to the previous game, but the use of special skills has tightened up as well, giving much more incentive for the player to try out classes other than the gun expert Soldier class (being an Adept with telekinetic powers is incredibly satisfying, not to mention all the other classes).\n\nIronically, the weak point of this game is also its selling point -- the morality system. Yes, it does have a morality system that very much controls the tone of the playthrough; but it lacks the complexity and the ambiguity that makes such systems… well… so delicious (Dragon Age, a Bioware game with such deliciousness, comes to mind). The player’s choices are always presented in a very clear manner that just boils them down to “good” or “bad” in the end. In my first playthrough I was interested in what Sheperd would do in a given situation but after a while I found myself just clicking the “good” option (as I was playing the “good” character) without even reading the actual response, which made me much less appreciative of the morality system. Other weak points include the sub-par vehicular DLC “Firewalker Pack” and the shallow and two-dimensional “romance” system.\n\nMass Effect 2 is one of the few games in which I began a second playthrough immediately after the first one. It is a game I’ll revisit at least once a year, like a classic book that gets better each time you read it. Is it the morality system that changes the tone of the game? Is it the compelling characters that I can’t keep away from? Maybe it is the engaging combat with multiple classes to choose from. Or maybe it is just the sheer polish of the script and voice acting. Whatever it is, there is no denying that Mass Effect 2 is something special. Even if you are not a sci-fi fan, even if you are not an RPG fan, or even if you are not a third person shooter fan, it would be a damn shame if I didn’t recommend this game with all my heart.","July 3, 2014","true","240.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Cerberus is still fighting for humanity albeit in a twisted fashion. If anything, the Asari and other council nations represent the US and the west while the Alliance is a rising power like China. Cerberus is a terrorist group that wants human power but with an absolute disregard for anything that doesn't support their specific agenda (since they believe they are the best, fastest, and possibly only hope for humanity).","January 6, 2015","true","25.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

For context reasons, I always recommend playing the trilogy in its chronological order though. Despite that I find the game excellent, there's a few points I need to criticise:\n- Squadmates. There's a lot of possible squadmates. My problem with them is not that they are hallow, barely fleshed out characters (none of them are, really), but the number is just too impractical. You never get to choose all of them often enough because you can always just choose two at once.\n- Gun variety. While the first title technically had lots of different guns (although they handled all pretty much the same), the amount of different weapons in ME2 is very limited and therefore fairly disappointing. You know there's a lack of content if you end up using the same pistol endgame that you had at the beginning.\n- The amount of DLCs and their price. Most of the DLCs are solid story additions and a must-have for anyone who wishes to experience the ME universe to its full extent. They are, however, pricey and numerous, and while I bought most of them legally for ME2, I went for.. less conventional ways in the 3rd title simply because I cannot support this 'DLC fad' of the last years (1st day DLCs are the pinnacle of intentional content restriction in order to milk more money from customers, I'm looking at you, EA)\n\n9/10.","July 8, 2014","true","57.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you liked the first one, you will love this. There are reoccurring characters from the first game and the ability to import your ME1 character, along with all the decisions (and consequences). A really nice touch.\n\nMy only (minor) gripes is that the inventory and level-up system seems even further dumbed down compared to the first one. A definate con for those of you that like customisation in their RPGs. The galaxy map is also a little silly (and pointless). These however, are nit-picking an otherwise superb game - a game that it probably on my top 10 games of all time. Everyone should play it.

The storyline, voice acting, visuals, and the 3rd-person combat system with a sci-fi twist work flawlessly. It is a masterpiece of our generation, to say the least.\n\nIn this sci-fi action RPG the player takes on the role of Commander Shepard who must save the world once again, this time from mysterious beings called “The Collectors”. Before they destroy humanity, Shepard must travel the universe and recruit a team of humans and aliens, gain their loyalty, research the enemy, and stop the Collectors at all cost.\n\nIn many ways Mass Effect 2 embodies what Bioware is all about. Players will appreciate not only the top quality storyline and voice acting -- Martin Sheen steals the show -- but also the lengths Bioware went to listen to their fans and improve on the flaws of the previous game. One example of such improvement is the switch from the cool-down weapons to the traditional magazine-reload weapons. While many developers would have kept their old “innovative” system, due to either pride or laziness, Bioware went the extra mile to make the changes -- and it paid off. Other changes such as simpler weapon customization and tighter combat controls make for a more satisfying experience overall compared to its predecessor. The save file from the previous game carries over as well, which is another welcome trademark of Bioware.\n\nThe presentation of the game is flawless. Including everything from visuals, audio, and writing, Mass Effect 2 does not fail in the “epic experience” department, the most impressive aspect being the characters themselves. Bioware has taken the time to create such compelling characters that I had no choice but to care about every single one of them. The universe of Mass Effect 2 is deep, thoughtfully-crafted, and engaging, just like its predecessor, which is full of codex entries that pull the players deeper still into the futuristic world. Add to it the attention to detail such as the great soundtrack and the subtle biblical references throughout the game and you get yourself an unforgettable experience.\n\nThe 3rd-person combat is very satisfying as well. Not only is the gunplay improved compared to the previous game, but the use of special skills has tightened up as well, giving much more incentive for the player to try out classes other than the gun expert Soldier class (being an Adept with telekinetic powers is incredibly satisfying, not to mention all the other classes).\n\nIronically, the weak point of this game is also its selling point -- the morality system. Yes, it does have a morality system that very much controls the tone of the playthrough; but it lacks the complexity and the ambiguity that makes such systems… well… so delicious (Dragon Age, a Bioware game with such deliciousness, comes to mind). The player’s choices are always presented in a very clear manner that just boils them down to “good” or “bad” in the end. In my first playthrough I was interested in what Sheperd would do in a given situation but after a while I found myself just clicking the “good” option (as I was playing the “good” character) without even reading the actual response, which made me much less appreciative of the morality system. Other weak points include the sub-par vehicular DLC “Firewalker Pack” and the shallow and two-dimensional “romance” system.\n\nMass Effect 2 is one of the few games in which I began a second playthrough immediately after the first one. It is a game I’ll revisit at least once a year, like a classic book that gets better each time you read it. Is it the morality system that changes the tone of the game? Is it the compelling characters that I can’t keep away from? Maybe it is the engaging combat with multiple classes to choose from. Or maybe it is just the sheer polish of the script and voice acting. Whatever it is, there is no denying that Mass Effect 2 is something special. Even if you are not a sci-fi fan, even if you are not an RPG fan, or even if you are not a third person shooter fan, it would be a damn shame if I didn’t recommend this game with all my heart.","July 3, 2014","true","240.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

As you build your team, you stumble upon some very interesting people. The best aspect of the game was getting to know everybody between missions, hearing their stories, and delving deeper into the Mass Effect universe. Especially Garrus with all of his calibrations, which is everything he wants to talk about.  Then there’s the fact that you’re able to romance some of the crew members. I really felt like I was invested in and torn between some of them. Whether it was flirty Kelly, shy Tali, or (insert your description of) Miranda.\n-Loyalty and crew missions. One of the reasons why you do care about the crew is permadeath. In order to get all of the crew out alive, you have to go on some loyalty missions. As you get to know everybody, crewmembers will tell you that there’s some personal problem they would like solved. Loyalty missions were the best kind of side mission because they weren’t random things to do. There was a sense of purpose—gaining a more meaningful understanding of the crew. All of them played out like a good movie should, with everybody gaining some type of character growth and a solid resolution.\n-Combat is decent and can be challenging. While it reinvented the wheel, I wasn’t bored senseless. In fact, there were a few parts that I had a difficult challenge. This one part of saving Garrus took me at least ten or so tries. Mostly due to the fact that enemies will use cover effectively, (generally) work as a group, and at times actually attempt to flank you.\nMixed Bag:\n-Dumbing down of rpg elements. It really seemed like there was much less of a focus on weapon diversity and putting together your gear. While it doesn’t kill the game, it certainly does make it more confusing when you buy upgrades. The upgrades tell you that it will do XYZ% more damage, but there’s no indication of how much that would be.\n-Interiors seem a lot smaller. The Citadel is pathetically tiny compared to the original. And the same could be said of a lot of the places you visit. They felt small and often very linear. I really wanted to explore some of these places, but to no avail.\n-No Mako, scanning only. The Mako is totally gone, which also felt like exploration was severely curtailed, and has been replaced with scanning planets. While this may on paper sound like getting resources has been streamlined—it isn’t. I did have this Minecraft mentality of collecting everything everywhere, but It’s downright boring a tedious after the fifth or so planet that you’ve scanned in the same system. By the time that you’re done with scanning every planet you’ll have an astronomically huge collection of resources.\nOverall:\nMass Effect 2 is a masterpiece. There was not a lot of time that I felt like I was disengaged from the story or that I was bored doing ho-hum quests. The mythos of the universe, the strength of the characters, and the story is what elevates this game into what I consider to be near legendary. 9.5/10\n","December 21, 2013","true","34.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

It is masterful on every level - story, writing, scope, decision making, combat, environmental design, artwork, lighting effects, cinematography, musical score, sound design, and virtually any other area I can think of. It is, without exaggeration, that good.\n\n(mini spoiler) And the last mission - any team member you have come to know in the game can die a very permanent death based on your decisions, giving the finale a weight and consequence rarely experienced in video games. (end mini spoiler)\n\nWhat is perhaps most staggering is that even after a 50-hour playthrough (DLC included), you can be sure that you have seen far less than even half of the possibilities that the game has to offer. The original game isn't nearly as perfect, but still worth a run-through for the storyline and decisions that will carry over into the sequel.\n\nNo, the game is not without faults. For one thing, it's overly easy and overly simplified compared to the original.\n\nIt doesn't have the same level of cinematic polish that we've come to expect from AAA titles in 2013 and beyond.\n\nIt gets excessively talkative and stale in certain areas.\n\nMuch like the previous game, the romance subplots are stupid. If you want your Commander Shepard to get some quick and casual sex, it's not gonna happen. It's deep love or nothing. And that deep love comes out of nowhere, since your intimate conversations with any given love interest are extremely limited.\n\nBut by far the worst of Mass Effect 2's problems is the very time-consuming process of grinding for resources, which isn't any fun at all. There are nearly endless amounts of resources available, but the game doesn't tell you how many you need. While there are ship upgrades available later in the game to make these processes quicker, the game doesn't tell you about them, and so you may waste much time in the first half grinding before acquiring them. My advice: grind at a minimum until you get the upgrades, and then only focus on "rich" planets, since there are more than enough to get you through.\n\n(Issues)\nI want to mention a few minor issues that you might run into. I frequently clipped through objects and got stuck, forcing a reload, and there are a few missions tied to DLC that resulted in game-breaking crashes. The latter problem was easily rectified by creating a shortcut to the .exe and putting -nomoviestartup in the parameters. One last very strange glitch resulted in my player character stretching her arms out to the sides, unable to shoot or interact anymore, solved only by reloading an earlier save and trying different dialogue choices before the bug. With a game this big, my recommendation is to keep numerous save files and save often.\n\nOverall, Mass Effect 2 is definitely one of my favorite games of 2010, matched only by Red Dead Redemption. In my book, that's saying a lot.\n\n\n9/10","January 16, 2014","true","52.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

UI and combat functions were so much easier in ME1. What is this bull about needing fuel and ammo? Not having ammo was the best part of ME1. Why would you take that away from me.\n\ntbh it's still about as fun as ME1 and the story parts are just as good (I can't believe I went for the straight romance on my first full playthrough though I am a horrible person) but they have added enough new and extremely obnoxious features that they are somewhat detrimental to my enjoyment of the series. idk maybe I'll be able to ignore them once I get farther in, but still. edit: yeah i was def able to ignore them and now i miss them.\n\nwhy ammo. I hate having to find ammo. And trying to figure out weapons upgrades is ridiculous. What did you do to my galaxy map. wtf is this hacking things now *taps on keyboard* im in. and the medi-gel thing too (although I am actually okay with how they changed the health meter and stuff, it's more Halo-y). WHY AMMO.\n\nupd8 to this review: I feel like I'm playing DnD, but I didn't get to roll the character. This new character was based on my old one, but I'm now sorta Chaotic Good at best instead of Lawful Good, and my DM is an over controlling **** who specifically designs the campaign to not let me switch ever, driving away all my old loved ones because I am forced to work for the bad guys I was specifically investigating on the side for their illegal experiments and xenophobia, none of which I am about. AND xe's making me scavenge for ammo. What the heck.\n\nupd8 to my upd8: having beaten the game, the stupid ammo thing gets less annoying over time, but it's still annoying and I don't like it. However, I freaking love that sniper rifle I call 'er Vera. It makes up for it. The Chaotic Good thing also still stands and why is there not an option for me to punch the **** out of the Smoking M- I mean the Illusive Man?\n\nupd8 many months later: yeaaaaah so I'm replaying ME1 now and. There are some things I definitely don't miss in ME2. So my first opinion is now incorrect.","December 26, 2014","true","74.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I really enjoyed the time playing it and getting to know the characters, the story took me in the most from all three games. I can't imagine playing the game without finishing the first part. It's a bit more action oriented game than the first one but that's definitely a plus. Sometimes it gets a bit repetetive after a while, especially with the side missions, but hey - which game doesn't these days. But once you attach to the characters and the storyline, the gameplay itself goes kinda sideways and I still mean that's a good thing and you focus on the progress of the story and the crew and everything. Also - I loved the final decision part and hated the boss fight, which pretty much sums it up. Anyway, I enjoyed Mass Effect 2 as much as only few games in my gaming life.","March 7, 2014","true","30.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I've never been so immersed into a game as I have with the Mass Effect series. The only downsides I can really say about the game is that it relies a little too much on borrowing elements from Bioware's other games (mostly KOTOR), and that there isn't a Game of the Year edition. That being said, it's still worth your time even without the DLC. The Mass Effect games have quickly become some of my favorite games of all time.

Also, Shepard is a pretty hilarious renegade.","March 13, 2014","true","189.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Though the gameplay mechanics of Mass Effect 1 is bad compared to the other two.\nBut Wow, just wow.. The story, the characters, the sound track.. It is just over all a fantastic game!\n\n11/10, will play many times more","March 21, 2014","true","150.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
