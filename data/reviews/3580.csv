I played it quite a few years ago.\n\nYou click to reveal a little of an item until you're pretty sure you know what it is and then you type it in. The game is good about giving you credit. For instance, I typed in mannequin once and it was "dress form" but the game gave it to me. Or if you type in watch instead of wrist watch, you'll still get it right. There are different types of guessing games as well. Some are blurry and get clearer with each click. Some are twisted and go more towards their natural shape with each click. Etc. Each stage has a theme so if you can guess that, it's much easier to figure out the object. Between stages, you'll get a "hidden object" type of room but instead of finding items, you complete them. A chair will be missing a leg so you draw that in (just click on it and your pen does the rest). A column will be missing or a bow on a present or half of a pair of scissors. You get the picture. As you progress through the game, you get power ups that will help your guessing when activated. And you'll also open up bonus stages where you can guess even MORE items if you don't get your fill in the main game.\n\nIf you like puzzle games, I wholeheartedly recommend this. It is just so much fun.","October 4, 2015","true","4.7"," 24 of 24 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","24","24","0","0"

Very creative.\nYour objective is to guess the object in the hidden picture. You can reveal a small portion of the picture by clicking, and of course, the fewer clicks you need, the better. There are hundreds of pictures for you to guess. And various potions to help you.\nAside from these normal problems, there are some bizarre challenges, such as guessing a twisted picture, a mosaic-ed picture, a scrambled picture, and more.\nEach chapter contains 16 puzzles, and between chapters there are search-for-hidden-object levels. What's creative about this is that, you don't just search for listed objects in the scene. Instead, you search for listed objects that SHOULD be in the scene but actually are NOT.\n\nRecommended for everyone. Well, non-native players may need a dictioinary, but still recommended. This is definitely one of the best games in Popcap complete pack.\n\n+ creative playstyle\n+ various powerups\n+ lots and lots of levels\n- occasionaly a synonym of the correct answer is judged incorrect\n9 out of 10, marvelous.","February 4, 2014","true","0.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

No need to be too specific on the words, as everyone has a different name for the same object.\n\nJust one more book. Just one more book. Just one more book. Just one more book. Just one more book.

Really short. Short enough that 3 hours should only be on your counter if you let the game run in the background to get other things done in the meantime.\n\nThe story can be ignored completely. Basically, the Wizard's Pen, a bewitched tool, locked away the wizard, but forgot that the moon undoes the spell. And after completing 16 times 16 hidden objects (which is relatively little, if you ignore the 16 scenes of "spot what is missing, even if it's just a pixel"), you save the wizard.\n\nApparently, this is also a common occurence, taking that from the wizard's words. The pen does it to him regularly. I can't decide what's more stupid. The wizard or the pen. They are both very high up on the scale of stupid.\n\nYeah, there are better hidden object games out there. Others worth your money. Wouldn't bother with this one (again).","February 13, 2015","false","3.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"
