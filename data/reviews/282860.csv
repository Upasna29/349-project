Now that it's "released", it will probably never become a really interesting game.\n\nFirst, it's glitchy.  Getting stuck on the landscape still happens.  If you step in a tiny hole, you might die, because the engine can't decide where you are, and beat you to death.  You can't just walk up and down the stairs in the prefab towers, because you are too tall, and the engine stops your motion if you get close to a block or vertical terrain.  This makes movement feel really difficult and pulls me out of the immersion.  It crashes too frequently, though not so much that it can't be played.  Rain still occurs indoors, and under terrain.\n\nWhy build a house or anything if it's just going to rain inside anyway?  Seriously breaks the immersion for me.\n\nSecond, why am I doing any of this?  There's no direction in this game.  Not even a survival motive like that really popular game with blocks.  The machines and technical progression are neat, but I just don't feel like there's a good reason to do anything.  There is a rare material that's only on the asteroids, but it was kind of a let down when I got some.  So, less reason to explore.\n\nThird, it's not even close to finished in any way.  I haven't played much since 4.0 came out, but there doesn't appear to be a working door.  So even if keeping wildlife out was a reason to build a structure, there isn't a way to do access control.  A short wall will stop any wildlife I encountered, except birds, but they are pretty harmless.  So why build more?  Just a pile of blocks will build the "culture" score, and then what?  Storage and containers seem like they are always disorganized, with no way to line them up.  The textures make it really  hard to see if you are looking at a flat wall of rock, or if there are holes and projections and the like.  If you build on a spherical planet, it's hard to get anything level on the terrain, because the curvature is pretty extreme.  I realize that's hard to get away from, but the machines in my cave-house were alway all ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•-eyed, because the floor can't be made level without bricking it all up.  It takes too long to build anything, too.  I'm bored of building before I even have walls.\n\nThis game has tremendous potential that will now, sadly, never be realized.  The way the game is right now just isn't that much fun.\n\nAlso, I hate the musical score, every single piece.  It's well done, someone put a lot of effort into it.  I just don't like it.  At all.","August 23, 2015","false","22.0"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","23","25","0","1"

Based on a single player game.\n\nWell It's not exactly a scam Like Linden Labs pulled with Patterns, but this title has suddenly announced after a long time away that it has moved from Early Access to final release, and in my opinion it still feels like Early Access.\n\nBut let's start with positives. Although I give a thumbs down, there is still gaming to be had here.\nOpen world/galaxy generated worlds with crafting of simple objects with of course much mining for resources. Simple rewards screen to upgrade your skills and unlock objects with the objective of building a ship to get you off the rock your on and onto another rock.\n\nAnd the negative is centred around the word I keep using, "simple". It's why it still feels like a development version. Gameplay is very simplistic and unchallenging, features are a bit half baked and it feels like a demo. As a single player game it is over very quickly and your left wanting much much more which is a shame as the core concept is still exciting.\n\nAs an Early Access review I would be giving this a thumbs up as good work in progress, but as V4 is the release version then I cannot recommend it.\nMaybe development will continue and my view will change.","June 13, 2015","false","10.9"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

If you want to wander around a game that looks like it was made in 1999, collecting x*hundred units of this and y*hundred units of that, this may appeal to you. Voxel games like minecraft tend to work because of a cohesive aesthetic but in this instance the developers removed the blocky feel to the world and replaced it with hideous textures and low poly count models, while leaving the world fairly smooth. Combine this with an utterly dull and lifeless universe and you have a flop in the making.","April 16, 2014","false","3.1"," 44 of 83 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","44","83","0","0"

They seem like they are realitivly similar but this one is smaller scale from what ive seen so far.\n\nId  recommened this game simply because of its style. Sandbox space games are a thing that will surly pop up a lot more.\nThis one in particular has a bit of a rough start up if you dont choose the right perk at the start. For example, dont put your first five points into a plasma cannon. You wont get anywhere.\nThis game is pretty fun with friends. A good time killer for solo play. The ship and building limits cause some interesting designs.\nThis game has its strong points and weak points like any other. Id say some strong points would be voxle terriforming, multiplanets, a fair crafting/perk system that requires a bit of reading to use correctly, and the visuals arent half bad. Just not the best. Some weak points would be FLOATING TREES (dont mine them, it looks bad), really bare to the bones basic AI that can get a tad annoying when they get in your way randomly, weird gravity on spherical planets that has potential of causing headaches, and audio... I personally cannot play this game with audio.\n\nOverall, id say this is a game to try with some friends.","November 29, 2014","true","9.5"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

I was very upset to see that the textures where all white, including the stone, dirt, and all other resources. There was no way to tell the difference between one thing from another, I hope this will be implemented in a nearing update. We both have laptops with Intel Drivers and I'm sure many other people would like to be warned before paying money for a game that doesn't have a texture able to be viewed by everyone. I think the developer should be told this so they can fix this as soon as possible so they make more money and don't have any issues with people reporting it to Steam. I recommend this game to anyone with a compatible driver. I want to help the developer as much as I can, I could be a "Tester" and try the versions if needed. Lastly, if this update will not be coming soon I want a refund of $22.38.","April 18, 2014","true","3.4"," 29 of 56 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","29","56","0","7"

I had many hours of fun in the game, but it is simply not finished. You can go through the build-trees and as soon as you've built your space ship to go to another planet, it starts to get really boring. There isn't really anything other to do than to gather and with the limited building height, you can't really make a nice castle, like you can in Minecraft for instance. The most fun in Minecraft, which makes it still cool to play is the redstone. Once you've built all there is in Masterspace, you're basically done and you can uninstall the game.\n\nAnother thing that really is bad, is the monster AI. Cows, sheep and pigs all seem to gather in lakes. They don't even drown. Also what's with the dogs/wolves. Even the baddies are merely running around like chickens without a head and are too easy to kill.\n\nBy the end of the building tree you can create teleporters, but they are very buggy and often you end up in the middle of space. It would also have been nice that when you die on one planet, that you actually revive there as well, so your only space ship is not on a far away planet upon revival.\n\nSo even though it is fun from the start, this game is far from a finished product.","December 23, 2014","false","43.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You begin on a spherical planet, you can run round the enitre planet in 5-6 mins. As the sun goes round you can keep moving and stay in daylight all the time.\n\nCurrently the basic drive is to get culture points which are then spent on perks. Perks unlock additional resources and equipment ultimatly allowing you to build a spaceship and fly away to the other planets.\n\nThere is enough motivation here to make the game playable, and as Culture points are gained only by constructing buildings (which can be saved separatly and shared) it makes this more of an architectural/building game rather than a mining game. Thus the amount of game play you get is somewhat dependant on you liking building.\n\nThe building tools are adequate, they could be improved, but are very usable already.\n\nThere are a few hostile mobs on the planet, these are easily dispatched with the pickaxe and do not currently re-spawn, so you can continue building unhindered.\n\nTerain forming spherical planets creates some interesting effects, both mining and re-depositing material. Even manufatured materials like steel can be used to teraform.\n\nBe aware this is an alpha game so be prepaired to make a consierable amount of the fun up yourself.","May 5, 2014","true","54.1"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

I won't say it's not bugged out with many design flaws and a tutorial that always bugs out before you can complete it, leaving you to figure things out on your own.\n\nBut I'm also not going to say that it's a game that anyone could only enjoy because it's-so-bad-it's-good. I bugged out in the tutorial and then joined some friends on a planar world with almost no idea what to do. Between us, we figured out the culture points system, obtained uranium for a quality pickaxe despite the fact that uranium drops are bugged and you can ONLY mine it with a quality pick or better.\nI think we beat the bugs.\n\nIt's unnecessarily difficult due to bad design, but not impossible to play and enjoy, like we did.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust don't have too high standards or expectations.........\n\nAaaaaaand it's 6 hours later and i'm bored of it....","December 28, 2015","true","6.3"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","3"

You should try that before you buy it from Steam.\n\nThis game should be clearly marked as beta or pre-release content. In that context I would not have felt cheated at paying for it.\n\nIn fairness, you can see its potential but that is largely undeveloped as yet. The game lacks polish in many obvious ways, though it is pretty good in just as many others. That's about a 50:50 ratio of bad to good.\n\nIt actually comes across as being a pre-concept of, or offshoot from, Space Engineers which is much more fully developed.\n\nMasterspace is not a game to spend money on unless you like to promote new developments like Green Lighted games.\n\nI'd rate it 6/10 for visisble potential, 3/10 for actual development and 1/10 for current value for money.","March 1, 2015","false","2.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

Do I play it? Yes, I do, but would I want other people to play it?... Not so much.\n\nFirst off, the loading times. Sure, that's to be expected in a game like this, but if you have one of the best systems on the gaming market and it takes you 45 minutes to load a game because you added a few extra asteroids, it gets kind of rediculous. If you're like me, and decided to watch Game Grumps while waiting for it to load and finally get in after lord knows how longs, only to discover that the game can't even handle it and you can't move at all, no matter how long you wait, once again, it gets kind of rediculous.\n\nThere's no updates... Like, none. at.... all.... It had one update since I bought it 4-6 months ago, and since then it's been dead. Unfortunately, this is undoubtedly a dead game, unless they decide to pivk it up again. The idea is wonderful, SOOOOO much potential is just waiting there, to build upon the system they created. Yet they're too lazy to even considider the community. If you want this game anyways, feel free to grab it, but don't use the generator. Just use the presets, trust me, even when turning the preloading of resources off, it'll still take five hours to load up a world with two standard planets, five random planets, and eight asteroids...\n\nThe verdict? About 2/5, that's all I can give it, and until it's proven otherwise by the creators, it's a dead game.\n\n\nEDIT:\nThe developer has told us that he hasn't been able to update Masterspace because he's recovering from illness. Given the extensive timeframe, I can only assume it wasn't your average cold or flu. The point being, when this game begins getting updated again, I'll make sure to change the review. Good luck Masterspace developer, and I say this because it's one guy working on an entire game. Give him some love guys ^.^\n\nEdit 2:\nThis guy has come back and successfully updated the game and made some dramatic changes. This game is now worth the play, and I recommend to people who are especially fond of Starmade. Seeing as there is only one person making this entire game, I have to put into prospect the difficulty of sating the hungry community. This game WILL be successful, but only if it is constantly updated and people are willing to give it a shot. This is to you, developer. Update this game often, and pay atention to what the community wants. If you do this, I gurantee you'll be even more successful than you are now.

I will say if a really good mod or total conversion of this were to come out, it could drastically alter this entire review.\n\nSome bad points:\nThe game is final now so nothing will change, not even bug fixes it seems.\nThe game has some really glaring bugs, extreme memory requirements, occasional crashes, wonky animal interactions with spherical planets, etc.\nThings seem like a long grind.  I am talking MMO levels of grinding on mining anything just to do the first basic tasks, and then it gets exponentially worse from there.  Yes this can be adjusted.\nEverything sort of feels the same.  You encounter the same few life forms distributed randomly through your solar system, and then apparently the rest of the universe.\nAI is not great.\n\nSome good points:\nThe water flowing is actually done pretty well.\nSphererical worlds.\nWorlds and asteroids that can be visited and seen on the screen from your current planet (assumes powerful enough hardware) for the current solar system.\nAbility to go to another solar system.\nNearly all the assets are exposed for the game, the system is mostly LUA and XML driven.

I support many Alpha games and take each game based on its own merits. This game has an interesting ideal behind it but is poorly executed at this time. I rarely feel like i have wasted money on games but this many be an exception. This game is not worth the money until the developer solves basic issues. The game crashes constantly and loads only half of the enviornment. This is not an issue with my system as i am running a very high end gaming system. Memory leaks and loading issues are common. I want to like this game but i cannot currently reccomend it.","April 19, 2014","false","1.3"," 8 of 24 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","8","24","0","3"

The graphics are sub-par. the buildings look terrible. This is clearly a poor attempt at making a build/survival/space game.\n\nA large thing I would have to point out is their is a huge lack of knowledge from just opening the game, it's confusing, you just don't know what you should be doing. Put a tutorial in at the very least.\n\nWhen you hit f2 to respawn, you're old stuff doesn't drop. Just avoid spending the money like I did, it will make you angry, and then very depressed at the fact that you spent money.","April 17, 2014","false","0.9"," 13 of 35 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","13","35","0","0"
