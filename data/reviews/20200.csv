Upon actually playing it, the controls will make you want to throw your entire computer out the window. Whatever I paid for this, years ago, it was too much.","September 8, 2014","false","0.3"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","17","20","5","4"

You can't play on your own WITHOUT an AI character. (If so, this game would've gotten a higher score, and a recommendation)\n2. The controls are broken to say the least.\n3. You can get a 300 EVERY SINGLE TIME! Due to the fact that the f**king bowling ball bounces off the pins for a dumb minigame, rather than going through them, like they were fricking supposed to!\nFinal Verdict: 2/10 It only escapes being WORSE because i like bowling games.","June 3, 2014","false","0.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

First you add a horrible story, then horrible controls. With these two throw in changing physics that are mind boggling and maybe a few special abilities that are special in the sense you'd be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to use them.\n\nDon't buy this game unless you like to suffer.","March 2, 2014","false","3.3"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","10","13","3","1"

Со слов ролика существует две планеты - планета света и планета тьмы. Королева планеты тьмы сделала свою дочь королевой планеты света и кукловодит ей. Земля в опасности, победитель останется только один....он спасёт галактику (без вариантов). Кстати, это я про боулинг ещё не упоминал:) Минус - дико неудобное управление ударом и самим прицеливанием, накрутили много лишнего на мой взгляд. Стоить отметить крайне харизматичных соперников. Полстрайка за галактику! 7 из 10 :)","July 30, 2012","true","3.3"," 2 of 29 people (7%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","7","2","29","0","1"
