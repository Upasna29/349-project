I played their early demos and bought an older version from WhiteGiantRPG.com a year ago. Now, after 100+ hours in the Last Dream world, here is my updated assessment:\n\nA+ Mapping: You made judicious use of surrounding detail everywhere, with beautiful towns (Alfheim), majestic cities (Doria), and pleasant villages (Oakwood). Dry Gulch also feels like the travelers’ caravan that it is. Overall, very scenic and satisfying to explore.\n\nB Ease of Play: At first, the character building felt overwhelming. It took me until my third game to obtain a full command of attribute development (for example, I didn’t initially realize I could acquire/build skills). But this will not be a stumbling block for more proficient gamers, particularly those that start with your in-game Tutorial. Plus, I see that you have since made this feature easier to command.\n\nA Variability: The initial complexity aside, I enjoyed having the freedom to select among the eight characters, and the freedom to build them per my preference, particularly with repeated playthroughs.\n\nA+ Dialogue: Last Dream shines in the dialogue – it feels professional and is at times quite poignant. I remain interested in the story arcs of the many NPCs, who each seem to have around 7 sets of text that change with the main storyline.\n\nB+ Features: Wow, there is a lot packed into this game. I love the Hunter’s Guild, Fishing, Encounter Options, Cutscenes, Bestiary, Achievements… but as with the initial ease of play, there is so much included in this game (Drill, Recipes, Puzzles, Sonar, Skills, Macros, etc!) that I wasn’t initially sure what to pursue. By my third game (and playing at a higher difficulty setting), I appreciated the value derived from more of these options. Still, there is a learning curve on all these features.\n\nA- Music: Excellent. I would listen to this music while jogging or just hanging out. I gave it an A- because, although each piece is really solid, the collective compositions are not unified, which I understand would be difficult/expensive to do. Still, you made beautiful selections and the music remains a significant part of Last Dream’s greatness.\n\nA Puzzles: Very enjoyable. I read on your website that the Chief Designer has a PhD – it shows. I only recently managed to complete all 50… some are strikingly hard!\n\nA+ Balancing: Last Dream is surprisingly well balanced. At first, I expected that one aspect would be better than all the others (e.g. The Hunter's Guild vs. Fishing vs. Experience Building vs. Recipes vs. Side Quests, etc.), because there are MANY things you can do in this game. Yet, each option has its strengths and place within the game. Essentially, I initially recommended breaking up Last Dream into multiple games, yet I now better appreciate what a finely-tuned experience you crafted within Last Dream.\n\nA OVERALL: Your passion for this game is evident in the careful mapping, professional dialogue, countless features, inventive paths, compelling story development, haunting music, and (very) challenging puzzles. I stumbled upon Last Dream in its early development and still find myself enthralled with this well-designed, polished gem of a game. The later parts of Last Dream particularly exceeded my expectations – well done.","March 13, 2014","true","75.0"," 202 of 279 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","202","279","0","20"

Battles give you Skill Points that you can use to purchase skills for each class. Some are active and some are passive. Actives become abilities/spells that cost mana. You also need to meet level and skill prerequisites to get the more advanced skills. There also seems to be quite a lot of them.\n\nThe stat system has really grabbed my attention. It really seems to open a lot of potential for playing parties in different ways. You can focus on damage, magic, defense, health, mana pool etc. I've so far focused on getting my party faster than all the monsters so they go first in combat (with reasonable success) while making them all beefy. Its a simple yet elegant little system.\n\nClasses are varied and fun, with unique properties that make them viable/worth consideration. Hunters can tame you Chocobos (moas) that you can ride around, Thieves let you steal from towns without worrying about guards, engineers let you take shortcuts etc.\n\nThe puzzles scattered around the world are also nice. They're just complicated enough to make you try more than once, but I have yet to get frustrated by one or take what I would consider too much time. They are also so far all different, which is nice because it doesn't feel like a harder version of the same puzzle every time.\n\nThe game also lets you customize difficulty with what must be at least 7 difficulty settings, as well as choosing when/how you allow yoruself to save. The New Game + modes include options to achievement hunt with a powered up party or just keep your gear and start a new party, or wipe all achievements to start again.\n\nGraphics are the standard RPG Maker sprites and tiles. While this is not the most amazing game to look at, visuals are really not the point of this game and the gameplay is great. If you're a bit of a "graphics ♥♥♥♥♥" you might not want to pick this one up.\n\nOverall, very fun game so far, and it does indeed remind me of the older final fantasy games in terms of gameplay.\n","March 13, 2014","true","36.1"," 58 of 76 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","58","76","0","1"

The game description lists its selling points well enough, but what really hooked me was being able to play on the highest difficulty and chase after very difficult or impossible achievements while never having played the game before.  I loved starting off the game and getting my ♥♥♥ handed to me in the newbie dungeon against 3 slimes, then trying to figure out exactly which kind of improvement on the 10 stats on which characters might help me to take on these challenges with more success.  There is a great deal of randomization involved here and always a chance that your healer will get two-shotted in the next round.  Will this break you, or will your tank be able to last through the fight?  Can you reach the dungeon exit with your three dead and one guy with 10% hp left or will you be seeing the Game Over screen?  Anything might happen in this game, and that is why I love it.","August 1, 2014","true","187.1"," 38 of 45 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","38","45","0","0"

A lot of thought was put into everything from skills/spells to leveling and character progression. From the start you get to choose your party a la Final Fantasy 1 style. You get to choose from Gray Mage (sorta like a red mage) White Mage, Black Mage, Engineer (sorta like a chemis from FF tactics), Thief, Knight, Monk and Hunter. Each one has their own sorta unique set of skills and abilities. Out of the classes there are three with unique abilities that you should consider bringing at least one of them along IE: Thief for steal, Engineer for Tunneling, and Hunter for Taming. I brought two of those along in hopes of accessing their specials to get better loot. Hopefully it doesn't come back to bite me.\n\nSo far nothing has felt bogged down or slow. I went out of the starter town with nothing and came back after a few minutes of grinding very pleased. So far I have no issues getting items and experience to make my characters stronger. This is wonderful as it gives you a sense that you've accomplished something either by making your party stats better or adding abilities. The rate at which you gain AP (ability points and SP (skill points) is consistent and rewarding. As for grinding... Well...\n\nAt the start of the game you get to choose your gameplay options like encounter rates and saving options which I find to be exceptionally refreshing. Some people favor story progression so rare encounter chance is perfect, standard encounter rate I think is a tad too lenient so far. I should have probably picked the GRIND option so I could get more encounters. I do likes my levelin' up. Also incorporated is a new game + mode. You can do two things when you beat the game, start a new one with all your achievements and no gear, OR, start a new game with no achievements and all your junk.\n\nPart choice I chose was Knight, White Mage, Engineer and Thief. Thinking that late game I'd have more use out of being defensive. Not sure how that'll pan out. So far it's fun and I highly look forward to playing this through. Several times in fact.\n\nI have found one issue though and that's a very minor one honestly. When you start you don't really know what class does what. If there's  a way to look at that prior to choosing IN GAME at the start I hadn't found it. Either way if you have internet and 1/4 of a brain cell you just google it like I did.\n\n\nOverall 9/10 * I think the game is fun and will provide me with many hours of enjoyment. Really brings me back to my eariler RPG days.\n\nCharacter/Party leveling 10/10 * Feels super rewarding and isn't too hard or too difficult to level your character the way YOU want.\n\nStory 8/10 * Dude it's RPH made by a RPG maker program. It's good enough.\n\nItems 10/10 * Dev clearly put a great amount of time into the weapons and armor and synthesis part of the game. Gives you something to look for\n\nGame Length/Replayability 10/10  * Not sure, some people say it's taken 40ish hours. I could easily see myself taking longer because I like to grind games out so I reckon it'll probably take me somewhere between 50-60 hours before I actually commit to beating it. And I am a completionist at heart  =)\n\n","March 14, 2014","true","17.6"," 46 of 62 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","46","62","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/risingpun/recommended/266230/","risingpun","Osirus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/risingpun/","1454 products in account","This game feels like comfort food, for someone who grew up on SNES jRPGs. And I mean the warm and good kind of comfort food, not junk food. It's familiar but not just empty calories, there's a great game here. It's not as funny as Cthulhu Saves the World, but in terms of expansive jRPG, it may be the best indie SNES-style RPG I've ever played. (Blows the Aldorea games out of the water.)\n\nYou choose 4 characters at the beginning from 8 classes, and it not only effects combat, but some out-of-combat options as well. My engineer means I can tunnel across the land, but lacking a thief means when trying to open locked treasures/doors, I am not stealthy enough to avoid summoning guards. This, plus a few forking path options, gives the game plenty of replay value. Especially because you can assign stats on level-up, it's conceivable that you could actually enjoyably beat the game with 4 white mages (whereas in Final Fantasy I abandoned that plan roundabouts the Marsh Cave).\n\nGood music, freedom to choose character stat development, mini-games, casino, fishing, crafting, puzzle rooms, bounty hunting, and that glorious moment when you get the ship or airship and suddenly the world opens up many more areas for you to explore while ignoring the main quest. Not for modern-gaming snobs who are going to ding it for not being Skyrim, but if you're looking to recapture the magic of 1990 jRPGs, this is the best indie FinalFantasy clone I've ever played.\n\nTwo thumbs up.","October 21, 2015","true","63.3"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","24","25","0","4"

Gameplay is fun, the puzzles are challenging (but not ridiculously difficult), and for a RPG Maker game, a lot of work and detail was put into it. So, there are definitely good points about this game.\n\nThe story was just mediocre. It wasn't bad. There were interesting things about it, but it got to the point where I just lost interest. I'm 47 hours in and I realized that I just don't really care about what's happening in the story. That's not a good sign. I was hoping it would get better as I progressed through it, but the story just wasn't enough to keep me going. It probably didn't help that there's ZERO women in game, unless you count a chosen party member, but they don't really have personality or a place in the story.\n\nI'd prefer to just keep this review as "neutral" instead of negative or positive, because I wouldn't say I have negative feelings for the game. I'd just say I was disappointed with the story.","July 1, 2014","false","47.0"," 48 of 68 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","48","68","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shikono/recommended/266230/","shikono","Elfee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shikono/","382 products in account","Last Dream is a game for people who love classic Singleplayer-RPGs in the old style.\n\nFirst of all you have to choose your main party (4 out of 8 Characters). You will always walk with your main character through the game but your party members will help you in the battles.\n\nStory:\nYour character (you can name him like you want) is lost in a strange world. He doesn’t know how he got there and starts to search a way back home. On his journey he discovered lots of evil monsters and you have to decide if you fight or try to escape (It’s a little bit like in Pokémon for all who know the GameBoy Pokémon games lol). But the main character will also meet lots of friendly town dweller from Terra who give him gifts or sell him stuff. The town dweller are scared about the ancient creatures of Terra because they get more and more power and hurt or kill people. So you have to defeat this corrupted power to save Terra and ultimately yourself.\n\nGameplay:\nLike I said it’s a classic RPG so you have your inventory with health items, equipment, collections and your map. You have also the possibility to Skill whatever you want and to go into the Level Up Menu. Besides you can set Battle Macros which I really recommend because this turn-based battle system becomes (at least for me) really fast boring. Way more interesting in my eyes are the challenging puzzles in the game and the side quests. I guess many of you will also love the cutscenes with the cute anime looking characters. Also Achievement Hunters have something to do in this game because there are 236 achievements which are not that easy to unlock!

I haven't had this much fun with an rpg since I was a kid. I've never played an rpg maker game before and had reservations about trying a game that looked very cheap and generic to be honest but I'm really glad I did. What the game lacks in original art it more than makes up for in game play and sheer scope. It does what old snes rpgs did so well then improves on them in subtle ways like letting players choose what skills to pick and the option to distribute character stats. This features are so well implemented that it makes you wonder how come it's so rare to see them in jrpg games.\n\nThe story is a little weak, you play a silent protagonist and your party members are completely anonymous henchman that get mentioned I think once in the entire game. There's a sort of trade off; instead of a tight narrative that restricts where and what your character can do like a more tradtional final fantasy story does, by not focusing on your character at first it allows for a very open world and gives the player a tremondous amount of freedom for exploration, especially once they get off the first continent. But the story does tighten up, you do get pulled into it more and more the further you get and I was pleasantly surprised by how good the ending was and by how varied it is depending on how you played through the game.\n\nI don't like puzzles much, but they're all %100 optional which is a really nice and I found myself going out of my way to finish them all because they were so much fun. I've done almost every puzzle in the game (over 50!) and only a handful had me quit out of frustration or had me running to the strategy guide.\n\nThere's an amazing developer made guide for free, a giant 700 page pdf, and for a game this massive and complex it's a very welcome addition especially if you're new to this genre because this game pulls no punches when it comes to dificulty. Hard mode is extremely dificult, I consider myself a veteran of snes rpgs and this game had no qualms about kicking my ♥♥♥ and forcing me to reconsider my gear and what skills I should use for each character.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough, can't wait for a sequel.","March 21, 2015","true","105.0"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","23","27","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexngregory/recommended/266230/","alexngregory","alex.n.gregory","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexngregory/","3023 products in account","Take everything that's great about 16-bit RPGs and distill it into a single product, and you end up with Last Dream, one of my favorite 2D turn-based RPGs of the last few years.\n\nMixing the spirit of games like Final Fantasy and the Gaia series with a strong attention to detail and world-building, Last Dream feels like it could have legitimately been released on an SNES in the 90s and no one would have batted an eye. The game combines standard RPG tropes with a deep skill system, lots of loot and a world full of things to explore for a very fulfilling experience.\n\nThe plot follows a father who discovers a portal while on a vacation with his kids at a beach. Sucked into the world of Terra, he discovers a plot regarding an entity named "The Dark Lord" who plans to overthrow the world by harnessing everyone's soul. From there, you start taking on missions to explore the region and find a way to get home with a crew of companions and working to destroy the Dark Lord once and for all. The plot is bog-standard stuff, but has enough twists going on throughout that it never feels overly boring.\n\nThe world is chockful of side activities and jobs to complete. There's a very robust arena mode with multiple tiers, unique character boosts and high-level rewards. There's a 50-level dungeon that ties into the backstory of one of the antagonists. There's a massive racing circuit (that helps you gain an item to craft some of the best armor in the game) and a fully-fledged "monster hunting" set of missions that is incredibly satisfying and difficult in equal parts. There's an entire casino full of mini-games. There's even lots of minor activities like puzzles to complete in the various dungeons, treasure hunting and a massive fishing sidequest(!).\n\nIt almost feels like there's too much to do. By the time I completed my playthrough (about 22 hours, rushing through with the help of a guide), there was still a lot of content I never touched. Players taking their time will easily get 40-50 hours of playtime out of this, and the massive number of achievements encourages full completion.\n\nLast Dream is interesting in that it rewards player experimentation and "going off the beaten path". When the game begins, you have a choice of taking one of two paths to retrieve the items necessary to secure the purchase of a boat. Yet, you can go back and do both courses before you move on with the plot, or try to take on high-level bosses earlier than you're supposed to.\n\nThis is the first game I've played in a long time that makes the player feel like there's weight to the actions they make during the storyline. There are several moments in the story where, depending on whether you have the right specialist/take on a specific challenge, you gain greater rewards and characters throughout the gameworld acknowledge your feats. This even affects a large chunk of dialogue and cutscenes during the ending, and I found myself feeling incredibly satisfied when I watched the finale and saw how characters in the world reacted to my actions and accomplishments (final scene aside, which ends on a vague sequel hook and doesn't answer what happened to your other party members).\n\nOn the flipside, however, there are many moments that feel... uncharacteristically violent. There's a cutscene that alludes to the sexual assault of a minor character by one of the villains, there's a town that can be permanently wiped out by a volcano if you don't have a certain party member, the main plot advocates nuking a populated city and the final boss is dispatched by casually stabbing him in the heart. It clashes with the focused (but generally light) plot that was set up through most of the game.\n\nThere are also parts that can be extremely frustrating for first-time players. I'll warn you now - if you hate button-mashing or remembering patterns, you are going to loathe Moa racing and the puzzles. I ended up giving up on the latter by the very end, and barely finished the former (which requires you to mash sequences of buttons for three minutes, in a race that is going to kill your fingers). On the flipside, there are also ways to exploit the plot or certain characters to get a boatload of amazing gear, weapons and/or money much earlier in the storyline, so it balances out.\n\nThis is also a title that was made with RPGMaker, which can be an automatic turnoff for a lot of people. However, the game utilizes the program's tilesets incredibly well and never feels phoned-in or lazy.\n\nIn the end, Last Dream has me very excited to see what will occur in the upcoming expansion pack and the eventual sequel. This is one game you should definitely check out - for the amount of content you'll get out of it, this is a no-brainer for any RPG fan.","August 16, 2015","true","22.8"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","25","31","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/varlun/recommended/266230/","varlun","Varlun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/varlun/","191 products in account","Alright. I'll get straight to the point.\n\nRecommended: Yes\n\nBecause overall this game was very very enjoyable for what it is.\n\nBut you're not interested in factless statements.\n\nI've already gotten my money's worth. Game cost me $5 and at the time of this review I've played it 7.7 hours. It costs like $6 to go to see a movie at the theater for like 2 or 2 and a half hours. So yeah.\n\nHere's what I like and don't like about it so far. Really just a couple major things.\n\nI'll start with what I like of course.\n\n+ I like the leveling up system. Rather than you getting preassigned increases to various stats when your guys level up, you just get the points to spend however you want. This makes me feel like I'm really in control of my party's strengths and weaknesses. That I can do something about it if they're lacking in this area or that. Is my White Mage not able to keep up with the damage being thrown at the party? Next level up I can dump ALL the points into INT if I want to. Is my White Mage keeping up just fine and I want to go for sustainability, with a higher mana pool, so I don't have to return to town as often? I can dump all the points into MP if I want.\n\n+ I like the skill system. Again rather than the game automatically giving you skills at certain levels, when you kill monsters, you get SP. You can spend this SP to unlock various passive or active abilities. So you directly control exactly what everyone has, and I love it.\n\n+ I like the various classes to be picked. Again, rather than most RPGs where you have preassigned characters with preassigned classes, you're able to pick the 4 characters you want, and what classes they are. It's completely in your hands. There are 8 classes to choose from, so it's up to you to decide what you think the best party composition is. There's a lot of debate over that. (And I've actually made a Guide for this game over it- check it out!) I personally went with 3 Knights and 1 White Mage. Though I feel I'll probably get boned in the future for not having a Black Mage. Maybe I'll be able to get elemental weapons for my knights and it won't matter. Who knows. It's up to you!\n\n+ I like the overall story. The plot is interesting and makes me want to press on to figure it out. Nothing really else to say about that.\n\nThere are other things I could talk about that I like about this game, but those are the major ones. The ones I really care about.\n\nNow for the negatives. There aren't many.\n\n- The dialogue outside of cutscenes is lackluster. Like, one box of text lackluster. Towards the beginning of the game (no spoilers) you have to go to a tower to get a thing. When you get in the tower you meet a guy and he simply says something like "You're here for the thing aren't you? We'll you'll have to fight this to prove you're worthy!" and that's freaking it. What? It's obvious that the developers skipped on this in favor of other things which is fine. It's just sometimes so obviously short that it smacks you in the face. It's like really. You just know that the developers threw something in there so they could move on. And this happens EVERYWHERE.\n\nBut to cut it some slack, I feel that it doesn't really take away from the overall experience of the game too much.\n\nThat being said I've always been more of a mechanics-focused guy than a story-focused guy, so keep that in mind.\n\nHonestly that's the only negative I could think of, really.\n\nWell that's it!

While this may not be the best overall  jRPG experience, it is the best jRPG gameplay experience I've ever had. I have been playing jRPGs for about 20 years, so that's saying quite a bit.\n\nIf you like the original Final Fantasy, you will fall in love. You simply select four out of eight possible characters to form a party (their descriptions are accurate, and you can take more than one of the same character). As you level up, you allocate points to different attributes, so the characters grow according to your needs. I adored the customization.\n\nThere are countless references to the Final Fantasy series, Lufia, and a few other titles as well. I'm almost done with my second playthrough, and I can say from experience that the way I handled combat and resource management completely changed with my party. It drags a little bit in the third quarter, but everything else is solid.\n\nOther than that, I suppose my only nitpicking complaints are that your main character's backstory is a little cliche, and if your main is a female, she'll be referred to as 'he' and 'him', as I've discovered on my second playthrough. These oversights shouldn't be what you take away from this review, though.\n\n","August 18, 2014","true","86.9"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

If you like traditional, old-school JRPGs, this is for you. If you like difficult games that can only be overcome by careful planning, this is for you. Actually, if you even want an easy game, this is also for you, because it has SIX difficulty settings. Hard is recommended, though, because these kind of games are meant to be hard.\n\nThe story is revealed as you go first through your own characters travels, then through periodic flashbacks. It can seem confusing at first, but it's very satisfying once you can piece it all together.\n\nThe writing... is incredible. It greatly surpasses any expectation you might ever had from an RPG maker game. If you are concerned that such a game might be full of errors, engrish, poor grammar, lazy use of language, and juvenile speech, let me assure you that this game does not have pretty much any of that. I talk to almost all NPCs in games, and the writing is better than most works by major studios. You will by no means be disappointed on this front. Unless you like games of few words. Then you will be disappointed, because there is a LOT of reading in this game. This is a pro for me, though.\n\nThe soundtrack is very versatile. There's a song for every occasion. I don't even know how many different battle themes there are, but you will not get burnt out on the same song over and over. Even areas of the world map have different music as you travel. You won't get bored with the music, and it's generally pretty well done for the occasions.\n\nYou will get your time's worth out of this game. Make liberal use of their extremely thorough strategy guide. It will be your best friend. But I suggest trying to solve the puzzles yourself first. Oh yeah. There are many Lufia-esque puzzles, and they're a lot of fun. But if anything ever becomes too frustrating, they have provided the information you need in their handy guide.\n\nGive it a go, classic JRPG fans, you will not be disappointed.","December 7, 2015","true","317.1"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

Most of the possible problems are either addressed via the free strategy guide or with the patches. The storyline is a bit light for this particular game but enjoyable to me. In fact it has two features I would wish were in all games, the ability to fast forward tedious events, and ability to turn off and or skip cutscenes. You can build your characters stats to fit your needs, choose your preferred classess, or experiment easily enough to make quite an enjoyable experince.

The games world is also huge, i mean really huge with alot of towns and dungeons packed with fun puzzels that you often get a really nice reward from in form of gear or items.

While it does have features to offer to make the game a walk in the park, the game lacks a reason to be played, and the customization options are only really useful for people seeking a minmax grind challenge through higher difficulties.\n\nUnlike traditional JRPGs, this game fails to provide both a reason to play (via story), a direction to go in, or even a clear line of difficulty guidance (floors in a dungeon will spontaneously just be harder than others), which will likely result in simply being completely annihilated because how could you have known.\n\nAnd when you see Game Over, and load up your last save, and realize you didn't save a while ago because it requires multiple steps from the menu (unless you select "save anywhere" option), you wont feel any reason to continue playing.","May 23, 2014","false","29.3"," 38 of 64 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","38","64","0","0"

I am fully aware of the possibilities and limitations that come with creating a game using RPGMaker, as I've used the program myself quite a bit, and I can tell you right away that this game isn't much more than stock resources piled onto a bland story.\n\nThere are a few interesting features, such as designing your own party, but in the end these features aren't used to their full extent, and the way it's done is very generic. Customizing stats and skills is fine in itself, but the system used here is, once again, very generic and doesn't offer much customization other than "make a good build or make five different bad ones".\n\nGraphics are mostly, if not completely, stock, which in itself can be fine, but when the game fails to produce any other redeeming qualities I can't help but notice how I've seen the graphics many, many times before. The music feels completely random most of the time. Especially during the flashback cutscenes. It just feels like the creator didn't know what music to put there, and just randomly picked a song from a playlist.\n\nThe story... I don't get it. What's my motivation? Why am I bothering with these guys. Just telling me I met some people and trained for some time doesn't really give me much of an emotional attachment to my party. Making them all mutes doesn't help much either. I assume I want back into my own world. It's only been a year, right? Why am I doing random fetch quests for people when I should be trying to get back home? Why do I care about what happened lots and lots of years ago to some pretty funky music?\n\nAs the game is a RPGMaker game with very basic battles and graphics, it really only has story to rely on. Unfortunately the story is simply not there, or if it is, presented in a way that makes me not care at all. And this comes from a diehard RPG fan who loved a bunch of the more recent retro-styled RPGs out there.\n\nIf you're looking for a retro-RPG with a good story, this is sadly not the game for you.","May 24, 2014","false","4.0"," 31 of 51 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","31","51","0","0"

The old-style sprites, the simplicity of the design, from Chrono Trigger to FF: Mystic Quest; i've run the gauntlet of encounters and grinded out countless storylines to save the world/universe/existence itself.  That being said, games made on RPG Maker have never been a turn-off for me, and even if they were, Last Dream would stand above.\n\nThis game is an outstanding throw-back to the RPG's I loved as a kid whilst also evolving into something new and engaging. The dailouge is well written, the storyline has depth to it, and the world itself is actually very sandbox-esque.  With room for open-world wandering, plenty of side quests and dungeons, there is tons to explore and do if grinding out the main plot isn't your style.  (This also means that for completionists and dungeon hunters, you're in luck! There is a LOT for you to seek out.)\n\nWhat I enjoy most of all is the full character control. No preset PC's to join your team, you design from the ground up all four of your party members. Furthermore, you control how they progress. Each level up grants you stat points which you can then use to mature each character how you see fit.  It's beautiful. Absolutely beautiful.\n\n8/10 Highly Recommended.

I took my time playing this game (on hard, save anywhere) and spent at least 100 hours on it, so I would say it's totally worth the full price. I didn't even complete all side quests, and could try a harder difficulty with different classes, plenty of unlocked achievements, etc. My point is there's plenty of content and some replay value.\n\nCons:\n- Controller support could have been better. Cannot use cross (must use thumb stick), customize options doesn't make sense and when you figure it out it doesn't allow you to choose from all the buttons you would want. So basically you better just learn to use the default mapping, it works though it's a bit unusual (confirm with X, switch characters with start and select instead of triggers...)\n- This kind of game is repetitive by nature, and fights can often be either too difficult or too easy. I just want to mention it, it's not really a con because that's what this game is supposed to be.\n\nPros:\n- Customization of start party and levelups\n- Customization of difficulty and save settings, for more/less old-school challenge.\n- Classic turn based combat\n- Awesome music (classic composers remixed on electric guitar: checked!)\n- Great story, original and different although inspired by FF.\n- A lot of content: side quests, crafting, fishing, arena, etc.","April 27, 2014","true","120.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

OK fair enough it doesn't sound overly brilliant in that example but it's still a different touch from the Breath of Fire type malarky. The classes are interestingly done too. Some with handy abilities to help in battles, others with skills that help out in general on the world map like tunnelling, stealing or ♥♥♥♥. Well OK not ♥♥♥♥ but the other two aye.

It has most of the good stuff from old RPGs from SNES and some new stuff like getting to add the points to your character.  You also can't mess up since you could eventually max all the characters' stats if played long enough.  They made NPCs say different things after most story events and they have some move to different towns throught the story, but not just following you.  They have the 50 floor dungeon similar to Lufia 2 cave, except not as good since you can't bring the special items back in.  There are tons of optional things you can do like race the birds, which is better than on FF since you can win just by pushing the correct buttons and no randomness.  You can fish to get gold super easy and the fish are good for healing, but you don't have to and there is no terrible mini game for the fishing.  It just works when you do it and you almost always get a fish.  Just buy 99 bait and set it to turbo or Autohotkey it (Would have been better with no delay and to just have the option to fish x99 in 1 second, but oh well.)  If you put it on the hardest mode, it starts out slow because you will need to grind a long time, but the game gets easy by the end.  They build in a battle macro system where you can preprogram a set of moves to do for a round.  This saves a ton of time and was one of the best improvements ever for turn based battles.  I will have a hard time playing any other turn based game after this since I am spoiled by only having to hit like 3 button presses to fight a round instead of 57 like other RPGs.  You get to pick your classes at the start and you can choose from 8 classes, so you can replay the game and try different strategies, although the characters didn't feel very different to me.  There are many items to equip and you can craft and do side quests to get alot of stuff.  This will give you something to do if you get stuck at any point right after the start and you won't need to just grind.  I deffinetly recommend this game when it is on sale of if it gets in a bundle.","September 29, 2014","true","293.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

You are given so much choice it's ridiculous. I made a pretty standard RPG party (tank, thief, healer, black mage) and have been really enjoying my time. It is a true tribute to the SNES RPGs of my youth. It is a little grindy (what RPG from that era wasn't?) but it gives you so much customization and so many meaningful choices on how your characters grow that I just can't wait for the next level. It's also rather brutal on hard, or at least it seems like it for me. However, to me this isn't a downside...it just adds to the fun. Most of the modern RPGs of this style are so formulaic and easy to build the perfect party (Blue Dragon, Persona 4, just to name a couple) that I quickly got bored with the battles, although I loved the storylines. So far, every new enemy I have encountered added something interesting to the battle, or some new ability or twist (or just tons of damage my party was equipped to take) that it has kept it interesting.

By crafting your own weapons, armors, rings, potions, etc, it opens a whole new universe of possibilities. Looking for that shiny Diamond Armor but has not enough gold to buy it from the shop?

I'm looking at you, Mr. Daedalus.\n\nGreat end game content. The Hunter's Guild owner Cid is looking for brave warriors on his mission to wipe the monsters from Terra's face.

IT IS GRIND HEAVY. However, the sheer amount of content that is within the game as well as the multitude of class options available to you make this game addicting.\n\nI began with a black mage, monk, engineer, and thief\n\nHere is my reasoning.\n\nMonk\n\nI feel the monk is a vital character late game. He kind of sucks on the outset, but upon building him with the ability to perform multiple attacks per turn at late game while buffed he is able to dish out tens of thousands of damage. (I had him buffed doing 25-35k around level 50-60). So he becomes vital as the sole damage at some points so the rest of you part can buff/heal.\n\nBlack Mage\n\nI love AOE (area of effect). So while he monk can deal tons of single target damage bosses, the black mage mops up random battles with a single cast of a spell. Furthermore, the monk/ black mage combo is an absolutely vital choice. This is doubly true if you want to tackle all the optional bosses in the game, because the black mage has spells that seriously buff the monk's damage. So the monk falls off a bit if you don’t have the BM to back him up.\n\nEngineer\n\nI have a love/hate relationship with this character. Believe it or not I took him in place of a dedicated healing class, which was a source of frustration for 75% of the game. I will argue that he is an AMAZING HEALER, but you MUST invest time into fishing in order for him to be good. This is not optional. So if you don’t want to be forced into a butt load of fishing don’t take him as a healer (fish are the best source by far of healing in the game). That being said, what makes him so good is that he gets a skill that doubles and then later triples the effectiveness of the items he uses. Sadly, he is the worst class by far for early and mid-game and often just becomes a source of a few minor buffs and an item user.\n\nThief\n\nStealing is love, stealing is life, steal. He's mediocre but you need him to steal the best items in the game of the optional bosses. Did I mention he steals?\n\nMusic 7/10\n\nThe music is good though I feel that the developers tried too hard to make every battle sound epic. This often leads to points in the game where the music becomes abrasive to the ears when you hopping in and out of battles every minute or so. I actually had to shut the music off at some points because all I would hear is maybe the first 20 seconds of the song when it’s at its most explosive volume. This also translates to the map where it does not pause the music, but instead chooses to start from the beginning every time you come out of battle. However, the boss music is phenomenal. The only reason this doesn’t get an eight out of ten is the technical oversights in its execution. The rest of the game is littered with classical covers (which I love) and a steady stream of acoustic guitar and metal.\n\nGameplay 8/10\n\nNo complaints here. Just your standard RPG elements.\n\nStory 7/10\n\nI don’t know why I am supposed to care about the main character. In fact he or she is kind of an enigma through most of it. Other than that it’s just your standard crazy bad guy with delusions of grandeur.\n\nExploration 10/10\n\nThis is a place where this game REALLY shines! The world feels HUGE and only continues to grow when you access the submarine and can explore underwater. The areas in the game themselves can often time be complicated requiring you to backtrack with multiple branching paths to make sure you found everything. I am a completeionist so the amount of area to explore really added to the fun of this game to me.\n\nSide quests 10/10\n\nThis is possibly the best part of the game as I am one who absolutely loves side quests! For as much as there is to explore, there’s even more side quests to do along the way. For starters in every dungeon in the game, there is an average of 1-3 puzzles you can complete. While they are not necessary (but they are, lets be serious who wouldn’t want to do them?) they can give you exceptional loot assuming you're not over leveled when you complete them (that happened to me a few times). Now they may be as simple as pushing a few blocks such as the first puzzle in Oakwood sewers to the horrific and arduous hour plus trial in the great southern marsh. (Screw you developer who came up with that).\n\nNow these puzzles are but one of the many side quests in this game. Next is my favorite. Bounty hunting! That’s right folks early in the game you are tasked with exterminating baddies across the world map. Now you start by killing some lowly trash, (don’t be fooled though the first time I fought the goblin king I got wrecked) but end up working your way to fight creatures of myth. Once again these are all optional and I recommend that you have a thief in your party because some of them hold the best items in the game.\n\nNext is the abyss which as of writing this I have only tentatively tried out. This thing is brutal and that is taking it lightly. The game starts you at level one with no gear and it’s up to you to relevel inside and make it all the way to the bottom. The catch is you have to pretty much do it all in one rip. In fact due to my party setup (engineer/black mage/thief/monk) I may have to replay the game with a different party because the engineer is not a viable healer in there. Which attests to the difficulty of the game if you are not properly prepared.\n\nI don’t want to list all of them here, but besides these there are many more points of interest in the world that you can reap many benefits from finding and doing. Half the fun is finding them right?\n\nDifficulty 10/10 (assuming you don’t over level)\n\nParty: monk/black mage/thief/engineer\n\nI want to say that I started out on hard. This is considered by the game guide to be the standard difficulty the developers wanted and it wasn’t a joke. Maybe it was my party set up, or maybe it is the game itself, but damn this game was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at points. I started out as a black mage and they didn’t even give me a single damn spell to work with! (Was fire 1 too much to ask?) So early on if you lack many physical options in your party it will be much harder. I finished the main game at 70 that was after doing every optional boss I could find. To top that off I had some of the most broken equipment (Amaranthine Ring/ kali's ring/ rainbow gear) in the game! And still the final boss could one shot some of my characters fully buffed. However, fishing is an MVP in this game that really helps "tackle" (get it....) some problems.\n\nIt seems that almost every damn enemy has a status afflicter so at any given time you’re either blowing MP or items almost every fight in an attempt to keep your party in top shape.\nThis is both a blessing and a curse for me because I have always felt that status attacks were a really underdeveloped aspect of most rags and used as a gimmick to make certain encounters harder. Last Dream on the other hand makes status a constant worry for you and your party especially if you enabled the "no saves in dungeons" option. This means that you must careful allocate what resources you want to use and when because you may just end up being totally unprepared and have to backtrack to resupply. However they were not entirely jerks when they did this and if you so choose to forego healing an ally many of these status ailments will wear off over several turns. (I usually found it to be 4-5 for most)\n\n\nSo you may be asking: "is this game for me?" I do indeed hope so. I also hope that my review gave you the push you needed to get it. There are a million more things I could touch base on concerning this title but I feel like I have taken enough of your time. In summation I have never seen more love put into a game than this title, and I feel that the industry itself would benefit for more developers with this amount of passion for their projects.","June 13, 2015","true","65.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

You can go into the game folder and replace sprites to change the look of your characters if you don't like the default looks.\n\nOpen world in the vein of old FF games.\n\nAwesome music with different battle tunes and dungeon music on every continent.\n\nHidden stuff everywhere, even entire dungeons in remote areas.\n\nLots of optionals and endgame content.\n\n\n\nNegatives:\nIf you just stack defense and magic defense you can get through pretty much the entire game without any trouble on most difficulties.\n\nDamage dealt = 4x Attack stat - 2x enemy defense stat.\n\nThat and instant death spells are ridiculous.  Either you have protect rings and they don't do anything or you don't have protect rings and your entire party dies before you even get to attack.

It reminded me of Final Fantasy 1, 3, and a little of Dragon Warrior. After playing the demo for less than an hour I decided to buy the game. The music is superb and there is enough dialogue to keep things focused without dumping too much on you. Party advancement (gold, experience, upgrades)  is paced nicely so that progress feels more smooth and steady, without drawing out too long or coming too quickly.\n\nThe world provides you with a good deal of freedom of where you want to go. There is also a good amount of things to do that are there just to be done if you choose that aren't part of the main story. The crafting system is straight forward and useful, and the items are real upgrades that are worth the time to assemble. The optional puzzles are, for the most part, challenging more than frustrating.\n\nThere are two New Game+ modes to check out after completing the game at least for the first time. One option resets your achievements but allows you to keep all of your items, while the other, I believe, lets you keep your achievements so you can work on completing more, but otherwise is like starting a new game.\n\nThere are 6 difficulty levels and 3 encounter rates so you should easily be able to find the right settings for you.\n\nAnd there is a lot of achievements, if that's your thing.\n\n\nI decided not to cover the story so much because it's subjective and everyone's taste are different. I found it interesting and unique. More control over what happens would ahve be nice but that's how I feel about most games - and most games doesn't give you a lot of control anyway so I can't really say it's a negative.\n\n\n\nAll in all, it's a fun solid game that is easily worth the price of admission.","March 16, 2014","true","3.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

The ability to select your characters is a great idea. Each character has their own unique skills. I spent about an hour just reading about the classes in the strategy guide and choosing the right party. The ability to add stat points upon level up and choose each characters skills adds a huge amount of customization. The music also surprised me, it is some of the best music in an RPG that I have heard since Chrono Trigger/Final Fantasy 3. The graphics are simple, yet pleasing to the eye and effective. You can also choose the difficulty and other game options to make the game harder or easier depending on your skill level.\n\nThe gameplay is great, the ability to set macros for the party alleviates some of the monotony when fighting weaker enemies. The puzzles scattered throughout the land are well thought out and fun to do. There is also a fishing minigame which is simple, yet surprisingly fun.\n\nAs for things that could be improved upon, I would really like to see the ability to choose the gender for each class. Although it's nitpicking, this is the one thing that stood out to me that I wish could be changed.\n\nOverall, if you like JRPGS's pick this one up now, you won't be disappointed.\n\n","March 17, 2014","true","37.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Here's my thoughts:\n\nIt's clearly an RPGmaker game, doesn't try to hide it. But it's really good. I've played (to my knowledge) all the RPGmaker games on Steam and this one is by FAR the best. The levelling up and skill system lets you customize your characters really well, and every class offers very unique additions to your party. Some of the music is public domain songs (such as Beethoven's Fifth) but they fit well with the atmosphere where they take place in.\n\nYou can craft in this game, by gathering materials from monsters and combining them with gear to create better gear. A unique thing about this game, unlike most RPGs, is that money is actually tightly controlled. You're always on your last dime once you upgrade in a new town, and you don't have 999,999 gold by time you reach the final boss.\n\nSome of the unique traits of the classes:  Thieves can steal. Hunter's let you be able to ride chocobo expys on the world map. Engineers let you use tunnels for faster travel and acess to treasure, along with stronger item usage and can increase EXP gained in battle. White Mages are the only way you can ressurect dead party members outside of town.\n\nI went with Monk, Thief, Black Mage, and Engineer.  The lack of Moa's (the chocobo expy) on the world map isn't too painful, but the lack of ressurecting puts pressure when deep inside a dungeon. That said, the group is pretty well rounded.\n\nMany dungeons have zelda-esque puzzles, and are a nice break from the grind. They're fun, however the rewards are uqually lackluster. I do all the puzzles anyway, but some of them aren't worth the time, so there's that.\n\nThe story is rather generic, but it feels like an oldschool RPG with some modern systems in place.\n\nThe creators are very vocal and take feedback from their fanbase, and as such, have earned my loyalty to them. I'm looking forward to their next releases.\n\nIf you're looking for a good oldschool JRPG, this one is the one you will want to get.\n\nP.S. A "load" options on the menu would be nice.  I save often, and if something goes wrong I have to exit out of the game to go to the starting screen to load from my save. Adding "load" to the menu would speed that up considerably.  (Now someone is going to tell me there is a way to load and I'm just blind, lol)","March 14, 2014","true","10.7"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

If you are a person who has bought several versions of final fantasy games, enjoy customizing characters and seeking out rare treasures to make your party incredibly powerful, or are a trophy hunter who enjoys a serious challenge to collect all achievements, this is the game for you.\n\nThis game is a polished experience of the classic RPG. If this game had come out 20 years ago, you would be having debates on whether Last Dream belongs in the top 3 RPGS along with Final Fantasy 6 and Chrono Trigger. The graphics are cheerful and colorful, and the music is a collection of great classical pieces, and you will find yourself humming along, and even recognizing many of them, and feeling cooler for doing so!\n\nWhile I beat the game within 40 hours the first time, the achievements added 100+ hours of replay-ability. You see, there are around a hundred achievements, some of which can't be completed in one playthrough. You have to do multiple playthroughs, and it took me some serious planning, but I managed to get them all done in 3 playthroughs. It is single-handedly the most fun achievement hunting I have ever done in a game.\n\nI look forward to Last Dream Expansion and Last Dream II.\n","June 27, 2015","true","774.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

That's the most important question to answer in a review, I think, and I'll answer that first: Probably. If you're even looking at the reviews for this game, chances are that you like the overall concept of it. Given that, yes, you absolutely should buy it. The gameplay is well-balanced and intuitive, the options are truly varied, and the old-school JRPG feeling really shines on here. A lot of love and a lot of learning have gone into this, and it shows.\n\nNow, to be a bit more specific:\n\nVisuals - Fantastic. Great art, very clear and quite pretty. Solid readability when encountering new things.\nMusic - Varies. Sometimes it's great, sometimes it's jarring, and many of the choices made here were just plain bizarre.\nBalance - Wonderful. You have the freedom to choose how you want to play, and cleverness will be rewarded.\nReplay - High. The various combinations for the main team, as well as some in-story decisions, invite exploration.\nWriting - Good. It's really quite strong in a few spots, but my socks were not knocked off.\nClarity - Good. If you read the strategy guide at all, bump that up to Near Perfect.\n\nOverall: Very highly recommended. I've really enjoyed my time spent in this game, and plan to spend much more. If you happen to find this game on sale or in a bundle, then pick it up even if it seems like it's not your thing.

For those well versed in SNES RPGs this reminds me of some mixture of Final Fantasy 4, Final Fantasy 5 and Lufia 2. Specifically the warring nations involved in the story (FF4); the class system and combat (FF5); and the puzzles and “The Abyss” optional dungeon (Lufia 2).\n\nBeyond the nostalgia there are some modern game features that are welcome additions to the formula. Perhaps the best of them is the macro system that lets you save a set of battle commands for all 4 of your characters that can be triggered quickly. This does away with needing to repeatedly mash out a simple 4x Attack round that is so commonly used or manually input the same series of stat boosting spells that you’ll use on most tough fights. They’ve also made it so you can customize the difficulty, encounter rate and amount of restriction on save location, without being locked into any choices.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by the added enjoyment I got out of all the achievements this game has. They unlock at a steady rate and give a similar feeling of reward as loot collecting. Many of them are tied to the optional activities abounding throughout the game and give a nice incentive to complete them. I won’t go into details on all the optional areas but I will say that I greatly enjoyed most of them and was thrilled by the variety to be found.\n\nThe class, skill and leveling up systems in Last Dream are all very satisfying. There’s not a lot surprising here but the wide range of flexibility in how you choose to progress your character’s stats and skills helps keep things engaging. You can further personalize things with gear and that includes a solid crafting system that focuses on steady collection of goods rather than random chance drops. One critique of the crafting is that I would have liked to see a sortable synthesis menu. Once you’ve amassed a decent number of recipes it becomes annoying to have to sift through them all to find the ones you want.\n\nAvoiding any spoilers I will say that the story was good, but not great. One major criticism I’ve always had of voiceless playable characters is that it then falls entirely on NPCs that you are infrequently in contact with to supply the game with interesting characters. This game is a prime example of that and, in my book, suffers because of it. That being said, I particularly enjoyed the character arc of the villain. I also want to give a big thumbs up for the huge amount of town NPC dialogue that continually evolves throughout the game, always reflecting the major happenings in the storyline. This does SO much to make the game world come alive.\n\nFinally I’d like to point out that while the soundtrack was patched together from a lot of different sources, it all comes together brilliantly with loads of excellent tracks.","April 5, 2014","true","57.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

White Giant was so careful about creating a new game that very much stands on its own despite being a tribute to the RPGs of old. I recommend this to everyone who enjoyed the early Final Fantasy/Dragon Quest games but feel like their respective developers have lost touch with their roots.\n\n\nPros:\n\n-Awesome, awesome, AWESOME leveling system. Choosing what stats I want to level is something RPGs almost never do.\n\n-REPLAYABILITY AND CUSTOMIZATION. You can edit so many options in this game and take so many paths with so many different party combinations that you only have the same experience twice if you're doing it intentionally.\n\n-Secondary Abilities. It's not a totally new concept, but it's done so well here. What Engineers, Thieves, and Hunters lack on the battlefield (at least until class upgrade), they more than make up for in convenience of travel and bonus loot.\n\n-Aside from combat decisions, that dastardly RNG seems to be downplayed here. No more repetitive "GAME OVER" screens because an enemy with a 10% chance of causing instant death does it to your entire party 5 times in a row.\n\n-The game has a linear story, but not a linear world. You can explore much of it and do many events out of the logical order.\n\n-Class upgrades, we've missed you.\n\n-Great Soundtrack\n\n-Nostalgic goodness\n\n-While some of the sidequests are\n\n\nCons\n\n-The dialogue. The story is interesting, but a lot of the dialogue is pretty contrived. It's hard to watch a story unfold when your eyes have rolled into the back of your head.\n\n-While I appreciate a game that doesn't feel the need to hold your hand through a story, there are times in which the next objective is a little unclear. If you are really into sidequests or you get distracted easily, this can potentially screw you up until you've sailed/flown to every objective on the map looking for what you're supposed to be doing.","February 19","true","68.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

(it's a ~15 min cutscene).\n\n- gameplay/combat: overall good, though some things are a bit unbalanced (thief's throwing stars, I'm looking at you). once you get the powerful abilities it gets a bit repetitive, since you just spam them and one-hit almost every non-boss. but I have to admit I was a bit overleveled by the endgame. other than that, bosses are (usually) a real challenge.\n\n- gameplay/character progression: fantastic, you build them the way you want. LOTS of options, and not just "flavour" ones, every decission matters.\n\n- level design: overall good. I didn't noticed anything annoying regarding it, so, that's a good signal. on the other hand, I'm not sure I liked the "flavoured" dungeons, e.g. the dread woods (was that one?), where it seems to be a perpetual storm. sure, it added immersion, but it was kinda difficult to see where you were going....\n\n- puzzles: some of them are actually intelligent ones, but some of them are just a matter of skill (eg. run following a pattern). overall good. also, you can skip them if you want.\n\n- graphics: they fit the game. but obviously, if you are looking for fancy 3D graphics (like skyrim's), then looks elsewhere. this game is not about graphics.\n\n- bottom thoughts: maybe I haven't played anough JRPGs to make a better comparison, but it kinda reminded me of pokemon. It has that kind of replayability, sadly, my backlog is too huge to starti it again now. It will have to wait a bit. also, be sure to take a look at the manual/guide. I'm not saying you need to follow the walkthrough, but in some points, it's well worth it to take a look at where you are supposed to go next. else you could keep wandering around for some time.... or finish a dungeon before you were supposed to start it. (say, I got to the end of the marsh before getting the crystals... and the medallion wasn't there, lol. it was a difficult dungeon, so I ended up overleveled. but it was FUN to take such a high-level dungeon a few levels under the recommendation. maybe I need to try a higher difficulty on my next playthrough)","October 24, 2014","true","37.1"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

The way the game is set up allows for as much or as little customization as the player wants. For example, you can throughly customize each stat for each member of your chosen party when you level up, or you can just pick a general category for your level up points to be assigned to. There are loads of side-quests, collectibles, and other completion things that will keep you exploring the massive world for hours on end.\n\nThe world is great. The soundtrack ranges from fast and heavy to ethereal and serene and even includes a few classical pieces. The environments are charming. One of my favorite parts of the towns is the books on people's shelves and tables. They're actual books written by actual people. I love the attention to detail and the surprises you find in exploring the world.\n\nBeyond just the game itself, the developers are very helpful and responsive to player feedback. They have produced a gargantuan strategy guide (available on their website) that can help you with whatever you need. There is also an expansion that is nearing completion as of now (October 2015) and a sequel on the horizon.\n\nIf you're going to have one turn-based RPG in your library, this is the one to have!","October 22, 2015","true","52.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm going to ignore the fact that this is indeed an RPG Maker game so if you feel cheated because someone uses an engine like that to make a solid title thats your problem not mine. I will be writing this review with 1 clear of a Warrior/Engineer/Hunter/Thief on Normal diff, average encounter, No saving in dungeons, yes you get lots of pregame options to your RPG experience with this one)\n\nGameplay: I'd probably give this one an 8. If you played the original Final Fantasy (or any of the remakes) then you know roughly 70% of the content and can anticipate everything your going to encounter. Then you add lots of side quests, mini games, and things that ADD players/achievement hunters will play all year with and you got yourself a solid game. In terms of the actual gameplay, the game has a level system with free reign on growth using ability points (AP) that you can spend as well. Also gives you a job system to specialize your characters with skills. Engineers can use tunnel holes to go from A to B while a regular party has to go around. This game even has puzzles from blocks to memorization to blow stuff up with limited bombs.\n\nAll in all the main issue with the gameplay is that some classes can be completely useless based on a SINGLE SOLE ITEM. Fishing or leveling a White Mage, I did fishing, and was almost happy I didn't roll a healer, why is this possible? The game even gives you items if you do things that are broken to the point you can just equip 1 or 2 things, tank the final boss solo.\n\nAudio: 6, The song library is HUGE, the flaw, some songs are better than others. Every area has a unique tune so you rarely repeat, but then you get some terrible tracks for some areas, and some amazing ones in others that I could use the like/hate factor better than flipping a coin. Also the sfx of the game is par for the course, lightning is lightning, but everyones heard lightning before.\n\nGraphics, 6 same with the audio things are just par for the course.\n\nEntertainment: This is variable, if you like the retro 8-16bit RPG's you'll enjoy this one because the RPG element is pretty good, but the gameplay feels as dated so if you expect the experience to be made for the 21st century, you better buy a time machine. If you are a big 100% player, you could probably spend between 100-200 hours doing it, and hope you don't miss something. I'd give this a 7 because while I liked it once, I'm probably not planning to play through it again anytime soon, and to score a great mark, I WANT to play the 2nd playthrough within 24-48 hrs, and this just doesn't.

Great visuals and minimalist art inspired by 16-bit SNES games, with a surprisingly good soundtrack.\n\nMost classes have unique abilities that come into play during exploration, interactions, or combat, increasing their utility beyond just battles and changing the way one might explore the world or forward the story. The frequency of random encounters and enemy strength can be adjusted (at the expense of some achievements), and it's possible to configure a "save anywhere" option.\n\nThe partial controller support is adequate, but inconsistent. Menu navigation is a bit cumbersome and often clumsy, possibly a limitation of the tools used to build the game. Interface and system options, such as adjusting resolution, aren't clearly communicated.","July 29, 2014","true","1.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Personally, I disagree with this negative sentiment - they can be deep, engaging games, like Starless Umbra, and this is one of them. It starts out feeling like a shameless Final Fantasy I clone (besides the title's obvious reference, your first quest is to go to a temple and rescue the village leader's daughter), which in and of itself isn't all that bad, but that changes as soon as that's done; you're given a decent chunk of land to explore and partake in side quests throughout before advancing the main story. There's tons of secrets and achievements in the game, and you can customize your party's stat gains and skill advancement completely. It sounds cumbersome, but it's rather simple - you can even just set them along preset paths if you wish. It's well worth your money, and the developers are hard at work fixing any bugs that pop up. A must play for fans of classic JRPGs.","June 19, 2014","true","18.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

(If it's on sale there's no reason not to get this, if it's not  $10 is still a steal)\n\n[Length - very good]: I'm 30 hours in and only 16% done with it. There's tons of sidequests, puzzles, monster hunting, treasure hunting, achievements, crafting and other challenge modes you can take on so there is a ton of more time to put into the game. I forgot to add they've got an expansion and full-on sequel in the works.\n\n[Soundtrack - bad]: My only negative is that the music can be a little grating because certain notes are too high or off key. I don't hate it by any means but I can see it being really annoying to people who are sound sensitive. (You can turn off the music at least)\n\n[Characters - good]: You get to pick from 8 classes, multiple of the same class can be chosen, and each one has a unique purpose as well as being able to upgrade to a more advanced form. There's custom stat placement, skill trees and of course equipment to choose from.\n\n[Story - good]: I can't give a real score for this yet since I'm not too far in, but it's keeping me interested to find out more so that's a plus. As a side note- Depending on your party choices, the results of events in the story change.\n\n[Combat - good]: It's exactly like any other turn-based JRPG of old except for the macro option which makes killing trash while traveling somewhere go much faster.\n\n[Difficulty - good]: It's entirely up to you how hard or easy you want the game to be and you can change the difficulty at any time from the in-game options.\n\n[Graphics - average]: It is what it is, RPG Maker for one thing, but the content and execution is what makes RPGs so charming and the fact this game is trying to be a homage to old school games makes it justifiable.","January 8, 2015","true","79.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But, I would say overall it is enjoyable. The game itself draws inspiration from classic RPGs like Final Fantasy (Obviously, given the title), Lufia, and so forth. Surprisingly, even though it uses the RPG Maker medium, it does so well, and the game itself can be compared favorably to its source materials.\n\nI'd like to start with three of my favorite aspects of this game, followed by three of its largest drawbacks. Favorable items first:\n\n1. Gameplay - I was genuinely surprised how much I enjoyed the gameplay in Last Dream. You can still tell it's an RPG Maker product, of course, but there's a lot to do and experience in the game. Sidequests alone can take days. The game can be unforgiving if you find yourself in a high-level zone too early or running up against a boss monster hunt that's way above your current level, but this is actually a good point; I don't like cookie-cutter experiences where everything just happens to be about as strong as your party. There's also some enjoyable puzzles in the game... and some very unenjoyable ones. But, the ratio of good to bad is definitely leaning toward good.\n\n2. Music - Oh MAN. The music in this game is fantastic. There's unique battle themes for almost much every continent, dungeon, and boss in the game. Town music is suitably mild, with no jarring sound to draw away from exploration or just popping in to save your game. I was not expecting the quality of music in this game to be as high as it is, but it definitely rocks.\n\n3. Story - I'm actually listing story as both the best and worst of this game, and I'll explain the other half in a bit. But as far as the favorable aspect of story goes, I felt that the progression of events was mostly well done.  You can actually take a couple of approaches to several smaller details in the story, and they end up affecting some of the details of later events. I won't spoil anything, but I will say that exploration is key.\n\nAnd, the drawbacks:\n\n1. Story - The actual story is... well... not very original, in my opinion. Don't get me wrong, the setting is great, and there are some pretty cool characters that pop up every now and again. The cogs of the main story, however, just seem to turn from some pretty noticeable force by means of deus ex machina. Again, this isn't necessarily deviating from the source material, but I felt like the main storyline was just something the game punished me with occasionally when I finished sidequest chains. I wish the main story had more to offer me.\n\n2. Length - Sort of hand in hand with the previous item, a lot of the game felt like it was drawn out farther than it had to be. I love a long and involved game that has good reason for eating up sixty hours of my life, but a lot of this game's main storyline felt like busywork. Also... I really wish the dev team had decided to add a skip option for the ending credits. The staff definitely deserves recogintion, but after beating the game a couple of times I end up just making myself a mixed drink and reading a book while I wait fifteen minutes for the credits to finish.\n\n3. Moa - I don't often call out things specifically when they usually just seem like minor details, but the Moa section of the game was easily the most annoying and pointless portion of the entire package. I know the game is inspired by Final Fantasy, and that's great. But, to literally throw chocobos into the game world, rename them, and then force the player to do everything that FF7 already did in order to make them useful seems like an unusually poor decision on White Giant's part. I feel it also made the Hunter class laughably pointless, and easily the most useless of the available class choices.\n\nPhew, long review. Again, overall, I found this game has more to recommend it than not. I would recommend trying it yourself to see what you think. I believe the developers have also mentioned a Last Dream II being in the works, so I'll be keeping an eye on that to see how it's coming along.","October 25, 2015","true","33.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

If you like any of those than you have to play this game. I have played for about 8 hours so far and I am really liking this and it is somewhat of a departure from Final Fantasy because it allows you to apply increases to all your stats when you level up which allows for some freedom. You have to be somewhat intelligent on how you apply the increases depending on your party and the variety is there since you can pick any combination of classes just like in Final Fantasy 1. If you want all black mages you can do that. But balance is also important. You even get an upgraded version of each class just like in Final Fantasy 1.\n\nThe references to Final Fantasy are also everywhere in this game. This game also does not reinvent the wheel or do anything all that fancy but if you yearn for the old days of Final Fantasy when things were a little more simple and grinding was the order of the day then this is the game for you.\n\nCombat is the same as FF too. Random Encounters that go to a different "battle screen". Using strategy is sometimes important and buffing abilities are extremely important especially in boss battles. The combat is not too challenging and as long as you understand the way each class works and there strengths it is pretty easy.\n\nThis game definitly caters to a niche fan base and as such may not be the best for people that are not fond of old school JRPGs.\n\n","December 8, 2014","true","3.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Some people consider those games to be a joke just because of that fact. This game isn't and is far superior to many other RPGs which weren't made using that tool.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n* The level of customization in this game is excellent. You can choose your own 4-character party from a total of 8 classes and build them in any way you wish (you assign stat and skill points). There is a lot of strategizing to be done in how you choose your party and how you build it.\n* Variable difficulty levels. I played on Hard and it was just right for me. If you dislike a challenge, there are much easier difficulty levels; likewise, if you want to be truly challenged, there are harder difficulty levels.\n* A lot of content and sidequests. Really impressive, it's definitely a lot!\n* Puzzles that are reminiscent of Lufia 2; but optional to complete the game.\n* Engaging and interesting story.\n* A fair amount of post-game content (although getting to, and beating the final boss is rather challenging by itself).\n* The amount of achievements is incredible. Sure feels like there is a lot, maybe too many, but it still does feel pretty good to earn one.\n* There are flaws and exploits in the game's system, but strangely enough, they seem to be intentional. For example, fishing can net you a lot of money and healing items that are simply awesome; Monks can deal an absolutely astounding amount of damage; and some others I won't say. The reason I feel this is positive is because I found the process of finding them and using them very fun, and I know that in the highest difficulty it's going to be very challenging.\n\nTHE NOT SO GOOD:\n* The Abyss dungeon is a little uninteresting, in comparison to, say, the Ancient Cave in Lufia 2 (which was definitely an inspiration).\n* I feel the world map is a little too large, and since there is no minimap, it's hard to get lost (you need to check the map to see where you are).\n* The game resolution is far too small.\n* I feel that stacking HP buffs is pretty "cheap" - I went through the game using only one HP buff, and when I finally learned I could stack them, everything else was made easy because they just couldn't kill me. With a white mage and buff items, you can easily quadruple your max HP in the late game.\n* The grind for materials earned from monsters can be a pain later on, when you need 10 of a material dropped by a monster that comes out pretty rarely.\n* There aren't enough save points in the game. You might want to choose "save anywhere", as going to a church to save is very time consuming.\n* Some of the later enemies are pretty uninspiring, and frankly there aren't enough high leveled monsters.\n\n\nI was skeptical when I bought this game at full price, as I really wanted to play a game of the sort. But this game surprised me positively. I spent 45+ hours in it, and still I feel tempted to play it again in a harder difficulty with a different party composition.\n\nBottom line:\n* If you have played and liked Lufia 2, buy it.\n* If you like RPGs particularly from the SNES era, try the demo - don't hesitate.\n\nCongratulations to the developers, and I'm really looking forward to the expansion and to the next game you're going to be releasing. :)","April 27, 2014","true","60.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

This game is fully realized, deep, and polished, but easy to get into, and without overwhelming you with extraneous minutiae, the way some needlessly complex games can.\n\nLast Dream is a professional production made by people with a deep understanding of what makes these games tick.  The mechanics are fun and engaging, and it is well-balanced throughout... although I'm not really sure how one makes it through the "Legendary" difficulty.  I tried that out briefly and I'll just say that you'd better be some next-level kind of hardcore player to consider taking that on.\n\nAnyway, I've completed the entire game, done pretty much all of the optional content (of which there is quite a bit), and done a full "Reborn" run (restart from the beginning with a level 1 party retaining all your end-game items), so I know this game well.

It seems the designers put no limit on what the game was going to be, so it tries to be everything at the same time and falls slightly short of pulling them all off.  The economics in the game are not balanced and most gold (at least early on) comes not from direct battle, but from selling the additional drops from enemies.  Equiping each character to their level becomes nearly impossible.\nI love the number of options for character class selection, but this too suffers under it's own weight, so many classes and special abilities that they overwhelm the player.  The mapping is pretty weak.  There is also an unexplainable lag in the overworld as you walk.  It is most notible when you enter a town or small building and suddenly goes away.\nI do like the game and I like the use of RPG Maker to create it, but I wish they had targeted less options and made them great, rather than an enormous number of options that still need to eb refined and balanced.","May 8, 2014","true","5.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

This is the first I have ever supported an RPG Maker game with my money. Got it during the $5 sale.\n\nWhen I first started playing I was not impressed. The story and everything that happens in the beginning is just poorly written and makes no sense really. The main character is warped to another dimension and befriends someone named Dante almost immediatley and the main character just goes along with him as if it is no big deal and does not mention those he left behind until an hour or so into the game. It was a very rough start for this game for me.\n\nI decided to not give up on it just yet. I continued playing and the more I played the more I started liking it and that is mainly due I think in part to the flashback cutscenes and leveling my characters up assigning stat points and skill points. It became very addictive.\n\nGraphically on full screen alot of the textures are muddy, would have been nice if this was designed with HD 16:9 displays in mind. But it doesn't look too horrible though.\n\nThe soundtrack is a bit hit or miss. Many tracks are great but some are just classic compositions redone with metal riffs and other such nonsense. Don't get me wrong I like that stuff, just would have liked to have heard more original music. Also you can hear a click after some loops/songs. But other than a few issues the soundtrack is fine.\n\nI would definitley recommend this game to anyone that is a fan of the old 8 and 16-bit RPG's from back in the day like Final Fantasy 1, 2, 3 and the Dragon Warrior/Quest series.\n\nAgain the game has a rough start but after you get past that and start playing more it kind of gets it's groove and feels like a good ol' RPG should.\n\nAs of right now I would give this game a 6.5/10. It's pretty average, nothing to write home about, but if you are looking for a new classic style RPG to play then I would recommend trying the demo and then pick it up if you like it. It's not bad at all, and it has some nice puzzles to solve as well.","March 17, 2014","true","14.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Despite only playing for about an hour, the initial impression that it leaves on me isn't a good one.\n\nFrom an RPG game, I expect a likable and exciting story line that captivates me and just makes me sit on the edge of my seat in anticipation as to what's going on next. This is because most well-written stories have the player empathize with the characters on screen, and make the player feel motivated to reach that end goal. This game, not so much. You have no clue what's going on, and it never really explains. There's no apparent end goal from what I can see, and the only goal thrown to you at the start is one you could care less about: saving a person's daughter who you have no connection with or have never met.\n\nNext up: controls. They suck. I've heard some stuff that the mapping for controls on an XBOX Controller is terrible and awkward, but I'm focusing on the keyboard, as that's what I've used. It's uncomfortable and awkward. It's strictly keyboard usage, which means you can't use the mouse at all, so navigating through menus in a pain to me, because I'm more used to using the mouse. Perhaps I'm just being picky, but the controls for the keyboard aren't the best, and it took me about thirty minutes just to figure out how to select and name my characters.\n\nThe last thing I'm going to touch is how difficult this game is. Now, a challenge in any game is good, and defeating that challenge makes it even more rewarding in the end because you feel as if you actually conquered something. In this game, it's cheap. All monsters do so much damage, while you can only do anywhere from 1 - 10 damage to them, depending on the class type. And you don't get any special abilites or skills to start with, either. That means every class you picked is basically just a stronger or weaker character that only has one attack. So, it makes it hard to get anywhere in this game, because in the beginning, you're getting your butt handed to you by a low level slime. This is why I have only played an hour on this game, because I can't get over this hill which prevents me from completing a battle and earning XP.\n\nThis game was a real disappointment to me. I'm sorry that I haven't played more of it to get a bit of a feel for the game, but as I've said, the initial hill to pass to actually beat monsters effectively is too steep to climb. That's why I can't recommend this game to anyone, and those who believe this game is actually worth $10, I'm afraid you're wrong in my eyes. It could have been done much better, but this was made in a $70 program that you can get on Steam, so I doubt much coding was really needed.\n\nThank you for reading my review.","May 11, 2014","false","1.1"," 21 of 41 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","21","41","0","0"

Giant Moas (Chocobos).","September 30, 2014","true","132.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

However that said, it is still a lot of fun and visually pleasing with it`s old feel to it and with good gameplay, but the controls leave something to be desired.","March 17, 2014","true","0.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Enjoying this game quit a bit, have a few complaints. You don't really have any story line attached to your characters. You just kind of pick 4 random classes and go with it. The attachment that I have had to characters in old SNES RPG's was a cool thing, but it's not in this game, which doesn't mean the game isn't still really good. My other complaint is there is no map, or at least none that I've come across, and this world is pretty large.

It doesn't have any particularly amazing features but don't get me wrong. It's amazingly good at what it is. It's kept me excited and entertained throughout the story. There are tons of side quests to take up and different activities to do from crafting to fishing to moa racing. Lots of tributes to old RPGs too. I especially like the leveling system. When you level you get points to put into any attributes you want so you completely customize your team. I like to play very defensively so I put a lot of points into defense. No one can hit me now. It takes longer to kill enemies but I can wander around the dungeons forever.","June 29, 2014","true","27.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

If you liked any of the older Final Fantasies (I-IV), this is right up your alley.\n\nThe combat system is typical turn based JRPG. You control how you level down to each stat choice, and 8 different classes to choose from means your party has a large number of combinations to try out.\n\nThe game world is very vast and there is quite a lot to explore. It's RPGMaker, so you get what you get, but aside from those limitations,\n\nThe music is diverse and gives the game a great atmosphere as the song choice was very good for each location you visit.\n\nThere are many mini-games to play that are fun. The world is filled with 50 puzzles, some hard, some easy, all puzzling. Racing Moas (Read: Chocobos), battling monsters in the Arena, and gambling in the casino give you plent to do alongside the side quests and main story.","October 13, 2014","true","149.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I was a bit confused when the initial configuration included an option to skip all cutscenes, but I got it after playing for a bit that the story is a mere filler in this grind fest. You don't get gold for defeating monsters Instead you'll get ingredients to 'synthesize' gear or just to sell them to buy useful things. When you level up you get points that you have to spend on your attributes and skills. This sounds like a great way to customize your characters, but it turns out to be more a waste of time and keeping track of things that could happen automatically.\n\nTake out the story from an JPRG and throw in a lot of micro management and you'll end up with this.

An incredibly detailed game that, though the story line is a little basic (like most in this genre) it more than compensates with adequate side missions and quests along the way. The game was addictive. The soundtrack was fair, but I did expect a little more out of it. It was an orginal for sure. The developers surely put in a lot of time to make the game interesting, challenging, insightful, and incredibly fun. If this is your type of game, get it!

My only complaint would be the grind, i just got off the 1st continent and im level 15, you stop learning new abilities at level 20. now im assuming theres either not a level cap and you keep going without adding more skills but if that were the case i would still like to see some skills post level 20 added even if its just a few "ultimate" skills that have a very large SP cost to learn. But i digress the game is very retro, the game is exceptionally fun and the story is kind of plain but there are dozens of side quests and places to explore making up for any short comings in the main story. overall 4/5 from me, highly recommended and cheap retro style rpg with a couple hundred achieves, well worth the price.","February 15, 2015","true","8.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I especially like how the developers made the effort to reduce the time spent on the more tedious aspects of the old RPGs by providing the player with things like the ability to set battle macros and speed up the game temporarily.

They are all ones I would list as 'Pro'. While the few I enjoyed the most being the custom Leveling and Party Building.\n\nPut simply, this may be an RPG Maker game, more than enough effort was put into customizing the experience so that it hardly feels like one, and more like an old skool JRPG.\n\nI'll also note that I have not experienced the Arena, Abyss, or the Hunters Guild... But if I understand them, I doubt I would appreciate them if I did. They strike me as cookie cutter grinds, and there is already plenty of that in the default travel mechanics as most point of interest are extremely far from each other.\n\nlastly, I'll mention that I am still intent on playing the game, so the 11 hrs (as of this review) is just a start, though I think PLENTY of time to form an opinion.\n\nHere are my criticisms. (In order of irritation)\n\n#1: Lack of quest log.\nWith all the custom scripting put into this title I am dumfounded as to WHY even a simple quest log wasn't one of them. As a result it is WAY TO EASY to get side tracked and no remember what the hell the point was of being wherever you are. ESPECIALLY after taking a few days off from playing it, or playing other games in the interim.\n\n#2: Skill Purchasing.\nThere is NO WAY to know why you should choose one skill before another, due to a complete lack of cost, restriction, and condition information for almost ALL level up purchasable skills. A one line blurb simply isn't enough. Its implementation is an illusory depth that would serve equally if it were an auto gain on level up, like 99% of JRPG's.\n\n#3: Specialty Classes.\nThere is simply NO reasonable excuse for the way the specialty classes, (e.g. engineer) are implemented. One is forced to choose this specialty before the game even begins, and is LOCKED into it without full context as to how each ones 'specialty' (*cough* weakness) is made up for by choosing it.\n\nI mention the engineer specifically due to the LOUGHABLE specialty to side step travel via tunnels... Which IRONICALLY serves more to remove needed leveling (grinding) than anything, as the time saved using the tunnels will have to be made up for in between by fighting more battles to make up for using the tunnels in the first place. AND you've stuck fighting those 'make up' battles with a weak alternative to another class, or whatever...\n\nYou're BETTER OFF totally ignoring the specialty classes. (or so it seems)\n\nThere are  few more but they are minor.\n\nOver all, the positives outweighed the negatives, and I would recommend this game.\n","May 22, 2015","true","11.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I had to go ahead to the next town, buy equipment and then synthesize even better equipment to survive that boss\n-Early in the game some people mention some numbers to you, several hours later you find doors that want number codes to let you in, go back and talk to the same people again and they're congratulating you on getting a ship instead of telling you the damn numbers\n-♥♥♥♥ING DEATH SPELLS\n-I'm sure there are more annoying things in this game but I quit near the start of the second continent so I don't know what the other annoying things are\n\nPositives:\n-Being able to choose everyone's class and palette scheme is nice\n-Being able to murder guardsmen to avoid paying exorbitant inn fees is also nice","July 22, 2015","false","16.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

First off, the game allows controller support, which is great, but it screws it up. The default for action confirmations is "X", instead of the usual "A" (assuming an XBox controller). There's a way to customize the buttons, but it doesn't tell you what buttons you're changing, so it's impossible. I don't know what "button 1" is, so I don't know what to change it to.\n\nThe second is that the game only plays in a tiny window. TINY. I can't even read most of the text, and there's no options to change it. Need full screen at least.\n\nLastly, the game brags customized characters, which is great, but when you start, none of your characters have ANY skills whatsoever. You have to grind skill points (which I like, I like an alternate reason to grind, Grandia 2 did it great), but I'm only getting 9 points per encounter, and the cheapest skill some of my characters has cost 100 skill points. Really, all four characters have nothing but an attack early on, and monsters do plenty of damage to you. And this is on EASY. I'm sure it gets great later, but I can't play it until these things are fixed.\n\nAfter playing a little, I can't believe how grindy this game is. Even on easy, I get to a point where I'm just getting WRECKED. And I'm a fan of a little grinding in RPG's. And I have grinded a little in this game. But even still, getting destroyed by stuff on easy after already grinding out some levels is insane. It's Japanese MMO level grinding, and it's a little overkill.","March 17, 2014","false","3.2"," 14 of 39 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","14","39","0","6"

Nonsense ! " and I understand that it can seem insufficient. I will update if I find the courage to soldier on, for now, here are my thoughts.\n\nEdit : this is not a widely known game, so If you have time, please share your opinion. I didn't write this to bash the game and I'd like to see diverging points of view, instead of seeing  silent downvotes.\n\nFirstly, Last Dream is a successful hommage to the RPGs of old. Indeed you will get a (relative) vintage Final Fantasy vibe (nothing like FF6, but hey, comparing to a masterpiece would be unfair), what with the combat system and the available classes. It holds a quite straightforward approach.\nThe gameplay is basic but allocating yourself the stats boosts at each level feels more involving, together with the possibility to unlock several skills- passive abilities, spells and special combat actions. They are numberful, reasonably varied but not too terribly inventive either. Classes themselves have a gimmick to them : thieves can unlock chests in cities, black mages can warp you out of a dungeon (even if it should be an option for all parties), beastmasters can tame chocobos, etc.\nThe developers have been keen enough to allow the player to save anywhere and adjust the random encounters rate, as well as implementing seven levels of difficulty, wich is quite nice.\n\nEven if it's nothing outstanding, the gameplay is not at fault. The design is already a bit. Your first quest ? Saving a woman you don't know, daughter of man you barely know, by going to some shady ruins near. Yup, she has been kidnapped by bats (yes, giant bats) for no apparent reason. The ruins have basic monsters, a cheesy puzzle, no boss (save... really weak bats) and there she is rescued, just so you can have several more starting items.\nOh, by the way, you are supposed to be someone from another world just wanting to go home, in training for one year and having befriended three generic individuals. It gives a bad feeling and for those four hours, I found absolutely nothing compelling about the story.\nNone of your party member ever say anything, you are pointed in vague directions (go find two random elven relics ! Gosh, can you get more cliché than that ?) and the "visions" you have reveal the beginning of a generic plot " Oh my, a demon has possesed one of the Elders, whoops we screwed up trying to banish it !"\nIt is difficult to relate to your characters, Last Dream just doesn't offer much incentive to go on. NPCs aren't much better : your usual bunch with 80% saying either not funny, not informative or not interesting things.\n\nNow I perfectly get that for some players, smashing monsters, levelling up, exploring dungeons and getting loot is the meat of a JRPG. Even so, I think the gameplay is not deep enough to warrant a purchase.\nSee the store page for yourself, they try to make you think the game is ever so rich, just by piling numbers over numbers : " Look ! We have so much of element X, more of element Y and even more of element Z ! "\n4000 party variations and 500 unique paths, for examples, are just smoke and mirror. You've gone to the mine before trekking to the oasis  and not the other way around ? There's a different path. It's not like branching parts of the scenario, wich would have been interesting.\nYes, you are quite in a free-roaming world for the genre but it doesn't amount to much in the end.\nThe puzzles are also not mind-bending. So far, it has been pushing rocks/blocks and levers. Hourray ?\n\nI may seem harsh, but I find the store page a bit pretentious. Four hours are sufficient to tell the narrative quality of RPG, stating that Last Dream has an in-depth, captivating storyline is simply a lie. For all I can tell, it is classic and dull, with a really poor introduction.\nIn the end, I think you should be really craving for a simple JRPG to overlook such flaws. It's not bad game, just far from the quality it thinks it shows.","August 4, 2014","false","4.3"," 5 of 22 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","5","22","0","0"

I'm actually about 20 hours in.\nAnd this game is boring.\nEverything that is supposed to make it interesting comes straight from other OSRPGs. There is NOTHING new. I know this is suppose to be a "love letter" to the genre, but c'mon, NOTHING NEW?!\nAnd making it big doesn't help. Making it free-roaming doesn't help. Having different music for every friggin' screen doesn't help.\nI had high hopes for this game cuz I love the genre, but I was eventually very let down. I hear they're making a sequel. Hope it's better.\n\nEDIT: Dec. 15, 2014\n\nSo I've given this game a second chance because I really do like the genre a lot. And I have figured out why games like the early Final Fantasy titles and the Ultima games worked while this one just doesn't.\nIn order for games like this to not bore the player to tears, there has to be a good story. There have to be compelling characters that have to develop. Or failing that, there HAS to at least be an interesting world built around the gameplay. In this game the story and the world-building very much seem to come fourth or fifth. We are introduced to the main chracter in the excellent beginning to the game, and then nothing. All of a sudden he has three friends and they're off on the quest. I like that it doesn't ♥♥♥♥ around with backstory before getting to the gameplay, but hours into the game there's still nothing in the way of character development and only scant flashback cutscenes for world-building.\nYou're The Hero in A Far-Off Land and that's really about it.\nWithout that compelling story and characters, the game really is just repetitive command-clicking. And for such a large world with so much to do in it, it gets repetitive awfully fast. This seems like an 80-hour game, and, for the second time now, I can't make it past the 20-hour mark.\nZeboyd makes tongue-in-cheek OSRPGs with neat characters and mixed-up gameplay (Cthulu Saves The World, Precipice of Darkness).  Try those instead. Or go back and play some Ultima titles. Or hell, read a book!","March 27, 2014","false","22.5"," 5 of 24 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","5","24","0","1"

Just like FF1, you have a selection of classes to build your party from (although you get 8 instead of 6). All the old classes are here; the warrior, monk, thief, black mage, white mage, and grey mage (the analog to red mage). As a side note, even the old Dia spell is here; the white mage spell whose sole purpose is to deal tons of damage, but only to undead. The two newcomers are the engineer, who lets you take shortcuts via tunneling and specializes in consumable items in combat, and the hunter, who lets you scan enemies, revealing their stats and granting a damage boost against them. Of course, just like FF1, you only get to pick four. Picking my four from those eight proved to be one of the most difficult choices I've made in my gaming life. I won't tell you what I picked; I'd rather not influence your choice.\n\nThe game itself seems to have a strong emphasis on building your party the way you want. No part of character growth is automated; you get to control it all. Your characters learn skills by accumulating skill points in the same way you gain xp, then spending them on the skills you want. Even when your characters level up, nothing happens immediately; rather, your character gains a pile of stat points which you can allocate as you choose. As a result, combat is less about the exact skills you use in combat and more about how your built your characters. This can potentially be a very bad thing; if you suddenly reach a boss who consistantly wrecks your face, it may be a sign that you built wrong. On the flip side, it can reduce the grinding you need to do to get past a problem boss. If it deals exclulsively physical damage, just level up once and dump all your points into physical defense.","September 1, 2015","true","22.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Of course, just like FF1, you only get to pick four. Picking my four from those eight proved to be one of the most difficult choices I've made in my gaming life. I won't tell you what I picked; I'd rather not influence your choice.\n\nThe game itself seems to have a strong emphasis on building your party the way you want. No part of character growth is automated; you get to control it all. Your characters learn skills by accumulating skill points in the same way you gain xp, then spending them on the skills you want. Even when your characters level up, nothing happens immediately; rather, your character gains a pile of stat points which you can allocate as you choose. As a result, combat is less about the exact skills you use in combat and more about how your built your characters. This can potentially be a very bad thing; if you suddenly reach a boss who consistantly wrecks your face, it may be a sign that you built wrong. On the flip side, it can reduce the grinding you need to do to get past a problem boss. If it deals exclulsively physical damage, just level up once and dump all your points into physical defense.","September 1, 2015","true","22.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The developers clearly are passionate about their work, and they put a level of craftsmanship into it that does the Final Fantasies/Dragon Warriors/Lufias proud.  If you're looking for a NES/SNES jRPG experience, you really can't go wrong with this game.\n\nGraphics: 7/10 - Stock/standard RPG maker graphics.  Nothing out of the ordinary to see here, but nothing bad either.  Enemy sprites are pretty solid, everything else is so-so.\n\nSound: 8.5/10 - Some original sounding scores, but none of the tracks were as memorable as things like Final Fantasy's crystal theme/Chocobo/Maria and Draco/Barron airships, etc.\n\nStory 8/10 - Pretty standard stuff, but I really like the cutscenes.\n\nGameplay 10/10 - This game is just a joy to play.  The combat and skill system is simple, but extensive with lots of choices on how you choose to develop your character.  Macro system takes the monotony out of the grind.  But the thing I like most is that the developer took every clever device from the 90s era and brought it into this game including: Monster hunting, puzzle solving, animal racing, ancient cave (lufia), fishing (which really is overpowered, I wish I had not fished as much as I did).\n\nValue/Overall:   10/10 - There are a few rough edges, but for this price point, you simply can't go wrong.  Honestly, had I paid about $30 I would feel like it was a fair deal - at $10, it's a bargain with many 10s of hours of playtime if you want to do all the optional things + the game is compelling enough that I could see doing it with a different party at some point in the future.","May 14","true","30.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's like an old-school Final Fantasy game but good.  Not often I say that about an RPGMaker game.  The storyline is good with some good characters in it.  Gameplay is just what you'd except from an old-school RPG.  Turned based with hours of fun.\n\nIf you like old-school (like me) games like Final Fantasy or Chrono Trigger or even Dragon Warrior (Quest), I would extremely recommend this game and get it.  Haven't beat it myself but it's a good buy as far as I have gotten.","April 10","true","38.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The absolute best part is the development team. You heard me - The Devs. There has rarely been a day where the Devs haven't posted on the forums, either answering questions or giving general updates. That combined with the mini competitions and games they run make this a very active game. It's not a "set it and forget it" game.\n\nBuy it.

What a fantastic game!  You can really tell that the creators put a lot of time and effort into making this game.\n\nThe Good:\nExcellent replayability (so many achievements, character combinations, difficulty levels, etc.)\nThe music changes often (don't like a battle theme in one area?  don't worry, it'll change for the others!)\nChallenging (or not, if you want)\nStory is interesting (though not phenomenial - it's very much like older RPGs in this regard)\nBalanced classes (for the most part - some would argue that thief isn't as useful for instance, but I like them)\nUnique abilities (scaning, for instance, gives the party buffs as well as info on the monster)\nNew Game+/Reborn (either keep your achievements in a new game, or keep your equipment/items - keeps things interesting!)\nNostalgic for old RPG lovers\nLots of puzzles and minigames\nSo much content!\n\nThe Bad:\nAddicting!  I waste so much time playing this.  Already over 80 hours at the time of this post.\nThe main character in the initial cutscene has white hair, but when you choose your characters, most don't match his/her appearance.\nLimited customization of character appearance (there's some, but limited)\nStory is similar to oldschool RPGs (this is both good and bad, IMO)\nA little laggy sometimes\n\nOverall, this is a wonderful game.  Don't let the RPG Maker style fool you - this game is a gem.","May 17","true","127.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The turn-based combat is pretty fun, if you're into turn-based RPG combat. The story is boring, though it has its moments of interest, it's really nothing to write home about. What you're getting into this game for is to Explore- to journey from one end of the world to another back and forth, combing it for details and loot and NPCs and anything else it has to offer you. Put your feet up, relax, and dive in. It's fun, in its own way, if you get into the mindset. If not- it will bore you, no real question about it. But if you're on board for just exploring and playing the pretty damn satisfying battle system, and enjoying the utterly bonkers soundtrack, this will be a fun one.\n\nOf note- there's a demo that's utterly MASSIVE, to the point that I recommend only playing a bit of it, because the saves don't transfer, and it can be boring playing through the same multiple hours of exploring again to catch up to where you were. Try it out though.","May 15","true","53.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
