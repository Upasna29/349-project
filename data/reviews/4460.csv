"http://steamcommunity.com/id/x4000/recommended/4460/","x4000","x-4000","http://steamcommunity.com/id/x4000/","493 products in account","This is really a tough review to write, because I really like a lot of what is going on here.  But ultimately I just never found it engaging on the level of, say, SimCity.  This has an awesome street view version that lets you walk around and actually FEEL like part of the city, and if you like that sort of thing then this game is definitely one you can have some fun with in that fashion.\n\nIn terms of the choices on how to build the city, it all feels a lot more abstract than SimCity, because of the way that there are these social groups and so on.\n\nIf you're looking for an entry into the city simulation genre, then probably SimCity 4 (despite its awkward controls by modern standards) is the way to go.  If you're into citybuilders as a genre and are looking for another good one after having exhausted others, I can definitely tell you that I had fun with this one despite my gripes.  But it's not one that held my attention for dozens of hours.\n\nI was really on the fence as to whether to give this a positive or negative review.  Ultimately I felt like I had fun and got my money's worth, though, so that's the main criteria that I guess I should use.  The developer should be able to do better, and I hope they get a chance.  I'd like to see this evolve in future sequels, but so far it was already fun for what it is.","September 24, 2014","true","15.0"," 67 of 77 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","67","77","4","6"

Theres always people complaining when you upgrade your city, but if you downgrade it, there's no way to get the population up. Factions that get close to each other fight, and they end up burning down a portion of the city, they make crime go up, or they destroy the economy. Essentially you can work up to a certain point, and the entire city will fail before you can expand further.\n\nAnother point to make, is that the business's in the game don't have any bonus's added to them, so the best way to run a city is to find the smallest building, and pack them together, because doing that will give absolutely no negative effects.\n\nI'd definitly reccommend this if you want a simplistic city simulator, but I greatly prefer Tropico 4 over this. The only fault with tropico is that the road system is absolutely terrible, and the only way to fix traffic is to redesign your city to situate the traffic better.","July 12, 2013","true","24.6"," 38 of 44 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","38","44","0","0"

There is a little lag in between games which is expected on Windows 8.1 running a game that was from 2008. Once you get understanding on the business to housing down and benefit the needs of all of your people, it works out great! I would suggest just reading over the tutorial that is there and testing out things slowly, adding a house here, then a business there and watching your money as you do so before diving head first into adding lots of houses and businesses.","January 29, 2015","true","8.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

But when it actually came to playing it, the system was broken and the game itself was so glitchy and sticky that I just gave up on it.  Juggling faction territory was a pain, balancing upgrades with population mood was a pain, and basically trying to do anything was a huge pain.  There is such thing as challenging and fun, but this was just challenging.  I wouldn't recommend it.  Try Banished instead.","February 21, 2015","false","0.5"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

I really like the idea of social classes occupying residential areas, being able to build per social class services, and different social classes not tolerating each other (meaning you may want to avoid mixing them up).\n\nBut this implementation of these ideas is very buggy -- it freezes up way too often just to display a bunch of errors on my screen. It also does not tolerate alttabbing (this is on 64bit Windows 8.1 and NVidia GTX 770). And I may be missing something, but I can't see autosave happening.\n\nThis means I've started off a couple of times already, but don't have any savegame to speak of.\n\nI'd say you may want to try it out, but bugs mean I found it too painful to actually play the game -- especially in face of competition.","April 3, 2015","false","1.0"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","3","9","0","0"

If you want a good city building sim, try what's been actually proven to be a good one, aka Sim City. The makers of this game were trying too hard to be different and yet bring something new and wonderful to the table. I found City Life to be the most boring game I've played EVER, not to mention the stupid instruction thing constantly telling me to build more houses when I don't even have the ones I built filled up with people. The mechanics themselves are simple in some areas, but in most it's complicated and a tad broken. Building a diverse sub-urb with buildings and things every "social culture" could like and not fight about was difficult enough. Imagine my anger when none of the people I built houses, infrastructure, and businesses for ever showed up. My town quickly became home to only one particular group of people simply because I was not able to attract anyone else besides super fanatical hipsters who's lifestyles are akin to people who live in rough built tin houses. With my patients wearing thin, I decided to make one last effort to make something out of the game and built a strip club, which even though was completely futile, was a little hilarious to be able to construct. "Lol, a strip club?" Were my exact thoughts, alongside "Why are there no blue collar people working at my blue collar beer factory?" and the long time award winner "Why is there no one manning the hospital?" Which btw, I had constructed so that the blue collars could work alongside the people I'm now refering to as "The Red Faction" because of their hideous, and often tacky display of red in their models and buildings. Who also, no matter how often I tried, fought with every ♥♥♥♥ing group I had put next to them. Eventually I scrapped the town and tried again, this time starting out with the blue collars and the have nots (basically homeless people, because why not?). This town also went to the scrap pile when NO ONE ♥♥♥♥ING SHOWED UP. being 19,000 dollars in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I came up with a new plan. Build affordable housing and infrastru-....oh riiiight, that didn't work before, why would it work now? Well, off to the scrap yard again!\n\nAnyway, long story short, with the game constantly telling you to build houses for all eternity, random fights breaking out between social groups, and buildings costing everything you have with no one wanting to work for their freely given cozey houses, I quickly panicked in blind fury trying my best to find the "Burn everything to the ground with a random, but oddly planned out meteor attack" button or perhaps the age old favorite, "Kill everything with a tornado." That last one was always my favorite when ever I played Sim City. Facinating when all your problems can just go away when God sends you a lovely gust of wind so you can start fresh and forget all your troubles. Ahhhhhhh....wonderful.","January 13, 2015","false","1.9"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","25","4","16","3","6"
