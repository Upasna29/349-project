Campiness and minor technical flaws are often part of the package, and I'm okay with that. So I was fine with realizing that the intro gave me a game breaking bug (on Win 8.1 64x) that there are no known solutions for: I watched the intro on youtube, then skipped it when launching the game, and thought little of it. The terrible (not an exaggeration) voice acting didn't deter me and neither did the really bad translation into english. Especially not since the art was decent, the animation fine enough for its age, the smooth jazz score impressively good (way WAY above the call of duty), and the start to the story a promising noir gumshoe's-tale-of-woe, the kind you probably can appreciate if this game peaked your interest.\n\nAnd then I realized how bad the controls were. And while that too is very often to be expected, these specific controls really go out of their way to make your life miserable. (They're also nowhere explained, read the manual before playing.) It would be much easier to forgive that if the game didn't saddle you with a huge amount of seemingly useless items (stuffed into an inventory system only reachable through F1) that you have to individually pick out every time before you attempt to try them onto yet another tiny, unreachable hotspot for some unfathomable reason. I cannot explain how soulcrashingly clunky the system is, especially when you may have to repeat it 20 times in a row on a single hotspot and still not get a result.\n\nI didn't hate the story, at least so far in. Not that it was good, but it was bad and campy in an interesting way. ;) But the gameplay is just really really bad. The controls and horrible puzzle design finally got the best of me.The term "illogical puzzle" that we throw about so often in adventure games? If you haven't played this game, you have no idea what that term means. Combine that with the insane amount of unusable items, the big maps, the complete lack of clues or guidance and those punishing controls, and you have a real recipe for frustration.\n\nIf you are still willing to play this game, do as everyone tells you and play it with a walkthrough. And yes, I realize how odd that sounds, but trust me (and everyone else) that's the only way to play the game without dropping it halfway through like I did. Alternatively you could just watch a Let's Play, and enjoy all the campiness and fascinating flaws of this odd bit of gaming history without suffering any of the frustrations yourself. At least that's what I'm doing. ;)","June 9, 2015","false","1.9"," 39 of 47 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","39","47","0","0"

I love this game it has a great story line thats simular to a D I C K Tracey film or a Hardy Boys book. ( Originaly released in 1997 ). The game is truely a classic point and click game but sometimes the controls are slow but thats just because the game is old so i can appreciate that aspect. The game is also tough and challanging when finding out what to do next, which can be annoying aswell. Heres a link if you ever get stuck. http://www.gameboomers.com/wtcheats/pcJj/JackOrl.htm ! I would really only Recomend this game to someone who likes Point and Click adventures otherwise you probably wont enjoy it. But going off all that, all and all i believe this is a great game and i hope you agree to. So have fun and check out the Masterpiece that is Jack Orlando.","May 26, 2014","true","7.0"," 37 of 53 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","37","53","0","0"

I've been playing LA Noire and like adventure games, so I figured why not if its only $1.25.\n\nThe first line of dialouge sets the tone for the entire game. The voice acting is the perfect amount of hilariously bad. The inflections, tone, and delivery are universally bad and I had a smile the whole time I was playing. Everything that any person says or does is hilarious. In the opening, Jack is given a Colt pistol by the Mayor and just waves it around. Its so hilariously bad, you can't help but smile.\n\nImpressivley, the entire game is done in hand drawn animation and it shows, usually in a good way. Although very early on, someone gets shot and the artist just drew a hole in the victims suit. No blood, no wincing or leaning over, the suit had a hole in it and the victim fell over. Additionally, the game calls itself a "Cinematic Experience", but between the art style, the way talking heads pop up in a box, and how any action is done in a seperate bubble (leaving the main scence as static characters who are only capable of moving their feet unless specifically in an animation), the game feels more like an interactive comic book.\n\nYou have some choice of what your character says, but they seem to lead to the same result or they are not representive of what you want to say. Early on (I don't feel this is a spoiler since its in the game's description) you're read your rights by a cop and they want you to say something. There is no "Remain Silent" option, all you can do is act like a smartass at all times. This is even worse when Jack visits his next door neighbor who tries to set him up on a date and his only response is to be a  total jackass to her. Its so hilariously bad, you really have to see it for yourself.\n\nSomething that is instantly a problem is lack of direction. The very first time I was granted use of the mouse, I had to look up what to do, because I had clicked on everything and was totally stuck. Turns out, you need to right click to select an action: Observe, touch, punch, or talk. Later, I picked up a feather duster and Jack's neighbor said "I need a new feather duster", but I couldn't figure out how to open my inventory, turns out you press F1. None of this was told to me prior to starting the game. There is no tutorial, you're just dropped in the world and that's it. I understand that this is a game from the late 90's and was rereleased in early 2000's, but when compared to modern adventure games, it falls short because of how little slack it gives to the player.\n\nI recommend this, only because of how hilarious the first five minutes are. As I continue to play, I hope it maintains that standard of terrible.\n\n","September 7, 2014","true","3.9"," 26 of 35 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","26","35","4","0"

There are multiple ways you can get permastuck that are absolutely absurd and if you're not saving constantly they will cause you to lose hours of progress. And it's not like these are hard to make happen either. Some of the solutions for items are really out there... for example giving a bellboy one of the three newspapers you've picked up without any sort of hint.\n\nEven if you're willing to put up with this lack of fundamental design concepts for some sort of experience, there's really not much to see. The graphics look like CD-I Zelda and the voice acting is even worse. Apparently they used Jack's voice for placeholders or something, except they forgot to remove it from several lines, some on female characters! Not that it really matters, most of the women sound like they're voiced by men anyway. The only reason to get this game is to laugh at how bad all of this is. Good thing Valve's giving out coupons for it like mad!","November 1, 2014","false","6.3"," 37 of 56 people (66%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","66","37","56","3","0"

However I've played a good many of these kinds of games and I've dealt with worse for the sake of a fantastic storyline, so that in itself is not a deal-breaker for me.\n\nThe voice acting is terrible, there is no flow to dialogue and it sounds like each line was recorded separately with actors who've never seen the script and who do not understand the syntax of English.\n\nThe lead character is fundamentally oboxious and unpleasant. That's probably the point, and maybe they are planning on doing some amazing character building and turning it around, we shall see.\n\nMy real problem with it so far is the rampant sexism. I know they're trying to invoke the spirit of the 1930s but they're really massively overdoing it on the gender stereotypes. I'm literally on the 2nd scene of the game and have heard at least four negative statements about women. As if the world of gaming really needed any more kitchen jokes! I'd understand an undertone of it to set the scene of the game, but at the moment it just feels like being bashed over the head with the blunt, narrow-minded opinions of someone who doesn't usually get an outlet for them. Have a little subtlety and empathy for your burgeoning female fan-base before you alienate them entirely.\n\nI plan on finishing the game and altering this review accordingly once completed, but as it stands at present I'm proceeding with extreme caution and not particularly high hopes that I'm not totally wasting my time.","January 29, 2014","false","2.0"," 62 of 103 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","62","103","0","7"

Or maybe you gave an item to the wrong character, and lost it forever. I hope you have a saved game before that, otherwise, time to start the game all over! You have to play it with a walkthrough open, which defeats the purpose of a point and click adventure game.\n\nIf you're wondering what's the director's cut content, it seems like they had a bunch of a backgrounds from a different game they didn't finish and they just shoehorned them into the game. They make absolotely no sense, because they're like, medieval catacombs and fantasy dungeons, and they have nothing to do with the plot of the game. It's terrible.\n\nThe music and the art are the only good thing about this title.

Although the wonderful graphics and music help to set a tone, the bad voice acting and the gradually weakening plot quickly ruins the game beyond any hope of salvation.\n\nLong version:Toontraxx– a developer known mostly for cheap arcade games– made Jack Orlando in a time when point ‘n’ click adventures enjoyed their last real large wave of success. At first it seems they did a decent job; even with the awful voice acting, the highly detailed hand-drawn graphics and the smooth jazz set a good atmosphere for this early 1930s hard-boiled detective story.\n\nYet there is a reason why nobody remembers it now. Because it just wastes your time: entire scenes, conversations, and a large number of items serve absolutely no purpose. Most of the play time is spent by pure guesswork on what random item do you need to give to a random person. Plot-critical people/items appear out of thin air only after a certain utterly unrelated task was completed. And on top of all you can get permanently stuck– a clear indication of bad game design.\n\nWith these kinds of mistakes only a die-hard adventure game fan could enjoy anything about Jack Orlando.

Turcotte\n\nwere to start with an amazing point and click game? It reminds me of a harder version of a Game I used to play with my brother back in the day. The Pajama Sam Seris. Very similar the two. But of course this one is a little harder. Like for example "it took me forever how to open my inteventory!" (It's F1) It's not just the adventure and story line that's awesome. But it's the action and drama that i also like. You fight a black guy and a italian. I don't no about you but when the black guy returns and get's revenge i was actually glad. It brought a smile to my face.

Some say this game is "too bad to be good" or "I wanted to strangle myself after playing such a catastrophe", but not me.  When I played this game, I was BEYOND the edge of my seat, I was on the floor dammit!  The voice acting only adds to the ambiance of the time era, when I managed to put this piece of art down, I came to the sudden reality that it was the 21st century, and not the early 1930's.  I hope all get to experience such a piece of work, and that the course of their lives will be forever changed, as mine has.\n5/5 hot peppers","April 27, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067758778/recommended/253960/","76561198067758778","Crestfallen_Rose","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067758778/","280 products in account","Because I'm a fan of the noir genre and adventure games, I was curious about Jack Orlando; though, even as I'm writing this after spend six hours on it, I still do haved mixed feelings about it.\n\nI'll explain the pros and pros before giving my final thoughts on it.\n\nBut first, a brief summary:\n\nJack Orlando is an African-American (don't let the cover art fool you, the protagonist is black and I found it very refreshing!) private detective in the 1930s, just after Prohibition ended. One night after drinking his sorrows away, Jack unwittingly stumbles onto the scene of a murder - and the blame is immediately placed on him due to the lack of witnesses and evidence. He's given two days to find the real killer; thus, he soon finds himself tangled in an elaborate conspiracy.\n\nSounds like a pretty decent noir-themed story, doesn't it?\nWell, it could be, if it wasn't so campy - but that's not necessarily a bad thing, in my own opinion.\n\n**I'm an optimist, so I'll write about the pros, next:\n\n-Good art style: There was a lot of polished buildings and furniture, they all gave off a very classy art deco style. The 'interactive' objects such as characters and vehicles, on the other hand, were a bit more...Toony, they were definitely set apart from the backgrounds; but I don't mind, I thought the game was very charming in these aspects.\n\n-Music: By far, the music won me over and I'd say if you weren't going to play the game, you might at least try listening to the soundtrack (there are clips all over Youtube). Despite the game being set during the 1930s, the soundtrack had more of an 80s buddy-cop theme. It didn't feel very natural, but it was fun to listen to (lots of saxophone).\n\n-Exploration: I enjoyed looking at all the backgrounds, trying to piece together the history behind them. For instance, there's this one green, abandoned building that's across from The Cotton Club, and it appears to be some kind of abbey from the renaissance era and it evolves into more modern settings as you move upwards.\nThe game does have a nice atmosphere and the whole point of Point & Clicks is to take the time to really appreciate the setting without the stress of rushing.\n\n\n**Now for cons:\n\n-Voice acting: I have mixed feelings about this aspect. The accents were very thick and some of the actors' emotions didn't match up with the dialogue. And, sometimes, Jack's voice replaced some of the NPCs, and it was pretty entertaining. I didn't expect much, since this game came out in the late 90s and it was developed by a very small crew in Poland.\n\n-Gameplay: The gameplay, sadly, isn't all that great.\nThere's a lot of stuff to pick up in the game, probably more than half of it is stuff I never needed (I did some reading and realized that these were called 'Red Herring Objects'; purely for the fun of finding and collecting them).\nNot only that, but the game can be very unforgiving at certain parts - you MUST save frequently and make different save slots because there are some points where if you say or do the wrong thing, or aren't quick enough to avoid a dangerous situation - it's an instant kill/defeat, and it's a game over. (I loved the atmosphere and music for The Harbor, but that was by far the most difficult and frustrating part of the game; and it's a shame because noir and gum-shoes and risky business at the docks should be the perfect combination!)\nAnd, yes, the controls are a bit wonky (Tip: F1 is inventory, F4 is menu options, and Right Click is the various action icons to use with the environment), so you might want to get a feel for them and write them down for reference.\n\n-Story & Characters: This is also a mix for me.\nI'll tell you right now that if you choose to play the game - don't take it too seriously.\nIt's so cheesy, campy, and light-hearted it almost can't be considered a noir story (Horseshoe in a boxing glove, etc.).\nThe story is very short and even more simple; and the characters don't have much background, nor psychological traits to speak of. (That was disappointing because I would've like to have known why Jack turned to drinking, was there some trauma involved? A case gone bad in the past?)\nI personally liked Jack, he was a bit more relatable and believable than the other characters, they felt so transparent.\n\nOverall...\n\nThis was an okay game to sit down and relax with, it's not great, and I doubt I'd replay it all over again; but I would replay the beginning, at least, because the early investigation and the night life in the city was fun.\n\nMany people have complained of issues about the game failing to launch, and this happened to me as well.\nOddly, after the latest update, my game suddenly ran fine and I was able to pick up where I left off and finish it.\n\nIf you're unsure of whether you'd like to buy it, just know that the Steam version will always be the cheapest due to the coupons - although there's a download for it on Amazon for the same price, but I don't know if one will work better than the other; I just got lucky with my copy.\n\nIf not, you might enjoy watching a walkthrough of it; I personally recommend 123Pazu's guide because they're very thorough and there's no commentary.\n\nWould I recommend it?\n\nMaybe, but cautiously (I wish there was a 'mixed' or 'conflicted' button option for reviews).","August 5, 2015","true","6.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I had played the game for a few hours and I discovered I had done the tasks in the wrong order so I couldn't continue.  If I had continued I would have got nowhere, luckily I checked a walkthrough.  I never bothered starting over.\n\nI only played €0.74 for this so I suppose the gameplay was OK for the price.  If you do decide to get this game wait for a sale and follow a walkthrough step by step to save you much annoyance later.","April 1, 2015","false","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The setting is perfect for this genre, an end-of-prohibition detective adventure in a city. How could you go wrong? I wish I didn't have to answer that question.\n\nFrom the outset of this game, I wandered aimlessly about for an hour or so, picking up everything that stood out from the background like a Hanna-Barbera cartoon and putting it in my oversized Deus Ex/Postal 2-like trenchcoat, which also seems to serve as a portal to another dimension, given the amount of garbage I can fit in there. After saving enough trash to be considered a modern art exhibit, I just barely scraped by on my own to make it halfway through the night of the first day, and that was only because I overdosed on painkillers, kicked back, and wondered to myself, "What happens if you keep walking left here?" Sadly, they wore off shortly after that, and I have no shame in admitting that I used a guide from that point on.\n\nI mean, that's my biggest problem with this game, the lack of direction. You're given very vague instructions and turned onto the streets where there are hundreds of different possibilities for sequence breaking (which can ruin a game should you save in the wrong area), and so much stuff to collect that's its often hard to distinguish what is absolutely necessary from what is worthless. Believe me when I say that there is a lot of pointless stuff to do and collect here.\n\nThe visuals are fine (with the exception of animations that occasionally block text). The cartoony style contrasts what is trying to be a rather mature story, with some violence and swearing. As I stated before, objects that can be used usually stand out from the background, so the only question lies in whether objects are useful enough to bring along.\n\nThe music is generic but memorable, though some of it sounds like a bad 80's adult film. The voice acting is variable in quality. Some of it sounds inspired, some of it's just lazy (lol at that Chinese guy). The biggest problem with the actual dialogue though is that it often turns out to be one of those situations where conversations are hard to follow, a matter of trial and error, and trigger some otherwise unrelated (but required for game progression) event.\n\nIf you asked me to give an " /10" score for this, I really couldn't. I could just say, get it only if you prefer story and visuals to gameplay, and would not miss the money either way. Otherwise, it's just kind of a waste of time that fails to excite. I got it on a coupon. I could've made some great iced tea for the money I paid.","March 18, 2015","false","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
