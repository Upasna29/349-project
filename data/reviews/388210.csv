"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198011861037/recommended/388210/","76561198011861037","Tarmack","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198011861037/","146 products in account","Video Version:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQOxJEqkLBA\n\nReview code was provided by the developer.\n\nBefore I get into the full review, I need you to understand that Day of the Tentacle is a game from my childhood.  My parents would sit at the computer with my brothers and I all huddled around a CRT monitor yelling at mom to try different combinations of items or click on certain things, in an excited way, not a mean way.  The nostalgia is huge here for me, just like it was for Monkey Island.  However, this also means that because the game is important to me, I’m holding Double Fine to a high standard.\n\nDay of the Tentacle from a story perspective is ridiculous.  Dr. Fred Edison appears first in the game Maniac Mansion, along with some of his family and tentacles that he had created which were in that game, devoid of any personality.  DoTT, being a sequel to Maniac Mansion revolves around Purple and Green tentacle.  Purple drinks some toxic sludge from the back of Edison’s house and becomes evil, even growing these cute little T’rex arms and he then goes on to take over the world.\n\nThis is the pure essence of a point and click adventure game.  You pick up items deemed pick-up-able by the devs and rub them together with other objects in hopes of combining logic and dumb luck to stumble on what the devs were thinking at the time.  For those who have never played a game like Day of the Tentacle, these types of games are based on inventory management and progression through the story comes down to using the right item in the right circumstance.  And to keep with the design consistency we’ve seen since the Monkey Island and Grim Fandango remasters, you can hotswap back and forth between the original and remastered versions by pressing F1.\n\nYou play as three characters in the same world area but separated by time.  Bernard, the stereotypical pocket protector geek in the present, Hoagie the rotund metal head 200 years in the past and Laverne the utterly bonkers girl 200 years in the future.  And the entire game revolves around Dr. Fred Edisons mansion, how it looked during those various time periods and how actions in each era cause changes in the other times.  For example, Fred has two identical twin ancestors who are only distinguishable because one is right handed and the other left.  By swapping out a right handed hammer for a left handed hammer, see?  I told you it was ridiculous, you can make a statue that is in the present day mansion swap right and left arm positions, a rather important change.\n\nAnd one of the beautiful pieces of the design is that unlike many other point and clicks, Day of the Tentacle offers a significant portion of the game that is non-linear.  Controlling three characters in three separate eras allows for a fair bit of player discretion and while the ultimate actions are all the same, for the most part you will often have somewhere else you can go solve a puzzle if your current task is proving difficult.\n\nThe puzzles in the game is identical to the original.  What is new is a complete rebuild of all of the graphical assets.  Double Fine did a very good job of sticking to the essence of what made the art style so effective and fun in this game.  It remains stylized but updated to match current day computer expectations as far as a cartoon look for a video game.  The characters are goofy looking, intentionally so and very little in the world involves right angles, and just looks enjoyably wacky as a result.\n\nThey have also rebuilt the user interface.  The original Day of the Tentacle used a bottom section of the screen to contain your inventory, the action words you would use to interact with the world and also the character swap buttons.  You can use that original style UI as they did redo the visuals if you want, or you can use the new UI that was added which puts your inventory into a hover to open button in the bottom left of the screen.  This new UI also lets you right click on items and choose actions from a dial.  It is just as effective but frees up significant screen space that was previously unused for game art.\n\nIn addition to the graphical side, unless I miss my mark, the audio has been remastered.  The voices and some of the sound effects are the same, but the quality scaled up from the original recordings.  New music has been added in place of the original audio as well, with rerecorded versions of songs and a number of other sound assets.\nBeyond the remastered art and music, they’ve also includes some nice bonus material in the form of concept art that unlocks as you play and developer commentary which can be turned on and listened to while playing.  Both of these are nice little features for the nostalgia buffs and also perhaps for budding game developers who enjoy seeing behind the curtain of the finished product.\n\nAs far as game options, there is little to speak of.  You can select fullscreen, change music, voice and sound effects independently.  You can also select the original or remastered art and music if you wish inside the options as well as swapping between the bar or dial UI.  They included a controls screen that has all of your non-rebindable key controls.  It does support controllers which while awkward, isn’t ultimately a problem because very little in the game is time sensitive requiring fast reactions.  There is one section with Ben Franklin that could cause controller players some trouble, but by the time you get to that bit, you should be pretty comfortable with the controller interface.\n\nWhat is my conclusion?  All in all, much like the new Monkey Island versions, Day of the Tentacle Remastered is an extremely faithful rebuild of a classic point and click adventure game.  There is nothing here that made me question any design choices that they went with.  It looks great, is still a blast to play through and for those of us who have played it before, hits all of the right nostalgia buttons.  If you enjoy point and clicks, this needs to be in your game library.  If you’re not sure, it is an excellent example of one of the most popular genres of games in the early 90s and is a great experience in that regard as well.  Though, if you’re young enough to have never used a VHS tape in your life, you may want to google what SP and EP related to VCRs mean.  It will save you some pain.","March 21","true","4.9"," 201 of 244 people (82%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","82","201","244","13","13"

I will add a TL;DR at the end.\n\nGameplay\nIn Day of the Tentacle you manage three different characters alongside three different timelines. Your actions will affect the future and you will be using items across the centuries to slowly advance through the game, and stop a maniacal purple tentacle who is going to take over the world and enslave humanity.\n\nThe game has you go back and forth between different locations and slowly advance through the plot. Day of the Tentacle has plenty of humour to keep your attention, and contains a rather long playthrough for someone who has not had the opportunity to play the original.\n\nWithin the game there is a developer commentary to allows people to actually hear the developers comment upon the game as you play through it (although it does cut off the natural game so I did not use it).\n\nGraphics/Sounds\nSomething to love about this version of Day of the Tentacle is that you have the ability to switch between the classic music and graphics or the remastered version. The remastered version has done a great job of polishing the graphics. The animations of characters doing certain objectives and the music make the game seem nostalgic and cartoonish making you appreciate how a game, even though it originally was released so long ago, is better than most adventure games we have today.\n\nPros/Cons\nPros\n\n+ Long playthrough with enjoyable dialogue\n+ Option for remastered or classic version\n+ Interesting plot and objectives\n+ Three different and unique characters and three different periods of time\n+ Colorful characters\n+ Humorous\n\nCons\n\n- Text delay within cutscenes in certain areas (Text cannot catch up to voice)\n- Slight graphical glitch (Only seen once though)\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI am not part of the nostalgic group who played this game when it was first released however I can easily say that this game is a true achievement as an adventure game. Day of the Tentacle holds quite a long playthrough for one clueless such as myself and  I love the comedy, all the different characters, the villains, the dialogue, it's simply a good adventure game, and sadly we do not see vey much of those these days.\n\nTL;DR\nIf you played this game in 1993 I would urge getting the remastered version if you have not already. If you never played the game, and like adventure games with comedy, try the game out. You will not regret it. There are even star wars jokes within it, there is no other way to say it than this is a beautiful game that has been remastered to shine again.\n\n\n** Key was provided by developer for review purposes **\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","April 25","true","10.0"," 62 of 68 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","62","68","4","1"

Bernard, Laverne, and Hoagie revisit the mansion to stop him when one of them gets transported 200 years into the past, the other 200 years into the future and one stays in the present. Though in different epochs, the three have to work together to save the human race from slavery and possible total annihilation.\n\nManiac Mansion Day of the Tentacle (Lucas Arts 1993, Double Fine 2016), also known as DotT, is my all-time favourite point & click adventure game. I played both the German as well as American version of this game so often, that I can rush through this game in no-time. Needless to say, I had high hopes & fears for its remaster.\n\nAbout the Gamehttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=651719523\n\nDay of the Tentacle takes place a couple of years after the events of Maniac Mansion (Lucas Arts 1987), which was the first ”real” point & click adventure, thanks to the SCUMM engine. No longer did players have to type in verbs, but verbs to intereact with the game environment were given to them through the engine. In DotT players not only get to play with a refined version of the engine, they also get to play in a game that’s superior to The Secret of Monkey Island and Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge in both story telling, pacing, puzzle design, as well as teaching players game mechanics.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=651719339\n\nSimilar to Maniac Mansion (MM), players get to control three protagonists, although the roster of playable characters has been trimmed down drastically. Unlike in MM, there are no longer multiple ways to beating the game, nor is there a way to die or fail. The overall maps are a lot smaller than in previous Lucas Arts adventure games, streamlining the puzzle solving process. It’s clear how much more experienced with the genre the developers were at this point as opposed to the first games (cf. my Monkey Island reviews). While in the remasters of both Monkey Island 1 & 2, I preferred using the old look, simply because it was easier for me to operate the menu and handle my items, in this game, I mostly used the new look as I was finally able to navigate through the options and items properly.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=651718249\n\nConclusion\nSo to anyone asking themselves whether or not they should get this game. If there’s only one adventure game that you’re going to get this year, make it either Grim Fandango or Day of the Tentacle Remastered. They’re that good.","March 26","true","5.0"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","31","33","0","2"

I was a huge fan of Maniac Mansion, so my excitement was  palpable when they originally announced that Day of the Tentacle was being released as a sequel. PCs had just started using that new fangled technology called CD-ROMs which allowed them to make a "talkie" version of the game, which was mindblowing at the time. Fortunately, the game lived up to the hype, as it's one of the most revered adventure games ever written. It's a mix of weird b-sci-fi horror with plenty of humor packed into puzzles which fall inbetween not impossibly difficult, yet not so obvious that the challenge is lacking.\n\nNow, as far as the Remastered aspect is concerned, Double Fine has done a fantastic job! A number of people were skeptical that the game was just put through a filter (like you'd find in the Lucas-Arts based emulator SCUMMVM), but after playing the game, I can say that this is not the case. There's a number of little details added that those filters can't add. On top of which, there are a number of little additions that add even more humor to the game, such as being able to read the actual letter Green Tentacle sent to Bernard. There's also some editions to the sound, such as an improved soundtrack (I kind of like the charm of the original, but that might just be nostalgia talking). The original was General MIDI, although I'm not sure what the new version falls under (prerecorded synth? I dunno.).\n\nFinally, there's some nice bonuses like developer's commentary, concept artwork, and I even enjoy the various hidden achivements that come from messing around in game. The UI is also improved, allowing for full screen presentation. I'm currently using the Steam Controller with it, and it feels natural.\n\nAll in all, a really well done version of the game!

When I saw that Double Fine had plans to remake some of the old LucasArts games, this one was at the top of my list.\n\nTo date, I have played both of the Double Fine remakes (Grim Fandango and this game) and I would say that because of the original format of the game, this one has aged much better. Even with updated graphics, Grim felt a bit dated and I didn't feel the remastered version added much for me having played through the original multiple times. This game, however, I feel has greatly benefited from being remastered, much like the Monkey Island series games. The sound is crisp and clear, the scenes are beautiful and more detailed than they were before. Basically, the game has retained all the awesome of the original with the added benefit of being visually and aurally more appealing.\n\nBottom line, if you like point and click adventure games centered around fascinating, humorous and quirky story lines with a little bit of time travel and historical fiction mixed in, you won't want to miss this one. And if you're just feeling nostalgic for another playthrough, there is enough added value from the remastering to make the game really come to life again.","April 30","true","7.5"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","1"

I'll try my best though.\n\nA trip to Wikipedia or Google will tell you how influential this game was at the time and its importance to the point and click adventure, so I won't waste time with that. The remaster really does well in capturing the art and music style of the original game without deviating too far and is quite suitable. Eliminating the original 'verb and inventory' interface at the bottom of the screen dedicates more space to the actual game which is a plus, as it holds up quite well even on large screens.\n\nPoint-and-clicks might not be as prominent in the current generation (aside from Telltale games) but give it a try if the style of gameplay is something you're interested in.

I remember, because I was a teenager then and couldn't play it as my PC didn't meet the minimum requirements! This was actually the sequel to an earlier game, Maniac Mansion, which was released in 1987. I played Maniac Mansion a few years after it came out, but did not complete it as the game's movement and controls were just too dated and clunky for me (even back then) to be bothered with.\n\nPlaying Maniac Mansion is not at all necessary in order to enjoy Day of the Tentacle, though those who have will definitely find greater connection to the game's characters, especially the Edison family.\n\n23 years later, Day of the Tentacle Remastered is essentially the same as it was before, but with sleeker graphics and a more modernised interface. While the story hasn't changed, it surprisingly (or not) hasn't aged one bit either - tentacle mutates and seeks to conquer the world, and only you (and your friends) can stop him! Though straightforward, the game's charm is in its various amusing time travel locations and the weird and wonderful characters you meet along the way. This is a prime example of where "it's all about the journey, not the destination."\n\n\nYays!\n+ Vibrant, colourful, hi-res cartoon-style graphics.\n+ Well-designed rooms, locations and scenery.\n+ Fully voiced, with good voice acting for the most part. (The guy who plays Dr Fred is awesome.)\n+ Interesting, memorable characters.\n+ Fun, amusing story.\n+ Wacky humour.\n+ Clear goals.\n+ Cool easter eggs. (Under "achievements".)\n+ Contains a free game (Maniac Mansion)!\n+ Puzzles are mostly enjoyable and require some creative thinking.\n+ Many gameplay hours.\n+ Trading cards.\n\nNays.\n- Audio starts stuttering after a while, due to memory problems.\n- Achievements remain hidden, even after the game is completed, so you can't see what you're missing.\n- Some puzzles have illogical or nonsensical solutions.\n- Bugs: e.g. When looking at one of the items, Laverne's voice sounds when Bernard speaks.\n- No mouse command to fast-forward dialogue; instead, you have to press "." which is really inconvenient, especially when the whole point of a point-n-click game is to not have to use your keyboard!\n- Some counter-intuitive puzzle set-ups: E.g. For the videotape puzzle, a button which looks like the "STOP" button, is actually the "RECORD" button. Anyone who's ever used a VCR or tape recorder would know that the square symbol denotes "STOP", while the round button denotes "RECORD".\n- Hoagie's periodic belches sound absolutely disgusting!\n\n\nConclusion\nThis was a hugely enjoyable experience from start to finish. Though the nostalgia factor played a part in my case, even if you've never heard of the Maniac Mansion series, as long as you count yourself a point-n-click adventure game fan, this is a must-play because it just gets so many things right. Add to that the timeless plot and wacky characters, and you have yourself a game that will play just as fresh & new decades down the road.\n\n\nDisclaimer: Game played for free, with many thanks to my dear friend KFlo. :)","May 29","true","17.6"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","14","16","3","2"

Not much, but it sure is enough to get our protagonists (the nerdy Bernard, the wanna-be-rockstar Hoagie and the not-so-attractive Laverne) contact Dr. Fred Edison for a solution. 3 mobile toilets serve as time machines to take them back to yesterday where they can turn off a machine that causes pollution and is responsible for making the tentacle creatures grow hands.\n\n"I  think I've made myself totally clear, Step one: Find Plans, Step two: Save World, Step three: Get out of my house! Let's get cracking!"\n\nSounds simple, but in reality, it is not! The time machines all malfunction and while Bernard finds himself in the present Hoagie meets the American Founding Fathers back in colonial times and Laverne finds herself in a tentacle-infested future where human beings are considered no more than pets.\n\nI like how you get to explore the same mansion / inn in 3 different times. While the objects / pieces of furniture / inhabitants are different, the layout / design remain the same. In fact, it's funny how you have the same grandfather clock in all locations and you get to see the mummy guy with all three of them. The goal is, naturally, to reverse the mess caused by Edison's faulty "science experiment" so that our heroes can meet once more to go back in time again!\n\n"Bernard, float over here so I can punch you!"\n\nI wholeheartedly agree! But LucasArts we'll not get a punch since they teamed up with Double Fine Productions to release this game once more but more than 20 years later. Similarly to the Monkey Island remastered editions they got rid of the bottom part of the screen which listed all the actions we could do (and covered a major portion of the display) and thanks to the greater resolution we do not find any pixelated characters / objects any more. I like how we can quickly change between the classic and the remastered render on the go by pressing F1.\n\nBeside the graphical and audio enhancements we can turn on the developer commentaries. From time to time a pop-up tells us to press a button so that we can hear what they want to say: sometimes it's lots of factual information on the development and the technological limitations they had back then, at other times they compliment each other for the jokes / cutscenes / music and crack some jokes themselves. I preferred the latter to the technological mumbo-jumbo.\n\n"We may not live to see yesterday..."\n\nWell, we get to see lots of achievements - some are very well hidden. The game forces you to look at all things and converse with all characters. Since many of these are missable you'll surely come back for a 2nd or even for a 3rd round. Oh, and in case you did not know: Day of The Tentacle is the sequel to Maniac Mansion, another oldie but goldie from LucasArts. In Bernard's storyline you can find a working PC and using it allows you to play this game! What a nice gesture and homage! And also what an annoying achievement hidden right there...\n\nWith the Monkey Island, Grim Fandango and Day of The Tentacle remastered I just need them to finish Full Throttle as well as Indiana Jones The Fate of Atlantis. There's no better pastime than replaying the classic point-and-click games on modern PCs!","May 15","true","12.8"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

Bernard once went to The Mansion to rescue a friend five years ago, but it looks like it’s time for him to go… “BACK TO THE MANSION.” Bernard returns to the Mansion to free his friend, but he also makes the mistake of releasing the clinically insane Purple Tentacle. Purple Tentacle had drink of the sewage flooding into the water below the Mansion. He was already pretty crazy but now he’s grown arms and vows to take over the world.\n\nThe Mad Scientist, Dr. Fred, comes up with a scheme to easily recover Purple Tentacle. It involves sending Bernard and his two friends, Hoagie, and Laverne back in time to stop Purple from drinking from the sewage. He sends the three back in time but somehow skimped on one vital component of the Time Machine… the power source. The Imitation Diamond blows which sends Hoagie to the Past and Laverne to the Future. Bernard must now discover a way to stop Purple Tentacle and also rescue Laverne and Hoagie in the process.\n\nVisuals\nSince this is a remaster, let's get right into what's changed from the original. The first thing we'll notice is the upscale to wide-screen and beautiful 1080p. Second, we'll notice the distinct upgrade of the character models and the environments. Maniac Mansion: Day of the Tentacle always had beautiful visuals, but now it looks like a cartoon come to life.\n\nOne of the biggest differences from the original is the complete overhaul of the interaction system. The interactive words have been removed from the UI and replaced with a selection wheel. It's a lot easier than dragging the mouse down to a slew of words to interact with an object you've already clicked on. It also cleans up the lower half of the screen to allow us more access to the glorious visuals. The sound has been greatly improved when compared to the classic version. The midi tracks were completely remastered and the voice work is much clearer.\n\nGameplay\nA couple of slice of life changes didn't make it into the remaster. Mainly, that you can't interact with a new item once the characters begin walking to a new area. You have to wait for Bernard and is friends to finish walking before selecting something new. Secondly, there are a few sounds that haven't been updated in the Remaster. There is a room with a snoring man and Bernard even comments on how loud it is, but the sound doesn't exist in the game. It's a little bit of a nag but it happens in enough places that it's noticeable.\n\nNothing has been altered much in the form of gameplay from the classic release. It's still a wonderfully designed adventure title with absolutely hilarious cutscenes accompanying every puzzle. Just be warned that it's still as much of a classic adventure game as it has ever been. Most of the puzzles are fairly easy to figure out but there are some really obscure hints for some others.\n\nDay of the Tentacle is not solely to blame for this. A lot of classic titles like these give a hint once and expect you to remember what that person said even hours later in the game. These moments happen quite often and since Day of the Tentacle is fairly open ended. You'll find yourself with tons of items and no idea how to use them. Some hints are also incredibly vague, like the mention of a car wash bringing rain that happens in the future. However, the actual car(t) washing needs to happen in the past. At least the design team pokes fun at these hints with achievements regarding some of the more insane hints.\n\nConclusion\nThe best thing about Day of the Tentacle has always been the hilarious script and interaction with the various characters. The jokes still stand up well for this day and age as I found myself chuckling from the multitude of interactions with the cast. I couldn't help but laugh at teeth chattering George Washington and the constant updates on Purple Tentacles' rise to power. For all the upgrades that the remaster performs, it definitely didn't need any in the humor and story department.\n\nManiac Mansion: Day of the Tentacle Remastered looks amazing, sounds amazing, and has a hilarious storyline to keep the gameplay moving forward. It can also be slightly ambiguous puzzle wise but we're all in luck that the game is old enough to have tons of guides available. This is one of those games that makes me miss the Lucasarts that used to make these awesome games.\n\nDay of the Tentacle is one of those games that innovated the adventure genre. It’s funny that this game from 1993 has more ground-breaking measures than a lot of adventure games released in 2016.\n","March 22","true","11.9"," 22 of 36 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","22","36","4","0"

And if you're a purist, you can switch everything back to the way things were back in 1993 - original pixel art, unremasterd soundtrack and traditional SCUMM(tm) interface are included for good measure too.\n\nAbout the new artwork, my main gripe is that they didn't add additional animation frames - seeing high-resolution cartoons with such stiff movement is a bit weird. On the plus side, the game now looks very faithful to the original box art[static.giantbomb.com], something that just wasn't possible 23 years ago.\n\nOn the game itself\nSo, how does this game hold up, 2 decades later ? This is one of the most well-known point & click adventures from the '90s after all...\nThe good news is that after all those years, it still shows why it's a classic. It offers a non-linear approach to puzzles, plenty of funny jokes, an insane plot and a lot of hints towards the more illogical puzzles if you're willing to explore, experiment, and pay attention to details.\nYep, illogical puzzles. But this game is illogical in a consist way, so it could be said to run on it's own internal logic instead. Explore everywhere, get hint in one place of the game, apply the hint elsewhere, get unexpected, and probably hilarious effect.\nOr when you know what effect to achieve, find items you need where you would not expect them at first, and put them to use.\n\nBottom line\nIf you're a fan of point & click adventures, you should own Day of the Tentacle.\n\n\n","March 27","true","5.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

As a fan, the commentary is fantastic, and the concept art is infinitely entertaining to explore.\n\nThat all being said, I’m a bit disappointed in the updated art and animation quality.

However, while using time machines two of the group get stranded in the past and future by accident and they have to return to present first.\n\nThe original game from 1993 can be called one of the best adventure games ever made. It combined wonderful cartoonish graphics, great puzzles, loveable funny characters, wonderful music, a lot of humour and an amusing time travel story into one.\nThe reboot does pretty much the same thing.\nTo be honest: Hardly anything has changed. There is no "Wow!" effect like in other remakes like "Ducktales Remastered". However, I am going to point out the differences...\n\nThe first change you notice is - of course - the graphics, now sharp and vectorized. This really looks great and makes the game look a bit more cartoonish without taking away the charme of the original graphics.\nAlso the music and sound effects seemed to have a little make-over.\nThe voices are the same as in the original, so there is no re-recording.\n\nBut do the changes please you?\nAs I said, the vectorized graphics are very fine.\nBut when it comes to the sound effects I wished there was a bit more effort put into it. They seem to be selected lazily out of a small sound library. For instance: The same sound effect is used for a reception bell and a ray gun. In some sequences random cartoon sound effects, if they fit at all or not, were put in. You may find this funny but I felt that this could be done better and more careful. Also, in sequences when characters laugh or scream there's still silence which is weird in a remake/reboot.\nBut that's nitpicking, to be honest.\n\nThe gameplay is fine and easy enough. The difference is that there's no text field at the bottom with verbs anymore ("Use", "Look", "Talk to"...). Instead you can either use the keyboard or mouse (or both) to control the game. A click on something/somebody with the right mouse button for example shows you the actions you can do here. A pop up menu at the bottom shows you your intenvory and the other characters (time periods) to switch to.\n\nThe other differences is the bonus material: an audio commentary track starring the makers of the game (like Tim Schafer), the option to switch to original/remastered graphics, beautiful concept art from 1992, 58 achievements and Steam trading cards.\nThey are all nice and if you play through the game you should get most of the achievements since they're often connected to puzzles you have to solve anyway.\n\nSince I am German and there are probably other German-speaking users reading this: There's also the option to change to a German audio track. However, personally I prefer the English one. The German has some good chosen voices but others just don't fit, for instance Bernard (the voice actor sounds way too handsome and uninterested as Bernard, sorry). Also I'm not quite satisfied with the German subtitles. They seem to be just wrong sometimes like the translator wasn't paying attention. Here are some examples:\n"awesome" -> "schrecklich" (terrible)\n"sushi platter" -> "Sushi-Teig" (sushi batter)\n"beef jerky" -> "Bonbons" (candies)\n"That's gross!" -> "Das ist toll!" (That's great!)\nSo if you're German and can at least understand the English audio track then you are definitely on the inside track.\n\nSo, does "Day of the Tentacle Remastered" pay off?\nI say: Yes. It's still damn funny and entertaining, a heartwarming return to the mansion.\nIf you are a fan already you will certainly feel the same and also discover the bonus material and try to get all achievements.\nIf you have never experienced "DOTT" this is a great opportunity to try out this classic that has aged very well (including the prequel "Maniac Mansion" from 1987 which can be played inside this game!). But prepare for some sophisticated puzzles which force you to think laterally pretty much all the time. However, it's not frustrating and lots of puzzles themselves were designed in a funny way, too.\n\nGrab your Chron-O-John and have a good time!

Simplifying the amounts of verbs to use, featuring incredibly comic/cartoon-like visuals, the novelty of spoken dialogue through the first bit of the game (they could only fit so much speech onto 7 floppies, it was awesome none the less) and an undeniable charme turned it into an instant classic. Only other Lucas Arts games like Fate of the Atlantis or Monkey Island 2 could hope to be anywhere near DOTT.\n\nWhile the humor isn't exactly my cup of tea anymore and the voice-acting being almost lethargic (it started to be annoying half-way through - turns out the floppy version of DOTT was the superior one ;)), the game is more or less intact and hasn't lost too much of its magic over the years.\n\nIn fact, it has been so ingrained into my memory that once I got back into the groove, I remembered it all. The dialogue, the puzzles - it all came back and there seems to be a part of my brain entirely reserved for DOTT. Sadly, this meant I was finished with the whole thing in no time - which is kinda troubling considering the somewhat expensive pricetag of the Remastered Edition.\n\nAnd actually, that's about the only real problem I have with this version: the "Remastering". I spent maybe a minute in the new, (not so) fancy HD graphics - just to realize that, much like other titles (Street Fighter HD Remix comes to mind) that "simply" presenting the same VGA-visuals at four times the resolution with traced, vector-like visuals isn't working out. There is a distinct lack of detail in the remastered graphics, the look is way too clean. This effect is even worse on the sprites of characters, using the same 2-3 frames of animations of the original looks incredibly weird at full HD - cheap and Adobe Flash-like. Did not like that, did not like that at all. Kinda wished they had instead given us more filters to make the OLD graphics look like CRTs instead, maybe even add some fun ones like an Amiga-palette - something more fitting to a game from 1993.\n\nSame goes for the new controls, I am so used to actually playing with Keyboard-shortcuts and the old mouse controls that the new approach with ring menu and everything feels cumbersome and slow in comparison. Again, not my cup of tea. But, I am bit of a purist with these things believing that old software should be presented as authentic and much MS-DOS era as it can on modern machines, so your mileage may vary. Personally, I don't feel that getting it for the remastering itself is worth it.\n\nLet us wrap things up then: if you still own the originals and/or know how to set up SCUMMVM, this might not be worth your hard earned cash. Remastering is probably nice for people who haven't grown up on low resolutions or who cannot stand big, bad pixels anymore - might help some people to get into DOTT. For me, as a purist, being all nostalgic and ♥♥♥♥, the remastering isn't working out as it changes the look and feel too much, taking away some of that low-res charme. The game itself has aged pretty good, the humor is a bit of a mixed bag but the gameplay and story are still very solid. Must buy if you are interested in "historical" gaming since DOTT is an amazingly important title for the whole point&click-adventure genre that still inspires people to this very day.","May 15","true","3.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I grew up playing this game, and is easily one of my all-time favourite adventure games.\n\nSTORYFive years after the events of Maniac Mansion, the evil Purple Tentacle drinks toxic sludge from a river behind Dr. Fred's laboratory. He grows a pair of arms, develop vastly increased intelligence and a thirst for global domination. Now it's up to Bernard Bernoulli and his friends Laverne and Hoagie to go back to the mansion of the crazy Edisons to stop the tentacle from taking over the world. Dr. Fred sends them back in time with a time machine, which doesn't work, and now the three friends are stuck in the past, present, and future.\nThis is one of the most classic premises for what many consider to be LucasArts' finest game: a fun, enjoyable, easy to follow story full of hilarious jokes, great visual gags and many references and easter eggs to other games. However, I wouldn't be surprised if many new gamers (and damn do I feel old writing this) won't find this story funny and find it kind of bad.\n\nGRAPHICSThe new, updated graphics look spectacular: in every room every single detail has remained untouched, and the animations and characters have never looked better.\nAlso, just like in the remastered versions of the first two Monkey Island games, you can seamlessly change the game from its new look to the old-school SCUMM interface, giving that extra nostalgic feel and taking us back to our childhood.\n\nGAMEPLAYWhen playing with the new graphics, a wheel opens up every time you click on an object, for a better and more accessible experience for gamepad users. However, I found it very easy to misclick your actions, and I often found myself using an object instead of examining it. Thankfully, there is always the classic and reliable SCUMM interface as well as keyboard shortcuts that make everything easier.\nThe main feature that makes the gameplay more interesting compared to most other point-and-click games, is that you can send different items to the characters through your time machine/toilet, and changing something in the past shows its consequences in the future. Even for todays standards, it's a pretty cool mechanic.\n\nCHALLENGEAs much as I love this game, I can't deny that it is not easy. It is actually very much a frustrating experience, just like with most LucasArts games: most of the puzzles require some incredibly weird and downright ideotic thinking, and I am not ashamed at admitting that I had to look up a walkthrough on more than one occasion out of sheer desperation. But, thankfully, there is the possibility to highlight every usable item in each room, so at least there isn't pixel-hunting.\n\nSOUNDThe original voice acting and sound effects all come back with a bang, while the soundtrack has been remastered, and most of the tracks are better than in the original. I highly recommend buying it if you can!\n\nREPLAYABILITYWhile there are a lot of concept arts and achievements to unlock (and not all story related), the game doesn't really offer much new when you play it again.\n\nOverall, this is a great remastered version of one of the best and funniest adventure games of all time. Highly recommended to old-school gamers and fans of the original.\n\nStory: 8.5\nGraphics: 9.5\nGameplay: 8.5\nChallenge: 8\nSound: 9\nReplayability: 6.5\n\nENJOYMENT: 8.5\nFRUSTRATION: 8\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\nJoin my Steam group","March 21","true","5.2"," 25 of 44 people (57%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","57","25","44","4","0"

Not only was it the first adventure game I played, it also introduced me to a lot of American cultural staples. And its humour helped shape mine.\n\nDOTT is a sort-of-sequel to Maniac Mansion, an older game (which is playable inside DOTT, by the way!). Friends Bernard, Laverne and Hoagie must travel back in time - courtesy of a shoddy time machine by Dr Fred - to prevent Purple Tentacle from gaining super intelligence (and arms!) and conquering the world. Instead, our three protagonists are accidentally scattered across time - far past, present and far future - and have to both rescue themselves and accomplish their original goal.\nThat's a summary of the silly premise, and the game is just as silly.\n\nHow that translates in terms of gameplay is that you have three playable characters occupying the same space - a motel where the events of the game take place - but at different periods in history. You control all three, solving puzzles, sometimes affecting the future, and sending items back and forth among them via the time machine.\nThis all makes your typical point-and-click puzzle solving a bit more interesting, as you need to think about what all three characters need and remember what items and NPCs and puzzles each version of the motel contains.\n\nAs for this modern remaster, I'm very happy to say they did an excellent job. It is basically how we imagine the original version in our minds. The music is also remastered, but I prefer the original. Lucky for everyone, the original art and music (and interface) are included and can be mixed and matched at will. I played modern art & interface with original music.\n\nWhat I enjoyed\nTriple the playable characters, triple the puzzles, triple the inventory, etc.\nCartoony, funny, and not obnoxious (you hear that, Deponia?)\nThe remastered art is excellent, making the whole game widescreen and crisp looking.\nThe new radial action menu is a huge improvement on the old action bar, allowing for faster play while keeping the variety of options that give you all sorts of fun dialogue.What I didn't like\nThis being an early 90s adventure game, the puzzles can be nonsensical sometimes - you have to apply "comedy logic" to some of them, which can get frustrating.\nAll the things you have to do across all the characters can get a bit overwhelming sometimes and you might forget what to do next. I'd suggest playing this game in as few sessions as possible, because you will forget stuff otherwise. Maybe take notes.\nI just relived a piece of my childhood, and it was just as good.","June 3","true","6.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You can also play this game's predecessor, Maniac Mansion, fully to completion, which I think is a really good touch.

I remember it taking forever to install via the floppy disks.  When it finally finished, I had reallocated memory by creating a boot disk.  When the intro sequence started up I was blown away.   I was drawn in by the cartoon effects and music.  I must admit though, it being my adventure game it did take me a while to get the games intro sequence to continue as I didn't know how to properly use the verb Pull on the Clock.  I had to ask a buddy at school how they did it while not admitting to them that I had spent more than 2 hours trying to get it.  lol.  Once I opened up the rest of the game, I was entranced by the story, humor, sound effects, and wacky puzzles.  I learned that vinegar is created from wine via my dad.  I found uses to my Looney Tune knowledge to solve puzzles (Pepe le Pew).  I was enamoured by the all the options to talk with the great Uncle Ted.  I think this game is the reason I love all time travel games now.\n\nSo, when I found the chance to by a remastered version of this game I jumped at it.  This game helped shape my gaming childhood.  I was estatic that I could change the graphics mode from remastered to original.  All the puzzles play the same, so if you remember them the play through will be a quick one.  I turned on commentary and learned alot about how the game was made.  Also, in the floppy version, which the commentary mentions there is only voice in the initial opening sequence in the lobby.  So, hearing all the voices of everyone to include Harold made my day.\n\nTo sum it up, this wacky, beautiful, and awesome game will get your mind going for a short bit.  As a fan of this game and point/click adventure games, I would had bought this at any price.  However, for someone new to this I would wait for a sale, as I think $14.99 is too much for a game this short.\n\nThat all being said though, this game is on my top 3 three list of the greatest games ever made.\n\nEnjoy!","March 27","true","2.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This (and LucasArts' Indiana Jones: The Fate of Atlantis) was my favorite DOS game of all time back in the 90's so I bought this immediately. I'm pretty sure I still have the original CD lying around somewhere. If I find it, i'll upload it in the Artwork section for the game.\n\nNeedless to say, nostalgia can be a cruel mistress, especially nostalgia from 3 decades ago. Not so in the case of LucasArts DOS games. His company's products were always ahead of their time. I personally feel that the cartoonish graphics of this game still hold up today (and they did a great job with the remastering!), and from what I remember, the puzzles in this game were not only challenging (not impossibly so) but there was a lot to do and figure out. And they were interesting puzzles. I still remember how it took me forever to figure out how to get the fake rubber barf off the ceiling. Awesome! I now had fake barf in my possession! Now what do I do with that!? xD\n\nThe voice acting was also superb. Instead of always using the bland, "I can't do that." or "That won't work." kind of line when trying to figure out object combinations and placements, you are greeted with lines like, "My therapist told me I'm not allowed to play with sharp objects." followed by maniacal guffawing. These are the kinds of things that stick with you and add so much charm to this game.\n\nSo, the basics:\n\nThis game is the sequal to the 1987 game Maniac Mansion and takes place 5 years after the events of the first game. It is a single-player point-and-click adventure that originally came out in 1993. You do not need to have played the first game in order to enjoy or understand the events in this one.\n\nPlot:\n\nThere are two living, breathing tentacles that are wandering around. Purple Tentacle ends up drinking some radioactive sludge that mutates him into having arms so he feels he can now take over the world. His brother, Green Tentacle, tries to stop him and ends up having to contact the mad scientist that lives in the mansion. Once the three main protagonists arive on the scene, the mad scientist asks for their help and convinces them to get into Port-O-Potty time machines to prevent Purple Tentacle from drinking the sludge in the first place.\n\nSomething goes terribly wrong and the three main protagonists get sent to three different points in time. The "Dude Brah", named Hoagie, gets sent about 200 years into the past to colonial America times, Bernard stays in the present and the deranged medical student, Laverne, gets sent about 200 years into the future where the world is now controlled by the evil Purple Tentacle's rule and humanity has been enslaved. All three have to work together, yet separately, in order to help each other out by sending objects back and forth to each other through the Port-O-Potty time machines. In doing so, they are not  only trying to get back to their own original timeline but also trying to prevent Purple Tentacle from taking over the world,\nThe premise sounds silly but it's such a fun romp through an interactive Saturday Morning Cartoon where the humor from the 90's was at it's best (There's also a computer in the mad scientist's room where you can play the original 1987 Maniac Mansion on it, right inside this game. I do so hope they kept that in this remastered version).\n\nThis game is absolutely worth the full asking price. But if you see it on sale, snatch it up in a heartbeat.","June 1","true","1.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I would not be surprised if DF wasn't using the same code-base to support this game.  This is all very good because Monkey Island 1/2 SE were fantastic.  This version retains the feature of being able to switch between the classic and enhanced versions of the game which is a must have for me.\n\nDOTT is one of the products of Lucasarts' golden age of PC gaming.  I can't recommend this game enough, I had so much fun playing it when I was a kid (and Maniac Mansion that's also included).  The commentary feature is great too because it's just wonderful to hear what the constraints where when they developed this game...  Orson Welles once said: "The enemy of art is the absence of limitations" and that holds very true to these older PC games.\n\nThe only criticism I have is that the new art is vectorized, but fortunately stays true to the original material (Monkey Island 1 SE took too many artistic liberties, imo).  I'm a much bigger fan of pixel art so it would have been nice to see the pixel graphics updated, but that would have obviously been much more work.  This game will probably play better on a mobile device so you may want to wait for that, but this version is still fantastic.","March 28","true","26.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's wrapped up in my childhood memories, along with the original Monkey Island series, Leisure Suit Larry, Indiana Jones and The fate of Atlantis, and the awesome Kings Quest series.   I could only play it staying at a relatives, twice a year, as we didn't have a PC man enough to run such a game!  Over the years, I have searched for it, hoping it may have surfaced to transport me back to my youth, so you can't even imagine my excitement, to find, 23 years later, that it was available on Steam!!\nI love the puzzles, the dialogue, and the characters, and the remastered version is as amazing as it always was, although slightly more polished.\nI can't recommend this game highly enough, as it's always been a favourite of mine.  The only downpoint, for me, is that it isn't longer.  I can complete it pretty quickly, and am then snapped back to reality, mid 30's, four kids, blah blah blah.

THIS is how you do a videogame remake. I must admit, I was highly skeptical when I saw the screenshots and previews it all looked a bit "too" close to the original; I wanted them to add a bit of detail and have some creativity and imagination when rebuilding this game's crazy universe. "It's just exactly the same as it always was!" I scoffed.\n\nSo to help explain how I was won over, first let me talk about a similar remake from six years ago:\n\nMonkey Island 2 Special Edition.\n\nNow, this remake had a gorgeous art style, but the presentation was just awful. A lot of artwork was outsourced, resulting in many graphical errors. The programming was an absolute joke, failing to emulate basic effects from 1991, and the emulation of the music while in Classic Mode sounded nothing like the music from the original game.\n\nI still love MI2SE, but all of these issues were hugely distracting to someone who has been playing these point and click adventure games over and over again for the last 20 years. Whenever something went wrong in MI2SE, it would take me out of the experience. Most often I would notice music tracks were playing at the wrong time, or absent from the game entirely.\n\nSo why did I fall in love with Day of the Tentacle Remastered? Because it has none of these problems whatsoever. Everything that has been done to update the game feels like it was handled perfectly; the soundtrack is still there, it's complete and it has all the original dynamic transitions intact. The Classic Mode music sounds exactly like the soundtrack I grew up with. I haven't spotted a single flaw in the graphics; none of it feels rushed or done carelessly. The quality is consistent and every frame feels like it was drawn with care. It plays and flows just like the original, and the presentation of the game is just phenomenal.\n\nMI2SE feels like it was clumsily thrown together by a bunch of different departments, some of whom clearly not having done the research on the original game, But I never once got that impression with DoTT Remastered. Never did I have an awkward "Ooh, that's not how it should be!" moment while playing the game; all the way through I felt comfortable and familiar with the experience, because it was so flawless down to the tiniest details.\n\nPersonally, I think it's incredibly clear that Double Fine put a huge amount of effort into getting the feel of this game just right, and they absolutely nailed it. While I do enjoy remakes that improve on or add to the original content, never before have I played one that captures the heart and soul of the original with such attention to detail, production value and an obvious sense of love and respect from the designers for what they were remastering.\n\nHaving completed the game, my thoughts in short are exactly the same; "It's just exactly the same as it always was!" But now I understand that this is absolutely not a problem. The original was a masterpiece, and so is the remaster.","March 24","true","36.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ultimately, I have a few critique points: The game looks good until people begin to interact. To keep true to the original sprites and to give you the option to change to "Retro Mode" on the fly, they did not smoothen out the animations or added additinal frames, so many scenes look stiff. Further: The interface has not aged well. This game has always needed some kind of "return to Time Machine" button or a way to send stuff in bulk. I was also a bit annoyed by the way the subtitles work (I speak german as my main language, so I want to read stuff to get it). Sometimes they will stay longer than the speech and ruin the timing of jokes.\nBut let's ask the question: Is it good?\nAnd i have to admit it: Yes, this game still holds up.\nDay of the Tentacle manages to use the dreadded inventory-puzzle gameplay to its advantage by giving characters unique voices to explain the objects and an constant onslaught of hints through interaction with the environment and dialogue. It is like a Looney Tunes sketch. It has not aged perfectly but by god, there is something timeless about 3 weirdos being heroic and silly at the same time. Each of the characters has a distinct personality, way of walking and talking. The way the game uses them seriously talking about how the world is about to fall to a purple plunger with arms is hillarious and the ending made me chuckle way longer than it had any right to be.\n","March 23","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's wrapped up in my childhood memories, along with the original Monkey Island series, Leisure Suit Larry, Indiana Jones and The fate of Atlantis, and the awesome Kings Quest series.   I could only play it staying at a relatives, twice a year, as we didn't have a PC man enough to run such a game!  Over the years, I have searched for it, hoping it may have surfaced to transport me back to my youth, so you can't even imagine my excitement, to find, 23 years later, that it was available on Steam!!\nI love the puzzles, the dialogue, and the characters, and the remastered version is as amazing as it always was, although slightly more polished.\nI can't recommend this game highly enough, as it's always been a favourite of mine.  The only downpoint, for me, is that it isn't longer.  I can complete it pretty quickly, and am then snapped back to reality, mid 30's, four kids, blah blah blah.

The "remastered" soundtrack also and dont get me started on how the unintuitive interface got even more destroyed by the ugly new font. All I can say is "Thank god for the option to play it like it was intended".\n\nThese were my major issues and it seems to me that the things I wanted just wasnt there in this remake. To bring some perspective to the issues I mentioned I might add that I absolutely adored the remakes of Monkey Island, especially the graphics and the sound (not the interface). This remake is another beast however.\n\nDotT is however still one of the best adventure games around so Im gonna give it a thumbs up nonetheless. The final judgement is however based on the original (and I do own the original in a box), nothing in this so called "remake effort" would get a thumbs up from me.","March 25","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Day of the Tentacle is also one of the most important adventure games ever made, and for good reason.\n\nEven without the nostalgia-filtered lenses, Day of the Tentacle stands as one of cleverest and funniest games I've ever played. The writing is filled with quirky charm, and the puzzles strike a perfect balance between cartoon logic, humor, and absurdity--even if they stump you for a bit, save the walkthrough until you're *really* stuck, because there's a lot of excitement and laughs in figuring the puzzles out yourself. The remaster is absolutely visually gorgeous and should be the standard that all remasters are held to; the sound is similarly spectacular and the voice acting is tremendous.\n\nThe only two reasons NOT to get this game are: 1) If you hate adventure games, because DotT is basically just collecting items, manipulating them, and talking to people; and 2) If you're really strapped for cash, because, while I think the price is very reasonable, some people might complain that <10 hrs of content for the price is steep.\n\nBut, seriously, if neither of the above apply, buy this game and start playing now.","March 25","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ElusiveOne/recommended/388210/","ElusiveOne","ElusiveOne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ElusiveOne/","71 products in account","Double Fine's remastered edition of Day of the Tentacle is all about preserving the integrity of the original version rather than offering a creative reinterpretation. Unlike the first two Monkey Island remakes, which boasted new backgrounds and updated art direction, this version remains largely intact, if only in sharper resolution.\nIt is a pure pleasure to rediscover the cheerful and silly world of the game. With over two decades since my first playthrough I've forgotten most puzzle solutions and dialogues. Everything holds perfectly well today. The humor and story are unblemished, and while the game is clearly a product of its time it should still appeal to both newcomers and nostalgic old-timers.\n\nThe more creative puzzles are almost always sensible. You'll spend the first chunk of the game mainly exploring the three different time periods and then start putting things together, working on multiple concurrent threads until the big finale. Just the right amount of hints are given through dialogues to guide players. Moreover, you can't mess up or fail so playing is always an enjoyable and stress-free experience.\n\nOne of the game's main strengths is offering a substantial amount of diversity within the same location only by adding or removing 200 years. The plot introduces more than one ingenious way to swap or transport items from the different time periods and everything is just generally well conceived.\n\nThe three main characters are obviously controlled by an omniscient being (the player) since they collaborate closely without ever communicating directly with each other, often performing actions that make no sense in their specific timeline except for those on the receiving end hundreds of years apart. The game's wholly implausible setting and absurd scenario are all part of its charm.\n\nLucasArts' original interface has always been messy, with its over-abundant action verbs that failed to add any proper value to the gameplay. For instance, there is never any need for both Open and Close commands as contextually only one of the two will ever make sense, if it were not for the game's insistence on crafting plausible sentences. This made sense in the early days of adventure gaming when players actually had to type out full commands on the keyboard, and it was a good solution in its time but it feels awkwardly dated by today's standards. I wish Double Fine had made more of an effort to streamline the UI, though its new action dial interface is imperfectly sufficient I suppose.\n\nIf I were to be picky, I'd mention some of the animation cells were poorly uprezed, with subtle alpha channel issues visible around some character edges or other animated parts. Not all background details appear lovingly hand-painted, revealing some skewed or hard edges that were not intentional in the source art, and places where the classic's limited color palette now show signs of age. The new art trades a bit of pixelated grittiness in favor of clean flat shading. The game still looks fantastic nonetheless and it is especially great to be able to finally enjoy it full screen and without the immense list of cluttered words at the bottom.\n\nThe makeover's new hot spot highlight system does not work on animated objects.

My gaming life was started in Atari 8-bit computers, but was groomed with IBM PCs and Lucasfilm & Lucasarts adventure games. Lucas arts adventure games were the main games I played growing up and they shaped my sense of humor and critical thinking skills. Day of the Tentacle is my favorite Lucas arts adventure game and this Remaster is PERFECT.\n\nOVERALL\n\nAs far as this I’m concerned in terms of this REMASTER - it is ABSOLUTELY PERFECT. It does what I absolutely love about Remasters and think they all should include this. At any time you can switch back to the original Graphics, music, and sound with a push of a button. Why I particularly love this Remaster as well is because it doesn’t overdo or redo things to a distasteful amount - It’s updated the artwork, smoothing out the pixels, and making Day of the Tentacle Look FANTASTIC in HD. I didn’t particularly enjoy what the Special Edition Monkey Island games did - It kind of lost the original artwork for new artwork -\n\nThe increased resolution improves Peter Chan’s amazing artwork and design and I have to give a big shout out to the lead artist on Day of the Tentacle which is Peter Chan - His artwork and design give Day of the Tentacle it’s mood and voice is you will. I love the quirky angles. and twists and the use of color - I cannot explain it, it’s just perfection.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nThe gameplay simplifies the old the point and click verb style with removing the verbs and inventory from the screen to just show your cursor and you right click to bring up a radial dial all the available options for you to interact with an object. This simplifies the thought process to a degree; by showing you the available actions for something, but it’s a much quicker way to play and I imagine great for consoles- However - I also thought not seeing your inventory on screen all the time made thinking about puzzles a little harder if you didn’t know what to do whereas seeing the items on screen might help you realize you have a solution for something.\n\nLuckily you can mix and match the art, verb and inventory style, and music anyway you like in the options so you can have the Old point and click verb style with the new HD artwork. I didn’t realize this until I had already played through the standard remaster and this made me even more happy than before, because while I played through the standard settings to experience the remaster, in the future I’ll probably play with old music, old verbs, and new artwork just because I’m an old school guy.\n\nYou still can play the original Maniac Mansion on the commodore 64 computer inside of weird Ed Edison’s room - you can quit anytime and it will autosave your progress. So you’re getting two games for the price of one here.\n\nMUSIC:\n\nNow in my personal opinion I don’t really like the new “remastered” music - I feel like it was a transfer of re-allocating midi instruments and not for the better. Maybe I’m partial to the original, but I just found many times enjoying the original music and also feeling that it was more subtle, less in your face, and worked with the cartoon style and imuse system better. The best way I can give you an example is the difference between how Green Tentacles band sounds when you listen to his track in the video above.\n\nAs far as sound effects go, I believe nothing has changed there except bitrate perhaps. And Hat’s off to the voice actors and voice director Tamlynn Barra for making quality voice acting for a 1993 video game. Do you know how long it took other companies to get good voice acting? (Think Final Fantasy X)\n\nUltimately I am so happy with this Remaster and I highly Recommend to everyone - even if you haven’t heard of played it before or even wondered what an adventure game is since they kind of went away, but have been coming back. Play it! Just play it!","March 28","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's exactly as I remember it when I was a prepubescent child, only now the sound doesn't skip like crazy and I didn't have to install six floppy disks.  The additional commentary is also enjoyable to listen to and gives a lot of incite on the development of this legendary title.\n\nAs for the game itself?  It's a classic.

Things that have always stood out is the art style, the writing in general, and the voice ating (*perfectly* cast voice actors) -- and just how amazingly all these different elements fuse together.\n\nThis new remastered version sounds a lot better, looks a lot better -- and has all the charm that everyone remembers.\nIf they had an animated series that looked like this game & had its same soul...I would watch it in a second. This coming from a guy who doesn't watch TV at all!\n\nWhile this is technically a sequel to Maniac Mansion, you do not need to have played the original Maniac Mansion in order to enjoy this game. As the ultimate 'extra', however, the entire first game is 'BUILT-IN' to this one -- you find an old 'computer' in the game, which gives you acesss to it. Thus, you have the option of revisiting the first game in the series, if you so choose. I did play & finish that game years and years ago on the original NES, and while I remember really enjoying it, the story I do not recall -- but I did not feel at all lost playing Day of the Tentacle.\n\nOverall, I can't recommend this game any more highly. It really is one of the high-points (if not the highest) in the Adventure Game genre, and stands apart from the rest in all the ways it oozes with charm -- enough ooze to sprout two tentacle arms!","April 10","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ElusiveOne/recommended/388210/","ElusiveOne","ElusiveOne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ElusiveOne/","71 products in account","Double Fine's remastered edition of Day of the Tentacle is all about preserving the integrity of the original version rather than offering a creative reinterpretation. Unlike the first two Monkey Island remakes, which boasted new backgrounds and updated art direction, this version remains largely intact, if only in sharper resolution.\nIt is a pure pleasure to rediscover the cheerful and silly world of the game. With over two decades since my first playthrough I've forgotten most puzzle solutions and dialogues. Everything holds perfectly well today. The humor and story are unblemished, and while the game is clearly a product of its time it should still appeal to both newcomers and nostalgic old-timers.\n\nThe more creative puzzles are almost always sensible. You'll spend the first chunk of the game mainly exploring the three different time periods and then start putting things together, working on multiple concurrent threads until the big finale. Just the right amount of hints are given through dialogues to guide players. Moreover, you can't mess up or fail so playing is always an enjoyable and stress-free experience.\n\nOne of the game's main strengths is offering a substantial amount of diversity within the same location only by adding or removing 200 years. The plot introduces more than one ingenious way to swap or transport items from the different time periods and everything is just generally well conceived.\n\nThe three main characters are obviously controlled by an omniscient being (the player) since they collaborate closely without ever communicating directly with each other, often performing actions that make no sense in their specific timeline except for those on the receiving end hundreds of years apart. The game's wholly implausible setting and absurd scenario are all part of its charm.\n\nLucasArts' original interface has always been messy, with its over-abundant action verbs that failed to add any proper value to the gameplay. For instance, there is never any need for both Open and Close commands as contextually only one of the two will ever make sense, if it were not for the game's insistence on crafting plausible sentences. This made sense in the early days of adventure gaming when players actually had to type out full commands on the keyboard, and it was a good solution in its time but it feels awkwardly dated by today's standards. I wish Double Fine had made more of an effort to streamline the UI, though its new action dial interface is imperfectly sufficient I suppose.\n\nIf I were to be picky, I'd mention some of the animation cells were poorly uprezed, with subtle alpha channel issues visible around some character edges or other animated parts. Not all background details appear lovingly hand-painted, revealing some skewed or hard edges that were not intentional in the source art, and places where the classic's limited color palette now show signs of age. The new art trades a bit of pixelated grittiness in favor of clean flat shading. The game still looks fantastic nonetheless and it is especially great to be able to finally enjoy it full screen and without the immense list of cluttered words at the bottom.\n\nThe makeover's new hot spot highlight system does not work on animated objects. It feels like a rushed job.\n\nDay of the Tentacle was and remains one of my favorite adventure games. I still have the original odd pyramid-shaped box accumulating dust in my collection, and I'm definitely happy that Double Fine gave me an excellent reason to revisit this timeless classic.","May 24","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is perfect. I also like the F1 graphics render option so it looks exactly like it did in the 90s. I might play it though like that after this first play through, but I'm currently likely the updated graphics.\n\nThe puzzles maybe not to some peoples liking as some of them aren't logical but they are all funny and maybe because I remember most of them from back in the day, it holds a nostalgia feel.\n\nI still say this is a must buy but it holds more to me and the people that played it back in the 90s than it might to new players.\n\nTIP- Listen to the dialogue throughout as it will give you hints on solving the puzzles.","June 4","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
