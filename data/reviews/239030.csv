From what I'd heard you just sit at a border checkpoint and decide if people are allowed to enter the country or not. And that's exactly what I got, but Papers, Please is so much more than that. It's not just a job simulation, it's a story of moral choices and corrupt government. It's not just about a border guard, it's about a man who struggles to provide for his family, who must work for the smallest of wages to make some of the toughest choices. You sit in your little checkpoint booth. A man comes up and hands you his passport. You skim over the information and stamp a big green "APPROVED" for him. He thanks you and starts to walk away, but before he does he says, "my wife is right behind me, please be nice to her." Sure enough, up steps a nice young woman. There's her passport. You look down and see an expiration date of last month. "This document is expired" you say. She stares at you, eyes wide and pleading: "Please, if I go back to my country they will kill me. Please let me in." What do you do? Do you risk losing your paycheck and therefore leave yourself unable to buy medicine for your sick son? Or do you abandon all morality and turn the woman away?\n\nPapers, Please is not an easy game, nor is it free of consequences. Not only does it become insanely difficult to reivew piles of papers and make sure every little details is accrate and correct, but every choice you make determines who you are and the path you take.

The one in the red sweater and with the crooked smile always plastered on his face. It's the third time already, this month.\nI look at him through the glass as he waves at me in an oddly familiar way that makes me feel a little bit awkward.\n«Old friend, hello! I am back again! This time everything set!». His voice is loud and cheerful, and I just can't help but wonder what the heck is wrong with him. There's nothing to be so happy about in this rotten place, you old geezer.\n«Papers, please» I simply say, ignoring his greetings.\nHe grins while handing me his brand new passport. I chuckle. Definitely better than the last one, at least this one is not pre-approved.\n«So this time you're from Obristan, I see, Mr... Jorji Costava? Is this even your real name?».\nHis grin grows even wider and he starts laughing again.\n«You a funny guy. I didn't like Cobrastan that much anymore. Obristan sure is a better country». He speaks with a tick foreign accent that makes me wonder where he is really from.\n«Cobrastan isn't even a real country, in the first place» I point out matter-of-factly. «Where's your entry ticket?».\nHis smile fades a little.\n«Arstotzka so great, we don't need an entry ticket!».\n«This is the same thing you said last time about passports. I'm sorry, an entry ticket is required». I hand his passport back.\n«Wow, you run very strict border here». He puts his paper back in the pocket of his trousers, shrugging. «That is good. Do job right. I look for entry thing and come back».\nBefore leaving the booth, he stares intensely at me.\n«You a good guy, but I have business in Arstotzka. I see you soon». He waves me goodbye and then disappears in the crowd, with that big careless smile on his face.\n\n*\n\nI keep staring at the ceiling of my bedroom. In the end, it seems I can't really sleep at all tonight.\nI can hear my wife coughing weakly beside me. The doctor said it's just a cold, but she's getting worse day after day. I'm slightly worried.\nOur son is sleeping in the next room, the only one lit by the sun in the morning. He is turning 7 next week. I'd really want to buy him a special present for his birthday.\nWe are currently living in a small apartment provided by the Ministry of Admission, here in East Grestin. The rooms are small and the heather doesn't work half the time. On top of that, our neighbours are awfully nosy. Living here is not that great, but there's really nothing I can do about it.\n\n*\n\nA week has passed since Jorji Costava last showed up. Maybe he is having a hard time finding a fake entry permit. Maybe he just gave up. Quite unlikely.\nThe siren's ringing, another day of work is starting.\nA tall figure silently enters the booth. He's wearing a green hood and his face is hidden behind a grey mask. I'm about to call the security, but he gently slides a paper note under the window and stares at me.\n«There's no much time, be quick please». His voice sounds young- he's probably younger than me- and unusually relaxed.\nMy hands are shaking and I don't even know why.\nThere's an odd symbol drawn on top of the card, a star-shaped one. I slowly open the note and start reading. I can feel the masked guy's staring gaze on me.\n\n\nARSTOTZKA IS GREAT COUNTRY POISONED BY CORRUPT LEADERS\n\nWAR HAS MADE GOV'T GREEDY AND PARANOID - YOU HAVE SEEN FOR YOURSELF\n\nHELP US FREE ARSTOTZKA FROM ITS SHACKLES\n\n+ THE ORDER OF THE EZIC STAR\n\n\nI'm in a cold sweat.\nI look up at the masked guy, I'm at a loss for words.\n«Our agents are ready», he helds out his hand, eyeing the card. «Starting tomorrow. Let them pass».\n\n\nIn Papers, Please you play as an immigration inspector working for the Ministry of Admission of Arstotzka in East Grestin. Your job is to check on people trying to enter Arstotzka and decide who can pass through the border and who has to be denied or even arrested.\nMost of the time, your decisions will lead to a different ending (not always a good one!).\nChoose wisely, the destiny of Arstotzka, your family and many other people is in your hands.\n\n\nPros:\n-Well written dystopian settings\n-20 different endings\n-Lovely retro graphics\n-Jorji Costava\n-Great plot and sub-plots\n-Shooting terrorists from your inspection booth since 1982\n-Did I already mention Jorji Costava?\n\n\nCons:\n-Maybe old school graphics are not everyone's cup of tea (I personally love it though)\n-Stamping visas and check out papers will probably sound boring to someone\n-There's no "Escape to Obristan with your newfound best friend Jorji" ending\n\nPapers, Please is hands-down one of my favorite games.

We would not let our enemies have guns, why should we let them have ideas?" - Joseph Stalin\n\nCongratulations! You've won the lottery and earned the "right" to become a nameless, faceless little bureaucrat who is responsible from the border station of a fictional socialist country in 1980s, alongside countless entrants and their tons of paperwork. Glory to Arstotzka!\n\nBefore describing any kind of gameplay, I'd like to warn you: Papers, Please is a highly political satire that parodies Stalin's Russia, or any oppressive totalitarian regime in human history. The humor of the game is comedy noir: cold, immediate and careless with an appropriate dose of existentialism, presenting some genuine examples of your good old-fashioned political dystopia. If you like your sarcasm served cold, and patient enough to go through a simulation of routine banality to observe a comment on the dynamics of government, keep reading. The game manages to set the mood for it perfectly.\n\nPapers, Please doesn't even closely resemble any game that I've played so far. It is a basic simulation that lets you try and decide whomever is eligible to enter the country, and whomever is not. And guess what? The rules change daily, always getting more and more complicated until the point you cannot possibly "not" hate the government. Endless political conflicts between the government, the neighboring countries and terrorist groups that are ever present don't make things easier or even safer. You live, work and try to earn enough to feed your family, but life is impossible for the honest as always. So things start to get interesting both financially and politically for our bureaucrat as the scenario progresses.\n\nThe game has 20 or so ending, which presents huge replayability and contains some hidden achievements to hunt for. As a plus, the game takes each save file for each day separately, so it is real easy to load a specific day and replay for the achievement or ending needed.\n\nAs the last call: I really liked the game, and probably gonna try to achievement hunt for a while. I advise the game for the curious, the bitter and the know-it-all. The graphic lovers won't find anything satisfactory though.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","July 14, 2015","true","16.2"," 474 of 508 people (93%) found this review helpful 63 people found this review funny","93","474","508","63","9"

I was taken away from the line, seperated from my passport and dumped in a bleak empty room filled with lines of chairs and people in various states of distress. Nobody told me what was happening. Occasionally an agent would appear at the back of the room and give passports to some of the people waiting, who left quickly and quietly. At one point an elderly man went up to the desk and begged to be let through, to be met with ice-cold condescension.\n\nAfter about half an hour I was called through into the back room. There I was told to sit down in front of a man called Keane, on a desk filled with papers. Keane never looked at me. He asked where I was going and why I was going there. When I said I was visiting my girlfriend he leered and asked me if it was "true love". When I asked him whether I'd been pulled out of the line for a reason or if it was a random check, he told me it "wasn't random". When I asked him if I would make my flight in 20 minutes, he told me that it depended how fast I could run.\n\nEventually Keane gave me my passport back and told me to "lift my heels up". I missed my flight by minutes. I waited for an hour for the next flight and then another hour on the plane for it to take off.\n\nThis game made me feel sorry for Keane.\n\n10/10, would feel empathy against my will again","October 10, 2015","true","17.2"," 611 of 669 people (91%) found this review helpful 352 people found this review funny","91","611","669","352","3"

I started playing Papers, Please and go to day eight before quitting the first time.  I thought to myself, "Who the hell wants to play a game based on stamping visas?  I can't wait to get done working for the day at my REAL job!"\n\nTwo days later I found myself thinking about the game.  I wanted to know what happened to the people I approved or denied.  Was it better to deny them entry, or to be a tyrant and detain them?  I mean, who doesn't know that their visa information is incorrect.  LIAR!  YOU ARE A CRIMINAL!\n\nIt is just a game though, why do I care?  I did not, really.  I played again, anyway.\n\nThe game kept my enthusiasm up as the difficulty ramped up, money was tight, and I seemed to be responsible for the lives of so many more pixel people than I anticiapted.  I enjoyed it up until the very end.  Good job, author.\n\nPros  Amazingly enough, makes stamping visas intriguing if you are the type of player that can get immersed in pixels.\nThe save system is AWESOME.  Almost like a source code repository, if you start playing at an existing day, you create a branch at that day and continue playing in a parallel universe.\nMany different endings depending on choices made throughout the game.  Reminiscent of Chrono Trigger, you do not have to get to the last day to trigger some endings.\nEven though simple and interactions are quick, you can feel sympathy or opposed to certain characters.\nCons  Replayability was low for me.  The game has very varied endings, but I found that after I meta-gamed the Steam Achievements out, I was not inclined to go back through and try to get the endings for which there are no achievements for.\nCertain things feel pointless in the game - although that might have been the developers intent.\nCan be frustrating and wig out your OCD.\nRecommendation\nI would recommend Papers, Please if you are type of gamer who does not need flashy graphics or rapid game play to be entertained.  If you are a fan of indie game development, Papers, Please is an enjoyable title that may grow on you as it has grown on me.","October 19, 2014","true","20.6"," 317 of 331 people (96%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","96","317","331","7","4"

It's stark and almost clinical in its execution which fits perfectly with its dystopian setting where you assume the role of an immigration inspector controlling the flow of people entering the recently opened borders of the Communistic State of Arstotzka. Arstotzka is as far flung from a Utopian society as you can possibly get as your paltry daily wages are repeatedly ♥♥♥♥♥ by an ever increasing rent, the need to feed the mouths of your family and the possibility of them getting ill and requiring the need for medicine and expensive medical care.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=337397125\nPapers, Please is also very Kafkaesque which is only further amplified by its almost colorless graphics and brutal take on paper bureaucracy. With Arstotka ruled by an oppressive government, every day is a constant fight for survival where your eyes, ears and mind will need to be at their most finely tuned best. The sense of impending doom that perpetuates each short play-through often looms large and from all corners. Keeping your family safe and well fed obviously feeds into this but Arstotzka is, as you would have guessed, not a happy place to live. You will often be faced with smugglers, spies and even terrorists arriving at your border gate, each determined to spread their own form of misery or joy (depending on how you view the world) should you let them through border control. These occurrences can often have devastating effects on you and your families well being.\n\nPapers, Please is also about what is means to be human in a bureaucratic society that values work, duty and loyalty to the State above the wants, needs and concerns of its citizens. You could also argue that it's about freedom (or the loss there of) and the hollow reality of what that actually means or that it's about the demise of human compassion and how human understanding and those deep connections we all have to our fellow human man are strangled to death through totalitarian bureaucracy. There are so many thematic elements on display here and all rather impressively handled considering the development team consists of one single person.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=337397994\nYou will often be faced with situations where your very humanity will be tested. Like life - much of this decision making that you are presented with resides comfortably in the grey and will often appear inconsequential just like the proverbial butterfly who flaps its wings in the west only to raise a tsunami in the east. Since every coin has two sides, things are never quite as simple as being black or white, good or bad. One deed could easily end up further paving the way towards hell (so often laid brick by brick with the best of human intentions) as much as another could end up being the catalyst that brings about a positive revolutionary change. Your families needs will also play heavily into this this decision making where some days, just to make up your quota so that you will have enough monies to purchase medicine for your deathly sick wife or child, you will end up condemning other citizens to their deaths.\n\nPapers, Please games are short but exciting with the possible outcome of twenty different endings. I managed on my first play through to get arrested because I had run into the red with regards to my rent. With my family sent away I was left to languish in a jail cell. Starting out simply your duty is to either approve or deny a persons entry into the country by stamping their passports. Slowly - layer upon layer is added to the game. One day you will happily accept foreigners into the country with a valid passport the next - not so - as they will need to supply you with an entrance visa or work permit. Dates on permits will need to be thoroughly checked and validated and ID numbers, date of births and genders correctly matched-up with the authorities being notified (or not) should there be any discrepancies.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=337398331\nYour days are also heavily influenced by what is occurring in the newspapers for the day so should an escaped convict arrive at your gate it is up to you to either detain them or let them through. Things get more and more complex as your desk literally starts to litter with pieces of useful information and papers about the possible citizens approaching your gate. Get it all wrong and deny a person entry or let the wrong person through and you could face the possibility of going home with a smaller wage packet should the authorities detect your transgression. It's really up to you to decide whether or not you will benefit from this which is made all the more trickier by the fact that you are on a constant timer to process the days queues. The more successful applications for entry you process the more pay you will earn.\n\nI would have never imagined a game centered around border control and the shuffling of papers could be this thrilling but as it turns out Papers, Please is just that. It's a simple yet effective little Indie title that is well worth looking into. I am not sure of its longevity though as I imagine sooner rather than later all the different kinds of scenarios will have played themselves out and will begin to repeat which could end up diminishing the games power. But honestly I am just nitpicking here now. Papers, Please was never meant to be a 40 hr epic and I am quite thankful for that. Perhaps - later down the line the game could introduce an entire new character set with scenarios DLC, which would help keep things fresh. However, I am jumping ahead of myself here. I should still have a good few games ahead of me.

Your job is simple, at least in concept: examine the documents of people who are trying to get into the country, and determine whether they're eligible for entry or should be turned away.\nAt first it's as easy as checking criteria like passport expiry dates, and rejecting paperwork that's invalid or forged. But before long, Papers, Please becomes a tension-filled juggling act, as you're cross-referencing work permits with identity cards, making sure the applicant's weight matches the value on their entry papers, checking fingerprint records and sometimes doing full-body scans for drugs and weapons.\nEvery new day adds new rules to follow and new layers of complexity, from making sure applicants' vaccinations are up to date to applying a draconian extra level of inspection for citizens of a rival nation. And every time you let mess up, you lose the money you'd have earned for properly processing that batch of paperwork.\nTo give the game a sense of grim consequence, your wages are tallied up at the end of each day, from which you must pay for rent, food, heat and medicine for your family. There's almost never enough money for everything... do you let your family go hungry in order to keep the heat on? When both your wife and son are sick and you can only afford medicine for one, who gets it?\nDespite the retro-flavoured visuals, the act of shuffling virtual papers is actually surprisingly tactile, and spotting a discrepancy and slamming the "denied" stamp down on a person's passport imparts an odd thrill of power.\nBut not all decisions are clear-cut, and the game has 20 different endings depending on how things unfold. Do you let a man's pleading wife into the country, even though her paperwork isn't valid and the money it will cost you may mean you can't feed your family that night? Do you deny passage to the man who you suspect is a human trafficker, even though all his documents are in order? Who is behind the enigmatic organization that wants to overthrow the government, and do you dare get involved with their cause?\nWith a deluge of big-budget, high-profile games on the horizon, it might be easy to overlook a quiet, unusual game like Papers, Please. But don't do that, comrade. The consequences would be dire.","January 5, 2015","true","35.2"," 274 of 290 people (94%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","94","274","290","20","0"

The game is based in a fictional country called Arstotzka.\n\nThe game play focuses around the work life of an immigration inspect at a boarder checkpoint. Players will inspect documents and using a selection of different tools to work out whether the papers meet all of the criteria to warrant access to crossing the boarder. When you do find a problem with the paper work presented to you, there is also the option to interrogate the applicant, which may result in the need for further information such as a full body scan or finger printers.  Once you have worked out all of the paper work and questions being asked, you have to make a choice whether to Accept or deny entry, and then call the next person in line. Only then are you told any mistakes that you have made in the form of a warning slip.\n\nOn top of wading your way through all the paper work, you also have a time limit for the day in which you have to process as many applicants as possible.  At the end of each working shift, you will earn money based on how many people have been processed, bribes collected, as well as deductions for any penalties you accrued.  Then you must decided how to spend this money with your families budget, spending it on rent, food, heat and other necessities such as medicine or upgrades to your working environment.\n\nPaper, Please has a very prominent sound track, which starts as a slow marching rhythm made by bass to represent flow of entrants in the line of applicants and how tired and depressed they are. Although the technical side of the music is basic, it is probably one of the most memorable soundtracks you will hear from a game.\n\nThe game is only as difficult as you make it; if you pay attention to every little detail, you shouldn't fail. Only if you missing key bits of information or just not paying attention in general will your warnings pile up, and you will start to get less and less money, which results in your bills not being paid, which then results in having to start all over.\n\nThe game took me a little over twenty hours to complete one run, there is just a huge amount of content to go through, although some of the applicants are scripted such as terrorists or smugglers, along with plot characters, a lot of the others are randomly generated which means no run should ever be the same.\n\nTechnically, I had no issues what so ever. It's a very technically simple game which can be played in Windows mode without problems either.\n\nPapers, Please will certainly not be for everybody, but if you want to try something different from the regular shooting and spell casting games we are drowning in today, pick this up. I got over twenty hours of game play out of this awesome £6,99 title.\n\nGlory to Arstotzka!\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

It's a game where you play an immigration inspector. No, that's not meant sarcastically. I know it sounds dull, but let me tell you that it is absolutely not. It's challenging and interesting, even if the game lasts just a few hours.\n\nWith every level you play new challenges are unlocked and near the end of the game you have to take into consideration the many aspects of an inspection.\n\nThere are many moral choices to be made and in total there are 20 endings so there's also more than enough replayabily. An endless mode is also included so this game is neverending. You could play this game your whole life and not get bored. Ok, maybe after a few years you'd get bored, but theoretically you could just go on and on.\n\nThe graphics have a retro Russian vibe that really impressed me. And the soundtrack isn't very long, but what's there is very good. The song that was played during the credits was actually great.\n\nIn the end Papers Please was a delight to play. If only more games had gameplay this fun and an idea this original. Get this as soon as you have some money.\n\nGlory to Arstotzka !\n\n[Rating: 90/100]","August 15, 2013","true","9.6"," 230 of 262 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","230","262","0","2"

Bluntly stated, 'Papers, Please' is a job simulator that has you checking for discrepancies between information. You'll look over permits, IDs and passports. Reading to what the people say vs what is in the information. After you look over everything, you will either approve or deny them. If you find anything questionable, you can have the game check for dependencies, by clicking on two specific things, such as their photo doesn't match their face and then ask them about it. Later in the game, you will unlock things such as searching people and finger printing them.\n\nEach day will have a new issue that you need to check for. Another layer that you look for. The game first starts out by only letting your own citizens back into your country. Then opening the borders to everyone with a ticket, then people need a permit, then a work permit for those working and an ID for your own citizens. You'll see the issuing city that you'll need to check your rulebook to see if its really an issuing city, a gender that you'll get to search their gender even if it looks like a woman, they could be a man, detain people with contraband, question identities and fingerprint them, look at the date of entry vs the expiration date of their passport, look at when their work permit says they'll leave vs how long they told you they'll be in the country vs what they told you. Eventually, forgeries will happen that will force you to see correct official seals are there. It is a lot of information you need to look over.\n\nThe major controls are just mouse clicks and drags. You have a rulebook that you can click and drag onto your desk. All information you are given from people needs to be click and dragged into your work desk to look over. Then approving or denying requires you to click to take out your stampers, then move the passport into place and click the approve or deny, then give everything back to the person, by clicking and dragging it back to them. Once you've approved or denied them, then its time to click the speaker to call up the next person in line. Its a very click heavy game, but as time goes on you can purchase booth upgrades that lets you click space or tab to call up things you'd normally just click and drag.\n\nEach person that you process earns you $5. If you make mistakes and approve or deny someone that you shouldn't you will receive no penalty the first two or three times. After that, you start losing $5. Why does money matter? You have 4 people at home with you, your wife, your son, your mother in law and your uncle. You spend money on rent, heat, food and medicine. If you don't have enough money you have to start sacrificing things. If you don't have heat, your family will start getting sick and need medicine. If you don't have food, eventually your family will die. When your family dies its game over. You need to be both thorough and efficient in the game, because you only have so much time in a day. Some days get stopped short with unavoidable terrorist attacks and bombings that cause new rules such as searching every Kolechian.\n\nThere are other game over states, like doing something incorrect in front of the wrong person. If you get a game over, you can restart from any previous day. This makes the game pretty forgiving.\n\nAs the days go on, a stories will unfold and you'll be responsible for the course of mini stories. You'll meet interesting characters such as diplomats, soldiers with bribes, inspectors, angry people cursing you out, human trafficers, secret agents, mysterious men.\n\nIn all, this is a very unique game if not job simulator with a good story, good art style and music that matches the game and back story. I can understand if this game isn't for everyone, but if you can get into it, Papers, Please will keep your attention in a lot of ways. Once you get endless mode unlocked, you have 3 categories: timed, perfect and endless complete with leader boards.","September 27, 2014","true","4.4"," 119 of 128 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","119","128","2","0"

Is a game that’s not “fun” bad? Of course not, we just need to expand our vocabularies a bit. Because Papers, Please simply isn’t fun at all and yet it’s a genuinely good game.\n\nPapers, Please is a bureaucratic simulation game in which the player takes over the role of a customs official of a pseudo Eastern Bloc country at the end of 1982. After a long time, the borders are open once more and it is your job to make sure that the flood of people pouring in have all the necessary documents. Not only that, but you need to make sure that the passports haven’t expired, that the information provided checks out across multiple documents and so on. Rules change regularly due to domestic and international events such as terrorist attacks and disease outbreaks which constantly keeps you on your toes. You will also be provided with bulletins informing you about wanted criminals.\n\nIt is as laborious, mundane and monotonous as it sounds. And yet it’s incredibly compelling due to everything around it. You want to do a good job because you get financially penalized for multiple mistakes. Also, the more people you process, the more money you get. And you need that money because your family depends on you for rent, heating and food. But there are desperate people with insufficient or forged documents begging you to let them pass for various reasons. Some people will try to bribe you. Rebel organizations trying to bring down the government will seek your aid. All the while the government will be bearing down on you to do your job in accordance to the strict, but not always fair, rules.\n\nAnd that’s what’s so brilliant about Papers, Please. You really get a feel of what it’s like, you get into the role and you start to think as if you’re really there and not just playing a game. Why wouldn’t I want to help these guys out? What has my government done for me aside from oppressing and threatening me? But what about my family? What will happen to them? So you juggle all of these thoughts and simply try to do what you feel is best in each particular situation. But there’s simply no way to do everything right, something always has to give.\n\nYou go through the story campaign day by day. There are 31 full days to play. To illustrate the many different ways your choices impact the game is the fact that the game has 20 different endings that can occur during various situations within that period. While the game does a really good job to convey its grim and bleak mood, the writing leaves a lot to be desired. Some of the dialogue is just unconvincing and unnatural. Also, for some reason, the game uses a bit of Soviet-esque broken English, but at the same time it uses some silly and very American colloquialisms. Apart from the story mode, there’s also the endless mode which you unlock when you get a certain ending, but by the time that you’ve seen most of what the story has to offer, chances are slim that you’ll be interested in more.\n\nPapers, Please is a brave and wholly original game that deliberately offers mundane gameplay and wraps it up into a surprisingly compelling and profoundly affecting whole.\n\n7 OUT OF 10 (GOOD)","January 7, 2014","true","17.7"," 131 of 162 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","131","162","0","0"

Five hours later, it's 5AM and I'm due at work in three hours. No regrets here, either. The gameplay is simple but deep, and the story branches like a visual novel. Plus it's the only game I've ever played to truly make me actually feel -BAD- for doing what the game tells me to. Video game history teaches us that morality is black and white. Papers reveals how evoke it with more gray area than I ever thought a game could, and it's crazy how easily it does so.\n\nThere's a reason this game was voted GoTY by so many publications, and touted as simply amazing by gamers far and wide.

The way it controls, with the dialog, the items, the choices, you really feel like you're there at a desk, sighing before starting work and sighing at peoples pointless chatter and sigh at peoples obviously wrong documents, 'I'm just doing my job here, you're wasting my time with that out of date passport'. In that way, it's a very realistic job simulator.\n\nAnd later, you start to feel the importance of your work. It is not just stamping documents, It is determining peoples future, the safety of those you work with and your country, secret agencies.. And your family. Which, if you suck, will die much like Oregon Trail. It has a very organic measure of how well you're doing and how.\n\nAnd all of that, mixed with the plotlines, the worry behind every decision, constantly balacing on a knifes' edge, the moments you need to pull the trigger, the sense of dissappointment if you miss a crucial detail and it ends up costing peoples lifes..

I love games that go beyond today's formula, game's that seek to push and explore new boundaries, even if they might fail. This game is certainly one of them.\n\nBut that same thing also hurts it, and some people might find this incredibly boring. You play as an immigration officer at a checkpoint in a fictional communist state, and you process people entering the country. As you can imagine, immigration officers don't have the most exciting job. It consists of checking to make sure their passports and papers are authentic, and if so, admitting them into the country. The gameplay is virtually the same throughout the game, but somehow it manages to captivate me, and clearly tons of others as well.\n\nThe gameplay, as I said before, is largely the same. In fact, it's almost entirely scripted for the most part. On day three a certain event happens, on day eleven another does, and there's no changing it. Despite that, however, there is still an incredible chance for a diverse experience. In fact, Papers, Please has 20 endings, each occurs as a result of you doing things a certain way, and there are still a lot of choices in this linear story. One thing I really enjoyed is how the game allows you to explore all those options. The game is set to have 31 days of work (there is an endless mode for those who complete the story) and once complete a day, you are allowed to start a semi-new game from that day and make a different decision. When each day takes around 15 minutes to complete, this was a brilliant addition that removed monotonous repeats that would've made me lose interest in a flash.\n\nWant to continue reading for a more in depth review?

The actual story of the game does not last all that long but it can be some trial and error figuring out how to get things done correctly and learning how to make things quicker for yourself so you can make more money.  It also helps to memorize things as well.  You also have some moral decisions to make to either help someone or make life easier for yourself.

It's refreshing to have something different for a change rather than another FPS, platformer or suchlike.\n\nYour job is to give or refuse permission to enter your country to various people who come to your customs booth...... it is a hard sell, isn't it?\n\nOkay then, your job is made more difficult in several ways. First of all, your bureaucratic government implements more and more rules as time goes on which means you have to be quicker and quicker at processing, without letting accuracy fall. Secondly, you have certain moral choices to make - you have to feed and warm your own family and that can only be done by processing people as quickly as possible. Well, unless they bribe you to let them in, or the guards bribe you to detain them or... and of course, there's always the risk of forged documentation [which you are punished for if you miss] or terrorist attack [which curtails the day].\n\nThis game is deeply engrossing. It's straightforward to begin with, but the difficulty curve is just right, adding complexity day by day - just as you master the rules something else comes along which you have to keep an eye out for. Added to the fact that there are MANY, MANY different possible endings will lead you to replay this several times in order to see what happens.\n\nWell worth a try!","October 31, 2014","true","19.3"," 53 of 58 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","53","58","0","4"

Verifying if different entries are coherent, checking for frauds or typos, asking people to provide more information. And then deciding if you let them through or not.\n\nI have very little empathy to pixels, so I thought this was going to be easy. I would just accept people whose papers are fine, and then refuse people whose papers are not right even if they are dying and need an organ transplant.\n\nBut then the game got to me. There is so much more going on than just the little story of the person that comes to meet you. One person will tell you about another. Will give you something for another. Will try to bribe you, and you need the money to keep your own family afloat. There are events going on in the game's world, and it is subtly told through short sequences or short news reports.\nI have to give a file to a spy. Someone else comes, and tells me that he is also a spy, and the next person looking for the file is a bad guy. He gives me another file so I can switch for the fake. Which file do I choose to give, who do I trust?\nAnd then I start to care. A girl tells me that her abusive boyfriend that beats her up and might end up killing her is coming. His papers are alright, but I still refuse to let him enter, and get a salary sanction for my decision. The game won, I was not just proceeding as if they were pixels and I started to make moral choices and get invested in my role.\n\nThis game is not exactly "fun", but it is Art and worth trying to anyone that wants to see maturity in the video games medium.

"How can sorting through papers be fun," I asked myself. The only reason I got it was becaues it was on sale.

You work a job to provide for you and your family. As you work, things happen and your job slowly gets complicated. The game boils down to how quickly you can correctly sort documents and detect frauds amung the people who pass through your checkpoint. If you mess up, you get a pink slip, and slowly lose money if you mess up too much. If you can't afford to provide for your family, they slowly die, and as you need to live as well, there are plenty of choices to be made.\n\nThere isn't much else to say about Papers, Please except for it is an indie gem.

My apologies to those feeling mislead by my hours count.\nIt's brutal. It's meticulous. It's Papers, Please. This well-known Indie gem became an instant favorite of mine upon finishing the first mission, and is one I both love and dread to play; love because of how fantastic it feels, dread because of how long I spend at one time playing. Thanks to Chaplainissar for purchasing this fantastic game for me (and to LockeProposal and Carsh who preread this review), I was able to play this cut-throat title about doing paperwork in an allotted time. Why, you may ask, would a game about forced desk labor be anywhere close to pleasurable to play? Here are just a few reasons I chose to deliberate on personally:\nThe Tutorial System - Why is the word “tutorial” in italics? Because this game does not have a tutorial. Papers, Please is a click-based game in which clients present their papers to a security checkpoint-the one you are stationed-to be cleared or denied for entry into the glorious Arstotzka. As the game progresses, various scenarios add vital components to the game’s management system. * Spoiler from Day 2 ahead. It’s not too major nor far in, but blacking out to be safe.* For example, from Day 2-onward, foreign entrants must have a passport and Inspection Mode is presented to denote discrepancies in client filing. This is where the tutorial system kicks in: the first entrant you meet each day is usually a ‘Denied’ entrant, mainly due to that day’s clause, which teaches the player throughout the game to maintain the new ruling set by the Arstotzka command. Of course, some of these rules dissipate or change, but as new features are added or story checkpoints occur, the game instructs the player how to react to said changes with the first entrant of each day; to me, this is a masterful way to teach the player without the need to add more content for them to read.\n\nStorytelling - Though the title is not the first to implement this style of storytelling, Papers, Please utilizes text-newspaper clippings and work noticed-to organize the ever-changing themes and rulings that occur during each day’s shift. For example (and I will not say which of these are spoilers because some of these may occur and some may not) you may read the news before walking to work to find that a convicted killer escaped his holding cell and may attempt to enter Arstoztka, or that a man with a brown jacket carrying a large amount of firepower may attempt to enter the city to ‘liberate’ the citizens from Arstoztka rule. Regardless of the scenario, the game hints the supposed rendezvous with the said individual, which may or may not occur within the next given days.\n\nFreedom of Choice - A man, succeeding his brother in-law and wife to your security checkpoint, expresses his elation for ultimately becoming free from his previous home country and of the new life that his wife, brother in-law, and he shall have in the glorious of Arstoztka! The wife and brother in-law were accepted after no deliberation required. The husband’s passport expired the day before, and Arstoztka law prevents anyone with an expired passport, whatever the reason, from passage to the country. The man pleads for you to authorize his entry permit, but you had earned two citations from prior mistakes; one more will prevent you from earning enough to feed your family. What would you do? There are several moments in the game similar to this that obligate the player to establish a decision. Day 1, I had chosen to follow Arstozta law no matter the consequences, but found myself quoting the unchanging phrase, “What have I done?”\n\nOverall Feel - Papers, Please is, to put it plainly, a grey title. The graphics, audio, and clients are bleakly designed to create an impression of oppression from the Arstoztka government. Even when the unnamed protagonist asked for each entrants’ paperwork-requesting their documents with the line, “Papers, please”-they do so with an ominous tone as if the phrase is ingrained as a rehearsed statement. The color palette of Papers, Please is as described: nearly colorless, with only specific objects retaining any tone of life. The clients you meet at the front gate hold a rigid design as well, seen here[pilki42.files.wordpress.com].\n\nTL:DR - In this society of right and wrong, justice and devotion, pride and dignity, how you play this dismal title is completely up to you. It’s a game about questions. It’s a game about truth. It’s a game about pride in country. Papers, Please suggests a simulation fashion of action combined with the immersion of the protagonist as yourself. The game becomes less about simply doing your job, and more of who you plan to save and leave behind with the government of a questionably oppressive nation breathing down your neck, prodding you with symbols that question each action you make. Thanks for reading.\n\nDisclaimer: Image not owned by myself.\n\nDo you enjoy these reviews?

But once you start playing you start to see the plot unfold every day that you complete and you start to get curious about all of the faces you'll see in line. It's definably easy to get a headache while playing this game and you'll have moments where you'll want to ragequit and smash your PC into a million pieces but you just can't quit because you want to complete the day and see the next piece of the story. There are even characters (like the two gaurds that compliment and pay you and Jorji Costava) that you'll grow attatched to and actually fear for their survival and you'll do anything you can to keep them alive (even if it costs you).\nI really love this game; it's extremely addicting.

Was legitimately shocked at pretty much each terrorist attack. The story keeps you engaged and I liked the moral choices.\n\nI didn’t like some of the format.  I’m sure its intentional, but the UI is so cramped and annoying that I can’t check everything in a decent amount of time.  I’d also maybe prefer a better clock because I had some difficulty keeping track of time.\n\nI played it as basically just somebody trying to survive.  I min/maxed my warnings and people going through because I don’t give a ♥♥♥♥, its a job and I need money for my family.  I’d also take bribes, especially after we got money confiscated because I couldn’t handle my family being sick or hungry.\n\nAlso supporting the order.  Let agents through because I’m sick of the government and how they treat me, was willing to kill somebody I never met who was going to kill more people for the government, but wasn’t willing to expose myself and put the order above my own life.\n\nReally, the game makes it amazingly simple to see why people might suddenly turn on their government.  It starts as apathy, then bitterness, then somebody comes in and offers a better life or change and you suddenly see yourself actively working against the regime in slowly more questionable ways.\n\nSo, in short, I can see why it won game of the year on many people’s lists.","January 14, 2015","true","4.6"," 25 of 25 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","25","25","4","0"

Does the pope ♥♥♥♥ in the woods??  I got this for my daughter, mainly, expecting crap.  In fact, I'd had it for quite some time but nobody has ever bothered with the game....after all, how good can a game that cost (probably) about £100 to create be?\n\nWell, me and my daughter fired this up tonight. We'd just put my lad to bed, at 9pm, after playing LEGO Marvel and was looking through what I had installed, so I could give my daughter the same amount of time on the PC as he did, to make it fair.  I suggested she try it out as there was no point putting on a massive game for the sake of 60 minutes.  Holy 'nards, was I wrong??  Before we knew it, and even bothered to look, it was 11:45pm.  The time, literally, flew by.\n\nI'm disabled and I was stood up at the time, (wife took all furniture when she left), because I have very limited seating, at the moment, that can cater to my needs and am usually getting fed up about 15-20 minutes of not being sat down with agony in my back as well as my legs.  Admittedly I gobbed a high dose of morphine first but I didn't even get fed up of standing.  I was stood over her shoulder watching her play and it ended up with us both doing it, asking each other to choose option A or option B or just to arrest the scumbags that were trying to get through!!\n\n10/10 DEFINITELY recommend this game.

This game teaches you that either you become a loyal and honest citizen of your country, or try to make a diffrence when the oppertunity arises. It gives you choice without just throwing options at you. You decide how you want to handle the situation, but you can't help everyone. So who are you going to save? Sounds a lot more than what ya think huh? I very highly recommend this game.\n\nAlso, before you give into the negitive reviews saying "This game sucks! It's so repetitive" Or "I can't understand it" You just haven't played/understood it enough to fully grasp what the game offers you. There is no tutorial. There are no hints. "Except in the bulletin you're given." And the rules change on a day to day basis. But that's to keep the intensity and change the aspect of the game to keep it from getting repetitive. Just like in real life, you are expected to understand your job even if you don't fully grasp how it goes. Adapt yourself and stop relying on mechanics to pop infront of your face. This game is certainly not for everyone, but i'd say give it a chance. You can always refund it. That is if you haven't been sucked in like I have.\n\n\n**Also there are 20 endings.**","January 7","true","20.1"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","21","22","0","0"

Now I get the chance of putting myself in the border guard's shoes and can tell you, I have learned a lot.\n\nThe checking on the documents is mere formalism, the real lesson starts on whether or not to let a person with an expired passport or a missing document cross the border and enter your country after he has told you "please, if I come back to my country I will be killed". If you let that person pass, you will be fined with 5 credits, which don't seem much at first, but it will allow you to buy the medicine your son so much needs.

It not only plays in the 80's it also looks and sounds like a game from that era. You play a border-officer of a fictional Eastern Bloc country during the cold war.\n\nYour job is to check the passports of immigrants and to decide who to let in and who to refuse. What sounds pretty boring turns out to be a quite fun puzzle game mixed with some elements from adventure games. You have to compare travel documents with your regulations and look for failures. Over time not only the regulations become more complicated also you get more and more efficient in your job and learn what to look for. Everytime you find a deviation in somebody's documents you get some sense of achievement. When you make too many mistakes on the other hand  your salary will be cut short which will make your own survival and that of your family members harder.\n\nThe whole experience lasts 30 in-game days and it is kept interesting while confronting you with a lot of decisions - not only who to refuse and who to let in. Some of the game's 8-Bit graphics and sounds are quite iconic - e.g. the sound of the bulletin you get when you make a mistake. All in all this game tries something new and was definitely an interesting experience for me.

This game is mental suicide for perfectionists. the game allows you to redo a level and branch off, the only problem is that each branch has to be connected, so if you played level 1-9 and wanted to go back and do level 2 better, you'd have to start a new branch at 2 stemming from #1 and all progress would be on another save for 3-9. that's the old 3-9, you need to play a new one.\n\nFor this reason I hate this game. But I love its style, I love it's story, I love Jorji, and I love to play it.\n\nI will never finish it, and that makes me angry.\n\nDO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE A PERFECTIONIST.\nGLORY TO ARSTOZKA, GLORY TO THE ARSTOZKA ARS KICKERS.

If you're able to tell apart minute details.\n\nI have a sharp mind and it is so easy to miss one tiny detail.\n\nYou sit in a claustrophobic office, with a tiny desk. Your job starts off easy. Arstotzkans only.\n\nWithin a matter of in game days though... You get piled with countless pieces of paper. ID cards, fake information, work slips, entry tickets, contraband, the full vindaloo. And you have very little help. It's not big enough to fit everything on the desk and to even think about making it through a week.\n\nThen you have EZIC, your family, people desperate to get through, sob stories, aggressive people.. But you have no choice but to stamp a big red X on their passport, sending them to their doom or stay in their problematic county...\n\nYour family, food, heat, rent... Medicine if things get bad and death. The game is moral questioning and you really begin to feel the effects of what you're really doing. You can't slow down either, you need to keep pumping out those papers... Otherwise everyone suffers for it.\n\nThis game is ultimately the definition of a hard life. Class 8 living, a family to care for, a busy border line and all you have is an acceptance and denial stamp to your name. This is meant to be depressing. And it definitely hits home.\n\nGlory to Arstotzka.","December 4, 2015","true","5.0"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","17","19","3","0"

Me neither. Papers, Please grants you a chance to try it anyway.\n\nThe background is grim: you only got the job because of a lottery. Arstotzkan border is a busy place, all kinds of shady people trying to get into the country that gives out a communist vibe. You make sure their papers are in order by meticulously checking each bit of information for the smallest mistakes. You do this manually by eye. It doesn't help that each day the ministry announces new, subsequently more bizarre rules for you to follow.\n\nAt first the user interface is confusing and it takes a while to get used to and see the logic behind. All the tutorial you'll get is in the instructions you're given each day. Interestingly, this adds to the all-encompassing dystopian feel that is well delivered by the pixelated graphics and ominous music.\n\nThe story elements are brilliantly woven into the protagonist's role, served with dark humour: you often have to make moral choices by either admitting or denying desperate immigrants or whether you'll help the insurgents. You generally can't do everything because the salary comes from admitting immigrants and you are fined for mistakes.\n\nKeeping your family alive provides the motivation to keep doing a good job. Money is always tight and you have to manage your expenses after each day. Fortunately, being a border inspector in a corrupt country, you can make additional profit by accepting bribes and striking deals with the honest people you meet in your job.\n\nEach playthrough, one month of game time, lasts approximately 4 hours but to complete everything will require several playthroughs: there are three different "winning" endings and 20 different endings in total that depend on your choices and performance. Afterwards, there's the endless mode to pour hours into.\n\nStriking into a niche as small as it gets, Papers, Please does a tremendous job at providing an interesting and even amusing experience as a border inspector. If you have an eye for detail and fancy scrutiny and perfection, you'll probably love this game. Otherwise you might want to check some gameplay videos first - it is a niche game after all.","January 27, 2015","true","22.3"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","12","12","4","1"

Let me tell you why.\n\nIn the game you are a dude that has been assigned a job at the border. Your task is to check the people going in your country, and see whether or not their papers are in order. Simple enough eh? Yeah, that's what I thought at first too.\n\nThe first day you will have to check passports only. Yeah, check the dude's face, see if matches the photo in the passport, check if the date of birth is valid and stuff like that.\n\nIt will take time for you to check stuff and make sure you did not miss anything. And here is the whole game challenge: time management. You see, every dude you process gives you money. If you take too much time analyzing papers you will process less people so you get less money.\n\nAt the end of the day you have to pay for the rent, for food and heat. Yeah, there is that side of the game too. Your child might get a cold so you will have to buy medecine. It costs a lot. So much that you will have to switch between a day with food and a day without, but with the heaters on. Sad but true.\n\nThe game goes very deep in the story; there actually is a strong narrative. Between your family life that shows how poor your country is, you will read the newspaper at the beginning of the day. It gives mandatory information like which country is at war (so that means immigrants leaving that said country) and criminals that are unnacounted for (they could show up at your booth... eh who knows right?)\n\nThe more you progress in the game, the more papers you will have to check. First passport then work permit. Yeah too many immigrants are "stealing our jobs" so the government tells you to check work permits too now. Oh but some countries don't need those, but just a coupon instead. Yeah, we also forgot diplomatic papers and vaccination crap. Oh, this country refuses to import our goods? Today we'll teach 'em a lesson: do not accept work permit from THIS country only. Oh yeah? Some people are trying to smuggle shït? Here, now you get a scanner. Check for weapons and drugs. Don't miss anything.\n\n"Hmmm sir, it is written here you are a woman...?"\n"Yes I am, as you can see."\n"Uh, ok, please step into the scanner please."\n[Bzzzzz] Scanner picture shows tïts and püssy.\n"Okay, si-I mean ma'am, all your papers are in order, have a good day."\n"Thank you."\n\nTrue story. However this scanner stuff takes TIME. So during this process you will quickly take the habit to process other papers. Yeah optimization man, I gotta feed my family man.\n\nOh, you think that game's boring? Not at all. It's a challenge.\nTo feed your family you will have to sometimes skip checks. Sometimes you will genuinely forget to check something, like is there day 31 in February...? Uhoh. You have a blame if you let someone in with wrong/forged papers, or if simply there was something weird but you did not ask the dude for precisions.\n\nLooking at that dude walking in the country, not being sure you checked everything. You feel like you missed something but you don't know what... dude is still walking... and... he passes. No warning, no blame. Looks like he was legit afterall. [Breath of relief]\n\nToo many warnings and you will have money penalty. Less money for your family. They will get sick, starve and die. Think about your kid, his birthday is coming very soon. You would like to buy him a present yeah? Then you gotta work faster. Stop looking into your help book if said city is really part of that country: learn it by heart. Same goes for the logos: learn them by heart so you won't waste time checking them in the help book.\n\nIndeed, your are provided with a small book that contains everything you need to know about countries surrounding yours and valid logos and stuff. My advice: learn everything by heart as this will prevent you from going back and forth clicking on the pages and checkings stuff out.\n\nStill seems boring to you? Gotta learn stuff by heart are you crazy man?\nOkay, my final argument: this game will improve you memory.\n\nTrust me at first you will be lost, you will not have work habits. But the more you play, the more efficient you will become. Grab that passport and directly put it right below the overhead stamp machine. So if the guy is okay, just stamp. It will go right on the right page. No need to fiddle the passport around to stamp it after you have checked it.\n\nSame goes for the information. Be fast but not TOO fast. Your brain will overdrive. Check the date... damn what's today's date? Yeah we are Friday, gotta remember dat. Damn, did he just say he wanted to work? I don't have the work permit. Oh shït no, today his country doesn't need a work permit but just a coupon...\n\nSee now? Everything you will have to check will make your brain work.\nRemembering procedures that change everyday is tough. Nah, no coupon today. Yeah today we don't let those guys pass at all. Remember that. Hell, remember the people you've processed too.\n\n"Papers please."\n"Oh hello. Have you seen my husband? He was a couple people before me in line..."\n"Uhoh ma'am, you are missing a stamp here, I can't let you in."\n"PLEASE, please they will kill me if you don't let me in! It's war in my country!"\n"Yeah but... I go a family you see... I--"\n"I beg of you, let me pass, let me meet my husband on the other side. Please!"\n"...."\n\nWhat will you do? Will you help people? Is she, really his wife? Could be a whôre yeah? A terrorist? Wait I think she has the same last name as this "husband". Hmmm.\n\nHard choices. Impossible decisions. Meeting people you see regulary at the border, having arrangements with gards to earn extra money. Taking bribes? Hmm risky...\n\nRemember, remember that dude. Remember dates, remember criminals, remember to check the name on the vaccination paper, remember to give that business card to engineer people, remember to give that other business card to construction worker... yeah that will give you extra bucks and is not illegal. But you gotta remember. Gotta remember a lot of things.\n\nThe last levels of the game are... very hard. I just couldn't play more than a couple levels so overheated my brain was.\n\nThough choices to make, and many unofficial "things" to do at the same time. And, the clock's ticking. Work hard to save your family. Don't screw up and remember.\n\nRemember.\n\nNow I cannot tell you everything you will have to check and remember. Part of the game is to actually make mistakes and learn from them. Also there is a real story. I did spoil you a little bit with the dialogs above but it's nothing much.\n\nI really strongly recommend the game.

You have to check dozens of immigrants for contradictions in their paperwork, and determine whether they’re accepted or rejected. You’re paid (poorly) for however many passports you stamp correctly. If you don’t perform well, your family will die of sickness or starvation, or you’ll get arrested for going into debt. (Yes, going into debt is illegal now.)\n\nBut it’s a game that’s less about how well you check papers, and more about why you’re checking papers. You won’t get very far before the story starts getting really complicated, and you’ve got to start making some tough ethical decisions.

Also, the atmosphere is quite convincing and immersive, great retro-style pixel art graphics too.\nAll in all, definitely worth checking out.","December 14, 2013","true","6.4"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Smiledozer/recommended/239030/","Smiledozer","*IC* Smiledozer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Smiledozer/","484 products in account","Papers, Please is a great little Indie game which doesn't take up much disk space and is actually very fun to play just to pass the time. The play style is almost casual, but there is also a story mode that can become quite difficult.\n\nMy first impression of the game was mixed. I couldn't choose decisively if it was a good game or just decent game. I knew it had potential though and I did enjoy playing it. On the surface, Papers, Please may seem like an odd East-Berlin Checkpoint Guard Simulator, with pixel-styled graphics and nothing much more to do than stamp passports and analyze them. It seemed like it might be just one of those repetitive games that's fun to play every now and again...then I gave it a chance. Now, I must say that I do enjoy playing this game very much.\n\nAs the story mode progresses, you'll begin to understand your role, equipment, and use of analytical skills more thoroughly. In addition to your job, at the end of the day when you collect your pay you must take care of your family by using a simple budget system of Rent, Food, and Medicine. If you cannot take care of your 4 family members (i.e they stay Cold, Sick, Hungry) they will die. Once you get a week or more into the story, this is when the real fun begins. Crazy things begin to happen at your checkpoint. From terrorist attacks to people trying to sneak in drugs to women whose passport says they're male (and they aren't lying). When it all started to get crazy, I decided that this game is not as simple as I first thought. It's a great game and it deserves a play from any Indie game fan.\n\nPros:\n- A 'Story Mode' in addition to an 'Endless' Mode (Unlockable)\n- Doesn't take up much space on any computer (About 40 mb)\n- Interesting Pixel-style artwork\n- Incidents that happen randomly or according to the story\n- Use a range of given tools to perform interrogations (if necessary). These tools include a strip-search camera, discrepancy detectors, and the ever handy Newspaper & Rule Book.\n- Use the little money you make to keep your house heated and your family fed. If not, they'll starve and/or die. This is a fairly difficult objective considering your pay.\n- Addictive play\n- Fun story mode which will keep you wondering what the next day might bring.\n- 20 different possible endings\n\nCons:\n- Some events in story mode will repeat themselves, but it helps to make to game flow along\n- The graphics were a turn off at first, but you get used to the style\n- There are only about 3 or 4 different sounds to represent the language (sounds like a mumbled mash of German and Russian). One of these sounds is "Papers" grumbled by your character.\n- A slight learning curve (which will dissapear after playing through the story mode for a few days)\n\nVerdict: - 6.5/10\n\nPapers, Please happens to be a really fun Indie jewel. There are various tools you use as a customs officer to help you identify or interrogate people whose documents, IDs, papers, etc. don't match. There's nothing much more I can add besides what I've written. I can safely recommend this game to people who are open minded, love indie games, or just like break from the usual high-graphic, PC melting games of the now.","June 13, 2015","true","11.7"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

You work as an immigration checkpoint employee checking the legitimacy of people's legal documents before determining if they can pass, be denied or even detained.  You're expected to move people through the checkpoint as quickly as possible to achieve optimal pay to provide for your family, as well as make several tough moral choices along the way, bribes included, all the while the checkpoint policies change and expand almost daily.  It manages to be engaging while also making a point about the difficult, flawed and corrupt immigration system we see today, and how you choose to run your shifts each day will result in 1 of 20 different endings.

I’m not even sure how I can describe it effectively.\nYou play as a dude who checks passports for a fictional communist country. Sounds boring right? But so much drama happens. People try to bribe you, they tell you their sob stories, they try to smuggle weapons and drugs, your superiors are eager to punish you for any mistake you make, terrorists ask you for your help in overthrowing the government (and you can!), and if you mess up, either your family will starve, you’ll be arrested, or you might just die in a terrorist attack. There’s tons of different endings, and all of your actions have far-reaching consequences.\n\nI used a walkthrough, because I didn’t find the gameplay very fun, I just wanted to experience the story. But I think the gameplay is supposed to NOT be fun. It’s supposed to be really stressful, and to put you in the shoes of the character you play. And maybe I cheapened the experience a bit by using that walkthrough. Oh well.\n\nAnyway! The story was intense!

I read about it on a comment on Reddit talking about some of this game's immersive aspects and I had to check it out, it was on sale anyway.\nI was certainly not disappointed, though not as amazing and sandbox-like as I initially imagined from what I read, it's still top notch. The whole border inspector setup is a great storytelling device. You can for example purposefully incorrectly handle an immigrant, while the game doesn't specifically ask for you to do this, and notice the effects within the story, or notice it in the next day's newspaper. It's a branching story with 20! different endings. The story has both it's funny and serious moments, and keeps it well balanced. This game has a sense of humor within a dystopian setting, which I adore. Your 'health' in this game is basically your financial situation, being able to keep up with the bills and pay for food and your family's health. If they get sick, they need medicine, which costs money. There's no arbitrary bars or meters or anything, everything is explained within the story. This is what makes it immersive to me.\n\nThe way you manage paperwork in this game is actually hilariously similar to real life. Real life shortcuts and organizational skills translate well into this game. I actually feel like being a border inspector at times, and it sounds weird to say that. XD\n\nStylistically, the pixel art represents the Soviet Union inspired architecture, iconography, typography, etc. really well with a fitting colorscheme.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who is open minded towards new experimental gameplay ideas, as this is an interesting one. It certainly holds an aspect of challenge and rewards you for actually balancing accuracy and speed. The game becomes more challenging with time and the added challenge is explained within the story.\n\nIn short: It's something different and innovating that's fun and challenging, quite immersive (if you still have your sense of imagination) and has a branching storyline that can both be funny (albeit often in a dark way) and serious at appropriate times.\n\n11/5 would buy again.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Levyne/recommended/239030/","Levyne","Levyne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Levyne/","141 products in account","For some reason I felt some sort of obligation to play this game. I wanted to play it, but almost because I felt like I was supposed to. So in some ways I wasn't really looking forward to the game itself, more like checking it off of some non-existent list. I'm unsure where this feeling came from, but considering the sale I figured I had to finally try it out. I'm glad I did.\n\nPapers, Please is described as a “A Dystopian Document Thriller", which introduces the general setting but doesn't tell me much at all about how the game plays. Basically you are a new worker at a border checkpoint, responsible for maintaining security for your nation within the small role you have. At first you are just checking for minor discrepancies for incoming foreigners and returning natives, allowing those in who check out and turning those away who don't have everything in line. Meanwhile, you have a small family to bring home your wages to, making sure to keep on top of rent and heat and food so that they can at least survive in a not-ideal situation. The game is segmented into days over the course of a month, allowing for bite-size play sessions, and each serves as a savepoint from which you can retry in case you don't care for a certain outcome.\n\nHowever, for each day that passes, the layers of complexity multiply, at first slowly and then the gameplay becomes increasingly more complex as the month heads towards its conclusion. While the first and most obvious way this manifests itself is the degree to which you have to use the information (documents) available to identify good and bad immigrants, the underlying "dystopian" going-ons come further and further into the light until the game's sudden conclusion, which highly varies depending on your in-game decisions. Throughout the month you'll have to make moral judgments about whether to aid people who earnestly require you to bend the rules, or whether to take no nonsense and abide to the letter of the law while forsaking the goodwill (and generous bribes) of those you figuratively crush under your unrelenting bureaucratic boots. The end result is a lot of decision making, in which the right answer is not immediately obvious. It does allow you to roleplay to some degree, whether you make decisions as you yourself would, or whether you shoot for the fewest citations possible, or getting away with as many bribes as possible. Needless to say, the game suits itself to many, many replays.\n\nIt's quite astonishing how quickly and strongly this game sucked me in. "Just one more day" became quite the excuse to keep playing regardless of how late it got or whether I originally intended to do something else. Before I knew it I had a couple family members sitting in front of the monitor, lending their eyeballs to double check what I might have missed\n","December 30, 2013","true","9.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","1"

So how can a game about paperwork be one of the BEST games I've ever played?!\n\nIt's a game that requires a good eye for detail, patience and vigilance (no slacking!) This is a game that is both simple and complex at the same time.\n\nPROS:\n+ Immersive: - Unlike other games where you feel detached from the characters, Papers, Please will really really make you feel like you're there making a difference.\n\n+ Consequence based Story: - The story, if you look at it from a distance, is simple. Yet each and every decision you make affects the overall story. The morality system in this game is one of the best I've seen as of late.\n\n+ Simple but effective Artstyle: - It's pixel art but it does the job well in conveying it's message. Most people would appreciate its simplicity.\n\n+ Surprisingly complex mechanic: - The game is not a simple approve and reject kind of thing. Each and every aspect of the unique immigrants who tries to enter needs to be inspected (from the face, the name, the weight, height, place of origin etc.). The game WILL know if you missed something and promptly gives you a citation for it.\n\nCONS:\n- Story is a bit short: - It would have been best if the story was stretched out more than it did. Although an endless mode is unlocked, I still think more side stories, more in-game events and more time could have been added. It has a lengthy gameplay, don't get me wrong.\n\n- Needs more sound: - The base music in this game is good and does its job well. I do feel they should add a wee bit more. Not a whole orchestra, but an alternative to the usual thing.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n"Don't Judge a Game because of it's graphics" is a phrase that would wholly apply to Papers, Please.\n\nIt's a great game for a good price and a good re-playability and experience value.\n\nMUST HAVE.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

A dystopian document thriller.\n\nNothing would sound more boring right? Well, you are right. It does sound boring.\n\nBut dont let the graphics, the minimalistic gameplay and repetetive music fool you. This game is one of the greatest out there, and easily beats AAA titles. I peaked you interest yet? Good.\n\n\n\nYou play as a border inspector in the fictional communist country of Arstotzka, just having finished a war against the neighbor country Kolechia that lasted 6 long years. Your job is paperwork. All you do is stamp passports and look through papers. Fisrt day, only citizens of Arstotzka are allowed entry. Next up, foreingers with valid passports are allowed to enter. Same day terrorists attack the border. Next day all foreingers must present a valid entry ticket. It all goes on and on and on. Eventually you will be dealing with a lot of papers. Still, you are expected too keep the same amount of presicion and speed as you had before. Why? At the end of each day you manage your expenses: Heat, food and rent. On top of this, we have your family: Son, wife, mother in law and your uncle. Not paying for food or heat will result in them being sick, which will result in them needing medicine. If you cant pay for medicine, one of your family members die. But on top of that, if you make a mistake at work, you get a citation. First two are warnings, after that you have to pay 5 credits per mistake. Incedentlly, every entrant you procces correctly will give you 5 credits.\n\nNow, with that out of the way, this game has a lot of choices. There is no black and white, there is only gray. This women does not have the right papers, but she will be killed if she returns to her home country. Do you let her in at the expense of your family, or do you deny here and move on? This man carries what he calls 'harmless medicine' and pays you 10 credits to let him pass. Do you detain him, or do you give a stamp?\n\nDo you help a secret group overthrow the proclaimed corrupt goverment? Do you do your thing as a upstanding citizen?\n\nPapers, Please is a work of art. Amazing and fitting gameplay, awesome story and sub stories.\n\nAlso, you might wonder what happens when your family dies or you run out of money. You will be replaced and put either into forced labor or ported back to your village.\n\nGlory to Arstotzka.","March 5, 2015","true","10.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

For a game made by a single guy, this is outstanding work. The concept of having to face a constant struggle of economic issues, terrorism, forgery, and even keeping your family healthy and well fed is innovative, and it keeps the GOOD bit of Pheonix Wright.\n\nThe world of Papers, Please is absorbing, and makes you feel as if you are genuinely affecting the lives of the peopl who you Deny, and Accept. There were many, many moments in Papers, Please where I was conflicted on whether to Accept or Deny someones Passport, as sometimes it would essentially ruin their entire life if you denied it, or accepted it.\n\nAlthough I do adore this game, if you're not quick with your fingers, I personally wouldn't reccomend it. The game, from my playthrough, requires fast movements and a keen eye, as some of the "forgery" is just a single letter in a name, or an extra +3 to the weight of the passport holder.

Papers, Please is a game about 12 hour work days living life paycheck to paycheck. Papers, Please should not sound like a good game, and in theory it shouldn’t be. But Papers, Please is not just a good game, it is a great game.\n\nYou play as a border guard in the fictional country of Arstotzka, your job is to control the flow of immigrants and exterminate all who try and cheat the system. You must care for a family of 5 and your pay is very little. Mistakes are not tolerated and every error will be deducted from the small amount of money you are given. It is very easy to starve to death in Papers, Please; death and insignificance play a large part in the overall theme of the game. You are not the hero, you are not important, if you fail to live up to expectations you will be replaced in a matter of hours.\n\nThe heavy themes that Papers, Please possess are what make the experience so great, its depictions of war in the 20th century are expressed so well in the colorless background. There isn’t a single happy thought in Papers, Please. The whole game has a depressing feel to it, but this is what the creator was aiming for. He wasn’t trying to make a fantasy where everything is good and right in the world; his approach is honest and sinister.\n\nThe sensational achievement that is Papers, Please art design is not enough on its own to be worth playing, but with the addition of its intriguing gameplay mechanics and consistent challenge makes for a level of enjoyment other artistic games miss, Papers, Please is not great because of its perfection at simulating paperwork, or its ability to depict gruesome settings and artistic impurity. It is great because it can balance the two elements so well and make for an experience like no other.\n\nPapers, Please proves that a game doesn’t need a million dollar budget and a team of thousands of developers to be good. Papers, Please was made by one man and standing up there with the biggest games of 2013.

But then, you must check tickets, then entry permits, then work passes, then terrorists come and next thing you know, you're going to check 7 different papers in one little screen. Some security, huh? Soon some organization comes and from there, things spiral out of control. That's the story portion. Then, once you're done, there is endless mode, which is pretty much what the title suggests, it's endless. But, there's not just one endless mode, there are, in a sense, 12 different modes you can choose from. You can choose what type of papers to check, and the style on how you want to play.\n\nVery early on in the game, the game requires you make a major choice, thus meaning the game has a lot of replayability. Also, there are over 20 endings, which also add to the replayability. But, in order to do that, you have to make choices that may or may not affect gameplay. These endings can be endings that are refreshing, to just plain morbid endings. Sometimes, you don't even know you got an ending until the next day or few days after.\n\nAlthough you meet people who talk in the form you will see a lot, there are some characters that have very special dialogue, or who are very memorable, like Jorji Costova, for example. He comes early on as a guy who has no papers, and every time he comes, he seems to be one step behind. That, to me, is something that is memorable, as every time I see him, I think, "Jorji! What's wrong this time?".\n\nThe only problems I have with this game are the discrepancies. Although mostly clear on what to do, sometimes when looking out for criminals, someone comes to the booth, and you highlight the man's face with the criminal's, and it says, "NO CORRELATION" even though they look identical! But, other than that, I really have no complaints! Of course, someone might think differently, but that's my opinion on the matter.\n\nThe graphics are really crappy, on first glance, but it is very efficient and to me, this says, "Just because a game has good graphics, doesn't mean a game is good." And the opposite, "Just because a game has bad graphics, doesn't mean that the game is utter crap." I personally like the graphics, as they really match my stylings for this type of game. They are very simple and neat, and the slip screen is a really neat concept to me.\n\nThis game is amazing. 9.3/10 No doubt.","February 7, 2014","true","158.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

But Papers, Please is not just a good game, it is a great game.\n\nYou play as a border guard in the fictional country of Arstotzka, your job is to control the flow of immigrants and exterminate all who try and cheat the system. You must care for a family of 5 and your pay is very little. Mistakes are not tolerated and every error will be deducted from the small amount of money you are given. It is very easy to starve to death in Papers, Please; death and insignificance play a large part in the overall theme of the game. You are not the hero, you are not important, if you fail to live up to expectations you will be replaced in a matter of hours.\n\nThe heavy themes that Papers, Please possess are what make the experience so great, its depictions of war in the 20th century are expressed so well in the colorless background. There isn’t a single happy thought in Papers, Please. The whole game has a depressing feel to it, but this is what the creator was aiming for. He wasn’t trying to make a fantasy where everything is good and right in the world; his approach is honest and sinister.\n\nThe sensational achievement that is Papers, Please art design is not enough on its own to be worth playing, but with the addition of its intriguing gameplay mechanics and consistent challenge makes for a level of enjoyment other artistic games miss, Papers, Please is not great because of its perfection at simulating paperwork, or its ability to depict gruesome settings and artistic impurity. It is great because it can balance the two elements so well and make for an experience like no other.\n\nPapers, Please proves that a game doesn’t need a million dollar budget and a team of thousands of developers to be good. Papers, Please was made by one man and standing up there with the biggest games of 2013. Papers, Please is the result of artistic brilliance and will be remembered and celebrated for many years to come.","March 22, 2014","true","26.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Think 'hidden object game' crossed with 'time management game' in a depressing Soviet landscape.\n\nIt is a truly ingenious puzzle game at it's core and the dreary art style is a perfect fit.  You play as a border guard tasked with checking passports and visas and ultimately deciding who gets to enter the country.  It eases you into the game gently enough that anyone can play the first few rounds, but it quickly gets devilishly difficult as the rules and regulations for entering the country become more and more complex.  Accuracy and speed become factors if you care at all about feeding your family and protecting them from the bitter cold - you could always let them starve or freeze of course...\n\nThe game goes so far as to make you face moral dilemmas, it creates a sort of paranoia where you trust no one and even begin to question your own intentions.\n\nOnce I started playing, it was really difficult to stop and I would highly recommend trying this game if you like detail oriented puzzle games.  There's an overarching story that's actually quite interesting. It does get repetitive, but the variation between levels and the difficulty factor is enough to keep you entertained for a good while!","November 28, 2013","true","4.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

That might be due to the fact that it's kind of dumb to compare two different mediums based on genre, but I digress.\n\nPapers, Please places you in the role of a border-control worker under a fascist regime in the 1980s that's eerily similar to the Soviet Union. Your job is to inspect the paper work presented by immigrating people and catch discrepancies and/or forgeries. The amount of people you deal with determines your paycheck, which adds a certain degree of urgency to the game. When you're not working, you're also managing your expenses in order to keep your family members healthy and, well, alive. If you make mistakes and turn away or allow people in based on incorrect paper work, you're eventually docked from your pay. The problem is, though, that a lot of the people trying to get into Arstotska have heart-felt stories to tell... and full wallets. You'll be offered bribes from desperate immigrants, your colleagues, and even a rebel group trying to overthrow the government.\n\nThis is actually an extremely complex and engrossing game. The amount of paperwork you have to inspect changes entirely or increases as the game progresses. You're constantly learning new ways to inspect for forgeries; non-matching birth dates, weight, issuing city, gender, photos, fingerprints, etc. You learn to be overly-meticulous in your inspections as well as lightning-quick. I actually started to call old ladies names because they were wasting my time with forgeries. I could be dealing with two more people in the time that I'm spending clearing up your discrepancies, you idiot!\n\nWhere a lot of other games might force you into the position of a daring hero with the aims to take down authoritarian governments head-on, Papers, Please demonstrates the tension and risk involved with everyday living under a realistic representation of fascism. I can't think of a single other game that tries to be historically accurate as well as give an honest depiction of what life for the bourgeois would be like in this sort of place and time. It's this level of immersion that contributes to a beautifully written narrative and abundance of side stories, as well. The gameplay is the story, and ultimately if you do your job right you come to feel overly invested in the well-being of your family and the people you encounter on the job.\n\nThe game plays like a dream, too. I was able to drag everything around my desk and inspect literally every aspect of the paper work without a single lapse in responsiveness, which may have been on account of the pixelly-8bit art style. Like everything else in this game, though, the visuals are purposeful and contribute to the game's bleak atmosphere.\n\nPlay Papers, Please!

It's a very interesting.. data management game, for lack of a better term, with quite an interesting storyline that is going on around the player and his little customs box.\n\nThough there are some personally uncomfortable themes in the game, I did not actually get a sense of depression or desperation from playing the game that some others have mentioned, though I can definitely see where that can come from. But once you figure out you can alternate not paying food or heating every other day, and know to avoid a couple early game pitfalls, money really isn't a problem any longer and you're free to follow your morals and eat any penalties, and you'll have enough money to still trivialize the later parts of the game as long as you're not going for both the money-heavy achievements at once. I feel the interaction with the people trying to cross the border could have been written to be much more heartbreaking than it was, though.\n\nOne of the shining stars of the game is the branching save system, it saves a new save at the start of each day, linked to the day before it, and if you go back in time and load a save and continue from there, it creates a new save chain that branches out from the old one at the point that you loaded from. The graphics are nowhere near modern, but fit in quite well with the dystopian time period and the feel of the game.\n\nThe game really drags you into the plot, a hapless "lottery winner" set in a world that's parallel to strife-torn eastern Europe from the past, but with city and country names that hint at regions from all around the world. The area is ripped apart by the aftermath and lingering threat of a civil war and tensions between the various countries, and all that plays heavily into your day to day work, constantly throwing you new challenges and twists. Tons of interesting personalities, nefarious types and the friendliest criminal ever! all try to cross your border at various points, and there is a lot of implied stuff that happens off screen, some that you can affect and some that you cannot as you head toward one of several good or bad endings.","July 7, 2014","true","18.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","2"

It has some special feeling to it, that i haven't seen before. You feel like you are a piece of that little machinery that is Arstotzka and it makes you wanna play it again and again.\nIt has an 16-bit graphical type that is really good for it being developed by only on person. But i can't understand where the 2GB Ram needed to play this game come from.\nIt has a really cachy theme and an ending music that really makes you feel happy, but except for these two, there is no music.\nThe gameplay is really a new thing i haven't seen before, but you could call it a "simulator" if you want, but it really isn't that much of one. It also features a challenge mode with leaderboard, for people who that, it's an extra of 4-5 hours of gameplay.\nTo end it here, Papers please is a really interessting game, a crown of the indie gerne and and worth the few bucks. But if you don't think it'll be interesting for you, don't pick it up. You really have to engage in it to have fun. But once you have, it's a hell lot of fun. This game gets an Indie 8/10.

These people are missing the point.\n\nYes, this game is unlike many other video games because it is poignant and is attempting to make some very serious social commentary.\n\nBriefly, you are a customs agent for a country vaguely reminiscent of Cold War era Russia.  Your job is to check the paperwork of all people attempting to enter your country.  Those who check out are permitted to enter and the rest are either rejected or detained.\n\nYour job is only part of the story.  After work every day you struggle to provide food, heat, and medicine for your family.  You can make more money if you process paperwork faster but this often results in mistakes and fines threatening to send you into debt or worse.\n\nThis game is not like a restaurant worker simulator because it has a clear message.  Well, even the restaurant simulators are maybe suggesting you have some empathy for overworked servers.\n\nThis game makes a more serious point:  Border crossings are dehumanizing for both those attempting to cross as well as for the employees.  Those travelling are subject to invasive searches, embarassing questions, endless lines, and the potential for political violence against their persons.  The employees in turn begin to treat the travellers not as humans but as cattle or a meal ticket.  These workers must carry out the often arbitrary regulations of their country in a way that often divides famliers and destroys lives.\n\nThis is not a game that one can play forever.  It is good for a couple play throughs and maybe a little exploration of the bonus modes.  It does not take very long to get to the heart of this game.  After a short time of playing you will start to feel hollow inside.  And that is the point.\n\nI cannot think of a game that has engaged the hearts and minds of players to contemplate very real political problems in this way.  In closing, the game is not fun.  The game is terrible.  And this is the point.","August 2, 2014","true","13.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","2"

There is a surprising amount of little side stories in the game that is given to you just through interaction with people at your checkpoint window.

Characters have medium depth (i.e. you know their names, and get used to their behaviours). Day to Day difficulty increases, especially when situation changes (i.e. policy changes, bombs).

Being a boarder security guard just reached another level of awesomeness.\n\nJust as the trailer shows you check passports - but it gets progressively harder over the course of time, not to mention interesting. The trailer literally nails what the game is about and does a good job of it. I found myself playing for an hour easily the first time I played. It literally delivers what it is designed to and isn't meant for a person who cannot sit still and analyze the finer details required to meet the games challenge demands. I like it as it forces me to pay attention. There are surprises in the game and nothing works exactly as it's supposed to. You may be offered a bribe half way through the game, and if you take it, you may get away with it. However, you may get caught down the line and then thrown in prison. Subsequently, you must try your best to keep your family alive. Money pays for heat and health needs of the family. Upgrades are also available for the booth, as well as your dwelling.

I did not let him through  I was on break…\n\nIntro\nPapers, please at first glance looks like a boring simulator of a tedious job but the first impression couldn’t be anything but horribly wrong.\n\nAccept or Decline\nYou can accept or decline people to pass through or not. The interesting thing is finding the errors in their passport. Finding errors in the start of the game was not interesting at first but as  the game progressed though it got more complicated and always mixed up the circumstances. This allowed for pretty interesting engagement.\n\nMemorize Memorize Memorize\nThis most obvious requirement of the game is to memorize rules,cities and symbols in order to properly do the job quickly and efficiently. You don’t need to be einstein or anything but it really does help your budget to be good at your job. Since the rules constantly change its best to know the basics through repetition so if a person forges it you are able to tell quickly and not get tricked.\n\nIf you screw up you get a citation which will eventually penalize you for making mistakes. Starting with 0 - 5 - 10 etc and constantly increasing. Sometimes its not about the quality of your work but rather the guilt of your heart when you pass someone with improper documentation because you would rather have that person succeed at what they told you then make them turn back.\n\nPeople Matter\nThere is a really gray area in this game where you have to make constant choices throughout the days between your family or strangers. These strangers mind you, weather telling the truth or not, can have their lives greatly effected on your decisions. Its up to you to decide who you prioritize, your family and reputation or strangers and their dreams.\n\nThere are npc’s that add more depth to the game from trying to decode cult-like messages to using your power to jail lots of people to make the officer more money to split with you.\n\nEndings and Consequences\nHow you proceed through the game will effect what ending will occur. In many situations it can happen sooner than later. The variety of endings and context is actually pretty good and not a blatant copy and paste of each other unlike a certain other game I rather not mention.\n\nEndless Mode\nThere is endless mode which allows you to select 3 categories timed, perfect, endless. The courses are basically difficulties and the higher you go max being 4 the harder it becomes to process people.\n\nThis also has steam leaderboards in case you want to compare yourself with friends but that would look rather silly wouldn’t it?  Hey, I am the best stamper of my steam friends group wooo!....\n\nRandom Experiences\n“hey I want to be with my husband!” Ok lady you are the 1000th customer so we will let you through… (citation pops up) “You screwed up again”\n\n“Hey buddy! You are the greatest here is my passport” “sir that passport looks like your kid drew it” “GOT A PROBLEM ? oh i mean well yes sorry i will come back with a better passport”","March 13, 2014","true","6.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It takes a completely mundane, boring job, makes a game about it, and makes it fun.\n\nSeriously, imagine some pitching the following idea to you.\n\n"How about a game where you play a customs officer? People come into your office on the country border, hand you their passport and other documents, and you check to make sure everything is in order."\n\nIf you are a publisher, you would stop listening to that person. If you aren't a publisher, you would still probably think it's a bad idea.\n\nThe thing is, though, that's exactly what the game is, and it's still fun to play. Even more mind-bogglingly, it's fun to play through two or three times.\n\nWhat makes this possible is the scenario. You work the border of a communist country that's clearly supposed to be a rip-off of Russia. (At least that's my interpretation. There are apparently several other valid possibilities, but it's clear that every country is ripping off some real country.) This is the job the government has assigned to you. Said government doesn't take ♥♥♥♥ from slackers, so rather than pay you by the hour, they pay you by the person. You have to provide for you and your family though, so the faster you work, the better the pay. That is, unless you start screwing up. If you let someone in that had bad papers, or deny someone with good papers, you get paid nothing, and also get docked pay for each mistake past the first. This alone creates a tension; work too fast, and you get screwed by mistakes, but work too slow, and you get screwed by inadequete pay.\n\nOn top of this, there are several unique characters that visit you every day. Many of them can be described as "I know my papers aren't in order but pleasepleaseplease let me in." For example, a husband with good papers asks you to let his wife in, who's next in line, but missing a critical paper. Do you take pity and let her in, or stick to your job and separate them?\n\nThere is a lot going on; the game reacts to your choices in a very natural way. Did you catch a wanted criminal trying to get through customs? The newspaper headline tomorrow will exclaim "Criminal caught in customs!"\n\nThere are too many examples to list, especially when several of them will spoil key elements of the game.\n\nTrust me. Just buy this game. It's worth the price tag. I know the concept is a hard sell, but you will NOT be disappointed.","December 27, 2015","true","29.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","7","8","2","0"

It takes monotony and finds away to make it fun and you feel invested in what you're doing. You're scanning people's passports for errors using various tools as an immigration officer for a fictional Russian-like country.\n\nFor the most part it's pretty stright forward but as time goes on the things you have to look for become more numerous and more subtle raising the difficulty as time goes on. For every day you complete you get money. And with that money you decide which necessities your family can afford. Maybe today they get to eat. Tomarrow they may get some heat in your apartment so they don't freeze to death. Maybe your son needs medication or he won't make it through the night. Rarley will have enough to do everything and if you don't manage your funds it's very likley that some or all of your family will die.\n\nBut it's not all just checking passes and hoping your family doesn't die from having their basic needs go unforfilled. There is a bigger story happening and while you're never outright told if you fulfill certain requirements the story will turn down one of a handful of paths.\n\nIt's a very interesting game and I highly recommend it.","October 29, 2014","true","7.7"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

As the government becomes more and more paranoid and constantly implements new rules as they're meant to fix the mistakes it has made, the difficulty increases - for you, the mere paper worker.\n\nCombined with the fact you're being paid accordingly with the amount of papers you've processed, it turns out that you cannot process them as quickly as when you got this position. A single detail is missed, and you're fined. You've got to make a choice between analyzing papers carefully and giving up on your earnings and trying to get through them quickly risking to miss on a little detail.\n\nLater on, it turns out that you cannot even put a little piece of decoration in your office, a little display of humanity in yourself. A swift reminder that you aren't a human - you're a human unit, a worker supposed to operate at a machine level efficiency, no matter the difficulty.\n\nThe longer you play, the more tension there is - and no way less morbid one than the one against the final boss of the level/the game. The longer you play, the more questions there are to ask and to answer to yourself. The longer you play, the further your work style shapes who you become closer to the end.\n\nNo surprise there are 20 endings - the game, being simple in graphics and context, not moving you any further than but one location, provides a pretty wide range of moral choices, work styles, opportunities for a better future, and overall psychological development of your character. You aren't the same since you've occupied this post.

Well, it's overdue then.\n\nPapers, Please is simply a MUST HAVE on Steam.  Especially if you like to try your hand at beurocratic tasks in a video game in an exciting way.  It's monotonous, but enjoyable.   I know it's less than 20 hours to get 100%, but I logged in (at the time of this writing) at least 43 hours of gameplay.  It's that good.\n\nYou play as an unknown inspector who was elected through a lottery to work  as a security guard running a graveyard shift at Freddy Fazbear's pizzeria for 5 nights as a border inspector between the cursed Kolechia and the wonderous motherland Arstotzka for one month.  But you have a time limit in which you can work, which adds pressure to your performance.  Inspect more and provide the correct responses quickly to get paid more.  Make mistakes and it'll come out of your paycheck after 2 free warnings a day.  By the end of the day, you'll need to pay for rent, food (optional), heat (optional), medical bills (optional if heat or food is neglected), and various other opportunities.  You play as a father providing for your family.  If your family dies (or other conditions occur), the game is over.   It's also a plus that it throws in ethical dillemas to keep you on your toes.\n\nPeople say this game is communistic and I'd say I agree with their statements.  You are playing in a job you did not choose and are dissuaded from trying to make more than you actually do...which makes it understandable why people would take bribes in communistic or socialist countries.\n\nThere are various paths you can take to different endings.  You can choose to complete your tasks in a purely beaurocratic manner for the motherland Arstotzka, you can help aid in a revolution for the Order of the EZIC Star, or you can escape Arstotzka by moving away with forged passports.   The fate of the people, the nation, and your family are in your hands.\n\n\nPROS:\nAddicting gameplay\nGreat (yet simple) story\nGreat challenges\nNice Puzzles (if you choose to work for EZIC)\nImplementation of ethical dillemas\nNo bugs\nRandomized portraits and stats based on a database (great programming)\nArstotzka  (Joke pro.  XD)\n\nCONS:\nLimited music choices\nNo planned sequel at this point\nCan be infuriating if you make mistakes\nNot all moral/ethical choices are judged/rewarded\nMay be too bland/boring/monotonous to some  (Not for me, but there are times where it can feel dull)\nKolechia  (Okay, that's a joke con.  Just making sure you're reading these.  lol)\n\n\nThis game is a great experience that seems simplistic, yet is so much more.  You can lose yourself for hours at a time playing this game.  I cannot say whether or not it's worth full price, but if it is on sale, you would have to be crazy to not grab it.  This game truly competes with "Triple A" First Party companies and proves that indies can be great things.\n\n\n9/10  Glory to Arstotzka!","January 23","true","53.5"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","9","13","4","0"

I am now trained to use a gun to deal with attackers, and I am a very good shooter. Secretly though, I am part of a special underground operation that aims to take down the horrible government and I recieve messages from them every day.\n\nThis game has a lot to offer.

Why, you ask? Because the game is just not fun to play. It's a pain in alot of ways. I've got a good memory and detail for spotting errors, and even then I messed up so often in this game that it got rather embarassing. But I did get to the end, and got all the achievements. So even my utter failure at being a border inspector managed to be ok in the end.\n\nSo if it's not fun to play, why is this a "yes" recommendation? Atmosphere. The lack of fun adds to that, oddly enough, and what you get is a game where you feel like a bureaucrat working for a pseudo facist/communist government that pays you crumbs and is all too ready to throw you in jail. The whole game dips you into this unpleasant world and does not let you escape unless you beat it or quit the game.\n\nSo it's an unfun game that uses that to add to the game's superbly done setting. If nothing else, it's often a very cheap game so you won't lose much money buying it. I'd say its worth checking out, if only to see what the fuss is about and to be the jackass government employee you always wanted to be... for only a few hours.\n\nGlory to... no. That place sucks.

Papers, Please has you being randomly chosen as the chief inspector of the newly opened border to the oppressive and corrupt glorious country of Arstotszka, your family has been moved to a class-8 settlement and you will need to balance how quickly you get people through your border with making sure that you are only letting through people with 100% valid paperwork to get paid and to support your family so they don't die cold, hungry, and sick. Which seems easy enough, but as the border becomes more and more strict and as the game adds more and more rules to watch out for it can become quite the challange which requires a lot of observation to do your job right. Alongside this, the game will offer a lot of moral dilemmas of desperate people who want into your country who you can approve, but would suffer a penalty for doing so. you shall not approve under any circumstance unless they have the correct paperwork.\n\nThe game's story is told very behind-the-scenes and you might not even notice how expansive the story is until the end of your first playthough, with the game having twenty different endings to get to depending on the choices you make and the people you do and don't let through. The game, like some other games of Pope's, seeks to make a political statement about security, violation of privacy and rights, and unjust censorship.\n\nThis game is in no ways pretty, the look is dark and dystopian, and the world barely has any color in it, but it's all made this way to help suit the style of the game and also to not blind the player with too much information. It allows you to easily see if a picture is false and if there is something wrong about someone's papers, such as a forged seal.\n\nOverall, the game is very good at what it does and I believe that it actually is worth the ten dollar price tag, as it has a lot of replayability to see the different endings, and the game also has an endless mode. Frankly, there is so much more I could talk about in this game and why it's genius but it would spoil much of the experience, it's really a game that you have to play for yourself.\n\nNow,\nPapers, Please.","July 1, 2014","true","7.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

Heavily influenced by the border systems present during World War II, Papers, Please introduces the player to the communist state of Arstotzka, which recently ended a 6-year war with its neighbors and otherwise reclaimed its rightful half of the border town, Grestin.\n\nWinning the lottery would be a nice thing – everywhere but in Arstotzka and in Shirley Jackson’s novel. Unlike Jackson’s novel however, the player gets to live after winning the lottery, but they are forced to take the job as an immigration inspector. And without further ado or formal introduction, day one starts and the player has to face foreigners wanting to immigrate and citizens wishing to return – all with both poor and good attempts to cross the border and (re-)enter Arstotzka.\n\nThe gameplay appears extremely simple, but as the game progresses and more regulations are added to the border-security and immigration processes, the harder and more complex the game becomes. The player has to ensure details ranging from name, day-of-birth, sex and passport number to appearance, height and work pass’ are in correct order. Should the player fail to do so, more than three times per shift, a penalty is applied which ultimately hits the player hard as they are under a massive pressure to support a wife, mother-in-law, son and uncle with food, heat, medicine and shelter.\n\nThis ultimately introduces a great range of moral choices – should the player bend the rules after hearing some visitor’s heartbreaking stories and let them enter; knowing the consequences? A few achievements are in fact challenging the player’s moral stance – for instance, should an aging woman be allowed to visit her son despite having discrepancy in her papers? Similar, as the entry requirements tightens – following the significant increase in terrorist attacks inside Arstotzka against the oppressive government – more people may be detained. The choice, however, ultimately lays with the player – but as the nearby guard continues to declare his willingness to share his payment, which happens to be based on the amount of detains, the more tempted the player becomes. It becomes a simple matter of survival and thus prioritization.\n\nAn interesting aspect to Papers, Please is the sound effects, audio and graphics. There are no identifiable voices (in any language), but rather extremely robotic and inhumane voices – something which follows the unidentifiable, gender less and anonymous queue outside the inspector booth. Both elements together with the Kafkaesque, colourless and overall dystopian environment greatly amplifies the alienation between the state and the people.\n\nThe lack of human compassion is stunning, but perhaps very fitting for a totalitarian bureaucracy which values the state above everything and everyone. This, once again, introduces the player’s role – no action is inconsequential, and with every coin having two sides nothing is just black and white. Yet the player is ultimately the only one who can question the procedures and do the unexpected and unwanted; show compassion and empathy. The choices will ultimately impact the player’s family directly as illnesses, hunger and cold all follows rapidly though.\n\nPapers, Please is in truth a unique game which pokes to the player’s moral and human compassion. It introduces the player to a very special and dystopian environment which, if allowed, greatly influences the player. It is not a game for everyone, but those who wishes to find a raw pearl within the ocean of indie-games and for those who treasures great narrative and design, this is the game.\n\nGlory to Arstotzka.\n\nRead my full review: http://212fahrenheit.reviews/?p=133","August 12, 2014","true","8.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Some are smugglers, some are reporters that I can't let through, some don't have the right papers but beg and bribe me, some have stories, some cuss at me, some threaten me, and some launch terrorist attacks. Personally, I'll let anyone in that will bribe me enough to compensate for my violation fees, and detain anyone because I made a deal with a security guard to have half of his bonus whenever I detain a person with him. I am now trained to use a gun to deal with attackers, and I am a very good shooter. Secretly though, I am part of a special underground operation that aims to take down the horrible government and I recieve messages from them every day.\n\nThis game has a lot to offer. Seems simple at first, but when you get into it, it turns out to be really great. Papers, Please is a true storytelling masterpiece.","November 5, 2014","true","5.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

Consequences greatly effect what is already the far-from-content life of which you spend stamping passports at a border checkpoint. But this task alters beyond promise, and presentation in ways that I cant help but call bold. New mechanics are added as the game progresses, as well as characters to sacrifice for. This game made me feel for the poor 8-bit immigrates being denied access back into their country, it also made me choose who to betray and how to go about situational hardship. Managing finance and family was an interesting take on putting a face or a name to your character. 30 different endings, spanning 30+ days will keep you playing more than you probaby should, and unique gameplay only further insures this.\nGames like this make me think, and not many games do that, even fewer that are 8-bit, and fewer more at this price point.\nDo whatever it takes to give this game a place in your Steam Library!\n","January 13, 2015","true","33.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

But the keyword here is "yet".  This game captures one thing impeccably well: going through the daily grind over and over and over.  Definitely recommend a mouse and not just a trackpad for this one as each day is time sensitive.\n\nAnother really great aspect is the ability to choose personal morals over the morals of the state.  Do you buy the sob story and let the lady pass, or do you send her back to her war torn country because her stamp is invalid.  Will that affect how much you can feed your family?!\n\nAs to your family: you make a certain amount of credits each day based on how many people you correctly allowed to immigrate.  Each day the rules get a little harder.  Each day you make a little less.  At some point, you have to use money management to decide if, with the pittance you just made, you are going to: heat your house, buy food for your family, purchase medicine or upgrade your booth.

Nonetheless, I love games which teach you to think faster.\n\nGlory to Arstotzka! 9.986/10","December 25, 2014","true","5.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

But the keyword here is "yet".  This game captures one thing impeccably well: going through the daily grind over and over and over.  Definitely recommend a mouse and not just a trackpad for this one as each day is time sensitive.\n\nAnother really great aspect is the ability to choose personal morals over the morals of the state.  Do you buy the sob story and let the lady pass, or do you send her back to her war torn country because her stamp is invalid.  Will that affect how much you can feed your family?!\n\nAs to your family: you make a certain amount of credits each day based on how many people you correctly allowed to immigrate.  Each day the rules get a little harder.  Each day you make a little less.  At some point, you have to use money management to decide if, with the pittance you just made, you are going to: heat your house, buy food for your family, purchase medicine or upgrade your booth.  If you can't pay rent, the game is over.\n\nIf given the chance would I buy it again?

Wonder about accessibility options?  This review is for you:\n\nI have been wanting to check out this game forever.  What’s more exciting than working the border & telling people who aren’t allowed in to bugger off?  That’s pretty much the basis of Papers, Please.  You check passports and paperwork to allow people into Arstotzka.  You need to earn enough money to support your family. But all that info does no good if we can’t play it.  So, how’s accessibility?\n\nI can’t explain how excited I was to see this.  You can get windowed mode before you even open the game.  Thank you developers!  Windowed mode is borderless so you can access your desktop with ease. Onscreen Keyboard was a click away but honestly wasn’t needed in the first look.  So far the game is pretty point and click.  I haven’t found a way to control gameplay with the keyboard alone, but will keep trying and will definitely report back if a solution is found.  Colorblind mode is also nowhere to be found.\n\nSo far Papers, Please has been a joy for mouse only players.  The first level took nothing more than point and click or drag and drop mechanics.  The speed at which you complete each level does determine income, but during early levels I haven’t felt the need to rush thus causing fatigue.  Things may change at later levels.","March 3, 2014","true","0.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It's unique in a good way. It seems dull, repetitive, and boring, but believe it or not, it's actually FUN. You are an immigration inspector who must see who can and can't pass through the border to Arstotzka, which makes me think of Soviet Russia in many ways. Pretty difficult game to me, since it can be hard finding the fake passports, IDs, etc etc. To add on to this great game, there are lots of humorous and somewhat sad parts. We all know and love Jorji, the most honest immigrant you'll ever find, and also I remember encountering a woman who wanted to see her son that she never saw in 6 years, but I had to not let her pass because I found some issues with her passport. The graphics are great! I can't say a single bad thing about it. TBH I don't even know if there really is a story to this, but that would be hard to do, especially for this type of game. My only flaw is that they could've had some more lore to the game so that way I could learn about Arstotzka and all of the other countries. Also, the endless mode is a bit repetitive, so don't expect much replay value. This is probably one of my favorite indie games right now, and is a special game that pops out from the best. I would certainly buy this.

Finding the discrepancies between the documents can be quite engaging at times, as you have to make sure that they follow the rules that are set out. Following these rules such as remembering what is and what is not allowed, stamping documents can be challenging and for the first time possibly overwhelming, however the more you play the easier it gets and you will have a better experience.

Arstotzka is a fictional country bearing a resemblance to the former soviet union before its collapse in December 26th of 1991. As the game starts it's very simple and straightforward, and as you would expect as the game progresses it become more challenging. However there's a catch, you're not just stamping passports without a goal, mind you! Every person you process correctly gains you an income, this income is then put towards maintaining your family's well being and as well as upgrading your workstation to improve efficiency. Papers, Please also has a compelling story that's choice based and is definitely worth replays to experience each choices effects.\n\nOverall this game is designed to challenge you. You need to know how to maintain a level head when faced with a stressful work environment, however that being said it's not rage inducing at all. The one thing to consider is that each day in the game will timed, but fair. The other major reason I love this game is that it makes you pay attention to detail and if you have a keen eye it can be quite satisfying to spot forged documentation.\n\nWhile I never like to give a game a score I must say that it’s looking like a 9/10 for me, and the reason I never like giving scores is because the game is only as good as what you put into the game.\n\nGlory to Arstotzka!","January 1","true","9.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","1"

The game takes place in the ficticious country of Arstotzka, you are a worker at the border control. The main gameplay element is to check the papers of the entrants and either deny them or let them through. What sounds tedious and repetitive at first, soon develops into moral conflicts and hard decisions. Papers, Please is not just a "border control simulator", but tells a story. You have a family to feed, so you want to do your job good. Unlawfully letting entrants through leads to citations and finally penalties, you might even lose your job. But do you really want to disunite a family or change the fate of other people to the worse, just for the sake of doing a good job? Do you let a drug smuggler or terrorist through because he bribes you with money that could save your family from starving?

Upon interrorgation, you can detain them (like if they have weapons or forged papers) or let them through. There are some moralistic choices along the way. For instance, one husband has all the correct paperwork, but his wife is next in line with missing paperwork.

Here we go!\nGlory to Arstotzka!\nThe greatest country!\n\nYou are an immigration inspector, stationed at the Artotzkan side of the city Grestin, a city which shares the border with neighboring Kolechia. Your job is to conrol the constant flow of poeple entering your country. Massive hordes of people wish to enter Arstotzka, many of whom are not friendly. You'll encounter smugglers, spies, murderers, and terrorists. Using only the documents provided by travelers and the Ministry of Admission's primitive inspect, search and fingerprint systems, you must decide who can enter Arstotzka and who will be turned away or arrested.\n\nGameplay in Papers, Please is rediculously fluid. Almost completely randomized, the game manages to make border inspection fun. As soon as a civilian approaches the booth, you must instantly snap up and pay attention. There are so many things to check for. Just to name a few: date of birth, expiration date, gender, face, if wanted criminal or not, weight, height, ID number, legit passport, and more. Terrorist attacks will be frequent, and you must be ready. You have a tranq at your side from day 16 on, and you will use it.  You'll always be on your toes.\n\nPapers, Please has many attractive features as well. The game in itself looks attractive, yielding a more harsh style. Everything in-game gives a nice vibe that definitely add to the experience. The interface may be a little difficult to get used to, but, with a little practice, become very easy. Booth upgrades increase fluidity and generally make the play quicker.\n\nPapers, Please, in addition to beautifully executed mechanics, has an amazing degree of humour and variability. With many, many references, Papers, Please does not dissapoint in the "entertainment" category. Random events will occur, as well as some scripted, more out-of-the-ordinary, ones. EZIC agents will require your assistance in restoring the Arstotzkan government, and amusing certain others (I'm looking at you, Jorji.) will attempt to surpass your stand. The game is endlessly fun.\n\nAside from the 20 different endings of story-mode, there is an unlockable "endless mode" available to play. This mode takes full advantage of the Papers, Please's randomization, and effectively increases the game's length.\n\nAll in all, Papers, Please is an enjoyable gaming experience that I would happily recommend to any gamer of any type.\n\nGlory to Arstotzka.","January 11, 2014","true","8.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Using only the documents provided by travelers and the Ministry of Admission's primitive inspect, search and fingerprint systems, you must decide who can enter Arstotzka and who will be turned away or arrested.\n\nGameplay in Papers, Please is rediculously fluid. Almost completely randomized, the game manages to make border inspection fun. As soon as a civilian approaches the booth, you must instantly snap up and pay attention. There are so many things to check for. Just to name a few: date of birth, expiration date, gender, face, if wanted criminal or not, weight, height, ID number, legit passport, and more. Terrorist attacks will be frequent, and you must be ready. You have a tranq at your side from day 16 on, and you will use it.  You'll always be on your toes.\n\nPapers, Please has many attractive features as well. The game in itself looks attractive, yielding a more harsh style. Everything in-game gives a nice vibe that definitely add to the experience. The interface may be a little difficult to get used to, but, with a little practice, become very easy. Booth upgrades increase fluidity and generally make the play quicker.\n\nPapers, Please, in addition to beautifully executed mechanics, has an amazing degree of humour and variability. With many, many references, Papers, Please does not dissapoint in the "entertainment" category. Random events will occur, as well as some scripted, more out-of-the-ordinary, ones. EZIC agents will require your assistance in restoring the Arstotzkan government, and amusing certain others (I'm looking at you, Jorji.) will attempt to surpass your stand. The game is endlessly fun.\n\nAside from the 20 different endings of story-mode, there is an unlockable "endless mode" available to play. This mode takes full advantage of the Papers, Please's randomization, and effectively increases the game's length.\n\nAll in all, Papers, Please is an enjoyable gaming experience that I would happily recommend to any gamer of any type.\n\nGlory to Arstotzka.","January 11, 2014","true","8.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

However as you progress the story unfolds to something more complex, maybe even emotional. Throughout your work you discover people and their stories, which can have a deep impact. E.g. an immigrant hasn't seen her son in six years but has expired documents. Do you deny her entry? Or do you let her through and face disciplinary action from your superiors? The pressure builds, as you are the only financial provider for a family of five.

You have a book of rules and it is your job to either approve or deny citizens. If there is a discrepancy between the rules and their passport or paperwork, you have to interrogate them. Upon interrorgation, you can detain them (like if they have weapons or forged papers) or let them through. There are some moralistic choices along the way. For instance, one husband has all the correct paperwork, but his wife is next in line with missing paperwork. Do you let her through and risk a citation or deny her because of the rules?\n\nAs the game progresses, there are more and more information you have to keep an eye on. Even the tiniest error can glaze over your eyes like mismatched gender and weight on the paperwork. The game may seem "boring and repititive," but that is the point of the game. It's suppposed to simulate a boring, real life job. There is also a secret organization that tries to take down the government and you can choose to participate with them or not. Papers, Please has a great sense of humor with 20 different endings and memorable characters. In order to attain a better apartment for your family as well as food and heat, you have to process people faster and correctly to make more money.\n\n"Glory to Arstotzka!"","January 13, 2014","true","14.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GerDeathstar/recommended/239030/","GerDeathstar","Deathstar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GerDeathstar/","407 products in account",""Papers, please.", the name of this game is also that one piece of dialogue you will read over and over and over again. You are an inspector for a communist regime, in a fictional country set in 1982. It is your job to keep the country safe, now that its borders have opened up again (a little). Natives and foreigners alike will have to show you their papers, including passports, ID cards and permits of various sorts and you must check them for credibility. Basically, Papers, Please is a simulation of the actual job of a border guard. Since this is set in a dystopian, cold war-era though, it is far from boring. Security is tight and you cannot afford any mistakes, especially because the life of your own family depends on it. After each day of sieving through papers, you will have to spend your hard-earned salary on rent, food and warmth for your loved ones. This forces you to work fast, though working fast makes you more prone to errors, which in turn might lead to penalties for any mistakes, even those as small as forgetting to check the date of expiration on a worker's permit.\n\nPutting yourself and your family first will mean absolute obedience to your regime, however, and a strict and methological approach to every single one of the (partly random, partly story-related) visitors. Some will tell you sad stories about how much they miss their family, others will flat-out lie to you and it is always up to you if they may enter or not. A psychological experiment, one could say. Will you stand up against a cold government and turn a blind eye on those with no malicious intend or will you be absolutely loyal in order to secure your paycheck for the day?\n\nPlaying through the storymode will confront you with various events, setting off chains and affecting the game later on. Apart from this, there are also some endless-gamemodes included, such as endurance (work until you run out of money) or time-trial (finish up as many people as possible within a given time).\n\nPapers, Please is one of the most interesting games out there right now and it does not even need any graphical miracles to pull that off. In fact, the monotone, pixelated world only contributes to its disturbingly grim atmosphere.\n\nWhat would you do?","August 21, 2013","true","9.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

It was 2013 GOTY in Indie Development.\n\n2. It is difficult but not impossible as i found myself the first time through getting to 7 days but on the next time knowing how the game played out i was able to get a lot further as i saved money daily and made sure i made small compromises so that my family didn’t die of hunger or being cold.\n\n3.The game gives you very hard choices to make for example in day 2 (i believe) a man says "my wife is next in line we are going to start a new life" which he has correct everything so i let him in but then the wife comes without an entry pass you have to decide to risk getting a fine or to let her into the country with her husband (HINT let her in achievement hunters).\n\n4. The theme tune along in the background deserves a pickup of the game as it really sets the tune of a communist country out of a war.\n\n5.The art style of this game is impeccable as it is very arcade and 80's feeling\n\n6.

Because of this, there are only two games other than this one that I consider "art", Shadow of the Colossus and Limbo. But SotC and Limbo both have similar atmospheres and worlds, something that Papers Please doesn't bother trying to set up to the same extent.\n\nPapers Please works instead as the videogame equivalent to Albert Camus's "The Stranger", in that you have to choose what is morally right and logically right. There's no real answer to any of the major border holdups you encounter throughout the game. By supporting a totalitarian regime you help secure your family's safety, but at the price of the immigrants and revolutionaries crossing the border. By helping the underground resistance movements, you put yourself and your entire family at risk, without the closure of knowing you became a martyr for a bigger cause.\n\nSo there's the holdup. Do you go with what is ethically right, appealing to your emotions to do what's best in the grand scheme of things? Or do what is logically right, sacrificing your own humanity for protection and security?\n\nGame's pretty fun too.","June 12, 2014","true","22.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The concept itself is let alone just brilliant but when laced with a great storytelling in which player can impact and with a gameplay that enhances the back-to-the-childhood feeling you get, Papers, Please is one to remeber. Just the ancient-sounding theme music brings an amused grin to your face - a reminder of the good old times. This is not easy game by any means, requires some brains and sharp eye but not in an annoying way. I found the difficulty very fitting and enjoyable.\n\nPapers, Please may not offer something to play for a very long time right away (depends on person), that said it will surely exceed its value by far anyway in the hands of an average gamer. On the other hand I can see myself returning to this game in future, similarly as with e.g. Max Payne, DOOM, etc. I do not want to give spoilers - one's has to experience this game like it happens in it's story - out of the blue.

Either you're intrigued by the concept, curious just how they can manage to make such a boring idea into compelling action, or you're instantly repelled by the premise, and rightfully so. This is about as indie as indie games get, and also as brilliant as they get. It takes such a simple thing, and wraps it up in politics, real-world parallels, and perhaps even some genuine feels to make you feel more invested in the fate of a fictional immigration officer than you ever would about a generic grimacing action hero.\n\nBut drama and intelligence aside, it's also surprisingly fun, with a very smooth difficulty curve that makes you feel your own skills improving just enough to meet the game's increasing demands. It even comes with some bonus high score modes that you could conceivably see yourself playing. It tells an interesting, branching story through simple means while also somehow managing to make boring real life work into entertainment I want more of. This is pretty much the epitome of why I love the indie game market despite all its warts.","September 18, 2015","true","10.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The goal of the player is to inspect documents using a set of tools and in some occasions to inspect the individual per se, in order to keep criminals out of the country . Everything is a bit unknown, until it will be disclosed , the more you play .\n\nEvery work day, you receive a document with informations about particular things you have to notice about, the arrival of important people and/or if you have to take some measures if a specific occasion happens, like having to do body scanning to all civilians who belong to the country of Kolechia . We also have a rule book all the time, so we can know what is allowed in the documents we inspect and if there are any discrepancys, you have to reject the entry to the person and later on, if you want, arrest them . A situation with a spy, terrorists and smugglers with not be uncommon, and you will decide if you will let them pass, because you can bribed and even threaten .\nAfter a day of work, you receive a wage, which depends on how well you did your job, and you will have to decide where your wage will go, some option include 'food', 'medicine' and 'heat', also as you progress in the story you will be able to choose to move to a better house, but it will also have bigger expenses . You also have freedom of will in basically everything since the game changes with your decisions .\nBe careful too, this game will play your emotion and will play mind games with you, sometimes you must choose between doing your job or doing the right thing sometimes, there will be families slip apart because of you, but if you decide to let someone passe the border without the correct documents so he or she can be with her/his family, you will face the consequences . Your gaming experience with this game could end in 20 different ways, each occur depending on what decisions did you take in a certain way because you actually have a lot of choices throughout the story, some of them may include, being part of a conspiration group named EZIC against the government of Arstotzka, accepting bribes and even saving money on medicine or food, which will let to the starvation of members of your family .\n\nThis game is worth all your attention, since its incredibly addicting, has a great plot and the gameplay its really original, you will not regret it .\n\n\n\nGlory To Arstotzka!\n\n\n~ 10/10","September 27, 2014","true","17.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

During the first hour or two of playtime it's easy to find yourself immersed in the dystopian fictional world and curious about what will happen next. However, after a while you realize that there is very little variety in terms of the scenarios that present themselves. Assuming you manage to stay on the good side of your superiors, this lack of variety leads to sessions that drag on and on and become extremely tedious.\n\nAfter reaching the end of any given playthrough there's little point in playing again. The only changes you'll encounter are when you get to choose a slightly different path by allowing somebody's wife through (or not), confiscating a diplomat's passport (or not), and so on. The differences in outcome are minor at best and certainly not worth 30-60 minutes of drudgery as you click through endless piles of documents.\n\nThe game's presentation is bare bones, but I think the audio and visual style works well and accomplishes what it sets out to do. The interface is decent, although the small space you have to work with means papers get lost under other ones and lots of annoyance as you go digging for whatever it is you're looking for. The system for finding discrepancies is fairly opaque at first, which will lead to frustration as you wonder how to properly execute your instructions. Even later on this can be an issue at times as the demands you're placed under become more and more complex.\n\nI think Papers, Please is an interesting experiment and worth at least playing around with for a few hours. I'd definitely wait for it to go on sale though. I just don't think most people will find enough enjoyment here to justify paying full price.","November 27, 2013","false","5.8"," 454 of 883 people (51%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","51","454","883","9","17"

You decide whether someone passes through the border and sometimes you need to make difficult decisions which goes against your orders.\n\nAn average day at your job can be like this: Woman steps up to the booth. Wearing lipstick, jewelry and a cute hat. She hands you the papers and it says she's a man. Are the papers correct? She claims so. You ask "her" to undress and you recieve a photo of a naked man wearing lipstick, jewelry and a cute hat.  So what do you do? Send "him" through or else you will be punished for doing a bad job!\n\nGood Stuff\nRanomized visitors\nSome visitors are hardcoded to be the same in the story, but the rest of them have ranomized portaits, names and traits. For some odd reason, checking someones passport which would be incredibly dull IRL becomes very interesting in this game. It's funny to hear their lame excuses and refuse morons to enter the country.\n\nFunny\nAs mentioned before, you will have some very interesting visitors at your booth. Did I mention the females with the male faces? There are plenty of those as well.\n\nUnlockable modes\nCan you manage clearing all visitors without missing a single error in their files? Good luck!\n\nEngaging characters\nWho doesn't love Jorji?  This game does tug on your heartstrings at times, I found it hard to refuse some requests which gave me a bad report at work.\n\nBad Stuff\nI have only one complaint about the game and it's the fact that the desk you work on is too small. You can barely fit all the papers on it and sometimes you need to stack them to be able to read one paper at all.  Especially when you're asked to look for criminals, I sometimes end up stacking papers over the faces so I forget to check them.","January 31, 2015","true","20.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You are an immigration officer, charged with determining who to let into the fictional Eastern European communist country of Arstotzka. Even the genre of the game is rather hard to pin down; ultimately, the game boils down to trying to find inconsistencies in the papers, making it a puzzle game of sorts, but it somehow lends checking people’s paperwork an air of great gravity and tension, even if the actual activity itself is rather boring.\n\nI don’t know if you can really say that Papers, Please is a fun game; there is a great feeling of tension throughout, and yet also of monotony. Somehow, you feel obligated to keep your faceless family members alive; somehow, you feel like the question of a bribe is a real one that has real weight; somehow, you feel like what you’re doing is important. And yet, ultimately, you’re just checking paperwork and determining whether or not to let people through based on the paperwork and your own feelings about the situation.\n\nIt is definitely an engaging experience, but I'm not sure if I can really say that I had fun playing it, apart from the interactions with Jorji and the tasks I did for EZIC.

Reminiscent of Orwell's 1984, Papers Please takes place in Arstotzka, a fictional country that resembles an Eastern European country during the Cold War. Here in Arstotzka, you are a border checkpoint officer, looking over the passports and documents of all citizens attempting to cross into glorious Arstotzka, making sure they have all proper paperwork, whilst also making sure you family doesnt starve to death or get sick.\n\nWhilst this seems like it would make for a boring game, Papers Please is probably one of the tensest games i've played. It riddles you with moral choices, decisions that affect your future (and that of your family), and the stress of taking care of 5/6 individuals, being paid based on your performance. You have to decide if you are going to let you're family go hungry so that you can help you co-workers, or maybe not have any heating, in exchange for letting in one too many people whose stories touched you. Maybe you'll find yourself aiding a terrorist organisation, or even a vengeful father. Or perhaps you will stay a hardworking, productive member of Arstotzka, with all which that entails.\n\nPapers Please is an excellent game, with unique gameplay, hard moral decisions, a large amount of replayability and a fantastic audiovisual aesthetic. It is truly unique, and definitely a game that everyone needs to play.\n\nGlory to Arstotzka!","September 22, 2014","true","11.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You'll be glad that everyone you meet are different.\nAlso, you can get some grumpy people who can ♥♥♥♥ you off or you can get people who are desperate to migrate because of war and they beg you to let them in even though they don't have a passport. Decision making is pretty heavy in this game.\nOverall, its interesting and fun game. I recommend it to those who have some time to kill and those who want pursue a border control career ;)","March 13, 2014","true","3.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

I bought it this time and I'm glad I did!\n\nI wasn't really expecting much of this game, but it ended up being splendid - simple yet wonderful. You have a choice no matter the situation and you have up to twenty endings you could end up with (reminds me of those stories when I was a child with the multiple endings, can't remember what they're called). Most of the endings seem to require different sacrifices you have to make along the way and give a realistic insight to the life of a border officer. It explores not only moral issues but corruption, blackmail, terrorism, bribery, etc. which is honestly a good portrayal of today's society. Following the rules to a T or being honest will not give you a good ending.\n\nAs each day moves forward, you are introduced to new daily tasks, many of which might be unfair to the person crossing the border. You get plenty of different people - some who are obviously crooks and some who just want to be free of their old country or visit a family member. There's a secret organization trying to infiltrate your country as well and whether you decide to help them or not, the consequences might never be the same.\n\nI don't know. It's entertaining and makes you ask questions. I think that makes this game a very good one, despite how repetitive it is. You're at least engaged with the central story and your life, your family's lives, and countless other families' lives depend on your decision, whereas other games like this might not make you have such conscious choices where so much relies on said choices, which really makes Papers, Please stand out.\n\nDefinitely recommended.

It's not necessarily fun; in fact, I think it's generally experienced as either mundanely boring or extremely stressful, but it's extraordinarily rewarding. You play as a border checkpoint inspector overseeing the entry of immigrants, returnees, and visitors into a fictionalized analogue of East Berlin under the Soviet Bloc, and the game follows your everyday life in your job over the course of one month. You have a family to feed and the political situation is worsening. On the first day, your job is easy: the checkpoint has just opened, so you only have to let citizens back into the country and keep everyone else out. The next day, the restrictions loosen and foreigners can be let in if they have the correct documentation. Soon terrorist attacks stop your days short and the security requirements tighten. From there, things get complicated.\n\nThere's basically two parts to this game: you have to figure out what you're "supposed to" do and what the correct protocol is, and then you have to decide whether or not you should do it. Rigidly following the system of often sexist, transphobic, racist, classist, or just generally heartless beaurocratic policy will leave you facing the human results of those actions, but be too kind and your family will starve or you might be sent to prison. There's 20 different endings reflecting the variety of ways in which your actions can influence the game world, a standard RPG feature these days, but perhaps uniquely all of the most powerful moments in the game come on the way to those endings and not in them. It's a hugely moving and interesting experience, and the utilitarian faux-Soviet aesthetic of the thing never breaks for a second. One of my favourite games of all time.\n\nGlory to Arstotzka.

It's clear that this is an indie game; most big publishers would be scared off by the game's punishing yet fundamentally repetitive gameplay. However, anyone who enjoys brainteasers and an excellent story will be impressed with Papers, Please.\n\nThe game, which takes place in an Arstotzkan border checkpoint at East Grestin, is based on sorting through papers. Does this person have all required papers? Are the papers valid? Does anything about the documents conflict with something else? These, and other new complexities, are difficult to understand at a glance, so game difficulty is no problem (though I haven't tried the Easy Mode yet). New twists, often caused by events at your own checkpoint (Kolechians are temporarily forbidden from entering Arstotzka following a Kolechian terrorist attack), are introduced, and often moral dilemmas arise, as bribes, anti-government rebel agents, and star-crossed lovers (Ooh-la-la) are frequent occurences on this border. Money troubles also appear, as you must maintain your family of four (fun things like "Your wife, uncle, and son died" are treated with little fanfare).\n\nThe depth of the story (which has 20 endings) is (quite) deep. The unique method of storytelling, where you see just a snapshot of the lives of travelers, is enough to recommend the game on. The gameplay is interesting, but loses much of its appeal early on. For one to look at this as an incredibly difficult and intense virtual novel would be a good summary, and if you enjoy those types of things, then this could be one of your favorite new indie titles. For gameplay first, story second players, the game is likely to bore you, as the story is the real selling point here.","December 20, 2013","true","8.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

By all reason, Papers Please shouldn't be as much of a good time as it is. You serve as an unnamed male citizen of the Arstozkan Empire, employed by lottery to rigorously scan and verify documents at the newest border crossing station in your dystopian, communist nation circa the 1980s. The names are all changed, but you essentially control Checkpoint Charlie at the Berlin Wall, and it's your job to make sure illegal immigration in your sector grinds to a halt. If you fail, your impoverished family will starve and freeze even worse than they already do.\n\nBut in spite of all its Cold War doom and gloom, Papers Please is a wonderfully intricate and engaging experience. The charm and humor of its characters, such as the permanently cheerful Jorgi Costava or the irascible Dimitri (Your supervisor, who stops by to inform you how bad you're doing each week) draws you in with each passport you process. Soon, you're reading your employee handbook to pass the time, determined to serve your country well and provide for your family. Or maybe you begin working undercover with the resistance, smuggling revolutionaries into the country with falsified papers. Or maybe you set up a smuggling business with a few regular border-crossers, and plan to flee the country yourself.\n\nWith 20 different endings to unlock and hundreds of stories to hear, Papers Please is unique kind of game; one that defies the genres of the medium and forces us to think differently about our entertainment. I highly recommend you pick it up. And remember! Always read the daily bulletin!\n\nGlory to Arstotzka!","December 29, 2013","true","16.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has 20 different endings, so there is replay value. Your first playthrough will really be entirely getting used to the system and to be as quick and efficient as possible, in order to maximize how much money you make everyday. Additionally, as a Passport Control Officer, you have to make decisions which will affect your character's, and your family's lives. Whether helping take down the government by letting terrorists through, letting people take vigiliante justice, denying people entry even though they may be executed if they return to their home country, or personally killing people to provide for your family. This is not "Passport Control Simulator." In this game, you really have to pay attention, and it is good for your brain, because you have to juggle multiple documents at the same time and remember dates and so forth off the top of your head on the fly. Not only that, it realy makes you question what you would do in these circumstances; help others at your family's expense, or only look out for yourself. Though it will get dull rather quickly, it is definitely worth the few bucks it costs.","June 20, 2014","true","5.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Now that I've finally played for some hours, I have to admit my first reaction to the game idea couldn't have been much farther from the mark. The background story is quite grim, having been influenced by the not so distant history, and this brings unforeseen depth to the game. However, humor is present as well, in the myriad funny details, cultural references, and indeed, the somewhat sparse unique characters. Even the cumbersome old smuggler who kept wasting my valuable inspector-time made me smile every time he trotted in front of the desk and started rambling cheerfully. The mechanic is quite ingenious in that it forces the player to make difficult choices: for instance, is it better to buy the essential supplies that are needed for the family to survive, or upgrades to the inspector's gear that, in the long run, enable the player to gain more money with which to secure their family's well-being? Choices that at first seem good investments in the future may turn out to be little more than shortcuts to an early grave, since a certain amount of randomness in the game's events ensures that each decision the player makes is laden with uncertainty. The carefully balanced mix of random and scripted events effectively create an addictive feeling that the player's actions have real consequences for the player's character and other characters as well. Well done.","June 21, 2014","true","7.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A cold war based theme set in 1982 where you decide on the entrance of people into your country, the "Glorious" Arstotzka.  The game difficulty starts slowly as you check the validity of people's documents at the border. This continues to build as more complex events occur adding more and more information to verify and new methods to test the stories of the masses.  At the end of the work day, you are paid by how many people you processed and penalized for mistakes made.  Your money is used to support your family, providing as good a living as you can for the necessities of life: Rent, food, heat, medicine.  It is a serious challege to process as many as you can while not letting criminals, terrorists, and other "undesirables" into your country.\n\nA word about the graphics:  they are intentionally low end to give the feel for what games were back in the 80's.  Nevertheless, what gamers often times fail to remember, it is the imagination that is the most important piece of play.  Many of you will recall how the BEST and most fun you had as a kid was when you had a tree branch sword, a pine cone grenade, or a fort made of boxes.  This frame of mind is nearly lost on the current generation as graphics have all but stunted their ability to dream and pretend.  This game deserves a look for the price, currently $5.  Those of you who remember the cold war era will laugh at the feel of the game, while those who do not may find that they actually have a great time with it as they strengthen "the muscle of their imagination" that has been dormant for perhaps their whole lives.

I love this game, even though it makes me feel very depressed/apprehensive about things. The reason why I like it so is beause of the masterful way the story is told. Games are a unique storytelling medium because of the level of interactivity. Really, no other media has that level of interaction (movies, books, comics, theater, music). What makes this game special is that through its mechanics and gameplay, the story unfolds. Line, hook and sinker the mechanics get you before you realize you're in too deep.\n\nOverall, if you play games for them to invoke some sort of emotion... This is it.

You'll be glad that everyone you meet are different.\nAlso, you can get some grumpy people who can ♥♥♥♥ you off or you can get people who are desperate to migrate because of war and they beg you to let them in even though they don't have a passport.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fenglengshun/recommended/239030/","fenglengshun","Feng Lengshun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fenglengshun/","192 products in account","Short Review\nNarrative: Focuses on role-playing\nGameplay: Time Rush "Match the Picture" Point-and-Click\nScore: 8/10\nRecommended: Yes\nRecommended buying point: Any discount of 50% or above\nRecommended for: People who don't care about a game's length and more focused on the intensity of an experience it can give\n\nDetailed Review\nThe Narrative\nStory:\nYou are the husband to a family of five, including you. You have been selected to work as an immigration officer in the border of the country. Basically, you are the paperwork inspector of the eastern side of the infamous Checkpoint Charlie[en.wikipedia.org].\n\nAnd that's it. You get a few snips of the immigrants' lives and story, and there is indeed a "larger" storyline that somewhat follows the historical Checkpoint Charlie, but the core focus of the story is you and your decisions. You have the greatest agency in the entire game: You get to decide the fate of all sorts of people and even that of the country itself! All through a bunch of bureacracy decisions. Of course, you need to remember that your decisions, ill-informed as it can be, also decides the fate of you and your family too. Rather than direct storytelling, the game puts a strong focus on storytelling through role-play.\n\nIf there is one weakness with the story, however, is that some of the puzzles can be hard that it will lead you into searching for guides to solve them (an adventure game trademark, really) which would really break immersion in the game and story. The moment you stop making on-the-spot from-the-heart decisions with the scant information available and think of getting a certain achievement or ending, at that moment the game really lose its grip on you.\n\nCharacter:\nThere isn't much of a characterization in here. As a character, the main character is 100% defined by your actions. You have a family, but they don't show up in the game - they barely even do anything other than being a bunch of mouth for you to keep warm, feed, and stay healthy - keep the alive as having all of them killed nets you a gameover. Some of the immigrants shows a certain characterization, but they are basically stranger which you only see for a few moments - as they are to you both in-character and meta-wise. The closest you have to legitimate characters are your co-workers.\n\nMost of the characters are just blank canvas for you to paint one - one person might think of one character as a jerk the other might think that he's not really a jerk. The focus in this game is in the role-play, there is little characterization so you fill in the blanks with what you think of them. Provided that you play this game completely honestly (which I recommend you doing until you reach Day 32/end-game once) then it can say a lot of interesting things about you. Apparently, I'm someone who can bend some rules and go against some moral and ethic codes so long as it isn't too big or if I need it.\n\nIt is a rather interesting experience, and what makes this game really strong.\n\nThe Gameplay\nMechanics:\nThe core mechanics of the game is basically similar to "Find what's different with the pictures" type of games. And easy comparison would be the Ace Attorney series of game, except this one is much more minimalistic in its storytelling, more focused in the 'courtroom' session, and less absurd or "anime-ish" but more grounded in reality.\n\nYou are presented with a bunch of documents, you need to find what's wrong with it, and match it with the rules or the other data that acts as a reference for how they are wrong. You then need to find if the discrepancies were simply outdated data or if the documents really are invalid. If it was all cleared and there's nothing wrong with the document, you approve their visa, and if it's not, you can either deny them or detain them (the latter gives a small bonus). At the end of the day, you can choose if you want to feed your family and keep them warm or not, as well as whether or not to give them medicine if they are sick. You can upgrade the booth for some shortcut commands and you can move to a more expensive appartment at certain days (which does nothing except for getting one achievement). Other than the rents and fines, the bills are opt-out while the upgrades are opt-in.\n\nThe game started rather difficult as there is a lack of tutorial - which admittedly does fit the image of the fictional country in that they demand nothing but the best from their workers. The game asks you to be constantly vigil and have a good memory about the rules. If you do not, then you might miss something that makes you get a warning from your superior or alternatively takes too long a time inspecting one immigrant meaning less immigrant processed and thus less money for you and your family. In a way, the core gameplay revolves around weighting your choices. Whether to rush the inspection out or to take your time, whether to be merciless or be nice, whether to accept bribes or not. The game focuses on these small moments and what it says about you. The gameplay mechanics are really just a vehicle for the role-playing part of the game, which is the main meat of the game.\n\nOverall, it's not really fun - and I'm sure it's not intended to be fun or at least not in the traditional way of fun - but it's good at what it's trying to do and it didn't overstay its welcome (you can finish this game in a single weekend, provided that you are good at it and know what you are doing). Although it is very annoying that many of the achievements are hidden and can be very hard to find unless you search a guide or the wiki (which as I said, can really break immersion in the game).\n\nOptimization:\nI was honestly surprised and floored by how light this game is. I would have thought that it would take a few hundreds megabyte, but then I saw that it only took about 50MB when I was downloading the game! And I have a rather old computer and to my surprise, it ran smoothly despite how I was opening a bunch of Chrome tabs and Notepad++ (with five open documents in it). My guess is that this is because of the very traditional art-style and how a lot of its contents are procedurally generated except for some few scripted encounters and dialogues in the game.\n\nThe Aesthetics\nGraphics:\nThe graphics is very traditional - it wouldn't be out-of-place in the NES console. In terms of fidelity, it's pretty high in fidelity in spite of its look, and it could clearly show everything that is needed. The art style was rather drab, but it fits the tone and theme of the game, as well as that of the setting. If there is one thing I have to criticize out of the graphic is that the in-game photo and the game's sprite can often looks rather different, leading to some confused moments. Not much to say other than that - it does its job and that's that.\n\nSound:\nThere isn't much to say about the sound department. It has about two or so music and about a dozen or so of SFX, and that they do the jobs they needed to do. The music sets the mood pretty nicely but is otherwise not notable, especially since during the main segment of the game they do not have any music at all (the music are only on the main menu and ending, I believe). The sound effects were okay - very minimalistic but nothing out of place.\n\n]Final Verdict:\n8/10 - Overall, this is a very good game not in the gameplay but because of how immersive and bleak in can be. Is it worth your money? Well, if you want a lot of milestone from your games, then I'd say Maybe with capital M, but if you are searching for unique and interesting experiences, however, then I would definitely recommend this game. If it has a discount of 50%, then I strongly recommend buying this game.","June 25, 2015","true","14.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You are an immigration inspector at the border town of Grestin. Your goal is simple; do your job correctly, get the money, and keep you and your family alive. But no, it is not this simple. You are the person that changes peoples lives entirely. To allow an individual into the country is completely your choice; a power that should not be given to a single person.\n\nFor a game with such a simple as well as unique concept, Papers, Please showed just how in-depth something so simple can go. From any person's perspective, it's a simple process: Accept. Deny. Accept. Deny. However, Something that simple is something that you cannot afford in Papers, Please. Passports, Entry Permits, Identity Supplements; all documents that each person must present to you; the inspector. Your duty is to correctly accept and deny immigrants into the country, (who may very well be terrorists, smugglers, and murderers,) in the country of Arstotzka.\n\nWhat makes Papers, Please the brilliant game that it is lies in every fiber of its design. From the art style to the dialogue., this game will present new ideals into your mind, making you wonder what the true right or wrong thing to is. Papers, Please will make you want to keep your job more than any real world job ever will, that is a given fact. Getting penalized by the Ministry of Admission for incorrectly allowing people into Arstotzka will fill every inch of your body with paranoia.

The depressive world and story mixed with that intense music, a game i've never played before. It's very difficult and challenging, it requires all your concentration to not miss a tiny detail on any of the given papers; this game is for open-minded people who like very challenging, brain straining games. I really enjoyed the flow of the game, and loved the story changing characters, which appear ever so often, as well as all the other little details put in it. While intensly working on checking data from the papers, you always have to be ready for a terrorist attack or some other event which may come unexpected. I also especially like the moral choices (which do not have influence on the story), for example, will you accept the wife to get to her husband even though she doesnt't have correct data? Will you accept bribes for people with not enough money to get the needed papers? Then there are bigger decisions that may change the complete story of the game, which I will not give an example for, because they might contain big spoilers.\n\nThis game is definitely worth checking out, if you don't want to buy it, you might as well check out some videos on the web.","September 21, 2014","true","6.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Your family will get sick and yes; they will die, when you do to much mistakes at your work. Mistakes means, that you haven't asked the immigrant why his passport says that he is female but he looks male or you haven't followed the order that immigrants from a certain country won't be past, because of threat of terrorism.

The game is challenging at first to learn of the different conditions and what each is (such as the passport nations). However later on it becomes more of a "spot the error" kind of game. If you get 2 wrong, you will not be penalized, but if you get 3 wrong, you will start to lose money. At the end of every day you can devote your money to different things such as heat and food. However, if you chose not to devote money to those for long enough, bad things will happen to your family which is dependent on the money.

I've already completed the game twice but gotten a different ending each time (there are 20!), and I will definitely play it more. It's just totally weird that I am having so much fun with this... You're literally processing documents. This idea sounds terrible on paper (ha). However, it's actually really, really engaging and fun to play. The game is exceptionally immersive and completely different from anything that I have ever played before. You get tied up in these little stories with the people that come to your window, and often you feel a tinge of guilt as you turn away someone from the checkpoint when they tell you how you've doomed them. The atmosphere is extremely oppressive; the devs did a GREAT job of sucking the player into the world. The game does a great job of piling more tasks you have to complete with each level, and the constantly-ticking clock pushes you to cut corners. This game just has something about it that draws me back over and over. Highly recommended if you desire something unusual.","December 4, 2013","true","9.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Papers, Please is the complete opposite of boring.\n\nTaking place in a fictional semi-corrupt semi-just-want-MIA-members-kept-in-place country named Arstotzka, you play as a border control agent, accepting or denying job-seekers, immigrants and criminals. While this game's first few hours/minutes (depending on how quick your fingers are and how long it takes to strain them dragging documents around your messy desk) are quite dull, the people I saw in just that little amount of gameplay made me rage, laugh and stare. This is a brilliant attribute as it jolts the brain and your emotions to a flying start. Time to time the game gets harder and more time-consuming, but still follows the same laugh-rage experience. It also displays attributes of a shooter - you will sometimes see a terrorist attack and have the power to stop one at your protagonist's twiddling fingers.\n\nIt also gives you opinions and puzzles (including the bomb some idiot thought would kill off an inspector and all the guards surrounding him), like managing your expenses and doing whatever it takes to not be arrested for giving a single document to the police. While this isn't too frequent it still makes you happy there's a change in the game and you have some freedom.\n\nGraphics-wise the game is pixellated, but looks lovely at the same time. This style fits the time the game was set, as I just thought, considering it is set in the 80s, a time when 8-bits were first introduced. It also displays musical talent, and the theme makes me want to go on a march in synchronization with it.\n\nSo, overall, I'd say Papers, Please, from such a simple idea, turns out to be one of my favourite games of all time, and I congratulate Dukope for making such a brilliant game.\n10/10. Glory to Arstotzka.","May 26, 2014","true","12.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

I followed it through development and into Steam, where it got bigger and better.\n\nThe constant being on-edge, management, strategy and difficulties you face are balanced by a wonderful simplistic art style and great soundtrack. The interface is perhaps a little counter-intuitive at points for me, but that's really my only problem with it. Given the number of endings, its replay value is immense. Even today after [insert large number here] hours of gameplay, I'm finding new things to do, new things I like doing in the game.\n\nThe best part is the waiting, which makes no sense without context. After you approve an applicant, there's the little tense wait to see if you got a citation. You begin to hate the little *clickity click* sound of the citation appearing, and makes you get angry at the system. You want revenge, and EZIC are there to help. Personally, I've always gone against EZIC, but the game adapts to your playstyle, once you adapt to it.\n\nThe best kind of game is one that impacts upon the player and vice versa.

Glory To Arstotzka's Boring Yet Compelling JobGenre: Point & Click Puzzle Simulation\nDeveloped & Published by: 3909\nPlatform: Windows, Mac and Linux.\nBusiness Model: Base Game.\nCopy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay Thoughts\nYou are a border guard of Arstotzka, a fictional government that has forced you into your current job. Your job, I might add, is to get as many people processed through the border as quickly as you can. The more people you process correctly, the more money you earn for the day. However, the job is made difficult with forged documentation, lists of rules you must make sure everyone has adhered to and an ever-increasing pile of paperwork to sift through. As you make mistakes, it costs money and could potentially get yourself jailed if you’re that terrible at your job. Your family has demands as well and the cost of living will go up, demanding that you work harder at processing more people through the gate every passing day.\n\nPapers, Please isn’t a pleasant stroll through the park. The work you’re doing is tedious and dull. Every new face a source of income and potential frustration. Inspections taking progressively longer as you become more paranoid of your fallibility. Let one guy through and he’s fine. Let the next woman through, whose paperwork seems legitimate, only to get instantly penalized as her documentation was expired. Then I begin checking documentation to make sure it isn’t expired only to get penalized for letting a criminal through. Curses! Then you deny the next person because something seems missing with his documentatio--oops, nope, he was completely fine. I just denied a man from seeing his wife. Now I have to be extra-careful with the next guy, which takes me over an hour of in-game time just to realize that his paperwork completely checks out. Damnit it all! I need to move faster. The Next person has concealed explosives but I forget to check his weight so he gets through and blows up the guards. The day is abruptly over. My income cut short, my family starves. I curse my inadequacy.\n\nPapers Please is a constant balance of fact-checking, observation and being as quick as possible with some of the most intentionally-clunky tools a border guard could possess. Each tool taking their own portion of precious time to make sure the documentation is or isn’t correct. Even if you know that person’s paperwork is wrong, you have to verify it with the in-game data checker, interrogate the person to be sure you’re correct and then and only then, can you call for the guards. All the while, the clock ticks on insidiously. Waiting to instantly call you out on that inevitable mistake you’ll make.\n\nGame Modes\nThere are two main game modes, story and endless. Story is a 31 day campaign with branching story paths based on the decisions you make. Whether it’s support for the rising rebellion against Arstotzka, support of the old government, getting caught doing illegal activities or adverse conditions affecting your family, ultimately remains up to you. The story is excellently paced and down to earth with each decision you make being personable. While some decisions may seem black and white at first, you may find out later that events didn’t play out as you expected. The story more or less gives reason for why you’re there and how your decisions affect what ultimately ends up happening. To you, the government or other factions at work. While many that try to cross the border are procedural generated, in the story mode there are some that aren’t. These crafted characters can be depressing, heart wrenching or sometimes amusing. This isn’t a simulation of a border guard’s job but it’s the closest game to being one while remaining entertaining for many.\n\nEndless gives you three ways to play with four levels of difficulty. There’s a timed mode where you process as many travelers in 10 minutes as possible. Perfection which has you going as long as you can until you make a mistake. Finally, there’s Endurance which has you playing until the score balances out from your mistakes. These simply give you a way to enjoy the game after the story and are a nice, simple addition.\n\nPC Settings\nUnsurprisingly basic settings, but usable for a 2D game. You have fullscreen, windowed mode and software rendering in case your hardware isn’t good enough. There’s a nudity on/off switch as well as an “Easy Mode” which gives you 20 credits every day. Separate volume sliders exist as well. However, there’s only one very catchy song that’s played in the main menu. The graphic style is, what I would consider, an oppressive & depressing pixelart. It looks great despite it not being a very colorful title.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nPapers Please is one of my favorite games of 2013. It keeps the dry experience of a border guard but still has depressing stories to tell. The pixelart and dreary atmosphere combine with the constant & insidious pressure to make for a very compelling experience. It’s a game that I shouldn’t find enjoyable but yet I do. Its an odd game that says something not only through words but through the game’s mechanics as well.\n\nRead the Review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]","November 28, 2013","true","15.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Papers, Please is the complete opposite of boring.\n\nTaking place in a fictional semi-corrupt semi-just-want-MIA-members-kept-in-place country named Arstotzka, you play as a border control agent, accepting or denying job-seekers, immigrants and criminals. While this game's first few hours/minutes (depending on how quick your fingers are and how long it takes to strain them dragging documents around your messy desk) are quite dull, the people I saw in just that little amount of gameplay made me rage, laugh and stare. This is a brilliant attribute as it jolts the brain and your emotions to a flying start. Time to time the game gets harder and more time-consuming, but still follows the same laugh-rage experience. It also displays attributes of a shooter - you will sometimes see a terrorist attack and have the power to stop one at your protagonist's twiddling fingers.\n\nIt also gives you opinions and puzzles (including the bomb some idiot thought would kill off an inspector and all the guards surrounding him), like managing your expenses and doing whatever it takes to not be arrested for giving a single document to the police. While this isn't too frequent it still makes you happy there's a change in the game and you have some freedom.\n\nGraphics-wise the game is pixellated, but looks lovely at the same time. This style fits the time the game was set, as I just thought, considering it is set in the 80s, a time when 8-bits were first introduced. It also displays musical talent, and the theme makes me want to go on a march in synchronization with it.\n\nSo, overall, I'd say Papers, Please, from such a simple idea, turns out to be one of my favourite games of all time, and I congratulate Dukope for making such a brilliant game.\n10/10.

I've already completed the game twice but gotten a different ending each time (there are 20!), and I will definitely play it more. It's just totally weird that I am having so much fun with this... You're literally processing documents. This idea sounds terrible on paper (ha). However, it's actually really, really engaging and fun to play. The game is exceptionally immersive and completely different from anything that I have ever played before. You get tied up in these little stories with the people that come to your window, and often you feel a tinge of guilt as you turn away someone from the checkpoint when they tell you how you've doomed them. The atmosphere is extremely oppressive; the devs did a GREAT job of sucking the player into the world. The game does a great job of piling more tasks you have to complete with each level, and the constantly-ticking clock pushes you to cut corners. This game just has something about it that draws me back over and over.

At the end of each round you will get your daily salary - if your daily salary is too low and your reserves are too low, then you have to option whether your family will get no food and/or no heating. Your salary will get lowered, when you do mistakes during your inspection and you let somebody past who is not authorized to cross the border. Your family will get sick and yes; they will die, when you do to much mistakes at your work. Mistakes means, that you haven't asked the immigrant why his passport says that he is female but he looks male or you haven't followed the order that immigrants from a certain country won't be past, because of threat of terrorism. After certain days and enough money you can upgrade your booth to work more efficient. Over the time there will be scripted events where you have to make moral decisions. These decisions will influence the story.

Glory To Arstotzka's Boring Yet Compelling JobGenre: Point & Click Puzzle Simulation\nDeveloped & Published by: 3909\nPlatform: Windows, Mac and Linux.\nBusiness Model: Base Game.\nCopy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay Thoughts\nYou are a border guard of Arstotzka, a fictional government that has forced you into your current job. Your job, I might add, is to get as many people processed through the border as quickly as you can. The more people you process correctly, the more money you earn for the day. However, the job is made difficult with forged documentation, lists of rules you must make sure everyone has adhered to and an ever-increasing pile of paperwork to sift through. As you make mistakes, it costs money and could potentially get yourself jailed if you’re that terrible at your job. Your family has demands as well and the cost of living will go up, demanding that you work harder at processing more people through the gate every passing day.\n\nPapers, Please isn’t a pleasant stroll through the park. The work you’re doing is tedious and dull. Every new face a source of income and potential frustration. Inspections taking progressively longer as you become more paranoid of your fallibility. Let one guy through and he’s fine. Let the next woman through, whose paperwork seems legitimate, only to get instantly penalized as her documentation was expired. Then I begin checking documentation to make sure it isn’t expired only to get penalized for letting a criminal through. Curses! Then you deny the next person because something seems missing with his documentatio--oops, nope, he was completely fine. I just denied a man from seeing his wife. Now I have to be extra-careful with the next guy, which takes me over an hour of in-game time just to realize that his paperwork completely checks out. Damnit it all! I need to move faster. The Next person has concealed explosives but I forget to check his weight so he gets through and blows up the guards. The day is abruptly over. My income cut short, my family starves. I curse my inadequacy.\n\nPapers Please is a constant balance of fact-checking, observation and being as quick as possible with some of the most intentionally-clunky tools a border guard could possess. Each tool taking their own portion of precious time to make sure the documentation is or isn’t correct. Even if you know that person’s paperwork is wrong, you have to verify it with the in-game data checker, interrogate the person to be sure you’re correct and then and only then, can you call for the guards. All the while, the clock ticks on insidiously. Waiting to instantly call you out on that inevitable mistake you’ll make.\n\nGame Modes\nThere are two main game modes, story and endless. Story is a 31 day campaign with branching story paths based on the decisions you make. Whether it’s support for the rising rebellion against Arstotzka, support of the old government, getting caught doing illegal activities or adverse conditions affecting your family, ultimately remains up to you. The story is excellently paced and down to earth with each decision you make being personable. While some decisions may seem black and white at first, you may find out later that events didn’t play out as you expected. The story more or less gives reason for why you’re there and how your decisions affect what ultimately ends up happening. To you, the government or other factions at work. While many that try to cross the border are procedural generated, in the story mode there are some that aren’t. These crafted characters can be depressing, heart wrenching or sometimes amusing. This isn’t a simulation of a border guard’s job but it’s the closest game to being one while remaining entertaining for many.\n\nEndless gives you three ways to play with four levels of difficulty. There’s a timed mode where you process as many travelers in 10 minutes as possible. Perfection which has you going as long as you can until you make a mistake. Finally, there’s Endurance which has you playing until the score balances out from your mistakes. These simply give you a way to enjoy the game after the story and are a nice, simple addition.\n\nPC Settings\nUnsurprisingly basic settings, but usable for a 2D game. You have fullscreen, windowed mode and software rendering in case your hardware isn’t good enough. There’s a nudity on/off switch as well as an “Easy Mode” which gives you 20 credits every day. Separate volume sliders exist as well. However, there’s only one very catchy song that’s played in the main menu. The graphic style is, what I would consider, an oppressive & depressing pixelart. It looks great despite it not being a very colorful title.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nPapers Please is one of my favorite games of 2013. It keeps the dry experience of a border guard but still has depressing stories to tell. The pixelart and dreary atmosphere combine with the constant & insidious pressure to make for a very compelling experience. It’s a game that I shouldn’t find enjoyable but yet I do.

The idea is original, the graphics fit the claustrophobic and choking atmosphere, the music enhances the idea of a smothering government regime in which the player finds himself as both citizen and employee, and the stories told through the window of your booth are engaging and develop themselves with intrigue and secrecy. It's hard to find where this game could be improved. It's something that works so well as a game, and as an educational experience that it could almost be used in a teaching environment. The idea that a citizen of this government would be placed into the position they are, allowing or denying various people access to their country, seeing the amount of paperwork involved, watching the rules and regulations pile up and change over the course of time leading to frustration, being faced with the moral dilemmas asked of them, and deciding how to handle their allegiance to country versus their conscious and compassion for other human beings is something that truly isn't captured as well as it is here with Papers, Please.\n\nI will say that the game is so well done, that it actually feels like work after awhile, which cuts into the fun factor, though it enchances the simulation aspect. It's almost hard to qualify it into a genre. The mechanics are crisp and clean, they build on themselves day after day, slowly increasing the difficulty by usually adding one or two additional rules, and eventually the player will find that they are totally immersed in the experience. It does feel like work after awhile though, so some players may actually be glad to 'punch out' after an hour or two of game play.\n\nThis is a game that has  left me thinking about it long after I exit the program. It's something that reaches a state where it's actually more than a game, it's a slice of actual human life.\n\nThis falls into the same category as This War of Mine in that it's an important game, and one that people should play with more in mind that just entertainment.

Glory To Arstotzka's Boring Yet Compelling JobGenre: Point & Click Puzzle Simulation\nDeveloped & Published by: 3909\nPlatform: Windows, Mac and Linux.\nBusiness Model: Base Game.\nCopy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay Thoughts\nYou are a border guard of Arstotzka, a fictional government that has forced you into your current job. Your job, I might add, is to get as many people processed through the border as quickly as you can. The more people you process correctly, the more money you earn for the day. However, the job is made difficult with forged documentation, lists of rules you must make sure everyone has adhered to and an ever-increasing pile of paperwork to sift through. As you make mistakes, it costs money and could potentially get yourself jailed if you’re that terrible at your job. Your family has demands as well and the cost of living will go up, demanding that you work harder at processing more people through the gate every passing day.\n\nPapers, Please isn’t a pleasant stroll through the park. The work you’re doing is tedious and dull. Every new face a source of income and potential frustration. Inspections taking progressively longer as you become more paranoid of your fallibility. Let one guy through and he’s fine. Let the next woman through, whose paperwork seems legitimate, only to get instantly penalized as her documentation was expired. Then I begin checking documentation to make sure it isn’t expired only to get penalized for letting a criminal through. Curses! Then you deny the next person because something seems missing with his documentatio--oops, nope, he was completely fine. I just denied a man from seeing his wife. Now I have to be extra-careful with the next guy, which takes me over an hour of in-game time just to realize that his paperwork completely checks out. Damnit it all! I need to move faster. The Next person has concealed explosives but I forget to check his weight so he gets through and blows up the guards. The day is abruptly over. My income cut short, my family starves. I curse my inadequacy.\n\nPapers Please is a constant balance of fact-checking, observation and being as quick as possible with some of the most intentionally-clunky tools a border guard could possess. Each tool taking their own portion of precious time to make sure the documentation is or isn’t correct. Even if you know that person’s paperwork is wrong, you have to verify it with the in-game data checker, interrogate the person to be sure you’re correct and then and only then, can you call for the guards. All the while, the clock ticks on insidiously. Waiting to instantly call you out on that inevitable mistake you’ll make.\n\nGame Modes\nThere are two main game modes, story and endless. Story is a 31 day campaign with branching story paths based on the decisions you make. Whether it’s support for the rising rebellion against Arstotzka, support of the old government, getting caught doing illegal activities or adverse conditions affecting your family, ultimately remains up to you. The story is excellently paced and down to earth with each decision you make being personable. While some decisions may seem black and white at first, you may find out later that events didn’t play out as you expected. The story more or less gives reason for why you’re there and how your decisions affect what ultimately ends up happening. To you, the government or other factions at work. While many that try to cross the border are procedural generated, in the story mode there are some that aren’t. These crafted characters can be depressing, heart wrenching or sometimes amusing. This isn’t a simulation of a border guard’s job but it’s the closest game to being one while remaining entertaining for many.\n\nEndless gives you three ways to play with four levels of difficulty. There’s a timed mode where you process as many travelers in 10 minutes as possible. Perfection which has you going as long as you can until you make a mistake. Finally, there’s Endurance which has you playing until the score balances out from your mistakes. These simply give you a way to enjoy the game after the story and are a nice, simple addition.\n\nPC Settings\nUnsurprisingly basic settings, but usable for a 2D game. You have fullscreen, windowed mode and software rendering in case your hardware isn’t good enough. There’s a nudity on/off switch as well as an “Easy Mode” which gives you 20 credits every day. Separate volume sliders exist as well. However, there’s only one very catchy song that’s played in the main menu. The graphic style is, what I would consider, an oppressive & depressing pixelart. It looks great despite it not being a very colorful title.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nPapers Please is one of my favorite games of 2013. It keeps the dry experience of a border guard but still has depressing stories to tell. The pixelart and dreary atmosphere combine with the constant & insidious pressure to make for a very compelling experience. It’s a game that I shouldn’t find enjoyable but yet I do. Its an odd game that says something not only through words but through the game’s mechanics as well.\n\nRead the Review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]","November 28, 2013","true","15.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You basically play as a immigration inspector who manages who get into the country of Azoska (as well as look after your family). Certain events are detailed via text boxes or in the newspaper. There a over ten endings in the game, which occur based on player action.\n\nGameplay is exceptional. You need to check the credentials of people who are entering the country and only let in people who meet the laws. This includes checking height, photo, passports, work visa etc. to find any discrepencies. If there are no problems you let them through, else you have to deny access into the country.  At each level, you only have a limited amount of time to work and earn money. Therefore you have to arrange where each piece of document you are given goes (either on the desk or counter) so you can efficiently check and hand those papers back as quickly as possible in order get the next visitor and hence more money. Each person you let in earns you ten dollars, while at the same time any mistakes you make (after the first one) will deduct money from you. Money is used at the end of the level to pay for your family's needs e.g. food and rent. Failure to earn enough money will mean that your family members start dieing off. Your moraility will also be tested in the game with various decisions such as whether to accept bribes, detain people to get more money, whether to let a grieving mother through etc. Basically you have to manage your job, family and morales during the game.\n\nThere is minimal audio in the game. Alarms and paper sound as they should. People speak via text boxes and some of their dialogue are quite humorous.\n\nGraphics aren't that detaile, but they do a good job at setting a surpressive atmosphere.\n\nIf you want to have unique, somewhat-funny point and click game, this game won't dissapoint.\n\n","March 2, 2015","true","5.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You have been selected to work as an immigration officer in the border of the country. Basically, you are the paperwork inspector of the eastern side of the infamous Checkpoint Charlie[en.wikipedia.org].\n\nAnd that's it. You get a few snips of the immigrants' lives and story, and there is indeed a "larger" storyline that somewhat follows the historical Checkpoint Charlie, but the core focus of the story is you and your decisions. You have the greatest agency in the entire game: You get to decide the fate of all sorts of people and even that of the country itself! All through a bunch of bureacracy decisions. Of course, you need to remember that your decisions, ill-informed as it can be, also decides the fate of you and your family too. Rather than direct storytelling, the game puts a strong focus on storytelling through role-play.\n\nIf there is one weakness with the story, however, is that some of the puzzles can be hard that it will lead you into searching for guides to solve them (an adventure game trademark, really) which would really break immersion in the game and story. The moment you stop making on-the-spot from-the-heart decisions with the scant information available and think of getting a certain achievement or ending, at that moment the game really lose its grip on you.\n\nCharacter:\nThere isn't much of a characterization in here. As a character, the main character is 100% defined by your actions. You have a family, but they don't show up in the game - they barely even do anything other than being a bunch of mouth for you to keep warm, feed, and stay healthy - keep the alive as having all of them killed nets you a gameover. Some of the immigrants shows a certain characterization, but they are basically stranger which you only see for a few moments - as they are to you both in-character and meta-wise. The closest you have to legitimate characters are your co-workers.\n\nMost of the characters are just blank canvas for you to paint one - one person might think of one character as a jerk the other might think that he's not really a jerk. The focus in this game is in the role-play, there is little characterization so you fill in the blanks with what you think of them. Provided that you play this game completely honestly (which I recommend you doing until you reach Day 32/end-game once) then it can say a lot of interesting things about you. Apparently, I'm someone who can bend some rules and go against some moral and ethic codes so long as it isn't too big or if I need it.\n\nIt is a rather interesting experience, and what makes this game really strong.\n\nThe Gameplay\nMechanics:\nThe core mechanics of the game is basically similar to "Find what's different with the pictures" type of games. And easy comparison would be the Ace Attorney series of game, except this one is much more minimalistic in its storytelling, more focused in the 'courtroom' session, and less absurd or "anime-ish" but more grounded in reality.\n\nYou are presented with a bunch of documents, you need to find what's wrong with it, and match it with the rules or the other data that acts as a reference for how they are wrong. You then need to find if the discrepancies were simply outdated data or if the documents really are invalid. If it was all cleared and there's nothing wrong with the document, you approve their visa, and if it's not, you can either deny them or detain them (the latter gives a small bonus). At the end of the day, you can choose if you want to feed your family and keep them warm or not, as well as whether or not to give them medicine if they are sick. You can upgrade the booth for some shortcut commands and you can move to a more expensive appartment at certain days (which does nothing except for getting one achievement). Other than the rents and fines, the bills are opt-out while the upgrades are opt-in.\n\nThe game started rather difficult as there is a lack of tutorial - which admittedly does fit the image of the fictional country in that they demand nothing but the best from their workers. The game asks you to be constantly vigil and have a good memory about the rules. If you do not, then you might miss something that makes you get a warning from your superior or alternatively takes too long a time inspecting one immigrant meaning less immigrant processed and thus less money for you and your family. In a way, the core gameplay revolves around weighting your choices. Whether to rush the inspection out or to take your time, whether to be merciless or be nice, whether to accept bribes or not. The game focuses on these small moments and what it says about you. The gameplay mechanics are really just a vehicle for the role-playing part of the game, which is the main meat of the game.\n\nOverall, it's not really fun - and I'm sure it's not intended to be fun or at least not in the traditional way of fun - but it's good at what it's trying to do and it didn't overstay its welcome (you can finish this game in a single weekend, provided that you are good at it and know what you are doing). Although it is very annoying that many of the achievements are hidden and can be very hard to find unless you search a guide or the wiki (which as I said, can really break immersion in the game).\n\nOptimization:\nI was honestly surprised and floored by how light this game is. I would have thought that it would take a few hundreds megabyte, but then I saw that it only took about 50MB when I was downloading the game! And I have a rather old computer and to my surprise, it ran smoothly despite how I was opening a bunch of Chrome tabs and Notepad++ (with five open documents in it). My guess is that this is because of the very traditional art-style and how a lot of its contents are procedurally generated except for some few scripted encounters and dialogues in the game.\n\nThe Aesthetics\nGraphics:\nThe graphics is very traditional - it wouldn't be out-of-place in the NES console. In terms of fidelity, it's pretty high in fidelity in spite of its look, and it could clearly show everything that is needed. The art style was rather drab, but it fits the tone and theme of the game, as well as that of the setting. If there is one thing I have to criticize out of the graphic is that the in-game photo and the game's sprite can often looks rather different, leading to some confused moments. Not much to say other than that - it does its job and that's that.\n\nSound:\nThere isn't much to say about the sound department. It has about two or so music and about a dozen or so of SFX, and that they do the jobs they needed to do. The music sets the mood pretty nicely but is otherwise not notable, especially since during the main segment of the game they do not have any music at all (the music are only on the main menu and ending, I believe). The sound effects were okay - very minimalistic but nothing out of place.\n\n]Final Verdict:\n8/10 - Overall, this is a very good game not in the gameplay but because of how immersive and bleak in can be. Is it worth your money? Well, if you want a lot of milestone from your games, then I'd say Maybe with capital M, but if you are searching for unique and interesting experiences, however, then I would definitely recommend this game. If it has a discount of 50%, then I strongly recommend buying this game.","June 25, 2015","true","14.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The goal of the game is to let the qualified people pass and reject the inqualified people. Every day there is a new set of rules or addition to the rules making each day still challenging and fun. The game is challenging at first to learn of the different conditions and what each is (such as the passport nations). However later on it becomes more of a "spot the error" kind of game. If you get 2 wrong, you will not be penalized, but if you get 3 wrong, you will start to lose money. At the end of every day you can devote your money to different things such as heat and food. However, if you chose not to devote money to those for long enough, bad things will happen to your family which is dependent on the money. If you go into the negatives after a day, you get arrested and it is game over.\n\nOverall pretty fun game and has a fitting soundtrack that plays when the game gets to certain points.\n\nRating: 8.6/10","February 4","true","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Admittedly, it’s a pretty tough sell. On paper, the game sounds like it’d be awful. Even when I purchased the game, I wasn’t really sold on it, but I took a chance on it based on the ravings from my friends, and the low sale price of $2.50. After playing the game, I’m glad I did. It’s worth getting at full price even, but this is Steam, we all wait for the sales, don’t we?\n\nSo why’s it a tough sell? Well, you play as an inspector at a border checkpoint. People give you their papers needed to enter, and you look over them and either let them enter your country,  deny them entry if their papers are not all in order, or even detain them if need be. Sound like fun? To me it didn’t, but maybe you can see the appeal there.\n\nSo why is it worth playing? Odd as it may be, that very task I talked about in the last paragraph actually is a lot of fun. But there’s further reason that is even more compelling. You work for the glorious country or Arstotzka, at the checkpoint the border town of Grestin. The half of Grestin belongs to the neighboring country of Kolechia, which Arstotzka has just ended a 6 year war with. Your border checkpoint has just opened because of this, and people are once again allowed to enter Arstotzka for the first time in 6 years. This setting, and the people it brings through your checkpoint, and the events it leads to, are the game’s biggest strengths. You’ll encounter natives trying to re-enter the country, foreigners who can finally come to Arstotzka to work or visit, or even just pass through. There will also be terrorists, who aim to harm your glorious country, and it is your duty to deny and even detain them.\n\nThe game’s story and dialogue are both well written. Your actions during the day (the gameplay portion, which we’ll get to in a moment) affect the story between days, and down the road. Both the one time characters passing through, and those who are recurring are interesting, and some even quite memorable. (I think everyone who’s played this game loves Jorji). The dialogue is quite good, and has plenty of memorable lines.\n\nSo what of the gameplay? It’s done in a single screen, divided into 3 portions. Roughly the top third of the screen is a top down view of the border checkpoint, the line, and the guards. This part isn’t used too often for gameplay. The bottom two thirds of the screen are divided as well, the left third presents a first person point of view from your place inside your border checkpoint. This is where applicants seeking entry to Arstotzka come in and give you your papers. The rest of the bottom portion of your screen is where you can look at said papers up close.\n\nNow this is the part of the game that I think is the hardest part to sell someone on, but I’m going to try anyway. When the game starts, applicants give you a passport, and so long as they are a resident of Arstotzka with a valid passport, they may enter the country. You simply stamp all passports with either “approved” or “denied.”\nAt the end of the day you will be paid 5 credits for every person you correctly processed. The first two incorrectly processed applicants will earn you a citation with a warning and no payment, each error after that will also incur a penalty docking some of your pay. Citations are reset at the beginning of each day.\n\nDuring this end of day phase you will also need to balance your finances, and decide if you have money to pay for heat in your apartment, or to purchase food for your family. If you’re not able to take care of them properly they can die. If they’re all dead, or if you run out of money entirely you’ll get a gamer over (there are other ways to get a game over, in total the game has 20 different endings). So it’s important to do your job well.\n\nOn day 2 things become more complicated, and foreigners may enter as well so long as their passport is valid. On each passport you have various things to check for, a valid issuing city, that their photo matches their physical appearance, and that it hasn’t yet expired.\n\nAs the days go on more documents and rules will be introduced. I won’t go over all of them, but you will also have documents for entry permits, work permits, and you’ll need to crosscheck the name and passport number -as well as other information- on these documents with what’s printed on their passport. Sometimes you’ll also need to fingerprint an applicant, or search them for weapons or contraband (can’t let the drug smugglers and terrorists in). You’ll need to go over the documents carefully, pointing out discrepancies, and even giving a proper reason for denial. On occasion you’ll need to detain some of the applicants instead of simply denying them entry.\n\nThat about covers the basics of the game, so let’s move on to the graphics. They’re done in a simple pixel style, they’re not anything fancy, but they are pleasant to look at, and they help set the dreary mood of the game.\n\nAnd it is quite dreary working this sort of job in an oppressive country, barely making enough to care for your family and survive. The music is good, and helps compliments this mood, and so do the sound effects.\n\nMy main criticism of the game is levelled at trying to point out discrepancies. Now, it’s not that I have issue doing this, I enjoy it. No no, my issue is that while you know which rule is broken, it’s not always clear how to properly point this out. Once you do figure it out, it’s a non-issue the next time you must deny someone entry for the same reason, and it’s not an issue most of the time, but it happens occasionally, and there’s not really a good reason for it.\nIn the end though, Papers Please is a fantastic game. If you’ve not played it yet, hopefully I’ve been able to convince you to give it a go, if you’re on the fence though, I urge you to gamble on it anyway, wait for a sale even if you wish. Just make sure that you do play this game.\n\nGlory to Arstotzka!","February 2, 2015","true","11.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Admittedly, it’s a pretty tough sell. On paper, the game sounds like it’d be awful. Even when I purchased the game, I wasn’t really sold on it, but I took a chance on it based on the ravings from my friends, and the low sale price of $2.50. After playing the game, I’m glad I did. It’s worth getting at full price even, but this is Steam, we all wait for the sales, don’t we?\n\nSo why’s it a tough sell? Well, you play as an inspector at a border checkpoint. People give you their papers needed to enter, and you look over them and either let them enter your country,  deny them entry if their papers are not all in order, or even detain them if need be. Sound like fun? To me it didn’t, but maybe you can see the appeal there.\n\nSo why is it worth playing? Odd as it may be, that very task I talked about in the last paragraph actually is a lot of fun. But there’s further reason that is even more compelling. You work for the glorious country or Arstotzka, at the checkpoint the border town of Grestin. The half of Grestin belongs to the neighboring country of Kolechia, which Arstotzka has just ended a 6 year war with. Your border checkpoint has just opened because of this, and people are once again allowed to enter Arstotzka for the first time in 6 years. This setting, and the people it brings through your checkpoint, and the events it leads to, are the game’s biggest strengths. You’ll encounter natives trying to re-enter the country, foreigners who can finally come to Arstotzka to work or visit, or even just pass through. There will also be terrorists, who aim to harm your glorious country, and it is your duty to deny and even detain them.\n\nThe game’s story and dialogue are both well written. Your actions during the day (the gameplay portion, which we’ll get to in a moment) affect the story between days, and down the road. Both the one time characters passing through, and those who are recurring are interesting, and some even quite memorable. (I think everyone who’s played this game loves Jorji). The dialogue is quite good, and has plenty of memorable lines.\n\nSo what of the gameplay? It’s done in a single screen, divided into 3 portions. Roughly the top third of the screen is a top down view of the border checkpoint, the line, and the guards. This part isn’t used too often for gameplay. The bottom two thirds of the screen are divided as well, the left third presents a first person point of view from your place inside your border checkpoint. This is where applicants seeking entry to Arstotzka come in and give you your papers. The rest of the bottom portion of your screen is where you can look at said papers up close.\n\nNow this is the part of the game that I think is the hardest part to sell someone on, but I’m going to try anyway. When the game starts, applicants give you a passport, and so long as they are a resident of Arstotzka with a valid passport, they may enter the country. You simply stamp all passports with either “approved” or “denied.”\nAt the end of the day you will be paid 5 credits for every person you correctly processed. The first two incorrectly processed applicants will earn you a citation with a warning and no payment, each error after that will also incur a penalty docking some of your pay. Citations are reset at the beginning of each day.\n\nDuring this end of day phase you will also need to balance your finances, and decide if you have money to pay for heat in your apartment, or to purchase food for your family. If you’re not able to take care of them properly they can die. If they’re all dead, or if you run out of money entirely you’ll get a gamer over (there are other ways to get a game over, in total the game has 20 different endings). So it’s important to do your job well.\n\nOn day 2 things become more complicated, and foreigners may enter as well so long as their passport is valid. On each passport you have various things to check for, a valid issuing city, that their photo matches their physical appearance, and that it hasn’t yet expired.\n\nAs the days go on more documents and rules will be introduced. I won’t go over all of them, but you will also have documents for entry permits, work permits, and you’ll need to crosscheck the name and passport number -as well as other information- on these documents with what’s printed on their passport. Sometimes you’ll also need to fingerprint an applicant, or search them for weapons or contraband (can’t let the drug smugglers and terrorists in). You’ll need to go over the documents carefully, pointing out discrepancies, and even giving a proper reason for denial. On occasion you’ll need to detain some of the applicants instead of simply denying them entry.\n\nThat about covers the basics of the game, so let’s move on to the graphics. They’re done in a simple pixel style, they’re not anything fancy, but they are pleasant to look at, and they help set the dreary mood of the game.\n\nAnd it is quite dreary working this sort of job in an oppressive country, barely making enough to care for your family and survive. The music is good, and helps compliments this mood, and so do the sound effects.\n\nMy main criticism of the game is levelled at trying to point out discrepancies. Now, it’s not that I have issue doing this, I enjoy it. No no, my issue is that while you know which rule is broken, it’s not always clear how to properly point this out. Once you do figure it out, it’s a non-issue the next time you must deny someone entry for the same reason, and it’s not an issue most of the time, but it happens occasionally, and there’s not really a good reason for it.\nIn the end though, Papers Please is a fantastic game. If you’ve not played it yet, hopefully I’ve been able to convince you to give it a go, if you’re on the fence though, I urge you to gamble on it anyway, wait for a sale even if you wish. Just make sure that you do play this game.\n\nGlory to Arstotzka!","February 2, 2015","true","11.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Yet, it doesn't matter, as the game itself is pretty unique and interesting... maybe even addictive.\n\nBasically, it's an exercise in concentration. Each day, your job as a passport-controller becomes more difficult. At first, there are like 2-3 things to watch out for. Each day, a new thing to observe and look out for is added, and so you need to remember more and more things to watch out for. Some of them don't come up for quite some time, but once you get too careless, you miss those things and fail.\n\nFortunately, you can mess up a few times each day without having to pay a fee from your measly pay. Then again, the more complaints you get, the worse it gets, as there also is some kind of inspector who will judge your efficiency every once in a while.\n\nI recommend to write down the issueing cities from each region on a piece of paper... otherwise, you might lose quite some time checking every time.\n\nI have played this for 5 hours so far, in two sessions, and I notice that it really can eat away at your ability to concentrate, so I think this is best played casually... do like half an hour at a time so you don't burn yourself out.\n\nI really like the theme, as it DOES make you think a bit about how unfair the system in that country is, and you have to make some harsh decisions. There even are a few puzzles in there in the story-mode.\n\nKudos to the developer... this is a fun little game, and to me, the old school graphics don't matter at all, as the core of the game is very well thought out, and it's fun!","March 23, 2015","true","11.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And I do mean tiny: 30 megs tiny. That's four times the price of an iTunes HD episode for less than one-fifteenth the size, but believe me when I say that you'll spend more time on this game than you ever would watching any episode of any TV show.\n\nThe power of the game lies in its simple and complex art style and moral elements, respectively. Your position sees very little of any colour other than greys and blacks, probably reflecting that the morality that the game pushes you towards. Almost your money goes to rent, food and heat for your family at the end of each workday, and you get paid by how many people you process correctly. This would normally just serve to give the players incentive to pay attention and not ♥♥♥♥ up, but the game has the simple trick of any citizen just claiming what any citizen would. Maybe they want to get into the country to see their family or reunite with their significant other, and turning them away means breaking that. Of course, letting them through means you might not be able to afford heat this evening.\n\nThe game has problems, sure. If you're not the type for it, the morality system falls completely flat and you just don't care, because there's no real penalty for simply doing your job aside from citizens calling you an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in 16-bit text before disappearing forever. The booth upgrades aren't very helpful, and I can't say that this is the most thrilling game to play if you're playing on a stationary rig that can run many more exciting, if not as compelling, games. That being said, it is still surprisingly engaging for its size; I found myself able to play it (before I bought the Steam version) in class for sometimes hours at a time, just processing and processing over and over. And its size and almost non-existant graphical tax means that no matter your specs, you could run it.\n\nIn conclusion, it's more than worth recommending. The phrase "Simple, yet elegant" is thrown around a lot but it really does find a place here, amongst the endless passports and tickets that will inevitably clutter your desk. If you're the type for it, pick it up anyway, but if you're on the move a lot and switching computers, frequently finding yourself with nothing to do, I couldn't recommend Papers, Please higher. It takes some real talent to make a job that should be boring fun and captivating, and that's just what Mr. Pope has done.\n\nFinal Score: 8.5/10","June 20, 2014","true","0.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The game has a very original concept and it does an amazing job of making a very mundane task appear thrilling and exciting. You start out as an immigration officer working in a border checkpoint of a communist country. The pay is abysmal and you have to provide for your whole family. When money's short, do you take bribes to keep you family fed and warm, or do you sacrifice their well-being for your own moral high ground? The game is full of such decisions that have long-lasting effects. The game starts with a simple task of checking entrant's passports then starts adding more and more rules to remember. Making more than two mistakes means you get fined, which can quicly drive you bankrupt. These challenges only make the gameplay more compelling though and you start to develop a sense of pride for your job. The constant narrative implications your actions have make for a very thrilling experience from the beginning to end.\n\nThe retro visual style of the game fits perfectly and adds a certain atmosphere to it that enhances the narrative setting. The soundtrack may be small in quantity, but the few tracks set the communist theme amazingly well.\n\nThe only real issue I had while playing this game was the repetitive nature of the gameplay, which I started to notice towards the end of the game.

The game has a very original concept and it does an amazing job of making a very mundane task appear thrilling and exciting. You start out as an immigration officer working in a border checkpoint of a communist country. The pay is abysmal and you have to provide for your whole family. When money's short, do you take bribes to keep you family fed and warm, or do you sacrifice their well-being for your own moral high ground? The game is full of such decisions that have long-lasting effects. The game starts with a simple task of checking entrant's passports then starts adding more and more rules to remember. Making more than two mistakes means you get fined, which can quicly drive you bankrupt. These challenges only make the gameplay more compelling though and you start to develop a sense of pride for your job. The constant narrative implications your actions have make for a very thrilling experience from the beginning to end.\n\nThe retro visual style of the game fits perfectly and adds a certain atmosphere to it that enhances the narrative setting. The soundtrack may be small in quantity, but the few tracks set the communist theme amazingly well.\n\nThe only real issue I had while playing this game was the repetitive nature of the gameplay, which I started to notice towards the end of the game. It is but a small blemish on an otherwise wonderful experience however.","January 22, 2014","true","7.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

Being a sort of point-and-click game, Papers, Please excels in the way it uses it.\n\nYou take the role of an Arstotzkan border controller who regulates the border checkpoint in Grestin, Arstotzka.\nYou must earn money by doing your job accordingly and with as few errors as possible in order to feed and protect your family, as well as keeping them healthy and living under a roof.\n\nThe game focuses on the basic mechanics of point-and-click, but uses this mechanic in a very different way by allowing the player to check entrees' passports as they attempt to enter the country of Arstotzka. Your duty, as border controll, is to make sure that only people with valid documents enter the country.\nIf you make any errors, small amounts of your salary will be held back, and you may even allow in a terrorist if the person that you allowed entrance carried a bomb and you forgot to x-ray them because they had expired documents, for example.\n\nThe game has a very simple art direction, as well as a very simple sound design. Lucas Pope, the creator of the game, really nailed it with Papers, Please, as he created something inspiring, entertaining, and very different.\n\nPapers, Please is one of its kind, and is one of those rare indie games that you should defnitely try out.\n\nThe only complaint I have is that the main story is too short, but even so, the game has a freemode and so you can continue to play on without focusing on the main story, even though the main story is crafted in a specific way and has its own events, the freemode is very fun too.\n\nNo more needs to be said.\nGlory to Arstotzka.","November 25, 2013","true","6.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The gameplay is entirely monotonous: someone hands you documents, you cross check these documents against a set of ever changing rules, point out any discrepencies, repeat for several hours.  Despite the seeming simplicity, PP is incredibly addicting and I ended up completing it in a single sitting, something I haven't done with a video game (even short ones) since high school.\n\nMaybe it's the moody atmosphere that's as disturbing as it is darkly humorous.  Maybe it's the idea of having absolute authority over the lives of these virtual citizens.

If you’re looking for something truly unique in the modern swamp of AAA titles, Papers, Please will definitely fill that role. At $9.99, it’s a low-entry oddity that tells a compelling story about failure. And who knows?

It will resonnate strongly with whoever had to be familiar with such situation.\nFellow reviewer Brandon Cackowski-Schnell stated on multiple occasions he was amazed and scared at how the game turned him into a robotic mostly uncaring machine, just to protect those dear to him. In my case, the reaction was the exact opposite : I couldn't cope with the harshness of the job and so I did what I love to think I would have done in real life in such a position : I quit. (Please don't ask my in-game relatives what happened of them ;)\n\nIn that sense, as Dark Souls, I think it truly can be the closest you can get to a real role-playing game on a computer.","December 13, 2013","true","4.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yazzeez/recommended/239030/","yazzeez","Yaz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yazzeez/","201 products in account","In a world where many people don't realize a "visa" isn't always a credit card, Papers Please seems like a pretty odd concept. A game where you stamp passports, being careful to abide by the ever-increasing rules and regulations of your dystopian public employers that are subject to the hopeless political climate of your war-torn and espionage-filled region, tends to stand out amongst the current plethora of green-lit retro platformers.\n\nDespite my own life-long love for a good sidescroller, I have to say Papers Please is the most engrossed I've been in a game in quite a while. When you're not lost in the bureaucratic fever dream of scanning each and every entrant's documentation - of which more and more will be required as time goes on and governments play dirtier - you're juggling funds for your family's food, heat, medicine, and possibility of moving up from the "Class-8" dwellings that sound only a notch better than homelessness.\n\nWhat's more, it comes as no surprise that those around you are looking to do the same; almost each day of the game has someone with missing or faulty documentation and an excuse to go along with it. Reuniting two long-lost loves, aiding an underground resistance group, allowing a woman on death-row in her home country with no documentation to enter with her allowed husband, allowing a child serial killer in (rather than detaining him) so a vengeful father of a little girl can exercise his own justice, and the repeated attempts of a happy-go-lucky drug dealer who tries entering with a crayon passport are all decisions left up to you, keeping in mind the 2-citation limit you get per day before being docked much-needed pay.\n\nAnd honestly, when you see a citation pop up that wasn't on purpose, that ♥♥♥♥ing fax-machine sound and a pink slip popping up? Your heart ♥♥♥♥ing sinks. You feel like an idiot. And worst of all, who knows what sort of scumbag you just let into the country scot-free after a long day of rejecting numerous people whose intentions and needs were possibly far more innocent than their lack of documents would suggest.\n\nStill, the game has its faults. "Booth upgrades" are simple hotkeys to make your job a smidge faster that many seem to not want to use anyway. The sound leaves a lot to be desired - there's basically 3 gibberish-y voice lines that are reused throughout each line of dialog ("baebaz", "hiyakku", "oushtod"), the game has a nearly overwhelming amount of endings (many of which feel more like a depressing Game-Over than an ending), and some things like the benefits of upgrading your apartment are poorly explained.\n\nBut play this game, and be mindful about it. Don't fall into the the ♥♥♥♥ing "Glory to Arstotzka!" memespouting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, don't treat it like Dystopian Despot Simulator XDDD 2013 and then toss it away without trying the other playstyles, and think about how immigration, customs, and bureaucracy affect you and all those in the world for better or worse, right down to the individual working at the desk.","August 21, 2014","true","14.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Which, in my opinion, is one of the best games I have ever played.\n\nThe game is set in a fictional country called Arstotska, and you have the job of being border control. You let immigrants into the country and if they don't have valid paperwork you send them on their way (later in the game you get the option to detain them). This is what I saw in the trailer, so I figured this was one of the boring of the dozens of simulators that are out on the market. So I started the game up, and realized that it was 3 in the morning.\n\nI wouldn't say that this is a fun game, but rather I very entertaining and tense game that gets you very well intrigued with the other countless stories of other immigrants that come into your country. The stress that comes with making enough money each day to keep your family healthy is something that not even Dark Souls could replicate with it's teeth grinding difficulty. Your job becomes more and more difficult as the rules constantly change and you have to check more paperwork until your desk is flooded with it. The last couple of hours were the tense I've had in gaming for a long time. For the cons of this game, well, I can't really think of any. The only thing that comes to mind is the paperwork does become a bit less interesting by the end of the game, and becomes more of a task.\n\nOverall I very much recommend this game, and if you haven't already, buy this game. You will be amazed at how good a paperwork simulator actually is.","February 1, 2015","true","26.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
