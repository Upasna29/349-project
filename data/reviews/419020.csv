Oh well here goes. For a first run picking the fighter, i must say that i'm pretty impressed!! The story (which you don't have to pay attention to really (sorry devs, not hating :) )  i find it rather cool for now. I for a long time have been waiting for some type of beatemup/rpg skill building that is actually worth it and with the team up skills and all, wow keep it up please! Do put online co-op please please please pretty please!!!!!\n\nIf you have a controller and want to play a type of river city ransom meets rpg kind of game and have 10$ to spare, do yourself a favor or send it as a gift to someone you know who would love it :)\n\n\nHappy Holidays y'all\n\nCheers!","December 19, 2015","true","0.5"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

The attacks are quite fluid and fast too.  Although there are some differences that separate this game from the rest.  You can perform combos to do high amounts of damage.  There is an active block that you can utilize to negate damage.\n\nAs for characters, each one has their own unique set of special moves and secret arts.  Special moves can be used on their own or can be used in a combo, kinda like a finisher.  Secret arts are like your ultimate moves, some can wipe out enemies on the screen, while others may grant you additional attack powers.  There are also team attacks that you can perform with another player that can potentially wipe the screen of enemies.\n\nThere are currently two modes that you can play, arcade and story mode.  Arcade mode has 3 difficulties:  easy, medium, and hard.  These 3 difficulties are basically like horde mode except it is not infinite, after you beat 5 rounds the level ends, but you can always replay.  Then you have your endless mode, the rounds are infinite and you play until you run out of health.\n\nAs for story mode you get to learn more about the characters and the lore of the game.  There isnt much currently, but will definitely be expand upon as the game gets updated.\n\nThere is only local coop as of now.  Online coop is TBD.  From a singleplayer standpoint the game is still very enjoyable, not one moment did I ever get bored from playing by myself.  That is not to say I dont want Online MP, I would love to see it implemented.\n\nAs for hours to price ratio, you will definitely get your moneys worth from this game and more.\n\nOverall Wishmere is an excellent game to play and add it to your already awesome collection of games.  I hope this review helps you in deciding whether to purchase the game or not.","February 25","true","7.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"
