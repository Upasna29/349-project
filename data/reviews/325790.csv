What went wrong?\n\nGame-breaking bugs, UI design flaws and annoyances.  If it were still in Early Access, I'd definitely recommend it, with bells on, as it's clearly got *so* much potential.  But apparently they're calling it finished now.  I just spent a few frustrating hours confirming that it really, really isn't.\n\nIf the serious bugs are fixed, the UI is given a little touch-up, the flow of gameplay is better managed and some minor attention is paid to balance, then it's definitely worth purchasing particularly for fans of XCOM et al.\n\nBut if there's no significant post "release" attention then the developers have sadly left this potential classic to whither on the vine.\n\nI'm sure they have their reasons.","August 15, 2015","false","4.4"," 344 of 372 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","344","372","3","15"

Get it on sale for 5 bucks if you are really interested in such kind of games and don't mind to support a developer/publisher, who basically has thrown a "half baked" product out on market and disappeared after that.\n\nLONG VERSION\n\nDiscovered this title while in early access and went for it in October 2015 after it was officially released and got a couple of patches/updates. Now after 70 hours spent I am pretty sure that I have seen and done everything possible within this game, so for all those of you who ask yourself "should I get it or not?" I got an answer. The answer is - no, unless there is a discount like -80% or better. Now some of you may ask "hmm, but what's wrong with it? Trailer looks promising, screens are looking good... okay-okay there were some bugs, but devs are fixing it, right?" and this question is legitimate for sure.\n\nSo let’s go deeper in detail:\n\n1. The game itself is ridiculously short. It consists of ca. 12 main story missions, that’s all. Plus there are so called random encounter events, which are cycled through 4 or 5 predefined maps. Main story maps are predefined as well. The task is always the same - kill them all. In a couple of story missions you need to get to point X and pick up a data, but in order to get there you still need to kill them all. The complete walkthrough will take about 10 hours if you won't waste much time with random encounters.\n\n2. The tactical phase is actually fun to play for a while. It plays pretty the same way like the new XCOM EU/EW. There is also a cover system, but the funny thing is that AI doesn't care about it at all - enemies are just rushing to you (no matter what weapons they have) or going in overwatch. It doesn't depend on difficulty you play - I've tested all possible difficulty settings - always the same behavior, no one takes cover. Furthermore enemies never retreat, never flank, never use medkits, never switch weapons (melee/ranged) and so on. Okay, they manage to use nades at least. But basically they are just dashing to you ignoring everything ready to die in the next turn.\n\n3. The progressing is unbalanced. It is possible to get best available weaponry (gencorp rifles) right in the very beginning via random encounter. Once obtained you will literally r.a.p.e everyone.\n\n4. Weapon setup is unbalanced. There are pretty many weapons and I've tried them all. Some (SMGs, flamethrowers, miniguns) are completely useless. Pistols, rifles and sniper rifles are OK. Shotguns and rocket launchers are too much overpowered.\n\n5. The optimization is not good. The game runs not really smooth on my laptop (i7-4710HQ, 8GB RAM, GeForce GTX860M, Win7-64 Prof.) although it is far beyond the minimal requirements (2GHz Dual Core, 2 GB RAM, Intel HD 4000, Win7)\n\n6. As for today (2015-12-05, v1.1.6) there are still minor bugs, glitches and other annoying things like steam achievements which are impossible to get. Check my reports - some of them are already solved, but latest were not even answered. I guess this game will be abandoned soon or maybe it is already.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/325790/discussions/1/490125737478014134/\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/325790/discussions/1/490125737478010454/\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/325790/discussions/1/490125737478008483/\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/325790/discussions/1/490125737478011420/\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/325790/discussions/1/485622866441482029/\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/325790/discussions/1/485622866441520810/\n\n7. I can just keep on going this way and mention tons of other stuff like:\na) Mercenaries, which you can hire but not fire - the only dismiss option is to vanish them in combat.\nb) If you hire a merc his attributes will be spread in his skilltree randomly. However you can't see his       skilltree before you hire him. If you got him and didn't like his perks selection for any reason - see 7a.\nc). Nothing to explore on the game map at all.\nd). Really confusing correlation between main and secondary stats.\ne). A hit/miss algorithm which is most likely broken. I experienced just too many misses with high-percentage shots like 3-4-5 misses in a row!!! with 80% to hit. On the other hand grenades will never miss, no matter what % is displayed.\nf). Caravan upgrades are pointless. There is no use for the most of those upgrades.\ng). Sometimes in random encounter missions enemies wont move at all, they will just stand there doing permanent overwatch turn after turn.\n\n\n\nNow in the conclusion I have to say that the primary idea/concept of the game isn't that bad at all. The visual art is ok, level design is ok, the story is ok, skill-tree is ok, weapon upgrade system is ok. But the whole rest construct around... it needs at least a massive polishing. It lacks some kind of deepness in this game as well. Something simple like a couple of side quests and explorable map would help a lot. I have a feeling that it was rushed in the very final stage of development. There was so much more potential inside this project, really sad to see what it became in the end.\n\nAs I already said in the beginning - I can not recommend this game in its actual shape. The full price of 20$/€ is honestly a joke for this kind of content. Hovewer if you are looking for a short and unbalanced XCOM-wannabe-clone with incredibly dumb AI, glitches and a lot of weird things - this game is for you.\n\n\n\nPS:\nDislikes are supposed to be invalid unless there is a proof about any single point in this review which is incorrect. Be aware - there are indeed fanboys denying any criticism and instantly disliking every negative review, simply because they get so much b.u.t.t.hurt by facing obvious facts.\n\nRead this thread for more information:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/325790/discussions/0/485624149158912987/","December 9, 2015","false","70.4"," 265 of 292 people (91%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","91","265","292","14","10"

I waited for a while until it was on sale, because I'm a miser like that, and I got at at 75% off.  Whoooo boy, that was probably the best decision I made.  Quickie run down, Do I reccomend it?  No.  Also Yes, but then more No.\n\nHere is the thing.  The mechanics work simlar to X-Com, maybe even slightly better because instead of 2 actions each round you may be able to run, shoot, and then run, or stab someone three times, or other options.  Its actually a superior action point system in my mind.  The graphics while not stunning are surpisingly good too.\n\nThen come the problems.  The most notable, glaring issues are all related to the characters.  Whoever wrote the dialogue for this game should be imprisoned.  It's seriously that bad.  Most games where people complain about the quality of the story, or the quality of voice acting and writing, I look at them and go "Well, it's really not THAT bad".  The only way I managed to finish this game was to stick my fingers in my ears, cover up the text on the bottom of the screen and go "LA LA LA LA I CANT HEAR YOU".  The dialogue doesn't match the subtext, and both of them are not only gramatically awful, but uninteresting at best and confusing at worst.  The voice actors might as well have been reading the back of a cereal box.  Hell, they were probably hired on Craig's List, because their 'performance' (If i can even be allowed to refer to it as such) was flat and emotionless, not to mention the voices definitely not matching faces. And the overall story was... well 'lacking' doesn't even begin to sum it up.  Possibly the worst excuse for a game in these categories that I have ever seen.\n\nGameplay you say?  Well there were a bunch of different kinds of maps I guess.... but the game started out being atrociously hard, and ended up being laughably easy, and all because of the same weapon.  Grenades.  The single most important weapon in the game is grenades.  If you do buy this game just remember that grenades are god.   Your low HP characters will be blasted apart by them early game, but then late game when they barely scratch you, don't worry; the enemies will continue throwing them at you even when you are standing right next to them and they set themselves on fire.  Oh, and they take up like no space and are the most valuable things in the game.  Good news, pretty much every enemy carries two of them.  Grab a sniper and just pick off your enemies and grab them for easy cash.\n\nProbably don't buy this game.  It was just okay enough that I finished it, but I almost always complete campaigns.  You have been warned, I cannot express accurately how horrible the writing and voice acting are.","January 10","false","86.3"," 70 of 76 people (92%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","92","70","76","9","3"

It took almost as long as a heartbeat to find out this is pretty much a poor mashup of XCOM, Shadowrun, and Wasteland 2.

They have a pretty amusing dialogues, but a lot of things are not quite clear because of the obvious gaps in the storytelling. But that’s something that’ll come later for sure.\n\nDownsides right now:\nSince this is alpha, there’s a lot of placeholders and things that are very rough around the edges\nA lot of placeholders everywhere\nUI is quite dodgy in places at the moment\nQuite a lot of times UI does not properly communicates the stats (which is quite important for TBS in my opinion)\nA lot of placeholders everywhere - most of the models are same (I wasn’t joking before)\nSome of the textures are quite low-res and can be painful to look at in high res\n\nBut all of those downsides are very much things in progress and will surely be fixed. If you can put those aside, you’ll find a pretty fun (albeit raw) turn-based strategy experience.\nIf you think those are a bit too much for you, then wait a bit until beta.\n\nYou can watch a bit more in-depth look at the game here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V39abxADtvw\n","April 6, 2015","true","2.9"," 90 of 120 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","90","120","0","7"

It should not have been released from Early Access is the state it is in.  While the Dev had made a lot of bug fixes and some UI improvements since launch, there is still a long way to go until it is a game worth spending your time and money on.\n\nAs for my 1.6 hours of playtime, it has given me enough experience with the game to know that it is not worth my time to keep playing it as it is.  I am willing to give it another try if more improvements are made, but as it is they may be the second game I have ever used Steam Refund on.\n\nMy main problems with the game so far have been-\n\nNo customizing your character.  You start with Herk, add some poorly defined stats, and you can choose from 4 different coats and add a face mask or glasses to your Character.  That is it for Character  Customization.  You will always play the man named Herk.\n\nThe UI is terrible. This is still true even after the update that did make some improvements, but it is still ugly and requires more clicks than it should to get a simple task done. such as searching a location for items you know are there.  Example. If I am next to an item on the ground, and I press the Hot Key to pick it up, there should be no need to confirm that yes, I really would like to pick up said item.\n\nCombat UI needs a lot of improvement.  When you chose to attack, a circle showing your attack range for the equipped weapon and % to hit for anything you move the cursor over. The main problem is trying to aim past somebody to fire a long range weapon, ignore the to hit % as it is a complete lie, and more than once I am unable to use a melee attack on somebody standing right next to be because of "reasons".\n\nCaravan map needs improvement. The way to travel from location is through the map screen, and there are several problems with it.  First is drilling for items.  You can purchase "Rumors" of treasure buried out in the wasteland.   The problems with this, is you have to find the exact pixel that contains the coordinates of the "rumored" treasure, so get ready to have fun as you click around the map looking for this pixel. Add to this the incredible problem of traffic in the Barren Wastelands, the game feels more like a trip to Walmart on Black Friday rather than a post-apocalyptic world.  There are roving caravans everywhere.\n\nThis game has other problems, but I don't feel like listing them all and the Dev has been active in forums and has released 2 patches since release that have fixed many bugs and made some UI improvements.\n\nThis game has a lot of potential to be a really good turn-based game, but it just isn't there yet and the rushing of the game through Early Access  is an act of desperation that makes me think that maybe this game will never receive the attention  it needs to be a great game.  I hope I am wrong about this, and the Dev continues to work on the game making the necessary  improvements to make the game enjoyable.","August 22, 2015","false","4.8"," 67 of 85 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","67","85","0","0"

Your fighters have some basic stats to start as well as the same leveling path for all of them, there are no classes of fighters as you might expect. Your troopers get familiar with certain weapons as they keep using them and over time this specialty increases to hit chance of that weapon class, therefor you can craft your troopers as you see fit, you can give one a shotgun, good protection clothes and +HP skills and make him an assault while another one will just keep distance with sniper rifle.\nThis game is not such well made as XCOM, but all above looks like a solid foundation for a turn base combat game.\n\nProblems start with gameplay.\n-I had about one crash every 2-3 hours.\n- Enemy AI is blunt stupid and enemies spawn on very small groups like 1-2 of them, so your 6 will kill them before their turn.\nEnemies will keep standing in the open and just overwatch with a weapon with very small range and you can pick them off with something with bigger range easly.\nThe hardest fight is when for the first time you meet a well a armed group with best rifles, after that you take possession of their rifles and game becomes even more easy.\n- There are no saves during tactical combat, so you game crashes or otherwise bugs out at the very end its your loss, start again.\n- Using cover is kind of hard master when it will actually work and provide cover.\n\nSo what is good in this game.\n+Post-apocalyptic climat is good, locations look deserted, ruined, repurposed.\n+You feel lack of supplies from the beggining to like mid-game.\n+Management is nice, you can improve your caravan, sell and buy more stuff for your troops.\n+Weapons feel nice, distance is a factor for most guns while sniper rifles use revers distance calculation (the closer to the target the worse is your aim)\n\nOverall game looks unfinished, but developers are still suppoting it and developing.

Eliot\n\nWithout any further delay, I present to you my review of Fallen: A2P Protocol.\n\nGameplayFrom the captivating design of the maps, to every small detail, Fallen: A2P Protocol has the looks of an amazing game.\nFollowing a story mode, it’s up to the player to choose the right moves, as well as the right weapon for the job, which can be a katana, a stop sign, an SMG, or even a sniper rifle.\nThe game also allows the player to choose which mission should be next, using a map and a vehicle, a caravan, to be more accurate. Since resourcers are scarce, driving around indefinitely is not an option, as there’s a sort of fuel resource limit. It’s also on the caravan that the player gets to use the hard earned experience to improve the unit’s skills, and even to gear them up, among other options.\nIf you’re looking for a good turn-based game, with an apocalyptic setting to it, and a bright future ahead of it, look no further.\n\nPros Great graphics;\nFantastic environment, incredibly well designed, givin a post-apocalyptic feeling to the game;\nThe AI is really solid;\nSound effects are well suited to the genre;\nNice variety of weapons;\nDiversified maps.\nConsidering it's an Early Access (EA) game, I've decided to add a "Neutral" category, for details I consider important, but not gamebreakers, and could easily improve the gameplay if attended.\n\nNeutral Needs more content;\nStory could use some polishing;\nSome achievements aren’t working properly;\nCould use some hints, or abilities, to find objectives during missions, as you might end up just looking around for enemies to kill;\nThe UI is a bit odd to get used to.\nThe game is rather enjoyable, especially considering its recent release date, so there’s no much to point out “Cons” wise.\n\nCons Some annoying bugs around.\nVerdictI'd give it a 7.5/10, which could easily be higher with some more content and some bugfixes.","May 25, 2015","true","8.5"," 52 of 88 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","52","88","0","6"

The devs, Red Katana, wanted to share early access with me for creating this first impression.  The game is currently in Early Access Alpha so there are many game mechanics still being worked on.  We're discussing the game strictly as a work in progress.  This game is originally fan funded on Kickstarter.\n\nSo when you look at this game in action it immediately reminds you of Xcom. So fans of Xcom  and turn based strategy combat should be interested in this game.  It does derive a lot of gameplay elements from Xcom in the combat, but there are many differences as well.   It is not an Xcom clone, it has it's own style of gameplay.\n\nIt does take place in the post apocalypse and the game is built around this.  Everything is limited and you are literally scavenging to survive.  In combat you have a limited number of bullets and melee weapons are important.  You have to find or purchase ranged weapons, melee weapons are your backup.  So positioning for attack can vary based on whether you are using melee or ranged weapons.  The attack system is based on AP points and each move you do uses a different amount of AP.  So in order to attack you have to judge how much distance you can move and still fire your attack.  There are also different types of defenses.  There's “hunker down” which reduces the damage you take during the enemy turn.  Then there's “Overwatch” where your character will fire back when the enemy enters your line of sight.  Looting is also crucial.  After each enemy you kill, you'll have to use AP to move to the loot and pick it up.  This is the primary way you get ammo during combat.\n\nWhen you finish combat, you'll find yourself in the overworld.  You can purchase new items, level up individual characters, and travel to different sites.  The different sites have shops and missions.  Leveling up characters can unlock new passive and active skills and this is done for each character.  So you definitely do not want to lose anyone in combat.  You can also move items around in your inventory.\n\nI'll remind you the game is an Early Access Alpha, but I do see a lot of room for improvement.  The game needs to include basic hotkeys in combat and that to be integrated into the UI.  The overworld UI could use a lot more intuitive functions.  Currently, players have to figure it all out themselves.  The story cut scenes could definitely use more animation and preferably voice overs.\n\nYou may want to wait until the final or beta version, but this game is heading in the right direction.  Red Katana is trying to create a solid strategy game.  If you are a huge fan of strategy game and want to support the devs, buy the early access which retails at $15.","April 6, 2015","true","1.8"," 43 of 73 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","43","73","2","2"

In spite of my greatest efforts to enjoy the game, too much of it is poorly implemented.  For example, while travelling on the world map you may likely come across encounters.  After you beat an encounter, you'll be looking at your spoils from the combat while on the main map.  This would be a non-issue if other enemies weren't speeding to you to attack you, giving you little time to look at your rewards.  The cover system is almost non-functional, as well.  Characters will regularly miss shots that have a 94% hit chance, but always seem to be struck by return fire... the list goes on.\n\nAll of this could be overlooked for the sake of enjoying the game, being a fan of the genre.  That is, except for the tragic and uninspired voice acting.  There seems to be one actor who cared about the game - the others sound like they've been sedated and have no interest in their job.  What would be meant as a heated argument with vitriol and resentment instead comes out sounding like a group of school children performing The Iliad while reading from cue cards just barely beyond their sight.  Unless you really have disposable income:  Stay away from "Fallen: A2P Protocol".","May 1","false","6.7"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

Writing now that it's out of early access. Well, it feels like it's still in early access to me.\n\nAs a big fan of X-Com (old and new) as well as Fallout (likewise), I figured this'd be right up my ally. And maybe it will be, once it gets another coat of polish. There's so much potential here, I'm sure it'll be great.\n\nMan, though. That dialog. I'm sure there are people who like it. Good for them, I'm legit happy. But wow, I am not among their ranks.\n\n(Edit; clarifying as per requests in the comments)\n\nReasonable! Let me go into more detail.\n\nThe dialog feels like the kind of writing you get out of 14-year old writers going for "Edgy." I have no issue with profanity, I find it can be a delightful spice for dialog. This was like eating a spoonful of raw cinnamon. I can't tell if they were going for a wacky comedy game, or a serious gritty wasteland tale. My guess is blending the two, as has been done successfuly with Wasteland, Fallout, etc.\n\nIt, in my estimation, fails absolutely on every count. It's tone is more in keeping with a YouTube video comments section than professional fiction of any stripe.\n\nThe voice acting is extremely disjointed. Not 90's Capcom Bad, insofar as I'm pretty sure these weren't cold reads by janitors, but it feels wildly disconnected; highly disjointed. At no point did I feel like these people were talking to each other.\n\nAs far as the early access, I was experiencing mouse lag on even medium settings - my compy's in the 84th percentile in horsepower & graphics, and this is hardly a graphics-intensive game. And yet.\n\nThe interface wasn't super intuitive. And okay, fine, you don't want to do a tutorial mode. Cool, that's old-school. Jagged Alliance & X-Com at least had manuals.\n\nOverall, it's not bad. But I was really excited for the release, and now I'm more excited about uninstalling it, and reinstalling Jagged Alliance 2.\n\nHopefully that clears up my concerns.","August 14, 2015","false","3.8"," 62 of 111 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","62","111","2","5"

The whole experience was 20+ hrs long. First 10 hrs were pure bliss, followed by the disappointment of seeing how the story was abandoned and the game didnt offer anything new...but it still was fun to play.\n\nIt is not a finished game, what you get is the first half of a fantastic game, followed by some generic whipped up content to call it a finished product when obviously it is not.\n\nWorth the asking price? Tough question.\nIts not a finished product but overall it offers better entertainment than a trollfest like Xcom which costs more.\nIt offers 20+ hrs of fun, but if you are a story b*tch like me you will be disappointed by how the story was abandoned mid-game.\nSo is it worth it? On a discount most definitely. Regular price only for the players that dont care much about the story and only want a good turn based tactical combat without the trolling of Xcom.","December 12, 2015","true","24.2"," 52 of 95 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","52","95","3","16"

I waited until release, so I could play the entire campaign.\n"Fallen: A2P Protocol" did have a rough start, though. It had plenty of bugs, even game-breaking ones. But - and this is a major positive for me - the devs really listen to the community. The constantly work on fixes and deliver them quickly. So as for now, the game experience has been greatly improved, and I can recommend it. The story ends in a cliffhanger, though, so I wonder if the devs are planning on releasing additional content or possible sequels.","September 15, 2015","true","16.2"," 21 of 36 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","21","36","0","0"

Sadly those good bones are wasted here.\n\nI kickstarted this game because I am a fan of Xcom type games and post-Apocalyptic stories. I will say that they tried their best to make the lore interesting. But hackneyed dialogue marred by cliche statements and prolific cursing drags down the plot. Some foul language is endemic to the topic but the writers throw the f-bomb around like it is going out of style. This constant drone of said word dumbs down the plot and alienates some of their customer base.\n\nThere is no paced evolution of equipment. I went from basic weapons to A2p weapons with my second encounter. I never felt that sense of accomplishment that you feel when you get that first energy weapon like in Fallout. It was just sort of dropped in my hands.\n\nCharacter growth is present but the tree seemed to be the same for everyone. This limits customisation and denies the player a chance to really make a character their own.\n\nI didn't expect a lot in the graphics department and so I wasn't surprised. Passable graphics and sound, they didn't detract but they also didn't add much to play. By the umpteenth time you hear the enemy spotted sound you'll be ready to turn off the speaker, though.\n\nI wish I had more positive to say about this game but it is quite flawed. Maybe they'll keep working on the problems I've pointed out but I doubt it as their budget probably will not support such efforts.","November 30, 2015","false","4.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

That reboot of the X-Com series was wonderful (although admittedly I didn't play a lot of it).\n\nSo the story is you're taken hostage and are being forced to help them collect treasures to sell. You are wearing an explosive collar! (Not so original)\n\nNow, I enjoyed the game play a lot. I think the game is already showing a lot of promise. You have to equip your team by scavenging the map, loot enemy bodies and I'm sure other ways I just haven't run into them yet.\n\nEach member of your party also levels up independently although it seemed even while I was playing (Each had earned the same number of skill points at the end of the level). And each member has it's own skill tree although for now they are identical. Though I'd have to imagine at some point there will be varied skill trees added.\n\nThe game plays like X-Com so if you liked that and want more in a different setting with it's own rule set, here it is!\n\nWhat I didn't enjoy though was jumping into a New Game, there is no tutorial. I just brute forced my way and figured it out. Though while ending my first play through I noticed a separate menu labeled 'Guides' wish I had noticed it before =/\n\nThe other thing is just the poor localization, not that bad but enough to find laughable, and hopefully fixed through-out the Early Access process.\n\nOverall I think there's a lot of potential here and the basics are already well established.\n\nHere's the video of my First Look!

You and your older brother Silas went to Purgatory to meet Maximus (a worshipper of A2P energy) a so-called old acquaintance of Silas. You were supposed to get an A2P Battery Cell (a new type of energy) for your motorcycle when you realised the incredible betrayal from your brother. He sold you to Maximus and you were thrown unconscious into a pit to be sacrificed to the A2P god!   The sound of gun shots quickly helps you to regain consciousness (yep, that would do the trick almost every time) and to your great surprise, you were rescued by Salvador who kindly hands you a Katana….. Now you have to get out of Purgatory and hunt down your loving brother!\n\nFallen: A2P Protocol is a tactical turn-based strategy game set in a post-apocalyptic world. At the start of the game, you will have to customize Herk by distributing points between the following attributes; strength, vitality, agility and perception. Then, you will be thrown very quickly into the thick of the story and to your first battle.\n\nWhen you start a mission, you will command 4 characters but sometimes it might be 3 or 2 depending on how you went in your previous mission and assuming you did not have enough scrap metal (which is your currency) to recruit new characters. It works in a  very similar way to Xcom, Jagged Alliance in terms of gameplay where you will have a specific amount of points allocated to each of your characters for movements or actions per turn. As you go through your missions and eradicate your challenging opponent, make sure you search the fallen enemies and take as much ammunition, weaponry (especially the ones with A2P cells attached to it), armour (hats, boots, vests etc..) and medkits as you can. Oh, sometimes you can find items in cars and boxes scattered in the map.\n\nWhen you finish your mission, you will be given skill points for each of your characters who are still alive and distribute them on a skills tree. Also, you can upgrade your caravan, but make sure you have enough scrap metal to do so.\nUse the travel map to go to different locations where you can recruit new characters, listen to rumours which will lead you to hidden stashes but remember this will cost you a fair bit of scrap metal. However, you will be able to trade items there too. So keep on the lookout for awesome weapons and armours!\n\nIn terms of graphics, they could have been slightly more polished in my opinion, but they are sound. I enjoy the dialogues but the voice-over could have been better. On the control side of the equation, they are very easy to learn and I really like the camera view; it works perfectly.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Challenging turn-based strategy game\n-	Controls are good and easy to learn\n-	Levels are well designed\n-	Good gameplay\n-	Steam achievements\n-	Trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Graphics could have been better\n-	Voice over could have been better executed\n\nIf you are like me and enjoy a good turn-based strategy game, Fallen: A2P Protocol is a game you have to have in your game library.\n\n8/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

There are not many games in this genre that stand out but those that do 'Fallout Tactics', 'XCOM - Enemy Within' and 'Shadowrun - Dragonfall' are easily some of the best games ever made. So interest in developing any games in this genre are always to be welcomed, even if the bar for greatness is very high. The combat is fun although rather basic at the moment, revolving around taking actions which use up a limited number of action points each turn. The game features weather effects which are a neat addition even if the ones I have encountered dont seem to have that much of an effect on gameplay. Storyline isn't great at the moment. Enjoyable if small level design.\n\nSection 2\nThe storyline needs work. Perhaps have West sold to his companions at the beginning rather than have him sold into slavery, thrown down a pit and then rescued by people who just turn him into their slave. The current story makes him look too gullible.\nI can't find how to swap weapons, even through using the inventory. Perhaps a guide could help with that or instructions.\nMost of the language used when characters swap taunts makes it sound as though it was written by an eight year old Samuel L Jackson who was really into BDSM at thetime. 'It's a be a good boy collar' etc.\nThe translation into english and grammar needs some work. Not sure why when two characters meet they start talking about 'fighting windmills'.\nI can use the mouse to scroll up and scroll down the map but not from side to side. ?\nThe game needs more information about its setting. A lot of world concepts get talked about at the beginning which go over my head because they are either not covered in the conversations or there is no backstory article available in the game.","April 12, 2015","true","2.5"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","10","21","0","1"

This game has promise as a great title, even though it is difficult to visualize the final product in its current state as Early Access. Set in a post-apocalyptic United States, you take command of a rag-tag group of scavengers that stumble upon a mystery of the wasteland. Each member of your squad can equip a variety of ranged and hand-to-hand weaponry, from makeshift swords to rocket launchers. Medikits, grenades, and armor are also available.\n\nThe developers helped to sell the post-apocalyptic setting by reducing the availability and limiting your access to weapons, equipment, and ammunition, both through NPC shops and on the battlefield. Granted you can buy and equip your squad with any items from the game at Level 1, assuming the NPC shop has it in its inventory and/or access to early dead body loot. However, ammunition is scarce, and you may only have one shot with that shiny new rocket launcher you have.\n\nIn battle, the game tallies and records all actions. Meaning, whenever a good guy or bad guy, shoots, throws an item, or uses a medikit, the game will make sure that item is expended, even after the end of the battle. Those item tallies will affect the items that can be looted from dead bodies. Example: If an enemy sniper has six bullets, and takes three shots by the time your men kill the sniper, looting his body will only get you the three remaining bullets, and his rifle of course.\n\nThe battlefield is also affect by weather conditions. Acid rain, extreme heat, and sandstorms are just a few examples. Each weather condition can appear and disappear without warning and will affect the battlefield for a random period of turns. Each weather condition will affect the battlefield in a different way, forcing you to change strategies in the middle of a fight.\n\nThere are a few drawbacks to this title that I do feel I need to mention. There a significant lack of roamability, random questing, and the ability to be a murderous vigilante to this post-apocalyptic world. The developers have emphasized (to my general disappointment) that Fallen: A2P Protocol is intended to be quite linear, and there will not be much deviation from the main story missions. Random encounters may be added to this title in the future, but that seems unconfirmed.\n\nAnother issue I see with Fallen: A2P Protocol is the lack of character individuality. (I am hoping in the long-term this evaluation is no longer applicable..) Every character you control in the game is a complete copy of the next, in terms of character stats, allowable equipment, and skill tree. (This is Early Access, so I will ignore the copy/paste character models and animations.) There is no variety for being a bunch of random misfits running around the ruins of the United States.\n\nIn conclusion, Fallen: A2P Protocol is a "Flubber" of a title. There is just enough content to feel interesting and worth peeking at. But it is not developed enough to know where it is going. It is too amorphous and not a lot of shape just yet. I do believe this game can be a great play option, like I said at the beginning of this review. However, I would only recommend this game to anyone who will actively participate in the Early Access improvement plan.","April 16, 2015","true","6.0"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

However, not a big issue, in tactical game not the graphic is the first.\n- I don't like the bloody games, and i am not expecting a human exploding in a bloody cloud after i shot him with a pistol. There is no option to turn off the blood. At least i didn't found.\n- It was annoying for me the character speeches if i misclick in combat. For example i click on an enemy who is out of shoot range, or i don't have enough AP for an action. In other games you get a message "not enough AP". In this game, the characters say a "funny" sentence. I am a bit disturbed when i click something wrong in the first hour, and they keep say "are you ♥♥♥♥ing kidding me?", "are you real?" and so on.\n\nI am sorry i waited so much with trying the game, i thought it will be good, and i didn't want a beta experience. But i learnt an important lession: shouldn't buy a game what you don't try ASAP, and miss the possibility for refund.","November 1, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"
