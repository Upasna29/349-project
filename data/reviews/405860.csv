You must help your alien friend by going through levels and defeating enemies to find missing parts to his space ship. Along the way expect cuteness, humor and a lot of fun. This is a game great for children and those wanting a nostalgia fix.\n\nThe game play is simple. You can jump, double jump and float down with a balloon. Enemies are taken care of by jumping onto their heads, though they will respawn, so be careful. You bounce around collecting coins used to buy nifty add-ons like more music or changing Ubie’s color. The levels also offer goals of collecting bees to for the Queen Bee and there are hidden diamonds scattered about. The game is very straightforward and easy to grasp but it still offers a challenge while the controls are intuitive and responsive.\n\nGraphics remind me of a flash game, they are rather simplistic and don’t offer much variety. Everything looks cute and colorful but that’s about it. This does not mean the graphics are bad.  For a simple platformer they work very well, but don’t expect bells and whistles. The game shines a bit more in the up-beat and catchy music -I found myself playing levels to get more coins for songs.\n\nI would certainly recommend this game to anyone with children, especially if you want to get them into gaming. It’s a good casual experience for adults and easy to pick up and put down when you need a break. It has four worlds with plenty of levels, though they can be a bit short. My only issue is the price, I would advise you to grab this title on sale since due to cost in relation to game length.\n\n\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!","February 9","true","7.4"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","20","21","0","0"

The little balloon they give you both makes it forgiving when you miss an easy jump and lets you try crazy and complex tricks.\n\nLots of different things in levels keep it interesting.  Difficulty varies a lot; the beginning is easy to just pick up and play, but some of the levels are super-hard.","January 15","true","11.8"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/405860/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Super Ubie Island REMIX is a platformer made by Notion Games that was originally kickstarted in 2012 (as Super Ubi Island, but the name had to take the change because of Ubisoft).\n\nYou control a small cute alien that has crashed to a planet with classic biomes like forests, deserts, or tundras. Speaking of cute stuff, that's something the game deserves praise for - nice cutscenes (between zones) and overall sweet drawn graphics and good character animation (for a platformer). The successful presentation is also followed with funny sounds and fine soundtrack.\n\nAs for the gameplay talk, there isn't much innovation, developers followed the classic formula known since Super Mario World. Besides jumping and double-jumping, you can also glide which will be most frequently used, as level design is built a lot around it. Attacking NPCs is done by classic jumping on head. The controls are overall responsive without any lags, it was nice to play with Xbox 360 controller. (Though there are some bugs, as once I've seen webkit debug popup.)\n\nThere isn't an overwhelming amount levels and if you don't want to complete the game on 100%, don't expect many hours of playtime. Still, it'll depend on your skill, as even though the levels are short-ish, there aren't any checkpoints and since the first levels there are places that instantly kills you, making you starting the level from beginning (and losing collectable items from specific level).\n\nConclusion:Super Ubie Island REMIX is not a bad platformer, but for relatively higher price it doesn't offer as much content as you could expect (in compare to Super Meat Boy, for example). It belongs to the mediocre category, but I believe the developers can do better and I'm looking forward to see their next game.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","March 20","false","1.4"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","13","20","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arcaded/recommended/405860/","arcaded","ArcadEd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arcaded/","233 products in account","I'm in love with this game.  It brings back the feeling of when I was a kid playing SMB (all of them) for the first time.  It's hard at times, but very rewarding when you finally get past that level you have been struggling with.  I think the levels are just the right length to where you don't get frustrated when you die and have to start over.\n\nCongrats to Notion Games.  It's extremely difficult to pour your heart and sould into a project like this, and I know the sheer amount of work that goes into it.   Plus the fact that the developer is an artist first and developer second makes it even more impressive.  I would happy to recommend this game to all of my friends, especially those around my age (39) that grew up on the NES and SNES.    Keep it up Notion Games, looking forward to more game from you in the future.","January 16","true","11.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

You control an alien who has crashed onto a planet after being attacked by an evil floating head. To fix your ship and get home you need to collect parts located at the end of each world. Each world has a short hub world that allows you to access all of the levels within.\n\nThe game handles very well with both keyboard and controller. I played through the first world with both and found the experience to be fairly comparable.\n\nThe strongest part of the game has to go to the soundtrack. This game is full of well produced music that fits it's aesthetic style very well. As you play the game you collect coins which can then later be exchanged for additional music tracks.\n\nThe game's art style is reminiscent of the bygone era of flash games. This would have been right at home on Newgrounds or Miniclip back in the day. Despite that this game certainly holds its own. It's quite a fun platformer and I've enjoyed my time with it so far.","January 27","true","1.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The comparison between the Mario series stops at you pick up coins and it's a platformer. It is a platformer that is unique in the genre.\n\nSuper Ubie Island Remix is about an alien who is forced to land on Climate Island by Dr Terrestrial. He has to collect parts for his ship all while defeating Dr Terrestrial's demented creations. Ubie has two abilities, float with a balloon and jump up walls. Both of these abilities are extremely powerful. This game's level design will remind you of games on the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis. Be preared to be challenged like no other platformer.\n\nChallenge is inheriently built into the level design. What may seem like random object placement, is really hints to upcoming obstacles and skills you'll need. There is no such thing as lives or time. Take as long as you want and try as many times as you want. Exploration is built into the level design as well. Hints will be given but only cleaver thought will discover them. Take your time and explore the level. That is until.....\n\nYou beat the game. Then comes time trials!! It records how fast you went through the level. I find this element to be enjoyable. Each zone is unlocked as a player completes them. With the auto-save feature seemless built into the game, you don't need to worry if your progress will be lost. There are also other items that you need to collect to unlock different skins for Ubie. Coins are used to unlock songs on the boombox. There is a side quest from Queen Bee to collect her children bees scattered across Climate Island. There is a reward for collecting these bees, inwhich there are 3 in each level. There is also two additional different side quests in this game as well.\n\nAll in and all, this game definitely was enjoyable! I'd recommend it for anyone's library.","January 16","true","14.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ConsentedGamer/recommended/405860/","ConsentedGamer","ConsentedGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ConsentedGamer/","63 products in account","The key for this game was given to me.\n\nSuper Ubie Island REMIX has nice a soundtrack and cute graphics. It also sports the basic mechanics of a platformer, with only a few slight differences (gliding, wall jumping).\n\nThe game is not very long, and I ended up dying a lot throughout my playthrough - perhaps at least 50% of my playthrough is due to my various attempts at levels I kept dying on. My vast amount of deaths could simply be from me being bad at games, but I like to think the game was simply a bit challenging - mainly to help my ego.\n\nThere were also some logical flaws, but hey, it's a game - it uses game logic.\n\nEven though the game was somewhat challenging (maybe), I definitely enjoyed the soundtrack.\n\nAs I always say, the value of an item is completely dependent on the individual buyer. $9.99 to some people is chump change, for others it is their dinner. With that being said, it is a matter of your situation and what you feel the game is worth. Personally, I would wait for it to be on sale before buying it.","January 28","true","16.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is so cutesy and chill, it'll keep you in a mellow mood throughout the whole time you're playing it. It's some deep, plot heavy slogfest you have to plow through to get the good stuff. It's a fast paced, lighthearted romp you can pick up and put down when you want. A great way to introduce platforming to young and old alike and still has a bit of challenge to keep it interesting.\n\nA great way to kill time!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/recommended/405860/","Dragnix","{FITH}™Dragnix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/","743 products in account","This key was obtained from the publisher for the purposes of review.\n\nSummary:\nA game that's living in Mario's shadow. Taking from a classic series and basing your gameplay from that can work, and Ubie can have moments where it captures some of the classic platforming gameplay, in particular in jumping from enemy to enemy. The controls work reasonably well in both the keyboard and mouse, and the game does have a nice charm to it. However, when you live in a game's shadow, it becomes that much more apparent of the games weaknesses. Level Design can lead to some silly situations as there's no reason for some of the elements to be there. The game compared to other games in the genre of an equivalent price point comes up short, but there's something that the game is missing more then anything else. The KO punch. The game doesn't have anything it truly excels at, and despite some variation in level design, can feel repetitive very quickly. With no other major mechanics that compliment the platforming, you end up feeling like the game has shown what it has to offer in the first hour...and really not a lot beyond that. It doesn't help that some bugs pop up once in a while to make it a bit more annoying. In the end, the pedigree of a Forbes 30 Under 30 developer doesn't shine through here, and while I will be interested in what he produces in the future, Super Ubie Island doesn't do it for me in the Platformer genre. If you're hard up for a game to bring back that nostalgic feeling, then it may do it for you, it just didn't keep it up for me.\n\nVideo Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRbLq1yqpNc\n\nLists:\n+:\nIs able to bring back nostalgic feelings of older platformers at first.\nControls are what you'd expect from a game of the genre. Tight enough for precision platforming.\nSimple aesthetic works from a simple platformer perspective.\nPerformance of the game works at 60 FPS and rarely dips at any point.\n-:\nSome weird ♥♥♥ level design. Elements may feel unfinished, and certain triggerable elements lead to nowhere, for no good reason.\nIt's lack of gameplay variety becomes apparent very quickly. Without secondary mechanics to prop it up, it focuses TOO much on its platforming gameplay.\nReally annoyed with the doors at time. Sometimes you couldn't go through them, other times it was way too easy to go through them.\nBoss battles were a bore.\nBugs stood out. Sometimes you were unable to move and unable to go into bonus doors. In addition, having to close out the game via the task manager also got REALLY old, and still was happening the day before launch.","January 15","false","5.3"," 17 of 37 people (46%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","46","17","37","5","1"
