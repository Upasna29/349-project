These guys are trying - and for free - to recreate one of the classic games albeit with its own feel. Give them your support, have a go and see what you think and don't judge it as one of the many abandoned rip offs that are found on Steam. It is free and developed by volunteers who are sticking to their task over many years - review the game as such. It is as strong as the community behind it.\n\nI reported a problem, it was fixed the same day. The game is playable although the UI is a little clunky, but you can build a fully functioning Roman city and it looks the part too. The good news? It's only going to get better because it is open source and that means community development.","November 12, 2015","true","0.7"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","33","37","2","0"

I have missing art, empty message boxes and all kinds of other problems.

Fixing some of the notorious problems of the old game, and adding nice new features (such as the monuments from Pharaoh) would be nice.\n\nDon't bother for now, unless you are an absolute Caesar III fanatic who'd welcome anything.

I fell in love with it. That game had the challenge, the nice atmosphere and aahh THE MUSIC was amazing. That time it was perfect. I am still playing it today.\n\nCreating CaesarIA, however it needs a lot to work on, is a great idea. If I would have the skill the develope games, I would also remake it. So my review will be more understandable for those who played the original game:\n\nPros:\n\n- Nice panel, map and menu.\n- New type of designs of buildings. (The Senate looks great.)\n- Unfortunately that's all I can say for now. But as it is already noted, the game is need more to work on.\n\n\n\nWhat to change (in my opinion):\n\n- The Music. I guess I heard the music in Rome Total War, which is good. I don't know if you have the permission to use the original songs of the game, but for me it was a BIG PLUS. (just listen this it's just AMAZING: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7UL2Dnyf1I  )\n\n- Some of the original buildings look better then the new ones and they give a better picture together. Some buildings' colour looks like it's made by paint.\n\n- Sound effects. They gave life to the city. You really felt like you are in the city life.\n- The terrain, water etc.\n\nI could say more, but I am sure they are working on these So, for the end I'd like to wish great motivation for the developers.

It has rather good graphics, and it isn't even laggy or slow on my less-than-adaquit laptop. I have to say the game itself isn't super time consuming, and you can get a lot of stuff done in about 10 mintues. I did have on issuse however that is still persisting. The game will, at random, shut off and close. I'm not sure if its just because I have played everything the game has so far, or if its an actual bug, but I know that it was a bit annoying. Beyond that though, this is one of the better games in early access right there with Subnautica and Stranded Deep. Though the graphics may not compare to those games, and it is a bit more broken then both of them, its still a rather good early access game for what it is. If you are into city builder games, than this one would be easy for you to love. I don't generally like those types of games, but I will say this one suprised me with how good it actually turned out to be. If I had to give a rating of some kind, I would probably say 3 out of 5. Simply because it actually made me like city builder games, and I never have liked them before. To the creators, if that "randomly turning off" thing is a bug, I'd love you to make that one of the first fixes you make to the game. Just so I can sit about and watch stuff just, happen. Either way, I believe this game is good for what it is.","January 30, 2015","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Infact it's more of a ripoff in the sense that they litterally nik sound and art assests and even missions directly from Caesar III. If it weren't for all the bugs and missing textures you almost wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Is it a bad game? In it's current state, it's better than most. I will admit if you haven't played Caesar you will be a little lost going in, but those like me who loved Caesar III you won't have much trouble getting into it. It plays almost exactly like Caesar III. That being said, if you do have Caesar III I would suggest playing that over this as it's not a buggy mess and you still get the exact same play experience which is mostly why I don't recommend this game at this time. If and when it gets everything smoothed out it might very well be good. As it stands, it's difficult as some of the buildings (like the aquaduct) don't even work, which tends to shoot you in the foot as most of those buildings are rather important, and you can't trade. Sure the empire map comes up but whenever you click on a city all the trade resources are either black squares or just non exsistant and you can't click on them to see what they are like most other things. It's not bad, but I would play the original over this any day.","January 21, 2015","false","0.6"," 59 of 117 people (50%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","50","59","117","10","2"

The game is in an extremely early alpha state with a lot of textures being blacked out because they aren't done yet. You don't really have any control over the people in your town at all. All you can do is build more houses. The gods kept destroying my stuff so I had to build like 10 temples for each god, and then my city caught on fire even though I had tons of presinces. Finally when I had everything sorted out and started building tons of people I had to get to 650 people to win and I was at 600 and suddenly some romans attacked with elephants and started knocking down all my buildings. I went from 600 people to 300 people in a minute.

With the exception of the many bugs, this game plays just like Caesar III did. And those bugs are quickly disappearing, with a number of patches and bug fixes since the games launch.\n\nI would reccomend this game, because I feel that it will absolutely get better and if you played the original and liked it, then you'll get to do so again.

I rarely write reviews, but I felt it was important to lend my support to the development team. Once this game is fleshed out, and honestly all it would take for me is the inclusion of physical representations of all the buildings, it will be excellent. For now it does feel very unfinished, but that does not take away from my enjoyment of the game. Of course this is because I played the original and already know what to do.

While this game is still in beta, I found that the relaxing, educational vibe of the game was quite polished and with time I'm sure it will grow even further. Something I noticed a lot in the negative reviews was how cryptic the game is, but honestly I found that to be part of the challenge. The game isn't impossibly cryptic, but it can be a little difficult to pick up without previous experience in RTS. One of my only gripes with the game is the console commands that will appear on screen from time to time, though I'm sure those will be refined or edited out in the finished product. Overall, I see a lot of potential for this game, and as a diehard hardcore gamer, it is refreshing to play a more casual title that can still bring the heat.","April 4, 2015","true","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The ai people that are suppose to put fires out dont seam to do anything and my town went up in flames even tho i had about 5-6 of the anti fire people.

I desprately want to like it, and it has amazing potential to become an exetremelly adicting game. However there are far to many problems with the game in it's current state that mean I would not reccomend this game to someone else.\n\nWhat's wrong with it?:\n- As mentioned by other reviews, some dialogue boxes are not working correctly. Obviously most are, however the ones that aren't are blaringly obvious.\n\n-At first launch the game launched at a strange resolution-which would not be a problem however upon closing the game the process does not seem to close properly meaning it's impossible to restart the game without shutting down steam or finding the process.\n\n- fire spread and building colapse does not seem to work properly, no matter how many of the necessary buildings I put down everything falls to bits.\n\n\nAs I said this game could be amazing, and I think it will be as long as the devs keep updating it.","April 2, 2015","false","8.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Its a crude "remake" I use that term loosely because you flat out have to have Caeser 3 since it uses the assets from that game. I found that a number of features didn't work, as is to be expected of early access, but bewilderingly there isn't a ton you can actually do. I couldn't get the sandbox mode to work for the life of me and for some reason or another the tutorial campaign just stops updating half way through the second map. I supposed they've updated this by now but all I gleamed was the sort of remake that doesn't remake or improves. Its just Caeser 3 with widescreen and all of the functionality scrapped.\n\nI'm aware the game is being made from custom assets from sourceforge but that is going to take months, even a year or more to get the game to an acceptable level. I'd be fine with this but I can install a mod for Caeser 3 that allows it to play in widescreen, and it looks and plays great. I have no reason to play this especially right now, but I can understand why people would want to help out.\n\nIts worth a try if you're interested in projects like these, just don't expect a working game, otherwise just play Caeser 3.","June 25, 2015","false","1.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I immediately hit the dl button, regardless that it's still in early access. I just wanted that feeling of those old builder games again.\n\nKeeping in mind that the game is still in early beta and having read that some of the textures were still not rendered yet so shapes would be black, I expected that and had no issue with it. The footprint still places properly and the buildings do their function IE graneries still store grain, etc.\n\nI have played games like AoE, Pharaoh etc exhaustively. I'm well aware of the bean counter aspect of the game.  Setting up engineers so they walk by the appropriate  places so they don't fall down, market sellers walking past households to distribute goods . . . . these only seemed to work if they were really close to the houses/buildings that they are built near. I constantly had fires, plagues, building collapse within my city and not very far from the site of one of the above buildings. I had set the priorities in the senate so that the workers would fill water distribution, engineering and food jobs first and then the others after.\n\nEnemy troops show up far too fast to be able to build a barrack, train soldiers, equip them, etc. The Emperer gets upset very quickly it seems. While I realise that there's still a ton of coding to be done, it would be nice if Rome would give me a break once in a while and the barbarians turn a blind eye occasionally to the fact that I don't have enough food to feed folks let alone for them to loot me.\n\nA open sandbox level without any aggressors would be an awesome addition to this game in addition to the tutorial. There, people could pratice setting up markets versus housing units versus water versus doctors and work out the bugs in their own personal gameplay style before trying to take on a campaign where barbarians show up in the first 20 minutes and wipe out your entire town and you have to start all over again just to have it repeatedly occur.\n\nKeep up the good work, folks!

From my understanding, the developer is trying to reverse engineer the Caesar 3 game. This potentially could lead to classic gameplay being extended infinitely with use of the steam workshop. However, the current iteration of the game is very far off from a lofty goal like that. Many hurdles both mechanically and graphically remain. This game was released on Jan 20, 2015 and currently has had 20 updates. This does show the game is being worked on, but many should remember Space Base where development can suddenly stop and be abandoned.\n\nPrevious Review:\nThis is basically a remake of Caesar III but with several downgrades. The buildings look like they are from 1980 graphics, building spaces are based on a 2x2 area like In Zeus or Emperor and not like the 1x1 square system in Caesar and Pharoah, even roads take up a 2x2 area. The developers did not fix the walker issues that were present in C3 and Pha despite this issue being somewhat resolved in the later games. The first two levels seems almost a complete remake of C3's campaign. The store page says that it's inspired by C3, but what it appears to be is a complete rip of the original game with no new additions other than low quality graphics. I would highly avoid wasting time with this game and go back to basics with the Fantasic Four: Caesar III, Pharaoh, Zeus, Emperor.","October 3, 2015","false","0.3"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","10"

However it's graphically worse than the original - 17 years on.  It doesn't take on board many of the innovations of games from later in the series (Zeus, Pharoah, Middle Kingdom etc).  In essence it is not, at least currently, an improvement on Caesar III.  In fact it feels like a step backwards.  My advice to anyone with fond memories of classical city building games is to pick up a copy of Zeus master of Olympus,  as a game it plays better, sounds better and looks better than CasearIA, perhaps given time they'll make this a worthy improvement, after all Rome wasn't built in a day.....","April 3, 2015","false","1.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

The game is a"remake"  of a much older game called Caesar III (I have never played the original).  Caesaria Looks and feels old, but it a a pretty decent strategy/ sim game, so far as I can tell from the few hours I have decided to play it. There are some bugs, and the game doesn't feel quite finished yet but the gameplay is there, and its free.\n\nI foresee Caesar putting of new players. The game obviously has an older look, but also I think it might be complicated for someone new to he genre. Heck I have played a lot of sim and strategy games and I was still lost at first! I think if your really interested in the game though, that you will come to like it. I recommend it to fans of sim and strategy games (obviously) but its good to see a good free to play economic/ city management type strategy game out there, its just not something I think you see often!","January 22, 2015","true","3.2"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

This version is quite a lot like Pharaoh and perfect for the times I'm after something slower-paced and more easy going.\n\nThere are some nuicance bugs though. One is pointed from the start that some of the tiles are black because they're still being made, or something of the sort.\n- Another is that sometimes the drag-build randomly stops working and I have to place each object one click at a time.\n- The 'clear' tool sometimes won't work until I right-click.\n- The text is very messy. There are bits of code throughout the instructions and information.\n\nUnfortunately though I like the game and will keep playing, I can't recommend it. That something is free is no reason to forgive its faults. A freebie is a demonstration of the creator's abilities and what the creator is demonstrating here is that they are not up to the task.","February 11, 2015","false","0.7"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

I can understand what to do and how things work, but im guessing for someone new it will be hard to get into the game and enjoy it. The biggest problem is that most buildings are blacked out with no graphics, and some doesnt even have the blackened texture so it's invisible buildings. Really hard to keep track of those. Other than that it seems to function roughly as it should, but theres alot of work left to be done.\n\nFor anyone who played caesar games before: You could probably enjoy it for roughly an hour as is now.\nFor anyone new to caesar games: You would probably do best by waiting for future versions before trying.","January 22, 2015","true","1.5"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Many of the game messages are still unfinished strings which mean things happen but then you can't learn what you are supposed to do about them, or it says to add something but you aren't able to see what. Also, there are black textures all over the place, which are things the developers have not finished texturing yet. This is all well and good, but half the items that you are supposed to build in the tutorial are not textured. In the second level, I was supposed to connect Aqueducts to Water Resevoirs, but the Resevoirs were untextured so I could not see how to proceed.\n\nOverall, I would check out this game in the future, but there is no reason to play it right now. It is completely pointless at this time as you can't even get a feel for the core gameplay and mechanics due to lack of completion of so many parts. I do have hopes for this game though because there could be promise in the future.","February 8, 2015","false","0.7"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","4","0","0"

I was surprised to see there "Român" and I can't wait to see the Romanian translation a.s.a.p. If I may help you with the translating, contact me... but anyways, back to the subject. I started a new game and started a new city. I like this kind of games where you make your empire/city by yourself, like RoN or Banished. I understand it's an early access, and from what I've played, even though I've experienced a few bugs, I can say that I really like it, and I stronlgy recommend it for anyone who likes this kind of strategy and city  building/simulator games. Here are pros and cons of the game:\nPros:\n- A nice and polished game interface\n- Fairly easy gameplay\n- Lots and lots of Fun\n- A pretty "Gods" system\n- Real Roman buildings and nice graphics\n- You get to choose your name :D\nCons:\nBefore anything, I understand it's an Early Access, so don't criticize me for talking about bugs or that kind of stuff.\n- The screen rotation is a little bit buggy\n- When you scroll up, you zoom away and when you scroll down, you zoom in. I'd think it should be viceversa.\n- Clearing trees, stones, ruins and buildings takes too short and is too easy. It should last like a few secconds at least.\n- No resource system, you build everything using money.\nI still recommend this game hardly to everyone.\nKeep going on with the game, I can't wait to see it done!","January 28, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I managed to just barely get the cursor over the right menu to re-adjust the screen resolution / fullscreen but it required a restart of the game to adjust screen Resolution.    While I was trying to adjust things my settlement was destroyed by an invading army.\n\nWhen I got to the second level I built a series of houses and Immigrants were coming down the road but they didn't stop they just walked right off the screen.. I couldn't get my market to sell excess goods to generate funds and when I put taxes into effect I went into negative funds.\n\nAs of this patch I think the game has potential but it's not ready for people wanting an imersive experience.","January 28, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm also waiting for a multiscreen Android release - the version I found a few weeks ago seems only good for tablets, I cannot see the entire window on my Samsung Galaxy S Advance, that's also yet to be solved.

I was surprised to see there "Român" and I can't wait to see the Romanian translation a.s.a.p. If I may help you with the translating, contact me... but anyways, back to the subject. I started a new game and started a new city. I like this kind of games where you make your empire/city by yourself, like RoN or Banished. I understand it's an early access, and from what I've played, even though I've experienced a few bugs, I can say that I really like it, and I stronlgy recommend it for anyone who likes this kind of strategy and city  building/simulator games. Here are pros and cons of the game:\nPros:\n- A nice and polished game interface\n- Fairly easy gameplay\n- Lots and lots of Fun\n- A pretty "Gods" system\n- Real Roman buildings and nice graphics\n- You get to choose your name :D\nCons:\nBefore anything, I understand it's an Early Access, so don't criticize me for talking about bugs or that kind of stuff.\n- The screen rotation is a little bit buggy\n- When you scroll up, you zoom away and when you scroll down, you zoom in. I'd think it should be viceversa.\n- Clearing trees, stones, ruins and buildings takes too short and is too easy. It should last like a few secconds at least.\n- No resource system, you build everything using money.\nI still recommend this game hardly to everyone.\nKeep going on with the game, I can't wait to see it done!","January 28, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I managed to just barely get the cursor over the right menu to re-adjust the screen resolution / fullscreen but it required a restart of the game to adjust screen Resolution.    While I was trying to adjust things my settlement was destroyed by an invading army.\n\nWhen I got to the second level I built a series of houses and Immigrants were coming down the road but they didn't stop they just walked right off the screen.. I couldn't get my market to sell excess goods to generate funds and when I put taxes into effect I went into negative funds.\n\nAs of this patch I think the game has potential but it's not ready for people wanting an imersive experience.","January 28, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
