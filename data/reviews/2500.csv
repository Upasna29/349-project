A game that's easy to recommend.\n\nThe weapon variety is excellent!\nThe pacing of the weapons being given to the player is great. If you explore each map really well you can find some of them before you would find them in later levels. On top of the steady stream of weapons, they all have multiple upgrades that can be used on the gun at the same time. (I only make note "at the same time" because Alien Breed only allowed one upgrade on a weapon at a time) These upgrades make a difference in how you use the weapons. For instance one has a short range tazer you can use to stun an enemy then switch to a harder hitting weapon to get the kill.\n\nThe enemy variety is fantastic!\nThe pace at which different enemies are introduced to the player keeps you on your toes and adds a layer of tactics.\n\nThe story is servicable. It gets you from point A to point B.\n\nThis game doesn't innovate or do anything unique, but that's not a detriment!\nIt is what it is, and does what it does very well in the box it's in.\n\nNote: Keyboard and mouse is the only way to play this, but the KB/M controls work great.\nThis game is not playable with a controller, even with JoyToKey.\nIt apparently has some partially implemented controller support, not listed on the store page, that only gets in the way of trying to use J2K and is not functional on its own via the in game options to be able to play well.

I played this game 'round 5 hours, killed first boss (2 lvls finished) and so what I got about it:\n\nWhat's good:\nFree Camera. It's really comfortable. If you turn it on, of course\n\nGameplay. So it's good and not so good meanwhile. About bad sides of that I'll tell later, but right now: it's not complicated too much and it's easy enough. You are not needed to pick "right weapon" to kill special enemy, Kill 'em with any thing you like ;-)\n\nNot too complicated plot. On first view, it's a real bad, but if you'll look at the game like Alien Shooter clone, so that's enough =)\n\nCooperative 4 4-person. Unfortunately, only on one PC, as I got (but I didn't tried it out 'cause I got no joystick) But it looks like we'd have extra characters and it'd be not too bad.\n\nFans of DOOM, who are tried of playing the same campaign time by time, would like it, I think. It's really close to third one especially.\n\nOf course, quality. Game was made fulfilled with love of dev-s. I found no bugs and have no any claims to it.\n\nAll in all, this game gives us opportunity to stress out and kill everything with unstoppable shotgun. That's cool. What's not too hot:\nLack of original ideas. The only thing that differs the game from DOOM 3 is another POV and weapons upgrades. That's all. In other aspects it's just a clone of DOOM 3 with plot that's not better.\n\nVoice Actors. By the way, the only thing I don't like is guys who were responsible for characters sounding. Actors are not too emotioinal and I don't believe them. Yea, of course, I said that game doesn't need us to go deep into plot, but if you've hired some people to voice game persons, you'd better control them to make it good.\n\nGraphics. You know, I'm not a kind of person who would be rebel because of graphics, but there are individs who would. So, the game was released in 2005. If you're to buy it, make sure to get over it.[/olist]\nTo sum up , the game is qualitative fusion of Alien Shooter and DOOM 3. Personally I, the person who didn't appreciate neither of them, liked this game. It has some plot to move us through locations and some features to make game a little more interesting. I enjoyed first two levels and hope some day I'll play SG: Survivor, cause It's interesting what differs that game from this. If you ask me, buy it or not, I'd say: You know, if you're looking for some mayhem-game, but not too crazy, take it. If you're looking for some good-made DOOM 3 clone, take this. Choose yourself :)\n\nIf I were needed to estimate it, I'd give a grade around 8/10 ajsuted for age or 6.5/10 for today. Have a nice day, pals :-)","January 5, 2015","true","11.5"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

I've only beaten the first two chapters and really enjoyed them. The top down camera angle that only lets you see forward is awkward at first, but once you get into the game, it keeps you checking behind you constantly. Especially when going through unlit areas with a limited duration flashlight.\n\nThe upgrades you can get for guns feels pretty good too. I dont really like using shotguns or machine guns, so I upgraded my pistol and now it outdamages both. While it might not work out so well later in the game, it kept the things I enjoyed alive in the game longer.\n\nI cant say I'd play this game over Payday2 or Killing Floor, but it's oh so worth the price if you get it on sale. Think of it like when you see those arcade machines that take 75 cents. Other than you get to take it home with you and play it whenever you want.

You run around a number of linear locations stopping every few rooms to fight off a throng of aliens looking to bite your face off. It is all a little too familiar and unfortunately it becomes tiresome rather quickly.\n\nThe gameplay is very much just that, you run around, shoot aliens, pick up ammo and health and occasionally upgrade your weapons. It's all very generic and something we have seen too many times before.\n\nWhere Shadowgrounds tries to stand apart from the rest is through the use of atmospheric lighting, or to say it in layman's terms, the game is very dark. At times it's completely pitch black on your screen except for the small cone from your flashlight. It's a fairly well executed feature but being a top down shooter you never really feel those horror elements that the game is trying to provoke.\n\nThe soundtrack does it's best to add to the scary mood but ultimately cannot overcome the game's basic design problems.\n\nIn the end, Shadowgrounds is a tired game in a tired genre, although it tries to do something new with the horror elements it never really hits home and you'll find yourself with just another mediocre top down shooter that's all about pumping massive hordes of alien invaders full of lead.","January 5, 2013","false","20.5"," 27 of 44 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","27","44","0","7"

But it still gets the job done.\n\nEven though the engine behind it shows its age nowadays, Shadowgrounds offers passable visuals with slick lighting and shadow effects, a setting and a threat that's clearly inspired by the 80's sci-fi classic Aliens (which is always a good thing in my book) and most importantly, enjoyable (if mostly repetitive) top-down action that's backed up with responsive controls and relevant mechanics to keep it interesting (i.e., rolling and the weapon upgrades).\n\nOn the con side, the story is a cliched one and it is presented through uninspired cutscenes with half-hearted voice acting. It only serves as a backbone for introducing challenges and an excuse for killing stuff. Albeit mostly boring, it comes with a nice twist in the end that I enjoyed.\n\nEven though not as polished as one might think by looking at the screenshots, Shadowgrounds is a justifiable purchase on a budget price. It's a fine little time-waster that evokes the nostalgia of the classic top-down shooters of the bygone days. Just don't get your hopes that high up and enjoy your relaxed six-hour ride.","April 28, 2014","true","7.5"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

The first boss fight was pretty tough, if fairly repetitive (he has a pattern of attack you need to learn and dance around). They give you up to 4 respawns if you die and the boss' health does not regenerate, but those extra lives are imo more than balanced by the fact that you can't get any more ammo on a respawn (unless you backtrack trying to look for it, I guess). This was also on Medium difficulty, so I would expect Hard to give fewer attempts.\n\nThe game's supply of med kits and ammo has been fairly reasonable up to this point. It would likely have been more tense and thereby more thrilling on Medium difficulty if I'd had a couple fewer med kits and a bit less ammo, but I'm guessing playing on Hard would fix that. I do plan on finishing the game on Medium and if the rest of the game feels as good as the first hour I'll probably replay it on Hard. Btw at first it seems like you're getting way too much rifle ammo, stacking up over 500 at times, but you really do burn through it quick. And you might want to save as much ammo as possible for the boss fight.\n\nGot this game as part of a discounted Frostbite bundle along with Trine and so far both games have been very enjoyable, in different ways. Kudos to Frostbite for making such distinct games that are almost polar opposites yet both styles are very solid (one a tense, atmospheric shooter and the other a relaxing, beautiful platformer).\n\nPricing is a highly subjective matter, I think, especially on older titles like this, but if the price agrees with you and/or you find it on sale and you think you might like an oldschool shooter with a dark atmosphere and an isometric perspective, then yeah I'd highly recommend giving this game a try.\n\nTurn off the light, put on some headphones, crank up the in-game music, and I think you'll have a good time shooting some creepy crawlies.\n\n\nUpdate: Aaaaanddd it didn't freaking save my game from my last playthrough.. awesome..\nAlso there's apaprently no quick save function.. so I'm not exactly sure how you do save your progress.. I'd read it's supposed to save when you complete a level, but I played for just over an hour a few days ago, even beat the first boss, and it didn't save any of it.

It's presented in a top down format, rather than as a FPS. The graphics are not world class, but do the job nicely. Likewise the story is certainly cliche - a space outpost is overrun by murderous aliens with a few survivors left to fight back and get out alive - but it is presented in a nice way and kept me entertained.\n\nI would recommend using a game controller with this game. For me that worked great vs. a bit of frustration with keyboard and mouse.\n\nI found the game to be slightly challenging without becoming frustrating. Each level gives you four respawns which reset for each new level. If/when you die you respawn a short distance from where you died and the level is exactly as when you died. In other words, any enemies you nerfed are still dead, etc. If you use up all your respawns (I assume) you must restart the level. There is no saving during a level, so you must either complete the current level or if you need to close the program you'll be forced to restart at the beginning. Due to this, my playtime is padded as I left the game running in the background a few times when I needed to step away.\n\nThere is a decent amount of variety in that there are about a dozen weapons to find and use and various upgrades to buy for each weapon. You won't have enough upgrade points to max out every weapon, so some thought needs to be used in deciding which to buy.\n\nThe enemies come in about six or seven different types which most of those types having several toughness levels. Throw in a few boss fights over the course of the game and it maintains interest over the half dozen or so hours it takes to run through.\n\nIf you can pick this up for a buck or two, I would go for it.

I highly recommend this game as an A+ game.","October 18, 2014","true","4.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's their first game, and although it has some weak points, they got the job reasonably well done.\nHave only played through the first levels, so this will be a short one. Shadowgrounds is a 3rd person shooter played from an isometric camera angle. The story is nothing special, even boring, and the voice-acting is terrible. Graphics are ok, considered its age, but they could have been a bit less dull. The main focus is on the gameplay, which is a blast - literally: you have to blast your way through tons of enemies in fast-paced action. Really, there is not much more to it. Ok, there are weapon upgrade parts to be found which add to the fun, and give your weapons the much needed extra punch. But basically, this is a shoot-them-all.\nSomehow, Shadowgrounds got my attention by its atmosphere, and that is why it gets a positive recommendation. The atmospere can be quite frightening, with good light effects - those shadows of the spiderlings in my flaslights did give me the creeps. But in the end, the gameplay gets boring by its repetiveness, yes, even after a couple of hours. Happily, this one gets huge sales now and then, so wait for those moments to pick it up - and the cards it comes with.\n\nGameplay: 16/30\nGraphics: 11/20\nSound/music: 5/10 (metal does suit this kind of game!)\nLongelivety: 4/10\nTechnical: 13/20 (resolution is stangely limited to 1600*1200)\nPersonal appreciation: 5/10\n\nOverall: 54/100\n\n50-60/100: a decent game, but nothing more than that - get it in sales only","July 27, 2014","true","1.7"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

The intro starts off wich seems to be the setting for your basic military experiment/conspiracy, which even though it has written low budget all over it, it still kind of sets the games premises on pretty good.\n\nThe menu is looking ok as well and the background always keeps it a bit interesting and makes you hope something is going to happen . The first thing you will notice is that it DOES NOT have a save option.Yes, in this game you cannot save. You just have a couple of lives/respawns after wich it is game over. Like in the good old PlayStation Arcade games. This may put off a lot of people because the game can be surprisingly hard at some points, but for people like me it is a welcoming challenge.\n\nFor all the others, well at least there is a save progress at the start of each level at least.\n\nThe story starts off with the hero (Tyler) , a former military , current mechanic guy , beeng sent to fix some random generators with his buddies. The starting tone was very creepy and reminded me of a Dead Space atmosphere, which was great to notice, considering that this game is definetly not a triple A title. You fix the generators and notice that all the sudden there are bodies and blood everywhere,and surprisingly enough there is an alien invasion on your planet. You meet the army and start cleaning up. While not the most original type of story (has Doom 3) written all over it, the story holds up surprisingly well.\n\nMoving on to the characters. All of them, including Tyler, seem very under developed. The game tries to tell you something at the start to make you care,but it just fails to deliver or generally fails at the character development section.\n\nGraphic wise, everything seems decent, even though most of the graphics seem a bit washed up,even for a top down shooter. The details to the terrain/rooms are quite astonishing at some points. Overall the graphic,while not impressive in any way,does its job, just because of the attention to detail.The character models look just really low budget and plain dumb. The graphics type for the characters is really low quality compared to the overall graphics of the game.\n\nMusic and sound FX. These just do their job but nothing more. No memorable music here and the SFX just blend in with the atmosphere. Some sound FX reminded me of the first Unreal game for some reason.\n\nThe enemies, are your generic alien types and all are very annoying because they can just randomly appear in front of you and outnumber you directly. Their attack types get some time to get used to,and you do need some patience with each. You cannot just rush everything because you will die extremely fast.\n\nGameplay and atmosphere. The game tries a dark and gritty atmosphere that initially delivers very well but it is just lost along the way. The flashlight object shadowing mechanic is very cool to look at but it gets old too quick. Overall the atmosphere is fairly decent, the game does tempt you to go back and finish it.\n\nRegarding gameplay only. It is quite satisfying to roll over large amounts of aliens but there are several points when it just feels unpolished. You need to do a lot of barrel rolling to avoid instant kill and you need to be aware of your environment all the time because if you hit a wall or an object,the character fails to respond quickly enough,and this causes a delay in movement,delay which will most of the time get you killed. This “stuck syndrome” is met in a large number of times,and really brings the game down as especially in the outdoor environments, you can get stuck a lot in the terrain because there are invisible walls in the middle of the map or the terrain was intended to be unpassable but on the map it looks just normal walking terrain. The gameplay overall feels initially good but gets repetitive and feels too hard at some points.\n\nThe weapons to me were very disappointing. While the game does have some sort of upgrade system to keep things interesting, I found myself way too many times using the standard pistol with unlimited ammo because everything else has very scarce ammo. Speaking of weapons, most of them seem very ineffective to the aliens. You waste an entire magazine on one enemy at times. Now this beeing good or bad,it is debateble. It does add a survival element to the game, but this element feels like it just happen to be in the game. Does not seem an intended behaivour. The ammo supplies are low, the weapons are largely ineffective and the only thing that keeps this aspect up is the upgrade system,which turns like a chore fast. It’s does not feel crucial on what type of upgrades you need to take.\nThroughout the game you get upgrade parts to upgarde the weapons, which is a bit refreshing but again,gets old fast and also you find several computer terminals that fill in on the back story.\n\nAfter managing to finish the game, I realized that the atmospheric music was much better than what it was initially and also what seemed to be a generic military/alien invasion had quite an interesting twist in the end. The story seemed stale throught the game but the ending was really weird to witness. Also with the right upgrades,the weapons DO seem to deliver some punch ,but for me it was still a bit of a disappointment.\n\nI will recommend this game to fans of the genre and even to people that just want something new. Be advised, that the game is good but it is definetely not great, it does have the weight of a budget title all over it, but in the end it manages to deliver.","September 10, 2014","true","8.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Overall, it's fun, which is the point, and why I clicked the Recommend button, but there are some flaws that detract from the amount of fun I could be having.\n\nFirst, the graphics. They may seem slightly dated, but that isn't the issue. The biggest problem is the lack of options. My screen is 16:9, but the screen seems to display in something like 2.33:1, so everything is squished. Another problem is the lack of antialiasing, and while this might not be as noticeable if I could set the graphics to my screen's native resolution, the two problems combined really take away from the immersion.\n\nSecond, the controls. I've tried both keyboard/mouse and a 360 controller, the latter of which seems like the better option for an isometric shooter. The default values are difficult to use at best. Why are the triggers used for rotating the camera instead of firing weapons? And why is the camera so overly touchy? When I switched to the KB/mouse combo, the WASD setup was fine for most things, but camera rotation became such an issue that I simply avoided it.\n\nI could make the writing and voice acting the third issue, and for some it may be problematic. I am a lover of B flicks however, so I didn't buy this game expecting a deep, rich story, or Hollywood A-list acting. While the script is predictable and the acting wooden, I could easily look past this and enjoy the game if it wasn't for the other flaws. (I've seen and loved almost every episode of MST3K, and if you know what that means, you'll understand.)\n\nThe one thing I have yet to check out is the main reason I bought it: co-op. Alas, if I can't sort out the issues with the controls, I don't know if I will bother. What I wanted was a PC version of Dead Nation, the brilliant PSN co-op zombie shooter. What I got was something less polished, and ultimately, less fun.\n\nSo why recommend it? Overall, it is somewhat fun, so if you get it on sale, go for it. There is some atmostphere about it, and some nice mechanics, including the weapon upgrade system--though this too lacks depth. Kill a critter and get some magic "upgrades"? How does that work exactly? This aside, and if you can look past the other flaws, it might be a nice way to waste some time.\n\nStay tuned for my review of the spin-off/sequel, Shadowgrounds Survivors, where I'm hoping that some of the issues listed above have been fixed. First, I need to finish this game.\n\nGraphics: 6/10\nAudio: 7/10\nGameplay: 8/10\nReplayability: 8/10\n\nOverall: 7/10","November 22, 2014","true","1.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I bought it here on a Steam sale just so I would have a copy that didn't involve digging through, um, shelves and shelves of game boxes. Yeah. Uh, that's not embarrassing or anything. Anyway.\n\nWhen you describe it as an Alien-esque top down shooter where you defend against waves of attackers, it sounds very retro, but the graphics and lighting (even now) are pretty cool, and it really comes across as a sort of first person-y experience. Sort of. It's hard to describe--probably easier to just watch a video. Anyway, the lighting makes it scary even in spite of the way you're usually distanced from the character in a top-down game.\n\nI always liked this game just a little bit better than the sequel Survivor, because it has more style and a tighter story. Survivor depends too much on battles where you have to defend one location against wave after wave of attackers. Maybe it's supposed to be a "challenge", but to me it always feels more like "padding." :)\n\nIt's fun and well worth the low price they're asking these days.

Where it really seems to shine is the lighting, destructables, and atmosphere, which almost made scared. Until I realized I wasn't in any actual danger. The game likes to hide things here and there, but is kind enough to put a large box around it. Sometimes there is an environmental puzzle to figure out first. The plot is...there, I guess. The game tries to take itself seriously, which doesn't work, so it can be ignored safely.

At times it feels like the game is trying to push into the horror market but falls dreary short. What this game does is provide a good few bloody hours of shooting hordes of zombies. If that's what you're looking for then I don't think you'd be too let down by this title.

The aliens here are in reality something that was in the soil. An lifeform that reminds on insectoids, with a variety of forms.

A unique atmosphere, a simple, yet exciting sci-fi plot, a retro arcade gameplay, long and challenging levels, with lives instead of checkpoints, and a nice weapon-upgrading system.\n\nBut the best thing about Shadowgrounds - and this is probably what made me fall in love with it so much - is the soundtrack. Ari Pulkkinen proves he can master the Electro-Metal with a diabolical perfection, and offers one of the best OST I've heard in my gaming life.\n\nA Must-have!

(That being said, PLEASE do not say my review was unhelpful unless you are, in fact, a Mac user as I simply wish to warn my fellow OS users.)\n\nFirst, let me say I enjoyed what I was able to play of this game.  Its very simple, the voice acting is horrendous, but the gameplay is fairly fun, albeit simple.  I got it for very cheap off of humble bundle so no complaints.  For $0.69 it was totally worth it I'd say.\n\nNow, if you have a mac, DO NOT BUY.  This game is broken on Macs.  Once I got to the 3rd or 4th (can't remember) chapter, the framerate dropped to maybe like 12 frames per minute.  Yes. Per MINUTE.  It was unplayable.  I thought, perhaps my laptop is just experiencing difficulties.  I restarted and retried.  I will now add that this game only autosaves once you complete a chapter and some of the chapters begin taking 1+ hours to beat.  I had to restart the chapter I was on, but it was ok at the time.  However, at roughly the same amount of time into said chapter, I encountered the same problem.\n\nI was ♥♥♥♥♥♥.  I contacted the devs as well as searched forums.  Turns out this is a VERY common problem on macs.  Frozenbyte basically said, "oh yeah we know about it but we don't know what causes it but hopefully our new games won't have the same problem."  Great load of help, that.\n\nAnyway, I'm sick of developers apparently not even hardly testing their product before releasing to Mac.  Currently, it is fraud that they are selling this game for mac, as it DOES NOT WORK.\n\nTL;DR:  If you want a simple isometric shooter, with voice acting on par with an arcade game, go for it. UNLESS you have a Mac in which case beware that this game probably will be unplayable for you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/perryibanez/recommended/2500/","perryibanez","PerryIbanez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/perryibanez/","91 products in account","I saw this game on sale and thought it looked similar to Alien Swarm (which has provided me with countless hours of entertainment) so I purchased this. At first I didn't like the feel of the controls and was starting to think it was a waste of money. I perservered and plowed on with the campaign. Before I knew it I was completely immersed into the story line and had come to terms with the controls. I think the initial dislike was the fact that the first Aliens you encounter are probably the hardest to shoot out of everything else in the game.\n\nThe story line was engaging enough for my liking but was somewhat predictable and recycled sci fi adventure themes resounded throughout. There were some extremely well made parts of the game that surprised me and brought a huge smile to my face. (The part where you fight loads of Aliens inside the Rave music room is EPIC. Loved the fact when outside of the main room you could hear the music muffled in the background. Very atmospheric.) The soundtrack was absolutely awesome. The dialogue in some sections between characters was a little forced and unnatural but they couldn't just stand in silence I guess.\n\nIt took me just a little over 8 hours to complete the entire campaign and I enjoyed every moment of it. Definitely worth a buy! I did however encounter a bug on 1 chapter which was literally right at the end of said chapter causing me to have to restart that particular chapter which irritated me somewhat. It was after prepping the space ship and the automated defense robots activate and come after you. I was on around 11hp after some poor combat vs the big ♥♥♥♥ers with forcefields and guns for hands. This caused me to die despite my best efforts vs the 2 automated defense robots and when I revived I was stuck behind the 2 blast doors you needed a key card for. This meant I could not get in to kill the robots and complete the chapter. Other than that it was a solid play and hugely enjoyable.","March 5, 2014","true","8.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is hilarious. Graphics suck really bad too. It is terribly generic and boring.\n\nFortunately there is no reason to talk about any more specifics of the game because of one game breaking flaw. The game might as well be unplayable because of it: invisible enemies that do heavy unavoidable damage to you. The only way you can uncover them is to continuously fire when you hear their noise, but even if I do and kill one and the sound the monster makes stops, I get ♥♥♥♥♥ by a silent second one for major unavoidable damage. No matter what hits you in the game you take major dmg and your life is constantly dropping like it is falling on a broken elevator plummeting to the ground, killing all the people on board and killing this game dead. I consider it a mercy killing. The faster I got to the uninstall button the ♥♥♥♥ing happier I was. So that is a huge game flaw. You get 5 respawns but it doesn't matter even if you have 500 respawns when your life bar falls quicker than a fat guy's self restraint in a icecream shop. Out of "respawns"? You get to start the ENTIRE long, boring, vomit-like muddy-graphic having level over. Even without these what I consider game breaking flaws, the game is incredibly generic. Much better similar titles exist, stay far away from this.\n\n3/10. Rather than play this anymore, I would rather eat out a dead gay guy's ♥♥♥ hole after he just finished having unprotected sex and his boyfriend didn't pull out then he died. Dead gay guy's a-hole glazed in man juice = better than this trash of a game.

If you Liked gams like Alien Shooter, Zombie Shooter and the like. You will like this game and if you didn't well you might still like this game. It's fun. The game is you standard dop down affair.. well not quite top down but close enough to it.\n\nTHE GOOD\nThe graphics are dated the animation is stiff but in the way that makes you chuckle. Otherwise, it's crisp. You will know what to shoot, you'll know what not to shoot and the differences will be immediately apparent at a glance. WHich is good because when things get busy in this game they can get busy.\n\nWhich will make you thankful for the responsive controls. Very little lag between the input and the action.\n\nThe sound is there and nothing special, same for the music but the amiance of the game itself and the lighting effects reallyt do add just a bit of tension to what would otherwise be a run of the mill shooter.\n\nThe Bad\nThe difficulty curve can be a little steep and not all the weapons you get are particularly useful. That say. Game is plenty fun. Only real complaint is that it does seem to drago on just a bit longer than it should have. WOuld have been just as good with 5 fewer missions.\n\nConclusion\nFun game is Gun.

Rather simple, but it's working. Needs no hour-long tutorials. Drop in, shoot stuff. Very few keys, easy to control. A game reduced to proven core features. You know what you get. A nice and fun no-brainer in times where other games sometimes tend to be overly ambitious or blown up with features no one ever needed or asked for.\n+ Nicely varied levels with thoughtful assets\n+ A pretty nice ambiance\n+ Some nice music tunes\n\n~ Story isn't the most original one, but solid enough\n~ Graphics and physics aren't fantastic, but solid enough (nice lighting though, your flashlight is generating nice light breaks and shadows and all)\n~ Many guns offering versatility. But in the heat of battle I found it difficult to find the weapon best suited for the situation. You have 8 or so towards the end. You press number buttons or use the mouse wheel to switch around. But you cannot reassign the guns from what I've seen, so you may switch around more during battle than you would want to. But the game, while having a few tense moments even on "Easy" difficulty, overall isn't too difficult, so no big harm I guess.\n\n- Characters are either somewhat bland or cheesy\n- Voice acting probably could have been better, at least for some characters. I've heard far worse though.\n- A few sloppy level design parts I noticed, where I could walk into rock formations in the surrounding area I shouldn't have been able to walk into. My character clipped through them, I could only see his head through the pile of sand and stone. Most players will never stray that far off from the main route, I guess, but if you give people the possibilty to roam around I suppose you should test these areas to not have such flaws, especially since this isn't something on the scale of an Elder Scrolls or Armed Assault game. Luckily I never got stuck there or anything.\n- Mission design has a few logic flaws too. In some levels you can access some areas before being told so mission-wise. This may trigger events, like new enemy types getting stalking-like appearances on you, which should have been spared for when you were really meant to go there. One level I was able to finish without even doing all the objectives I was told to do. Going into detail may spoil it, perhaps the devs intended to give some freedom there as that specific level was still logically working without all the objectives done, but I tend more to believe that this was unintended and therefore a bit of a sloppy design too.","June 25, 2014","true","8.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Yes the controls are smooth, the graphic ok (for the time) and it's well executed in general, but there're too many bad things:\n1)you can't counter enemies; in many other games, enemies have weak points you can shoot or use to ease the combat, or at least they have attack patterns to let you avoid some damage, in this game enemies give you no chanche to survive, you can't avoid attack in any way, and you have to expose yourself to attack them.\n2)not enought ammo; powerful ammos are never enought and you'll run out of ammo shortly, leaving you fighting 4-meters-tall monsters with bouble machine gun with a pistol or a shotgun (if you're lucky)\n3)enemies coming from nowhere; the game gives you the feeling that if you clean up a room it will stay clear so most of the time so don't care too much about your shoulders, but sometimes enemies appear behind you and you'll find yourself sorrounded and with your health-bar drained even before you realize what happened. I said "appear" on purpose, since i constntly check the radar for enemy movements and they never showed on in.\n\nso, to sum up, good gameplay bad mechanics, it will become frustrating in no time.","February 26","false","5.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Shoot thousands of giant bugs and cyborg spiders with a multitude of different weapons.\n\nHumanity has successfully terraformed Ganymede, and there is a burgeoning scientific and military presence establishing a foothold here.  But when the power generator is mysteriously sent offline, the mechanic Tyler has to go investigate.  Turns out there is blood smeared everywhere and bodies lying all over.  What he finds after that will change the course of history.  The story tries to take itself seriously, but in all honesty, it isn’t very original or all that engaging.  But it’s a good enough excuse for indiscriminately blowing up aliens.\n\nShadowgrounds is a top-down shooter, which takes a few minutes to get used to, as atmospheric games like this usually are in first person.  The game is focused on exploring the different alien-infested buildings in each level, finding keycards to unlock the next section, and shooting anything that moves.  You’ll constantly be concerned with your ammo reserves (especially on boss levels, as bosses can take A LOT of damage) but for most of the game ammo is plentiful.  Enemies have an annoying tendency to be bullet sponges, requiring you to empty a clip or more into some of them in order to kill them.  You’ll never be completely helpless, as your pistol has infinite shots.  The other weapons are all unique and satisfying to use, each giving you different strategies to employ and allowing you an easier time of taking out certain enemies.  Dead aliens will sometimes drop upgrade parts, which you can spend to give your weapons new abilities like higher damage, rapid fire, or extended magazines.  You can read documents that have been left lying around on PDAs or on computers in order to figure out what is really going on, but it is completely optional, and frankly not all that interesting.\n\nThe visuals are pretty simplistic, and the textures of the different buildings do little to set themselves apart from one another.  But the way the game handles lighting is superb.  The smaller alien bugs will actually run away from you if your flashlight is on.  This is useful knowledge, but know that objects like crates or doors will block your flashlight just like in real life.  The way light bends (or more accurately, doesn’t) around corners is a surprisingly nice touch.  In later levels, you’ll come across invisible enemies that will flicker in the beam of your flashlight, giving an eerie screech as they try to dismember you.\n\nThe audio quality is passable, overall.  The voice acting is definitely the low point, as lines are delivered with over-the-top and unconvincing cheesiness.  The soundtrack is this cool hard rock techno you might find in a summer action movie, which fits the theme very well.  Enemy screeches and clanging objects will let you know what is coming once you learn how each enemy behaves.\n\nThe biggest issue with this game is that it really wants me to care about the story it is trying to tell, and while I enjoyed it near the end, it was quite diffult to get into.  The subpar voice acting doesn’t really help in that regard, but I enjoyed my time in Shadowgrounds.  The developers did a great job making levels seem just a little different from each other, which gives some uniqueness to each encounter.  In one, you’ll be defending a base full of survivors from waves of attackers, and in another you’ll be negotiating a twisting canyon as aliens climb down and surprise you.\n\nHaving said all that, do I recommend Shadowgrounds?  The easiest way I can describe it is that it feels like a poor man’s Halo.  Fun, frentic combat makes up for a lot of the game’s other faults, and playing it on Easy is a decent waste of a Saturday afternoon, but I wouldn’t say you’ll be missing out on much if you skip this game.","April 5","false","31.5"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

I wasn't expecting much from it, so it came a surprise when the game was actually pretty good.\nLet's put the ridiculous storyline aside, as it isn't even worth mentioning (it is pretty much the same for all the overhead monster shoot-em-ups). The time me and my friend spent however shooting up the variety of creatures we encountered as we moved on through the levels was I think well spent; the game is quite simple and the gameplay feels nostalgic with other games of the same genre.\nThe game accepts multiple players in local, one-screen co-op (up to 4 I think?), which gives for a fun experience when a few friends are over.\nThe only con except the quirky storyline was the controller support; most of it works fine like assigning buttons, however the lack of a setting for sensitivity of the aiming axis made the game considerably harder for the controller player.\nNevertheless, quite a cool game for its price.","March 10, 2014","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I highly recommend this game because it has what matters most: lots of satisfying fun.\n\nI didn't think I liked isometric shooters - then I played this one.  The controls took a brief getting-used-to, and once I had, I was roll-flipping-behind-the-back shotgunning aliens in 360 degrees.  So fun.\n\nThe sequel introduced physics objects - which I think is actually a very bad idea, as they briefly slow down the flow of time in the game on older computers.  Part of what makes this original Shadowgrounds so great is it's silky-smooth and consistent gameplay throughout.  Nothing drives me nuts more than inconsistent flow-of-time / speed-of-time in a game.  (I'm looking at YOU, EA.)  I'd much rather have simple graphics and solid-as-steel gameplay than super HD realism and feeling like some man behind the curtain is filddling with the universe's speed-dial, screwing up my reaction time.\n\nSeriously.  Action games are all about reflexes, judging and anticipating movement - hitting stuff that moves with other stuff that moves.  If you were about to hit a baseball as it flies towards your bat at 92.6 miles an hour... and suddenly, 10 feet before it reaches you, just as you are releasing your wind-up... the ball decides to move at 84.5 mile an hour until it passes your already-swung bat, accelerating to an unexplainable 135 miles an hour as it no-clips through the wall.  No.\n\nThis game does not have that problem, so buy it - and relish in it's mindless alien-slaughtering, earth-saving glory.","June 29, 2014","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very classic co-op top down shooter. There's not much to the plot but, there doesn't need to be. You play Wesley Tyler, a senior mechanic with the IGTO who has been stationed on Ganymede, the largest moon of Jupiter, when aliens suddenly attack one night. The game comes across as very straightforward and tends to let the action of the game do a lot of the talking. Any real twists and turns in the plot are few and far between, but what it does have works for the story. As far as any RPG elements, there's not a whole lot. You just kill monsters and you get upgrade parts. Simple and easy. Now, just to make you aware, the game can get hard later on in the game, Maybe not old-school video games hard but, hard enough where you'll be begging for a medkit at least once per level.\n\nThe variety of weapons is nice, there's a nice list of different enemies to fight and the graphics are alright looking for a game originally released in 2005. Maybe you'll find something you'll like, maybe you won't. It's a cheap enough game, especially if it is on sale.

It's not the best top-down shooter I've ever played.\n\nIt's unbalanced, gives you at least twice as many guns as you actually need, it's a bit buggy and unpolished. It starts you off really slowly on the first few levels. The shotgun doesn't feel powerful at all even with burst fire, and the Electric Gun came far too late and ended up being pointless. The main character suffers from "gotta roll to go faster" syndrome. The boss in the Mines level is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as he's faster than you and you have no way to dodge him until he starts rolling and summoning enemies (fun fact, I lost a life). The final boss is disappointing and the ending is just awful. Co-op is local only. But perhaps worst of all, it's too damn short, clocking at a mere 6 hours, and with no reason whatsoever to replay it.\n\nAnd yet, it's definitely one of the most enjoyable. The levels are built in a non-linear fashion and encourage exploration, and despite being somewhat repetitive at times, always come out with many varied challenges. Enemies manage to be varied, even requiring a different approach depending on your arsenal. Most weapons feel fantastic, especially when fully upgraded. The pistol, considering it's your backup infinite-ammo weapon, is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amazing with the upgrades (though the secondary feels more like a passive skill, which was indeed the result in the sequel). Some of the effects and scenery are jaw-dropping, even today (♥♥♥♥ yeah particles). The soundtrack, especially in action sequences, really makes you pump adrenaline with all its awesomeness. It's jolly good fun.\n\nOh, and it's also absurdly cheap on sale, a mere 99 cents for the two games.

It has some strong points and some weak.

But more and more you progress game becomes mindless shooter, story becomes worse and worse , I don't want to spoil but its one big cliche, they end up pushing all these types of weapons in your face. Idea for upgrade system was nice but later on you get so many upgrade parts its easy and there is no need to chose what you want to upgrade because you can do it all.

Not at all and far from it. But giving it a shot won't hurt.\n\nWhy is that? Simply because the game isn't good and isn't really challenging.\nBut does that actually matter? Of course it does, it always does.\n\nShadowgrounds has many flaws, first up the sound.\nSometimes the music's too loud, which can be adjusted accordingly but nobody keeps that up forever.\nThe voice acting is really bad, not badly acted because I'm talking about sound, just bad volume, sometimes you'll hear someone say something while other times you'll barely have heard anything.\n\nEnemies seem to be generally stupid, wandering in and out rooms, if they see you they'll attack...sometimes they'll just stand in the distance....merrily eating every bullet you're firing at them and die off-screen somewhere.\n\nI finished this game by using the pistol mostly, even though the other weapons are more powerful, the pistol seems to have this brute stopping power.\n\nBut the most important question of any game is, did you have fun?\nI had fun yes, loads of fun, playing in coop just seemed to go on forever, even though it wasn't hard, even though the story was done like everything that came before it.\nEven though the game isn't good, the hours of fun I had playing, were.\n\nSo I definitely recommend this game to anyone that is looking for a mindless shooting game to play with a friend.\nAnd also, I'm pretty sure that player 2 is imanginary in the campaign, he's never there in the cutscenes.","October 21, 2015","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is a great top down run and gun, depsite having "oldish" graphics the gameplay more than makes up for it. The progression of weapons that are made available to you is good and you can upgrade them too which is a nice touch. The secondary fire for each weapon comes in handy in for different situations. Overall for the price this game was actually great fun. It reminds me very much of those late 90's arcade run and gun survival games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/antonior/recommended/2500/","antonior","AntonioR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/antonior/","115 products in account","UPDATE\n\nWhile playing the game for the second time I had much more fun then on my first run. The game has a pretty good atmosphere, especially at the beginning when you still don't know what is going on and your arsenal is very limited. The dynamic shadows keep the tension up, since sometimes you are not sure if that was the enemy that moved or just the shadow. You can read personal logs on PDAs and computers and learn abut tragic deaths, fun jokes on the workplace while things were peaceful, and learn about what was happening before the events in the game. This is all just like in Doom 3, but it's still fun.\n\nThe soundtrack is pretty good and sets the mood just right, and when a large battle starts the music gets more energetic and makes you ready for the battle.\n\nThe maps are HUGE, some can take more than half an hour to finish, and first few levels are more open, so you can enter a building from various points. All the weapons are very fun to use and you can upgrade them. The upgrade system makes you explore the maps more, so you can kill more enemies and get the upgrade parts sooner.\n\nThere are not many enemies in the game, but they are all very different, and require slightly different tactics and weapons. Some run at you and jump, some get invisible and you need to use the flashlight to see them, some have shields on front, so you need to sneek from the back, some throw goo at you and slow you down... Unfortunatelly the AI is very limited, and sometimes they get stuck.\n\nI enjoyed the story too, it is nothing groundbreaking, enough to give you some context and keep you going, but the ending was a surprise. I'm glad I replayed this game and now I think it is a much better game than I first thought.\n\n\n*** OLD REVIEW ***\n\nThis game is a definition of a "7/10" game. There is nothing wrong with it, but there is also nothing special about, it's just good. After almost 20 years of playing games, somehow this is the first top down shooter I ever played.\n\nGraphics and sound\n\nI think the graphics look pretty good, nothing fancy though. You could say they look cartoony by today's standards.\n\nThe game misses some sounds. Like when you walk you hear no steps, I felt it was awkward. Also you would expect those big enemies to make stomping sounds when they walk close.\n\nThe voice acting is not good, especially for the main character. It's like he was sitting on the toilet reading newspapers and not fighting an alien invasion.\n\nYou get two types of music in this game; the "ambient music" is nothing special, but "fight" music (which sometimes plays when something important happens or when there is a large fight) is great, and I added those to my music library.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe weapons are the standard 10 weapons you would find in every shooter released before 2007. Except for the upgrades it's nothing new, but still fun to use.\n\nUnfortunatelly there are not many different types of enemies in the game. Most of them do require different tactics and weapons to fight them, so that's a plus.\n\nThe AI is not great, both for the enemies and NPCs, they sometimes get stuck. Few times when you have company they are not very helpful (the female lead character just uses a gun, would be cool if you could give her some of your weapons like in The Thing).\n\nIf you watched Aliens, or played Doom, the story will be familiar. You can read PDAs and acces computers to get some backstory, but you wont miss much if you skip those.\n\nConclusion\n\nI'm sure I would appreciate this game more if I played it 10 years ago when it was first released and when I was younger. There are probably better similar games out there now. This was the first game from Frozenbyte and with just a bit more polish(read budget) it could have been not just good, but great. With that being said I'm curious what they did with the sequel Shadowgrounds Survivor. I'm definitely playing that next.","September 1, 2015","true","20.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
