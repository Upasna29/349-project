It has a deep game sim engine, and pretty decent options to customize the experience to your liking. Don't expect it to do everything, but it does what it says it will do quite well. If you bought FHM 2014 and are now on the fence about this game, I'd say give it a chance. It's drastically different from FHM 2014, and has no errors or issues so far.\n\nI have been waiting for this game for the last couple of months to come out. I have followed the build-up to the game's release quite closely, seeing what the beta testers and developers had to say about it, and it's expectations. I played FHM 2014, and was disappointed by it as many were, but the developers have done a wonderful job this time around. They have built a very solid game, and have not overstretched themselves by marketing something beyond what they said they would do. In fact, Sebastian, the lead developer on the project, has time and time again undersold the game on the game's forums, likely trying to temper expectations after the release of the last FHM title.\n\nBut anyways, I haven't had any issues with this game yet, and the way it was so strenuously tested I don't anticipate having any major issues. I'm sure there are bugs here and there to be found, but it's definitely a solid release.\n\nThey plan to release this game annually after this year, and it's likely if there aren't features you're looking for in this release, they'll be added in subsequent versions.\n\nBut having played EHM:EA I can honestly say there's no alternative to FHM 2.\n\n10/10","September 28, 2015","true","53.4"," 34 of 46 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","34","46","0","0"

When I got invited to help beta test for it the past couple months on the forum to iron out bugs, I was even more excited. So don't let the low number of hours fool you, I've played the game a lot already prior to the release here on Steam.\n\nWith that said I can safely say this game is leaps and bounds above what the first game was. If you had a bad experience with FHM 2014, don't let that sway you at all. This is like a whole different game in terms of how much was done to fix and chnage everything. Fictional mode (my preferred mode personally) is far more stable, as now it only will run your league and its affiliates, no background leagues to slow you down. The facegen really helps in making players stand out and come to life a little more, you can add in custom jerseys for the teams through mods along with logos and pictures, the new game engine is much improved as it takes into account different player roles to rate them better during games. On top of that you've got new tactics management and a generally better AI for lines and rosters.\n\nIf you are a hockey fan or fan of the OOTP team as a whole, you will not be disappointed in this game. It is very worth the long wait it took, and having tested the game I've seen how hard they worked to make sure it was close to perfect at release. This is truly the game we had hoped for before.","September 29, 2015","true","485.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Granted, I could play in Commissioner Mode, which would allow me to force trades through (just like OOTP), but it's the principle of the thing.\n\nThe menu system also feels a generation behind that of OOTP. It's rather clunky and takes some getting used to. That's before players ever reach the bizarre game screen which makes all the information very difficult to digest, especially when the game is moving along at the normal speed of a hockey game or faster.\n\nOther than that, complaints are minor. Little things that get missed in some of the nuances of each league, which are irritating and, at some levels, even game-breaking. But, you know what? It's hockey. And if it's playable, I'm willing to overlook some of its flaws to get some enjoyment out of it. And, despite my complaints, I have enjoyed FHM2.

Unfortunately the wonderful things are outweighed by some unbelievably poorly thought-out flaws. You manage a hockey team. You draft and trade players to build up the team over time. Your effort is made futile by the AI very often taking spontaneous control of your trading and management of the team. It's very absurd.\n\nYou make a chart of what positions you need to trade for to have a shot at the cup this year but - WHOA! The AI takes charge and trades for three mediocre defencemen! Sure you checked off that box saying you're in control of trades, setting the lines, etc., but that box does nothing. No problem: You're lucky and you saved the game recently. So all you have to do is spend an hour redoing the entry draft and then WHOA! the AI just traded away that goalie you've been developing for three years! Let's go back to your last save game and redo that entry draft again. And again. And again.\n\nThe point of the game is developing a team over a number of seasons but, regardless of your performance, the AI constantly interferes. I've played five seasons of this Kafkaesque nightmare and I'm calling it quits. Outrageously poor design for a sports management game.\n\nYes, I've played this game for 172 hours.

You can go back and simulate ANY season in the history of the sport. You can start play from the current season. You can have a fantasy draft and have your own NHL. My favorite? Fictional players. You can create a brand new hockey universe for your amusement. Set the level of depth YOU want. Coaches, scouting, international feeder leagues, the works. THIS is sports simulation at it's finest.

While saying that, there are still some problems with this game, but not major ones and not as close to as bad as to FHM 2014's probelms. OK, lets start off with the positives of this game. FHM 2 now has a completely new engine that looks almost exactly like the one in OOTP16, which gives it a lot of points in my book. Another positive that it has with me is that it is easy to find your team and the farm teams with the new menu's, it saves time and it also saves probelms that you might have. The trades, OMG the trades, they are so much better in this game, and it now rivals OOTP16 trading system, it is that good. There are also expansions that you can do at the end of a season, if you would like, that makes the game feel fresher and more lively. With all of the pluses, there are some negitives that i must tell you, The major one i see so far, is the loading, it can take a long time if you even click on the home screen, i mean its not to long, but it is a wait. Another thing that i hoped got fixed but did not was the games, i really hoped for a new game screen for the games, but that didnt happen, it still looks boring and the screens can make it confusing. But other than that i really dont see anything totally wrong with this game. Overall, FHM2 is getting better, i mean a lot better, its getting up there towards OOTP, but its still years away from it\n\nI give this game a overall score of 8.25/10 and would recommend it to hardcore hockey fans to buy it now, but causal hockey fans to wait till a sale.\n\nFHM2 is a much more improved game than FHM2014, but it is still no where close to OOTP","October 2, 2015","true","11.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I played that game to enternal hell, why not ?? It was the best simulation in the world at that time! Risto "Riz" Remes was the godfather of this era and his accomplishment for the product years later gave him an opportunity to join up with SEGA Sports Interactive to produce Eastside Hockey Manager. Who wasn't happy about this at the time ? I mean C'mon... the amount of potential the game had now with a brand like Sega backing them was endless and a dream come true to fans all over the world.\n\nWell... after a few versions, bad advertisment, absolutley no additional features, a few years later because of they're pi$$ poor excuse of "pirating", the game was.. cancelled... yes folks... SEGA.. who had this golden apple in front of them for years and years, no to mention the hardcore fans all over the globe frothing for more were told .. thats it!\n\nNow.. years later with SEGA not willing to produce anything other than a tight leech for updating EHM:EA as a side gig for the small clan of hockey gurus they have working for them, because of well... lets face it... costs!! thats right folks... money.. greenbacks... the risk versus reward wasn't in Sega's scope anymore to fix they're mistake of product advertisments, basically starting again and taking that golden apple from the tree.\n\nHere we are today... Enter OOTP FHM2. OOTP isn't about money... they arn't about how many units they sell to cover the costs of they're managers paying for those BMW's, fancy suits and all that corprate bullcrap, they are out to deliver the best simulation product they can muster up and then some. FHM isn't going away no.. they are here to stay.\n\nI don't expect everyone to have the same point of view to all this but over the years of frustration and looking for a hockey simulation fix, Out of the Parks FHM2 is now officially the best of the best at this moment and with a dedicated, motivated, drop the gloves group of developers looking to deliver to the hockey world without the bullcrap excuse's of the later mentioned, I'm also here to stay.

The major one is the interface, it's just more awkward than OOTPB, it's workable but it can be frustrating if you're used to their Baseball games. The second isn't that big of a deal but the match interface is a little boring. Neither detracts massively from the game.

I felt I would be willing to give it a try for that price, not knowing whether I would enjoy the product or not. I tinkered around with it for a bit... setting up a historical season of my Boston Bruins from 1986. I found it a lot more clunky that OOTP... but then I do realize this FHM 2, and OOTP has 15 plus seasons of development over it. I can't comment a lot on the financials in the game, as I tend to play these types of games more as a game/season simulator, where I like to be involved at the manager/head coach level, and just get in at the game level making decisions a coach would handle. In this respect, I can say I'm not really enjoying the game all that much... most of your decision making is happening before the game with a pre-programmed set of instructions for your lines and tactics, and then the simulator just runs through that without any real imput from you as the coach in game beyond watching what happens from your pre-programmed lines and tactics. The biggest game breaker for me is the fact I can't even program any type of line matching, or make any decisions in game to put in the lines I want at the moments I would feel they need to be out there... that is one of the few things a coach can do in hockey to control the game. I really really want to like this sim and I do want to support it, so I'm kind of sorry to write a negative review on it... but just being honest, its not the game I want to play AT THIS TIME. I stress AT THIS TIME, because I think it holds so much promise... and I really hope FHM 3 will be a leap forward, and I'm hoping in the upcoming years it will become the game that I do want to play as they develop it.

You can tell that the same dediciation to providing the player with an immersive simulation is present in this game but it is still far too buggy. It crashes often, especially when you want to run a historical expansive team (e.g., the San Jose Sharks). Simple things like conducting searches with filters that yield players with certain attributes (e.g., hockey sense > 13) are still missing.\n\nI would wait until the next version comes out.","February 13","false","496.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Also, trading still needs some work to get up to the level of OOTP\n\nOnly 6 hours in, and I am already sick or having to change my lines after every few games, it is taking away from much from the enjoyability of the game. I never played the first one, have gathered this was a great improvement.....but there is still a long way to go\n\nUpdate - This game makes my head hurt. Seriously. It keeps changing my lines around, and then I see that the game has changed my settings(which believe me, I took great care to ensure the settings were how I wanted them and then saved). So, check your settings at the start of every season, no matter how many times you have set them and saved them....it is too late for me, but maybe I can save someone else smacking themselves in the head in frustration, which I will do many more times before I can make the Leafs a cup winner\n\nOne more issue, and it is a big one. I have a drafted player who I have signed to an entry-level contract, but I wish to return to junior. However, his team already had the maximum of foreign import players, so I can't send him to junior. He is too young to assign to minor pro, so the only choices I have are to buy out the contract and release a 19 year old first round pick, trade him, or keep him on the NHL roster, which I don't want to do because he won't play regularly barring injury. This needs to be changed so that the junior team accepts his rights back, and is then able to trade him or another player in order to get back to their limit.","January 5","false","54.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

I've played Football Manager and OOTP for years and this comes nowhere close to that. The screen's are "pretty" but utterly unusable. For example, you can't easily move players up and down the layers of your organization, there are no way or filtering your current roster by position (which makes it really hard to know what you need) and altogether not enough data is shown about your team to really understand where you stand. This "unfinished" feeling is compiled by random bugs (can't submit offer sheets half the time), unstyled block of HTML in text paragraphs and slow performance.

It's better but still not quite there yet. The other issue is you can create new players but not coaches and to me that's terrible.
