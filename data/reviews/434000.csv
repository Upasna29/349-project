I still have a way to go in the game myself, but I am just enjoying it and not rushing through it.\n\nThe Art Style is very unique and original, and I quite like it, while other's may not. I am just in awwww with this lovely game, and have no regrets buying the "Pitter Patter Edition" which has the interactive book, in which I have discovered you will find under software in your librarys if you purchased this Edition of course. If You have it you will need to download it first to view it, as its separate from the main game.\n\nAs I write this review I speak for myself and I can say that I am so enjoying this game, it does keep you on your toes and can be a bit confusing at times, BUT have patients and be persistant and you will get through. The game is not very difficult, you play as a baby lynx cub and he/she is so very cute, I now have a lovely Baby Bear buddy to help me on my journey.:)\n\nThe Store page tells a better picture about the game, so I would make your own judgements via the store page.\n\nI prefere not to spoil anymore, given my influx of spoiler taged screenshots, believe me the game itself is much better than screen shots, as I did find it tricky to get desent and clear pictures. In game is best in my opinion 9/10","March 24","true","9.0"," 62 of 68 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","62","68","3","18"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blaideblack/recommended/434000/","Blaideblack","Dr. Permixtus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blaideblack/","150 products in account","Absolutely wonderful and emotional like any other Shelter Game so far. A huge Rollercoaster of emotions with all good and sad emotions in it. As always a beautiful artstyle and a very atmospheric soundtrack.\n\nHowever, as much as I love the game and the Shelter Games in generell, this one left me a bit dissappointed. I knew the game was going to be short, but being able to complete it in an hour was a bit too short. I could barely get into the experience, get known to my companion, as the adventure was already over again. I was basically just getting really into it, when it ended. I wished they would have made it just a tiny bit longer.\n\nIf you are thinking about getting this game, don't do the same mistake that I did. Explore every Corner of the game and take as much time as you can for every part. I am going to complete the games another couple times, get really into it, collect all the rewards, so complete it carefully, because nonthenless, it's a stunning experient! Don't rush the game!\n\nThat said there is not much else I could say about it. The plattformer part in this game works smooth and fits within the entire game, everything is simple and easily understood.\n\nIt's overall just Beautiful, short and emotional. It gets you.\n\nUpdate:\nAnother + is, that the Devs are incredibly nice people who actually help you with your problems too. Amazing guys!

Do read this before making a choice!!!\n\n\nWhere to begin... I guess firstly we take a look at price tag and content. It took me 3 hours for this game because I wanted both endings, the second playthrough finished faster because I knew what I was going for. So is $15 worth for a game of 3 hours? Well I'm here to explain the game and you decide.\n\nNow in Paws unlike the previous titles, you actually play as a cub! A lynx cub. You're separated from family and you're off to an adventure to find them. Along the way you meet a companion and later in the game you will find yourself at a crossroad on which side to pick.\n\nThe world did get expanded... a little I guess. There are the same old collectibles as in Shelter 1 and 2 that doesn't really do anything aside from achievements. If anything though, I feel like the world is even more vivid than the previous titles and the atmosphere along with the background music playing during specific parts really set the atmosphere really well.\n\nOne part I was at a swamp-like area and the background music really set the mood that this place isn't very welcoming which was fantastic.\n\nThe AI is simple and works fine. Although the game still retains the 'feeding' mechanic from the previous titles, it does nothing. You don't get hungry or tired; you can sprint all day and get to the end w/o eating (or at least it seems that way. I didn't try as I ate along the way for immersion). There isn't a hunger/stamina indication so dunno why this is a thing.\n\nThe rest of the game's pretty linear as usual but you can explore each section of the game to find collectibles and just indulge yourself in the world. Speaking of indulging yourself, since you're playing as a little cub, you can left click to meow! It's so... ADORABLE. I almost fainted out of cuteness.\n\nAnyways back to the game. The narrative is quite different in this game. Some areas it's okay, there's a clear direction on where to go, other times it can get confusing. I was stuck at one part of the game for roughly 10-15 minutes because I didn't know where to go.\n\nThere's also a lack of real danger in the game as dying just resets to last saved point unlike in the previous titles where danger eats your family. Although this could be a feature as it allows you to fully experience the life of a lynx lost in the wilderness trying to return to her family. I know I enjoyed it.\n\nSo in conclusion, this game is more lively than its predecessors. Much more beautiful and the endings are both fantastic although I'm in favor for one over the other but that's just me. There are two endings so let that be a thing for you to think about as you play this game; a Friend ending and a Family ending.\n\n**Minor Spoiler**\nIf you're aiming for the friend ending, when you see foxes, let them attack you.\n**Minor Spoiler ended**\n\nSo now back to the question for those who has never played this title series before. Is it worth $15 for a 2-3 hour game? It can even be longer if you're the kind of person who likes to achieve everything in a game. However, I was talking about it being a 2-3 hour game so I'll ask another question. How much does it take you to go watch a movie?\n\nBecause this is pretty much what it is. It's roughly more or less 1 hour and 40 minutes for the first playthrough as you explore the game and about an hour for the 2nd to reach the 2nd ending. It's dumb they don't have a checkpoint system where you can load back to the split path but whatever.\n\nTreat this as more of a visual novel than anything else. Even 1 manga or a novel is roughly $10.\n\nThis is my personal opinion as a GAMER but $15 for a 3 hour game is a NOPE.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, as someone who loves cute and cuddly things and a story? $15 is cheap. I have tons of cute things that costed more than just $15.","March 27","false","3.8"," 51 of 74 people (69%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","69","51","74","8","1"

Each one got me attached to each one of my cute lil cubs and made me overwhelmingly sad if I lost one. This game topped it all. Not only did it make me feel emotional, in the game I was trying to go back. The ending made me sadder than I have been in a game and touched me hte most. Amazing game.\n\nOn the down side, it kept crashing a LOT which was annoying. It can be played for around an hour without exploring and the game will end so don't be me and explore as much as you can!\n\nAn idea for a new game would be a wolf story. Like a mother wolf and her pups. I have seen a lot of wolf games but I never got the beautiful art style mixed with realistic gameplay. Shelter 1 and Shelter 2 gave that feel and that is why I love Might and Delight.

Could've played for hours more.\n\nIf you're a fan of the Shelter games, this one is a must have. It has a more concrete story and levels like in Shelter 1, but follows a familiar Lynx cub from Shelter 2. The story is sweet and touching, and exploring the world is just as enjoyable as ever.\nBear in mind that the levels are straightforward and not open world, so the opportunities to explore are limited. On the bright side, there is no chance of getting lost. Puzzles provided are simple, but work well in the game's setting.\n\nThere are memories and collectables to collect, so if you're the type to want to 100% games, you might get a few playthroughs out of this, depending on how carefully you search when you play.\n\nIf you want a short enjoyable experience, Paws is a wonderful choice.

It is not an animal survival game, but a story driven game about exploration. I see too many people saying it is bad because it is not like the Shelter games. But it is not supposed to be like them.\n\nOn to my review then:\nPaws.. there is a lot to say. I know you will be seeing me saying to not buy this game, even though I admit: I love it.\nThis game was great. Storytelling, music, gameplay, the emotions and how Might & Delight have a really good sense for telling stories from an animals perspective.\n\nBut then there are the cons. This game is short. Hellishly short. And it saddens me, because I feel like there could have been so much more dangers happening and more bonding between the Lynx cub and her new found friend, the Bear cub.\nDespite it being claimed as a puzzle-platformer, there was not very much of either. You do jump a lot and there are some areas that are freakishly well hidden, but it all sums up to not really being in that genre in the long run. If I had to put it anywhere, it's a lot like an explorable storybook, which would be okay if it was longer.\n\nAll in All: I am a hardcore (as hardcore as it gets) fan of Shelter 2. But even I can not really recommend this game entirely. It's beautiful, it's stunning and has a lot of exploration to offer, but it falls short on its length and on the platforming, as well as the connection between Lynx and Bear.  Perhaps there will be DLC to iron its issue out, but as it stands right now, you are better off sticking to Shelter 2.","March 26","false","3.2"," 31 of 49 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","31","49","2","1"

I will not actually get into Shelter 2 a lot. It is pretty confusing in some parts, in other parts, it completely tells you what to do. I'd say it would be worth 10 instead of 15 but, since I love it so much, its fine. It basically heart-wrenches you. From a happy start, to already a treacherous part, transitions kind of fast. I also love the art style, I have not seen another game with its style (May be one) meaning, its is unique, and does not copy off of others. It also has a great soundtrack (As many games with good soundtracks, sell them) too. Also, a little easter egg, that is also a SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER. READ THIS ONLY IF YOU HAVE PLAYED THE FIRST MOMENTS OF IT! Inna, is the name of the cub you play as. In Shelter 2, your name as a mother is Inna too. Even though the title says "....A Shelter 2 Game" I still think it would be one. So this basically tells the story of the mother in Shelter 2. SPOILER OVER. I'd say buy it if you love great story lines, as it is confusing at times, like a puzzle. You need good common sense,  for the objects around you. And I especially love the feature (SMALL SPOILER) where you can sniff out your mother's foot steps to find her, as this is a great way to tell players where to go. Its really confusing, but has a great storyline. It really is nothing else, but you could get Shelter 2 if you'd like an actual game similar to this. And yes I did cry in Shelter 2 where one of my cubs, almost grown :( died. It is a pretty hard game, indeed, but if one cub dies, it affects (SMALL SPOILER, again) the family tree in the game. As I said, Paws, is more for a story, where you will certainly cry (If you won't, you have a demonic heart) and even though Shelter 2 doesn't have a story, it can still make you cry, as you work so hard for your cubs, just to see the perish. A little off-topic warning: Games with a 'juicy' story like this, can have people who are recommending, say spoilers. Thats why I don't really read any of them, just look at what percentage. I'd say for a game like this, 80 percent and above is fine. 90 percent, is an extremely good game. In other games, like something you play with, not enfold a story, 75 and above is perfect. Just a little thing about games, dont read comments on games with a thick, juicy story, as they do spoil parts, and always check the percentages!","May 9","true","1.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

These days it is all about guns. But this game tells a magnificent story of friendship. Also family. This by far is one of the best games I have played. I might get the DLC soon, but for now, I`ll stick with the main game. Might and Delight; You are amazing, in every way possible.\n\nHere is a quick summary of the game: (spoilers)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo you start out as a baby lynx, the story starts when your mom just gave birth to you. It is like the shelter 2 opening, but in first person in baby Inna's eyes. After a day or two (I think?) you, your siblings and your mom go outside to hunt. After you are done hunting you go back into the den. At night you and your mom go to a star  Once your are done looking at it, you go back to the den. Next morning, it seems that you are moving out. sadly you get stuck in the lake and you are tooken miles away from your family.\n\nYou explore a creepy forest (rainforest?) and you have to smell your mom's foot steps. Then you meet some swans, but not in the best way. they throw you around if you get too close. Once you get passed them you go up the mountain(I don't belive it was a mountain, actually). At the top of this mountain(or ledge) you find a bear, ineed of food. before you saw the bear, wasn't there berries before you saw him? go get them! or if you are feeling evil you can feed him a bird.  Feed him three of the berries.\n\nOnce you have him following you, you go on an adventure with him. you'll bump into a misty area. There is a small hole only you can fit into. try to find a way in for the bear. which means leave him behind for now. Once you find a wayy in- wait, there is a fox after you! run! Bam. You got caught. But the bear rushes in and kills the fox. he brings you to a safe place, and gives you a fish to eat.\n\nNow you are awake. Finally. You keep on going on your adventure. Wait- your bear ran away somewhere. Follow him. What is he looking at? Is that another bear? No... to small. It is your mom! But that means you have to leave your friend behind. Once you get back to your mom, keep on meowing, you can still hear him, but now you can't. The en- wait! You wake up in the middle of the night, go to the star, and you can see him.

It's a very sad and yet a very happy story.\n\nGRAPHICS\nPaws has a very interresting artstyle, very similar to N64 graphics. The game is created out of polygons, yet even through that it's a beautiful game. It gets you immersed in the game instantly, the textures on such simple shapes draw you in and make you want to stay. Paws is an admirable game for this reason; I have never found a game that provides this feeling.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThis game runs perfectly; at even the highest settings, it runs perfectly for many people. As the graphics are mere polygons, it's not too hard for any PC to handle. The controls are smooth as well, acting like they should properly. The subtlest buttons can do great things however. The LMB has you meow, this is your way on communication. You can talk to other animals this way, and it's too cute for words. One flaw with the gameplay is that when you rotate, you don't go right into facing that direction, the cat has to do an actual turn, which can cause some problems if you're being chased. Though overall, it's perfect.\n\nOVERALL\nOverall, this game is amazing. It has a deep story that drags you in from the second it starts to the second it ends. The graphics are simple shapes, yet beautiful and really set the mood for an adventure story. The game runs smoothly as well, reacting as you'd probably want it to. I recommend this game for sure, this game is revolutionary in my opinion, showing something that seems so basic can be an amazing work of art.\n\nRATING\nThe game gets: 4.5/5\n\n","March 30","true","1.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sonoralax/recommended/434000/","sonoralax","Sonora","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sonoralax/","456 products in account","Have you ever wondered what the world looked like through the eyes of a lynx? Perhaps they are your favourite animal or you’re just interested in the species or animal kingdom. Whatever the case, Paws: A Shelter 2 Game acts as both an educational game and also an immersion into the lynx life. Play as one of four cubs and begin a journey of love, triumph, friendship, loss, survival, and motherhood. Understand the complex relationship between life and nature - the very force that compels the choices we make.\n\nIf you are already familiar with the franchise and enjoyed it, in particular Shelter 2, then you will be pleased to know that this game is very similar. It follows the same story line as its predecessor, but differs in that it now allows gamers to experience life through the lens of a young cub. As you control this particular cub you will experience a mother’s love and patience, a family’s warmth, and then almost suddenly, desperation and separation. Ultimately, this is a game that will pull at your heartstrings as fast as it will mend them. This is the game that introduces us to Inna.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nPros+ This is a game that you can definitely play with your family\n+ New characters to meet and explore! The Goose is not a welcomed character though...\n+ It's a Might and Delight game, and unfortunately I will always be biased and say they're great\n+ Adorable sound effects and music. Very appropriate for the kind of game that this is and helps set the mood\n+ You get to play as a lynx cub and piggy back on a bear cub: what more could you want?! Be aware, the bear cub can be quite tempermental\n+ As always, Paws: A Shelter 2 Game is set within an artistically pleasing world; the graphics are unique to this franchise and offers real familiarity to those who know and love it\n\nNeutral± Like all the other games in this franchise, the achievements take time and dedication to get; they are definitely no walk in the park. Prepare to spend a couple of days toiling over the locations of the rares, etc.\n± Controls are both easy yet sometimes a hinderance. What I mean is controls are clunky  at times, like when you're trying to catch prey, but easy when you're doing small stuff (like basic maneuvering, running, and jumping)\n\nCons- To those who have played through the whole game: the ending - what?\n- I suggest waiting for this game to go on sale before purchasing it. It's not worth the $14,99 price tag when you'll probably complete it in about 3 hours tops\n- You will get lost from time to time. The lack of directions can be annoying and you will be backtracking a lot due to the lack of instructions. In the end, it's not fun at all and does detract from the overall quality of the game\n- If you stray far off the path, then be prepared to glitch like hell... I managed to leave the path completely and ended up stuck between 3 tree's. I attempted to jump, crawl, and walk my way out, but to no avail. Out of frustration I ended up just closing the game only to lose all the progress I had made in that session. To say the least, I was furious\n- Do you suffer from motion sickness? If yes, then please be aware of your tolerance and take breaks accordingly. I’m easily affected by motion sickness, sadly, and the camera angles in this makes me feel like I'm aboard a ship. This is the number one flaw of the game, but I can understand the difficulties the developers have in trying to get it just right for every gamer. Mess around a bit with the settings - it may or may not help. As for me, I can only play about 20 minutes of this game before I have to exit it (reason behind my low play time)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nExperience the raw power of nature and form a valuable bond along your journey. This is a riveting tale of friendship that withstands all odds. It will force you out of your comfort zone at times, and you will think considerably about every tough decision presented before you. While this game does have its issues that it can't seem to iron out, I still highly recommend it if you're a Might and Delight fan. This is a great game to add to your Shelter collection.\n\nAll in all, brace yourself for heartbreak and other mood swings, for Paws: A Shelter 2 Game will tug at every ounce of your being.\n\nOverall\n6.5/10","June 5","true","6.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

The music helped show the mood of the game in a very effective way. The controls are easy to learn, the same as Shelter 2. I liked how the hints didn't lead me through the whole game, just handy enough to show me what to do the first time 'round but subtle enough to ignore on other plays. I also appreciated that it isn't just a play-through and you've now seen it all, you need to play it more than once, to build the puzzle pieces. One thing I found difficult though, was camera response, different from shelter 2. No matter how I tinkered with settings the camera never quite followed and gave me the feeling of weights on my cursor.

But be aware that it is short and also has a terrible camera and clunky controls. Also if you often get motion sickness from games, this might cause problems for you.\n\nLonger version:\n\nThis game is cute. I really really wanted to really enjoy it, even knowing that it was just going to be a short romp.\n\nUnfortunately trying to play with mouse and keyboard was an absolute nightmare. I spent a while just trying to make the camera not a wildly swinging around pain in the ♥♥♥, and eventually just gave up and settled on the static camera so I could actually start playing. And even once I did start playing, I had to keep stopping to close my eyes and deep breathe because I was getting incredibly motion sick.\n\nThe controls are.. meh. I don't know. It felt like even with the sensitivity turned down trying to move around would often result in me having to zig zag around, making my motion sickness worse. It's weirdly difficult to get back to moving in a straight line.\n\nI'm sure, with a lot of fiddling around, I could have the controls and camera be actually manageable, but who even knows about the motion sickness. It's a real deal breaker for me, though I'm sure I'll try playing again anyway. It's still something you should keep in mind if you also get motion sickness from games.\n\n","April 11","false","1.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The art style is beautiful as always, and the story is emotional without needing a single word spoken.  I really love this game, and I'll be going back to grab the secrets in another playthrough.  But I just can't recommend this game.\n\n1. "Platformer," as stated in the description of the game, is a bit of a stretch.  Basically, you just jump up stairs.\n\n2. The controls are awful.  I used a keyboard & mouse, and had to fiddle with the settings quite a bit to make it playable.  Even with tweaked settings, the camera is hard to work with, and the mouse movements are not precise.  The log bit was probably the worst, as the log would never turn in the direction I wanted.  Who knows, maybe a controller is the only way to go.\n\n3. Game time.  In my eyes, you should be able to have at LEAST as many hours of fun as the game costs.  This game costs $14.99 and my first main playthrough (the fun bit) didn't even last an hour.  To me, this game is worth $4.99 max.\n\nMeow.","March 30","false","0.8"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","0"

It's so beautiful. But it's just not the best game. My complaints (spoiler alerts):\n\n-Extremely glitchy. Sometimes when I jump on the bear's back the game freezes. I can hear my movements and my meow, but the screen is just frozen and I have to unplug the cord to my computer.\n\n-The controls are weird and glitchy. Sometimes the controls won't respond. But hey, it could just be my keyboard.\n\n-The game doesn't tell you what to do. Basically a figure-it-out-yourself game. When I found and fed the bear, I knew I could get on its back. After 15 minutes of trying to get on the bear's back, the game finally tells me you have to hold down spacebar.\n\n-Took me 45 minutes to complete the game. I wouldn't say it's worth as much as Shelter 2. If the story was longer, then it'd be worth it.\n\n-The ending.. Where to begin with this? In the middle of the story your mother couldn't save you from the river in time. Luckily, in the area you ended up at, you find your mother's footprints just lying around. You find and feed your bear friend to help you with bigger jumps. A day later your friend senses your mother. You see her across the river. You swim up to her and then you go home and sleep. The end. What? That's it? You don't get to see yourself grow up and be the mother in Shelter 2?\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone that loves roleplaying. I can roleplay, but it's hard with such a terrible ending. If you don't agree with my opinion, that's perfectly fine.\n\nThe only reason why I like this game is because it's beautiful, heartwarming, and you can run away from your mother until she catches you. But other than that, not my favorite game.","May 26","false","8.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Paws: A Shelter 2 Game is a standalone expansion on Shelter 2. The music is absolutely beautiful as usual, and the patchwork style graphics take art seen in gaming to a new level.\n\nTaking the role of a baby lynx learning the basics of survival in the wilderness, you follow your siblings and mother around, eating butterflies and other such critters.\n\nPaws: A Shelter 2 Game weaves a beautiful yet heart-breaking story of a baby lynx who finds itself swept away from it's family by a freak wave. During your time in the wild, you put your recently learned skills to the test and follow the footsteps of your mother. Along the way you come across a friend who helps you get through the rough and unforgiving forest that has become your temporary home.\n\nWill the baby lynx ever find it's mother again? Take a look at our gameplay and review video, then head on over to Steam and get downloading!\n\nQ&A With Might & Delight:\nGameReviewsAU:\nWhat prompted you to take Shelter 2 in the opposite direction by putting the player in the paws of one of the baby lynxes?\n\nMight & Delight:\nIt seemed a natural progression. A fact echoed by a vocal majority of our fans and supporters, who had made it clear they really wanted the chance to assume control of one of the younglings in a Shelter game. They told us what they wanted, we listened and et voila.\n\nGameReviewsAU:\nThe Shelter series is very much focused on motherhood. Is there a particular reason for you shining the spotlight on mothers?\n\nMight & Delight:\nThe theme is largely underrepresented in games. Not just motherhood, but parenthood as a whole and the wave of emotions that comes with the responsibility of taking care of young ones. Also, when trying to come up with the original Shelter concept, members of the team were either parents or making their first inroads into parenthood. That played a big part in the games theme.\n\nGameReviewsAU:\nWhere did you initially get the inspiration for the patchwork graphics seen in each Shelter game?\n\nMight & Delight:\nIt’s easy to assume both Shelter 1 and Shelter 2 have the same visual style, but they are born from two separate sources of inspiration. The first games visual style was heavily inspired by Japanese Kamon, which is a form of emblems used to uniquely identify a family or person - not unlike a coat of arms. Whilst the second Shelter was inspired by Russian embroidery ornament patterns.\n\nGameReviewsAU:\nWhy did you decide to release Paws as a standalone game rather than as DLC for Shelter 2?\n\nMight & Delight:\nWe felt since the gameplay and story explored different themes to the Shelter series, it warranted a spin-off. If it proves popular we would be open to developing the Paws concept further.\n\nGameReviewsAU:\nA lot of people seem to be interested in co-op being implemented in Paws. Do you have plans to make this a reality?\n\nMight & Delight:\nWe try to listen to feedback from our fans and if there is genuine interest in another Shelter game or co-op then we would be silly to completely ignore it.\n\nGameReviewsAU:\nSeeing as Shelter 2 has you playing as the mother lynx, and Paws has you controlling one of the babies, will you ever make a standalone game based on Shelter 1 where you play as a baby badger?\n\nMight & Delight:\nNever say never.\n\nGameReviewsAU:\nWhat can gamers expect to see from Might and Delight in the future?\n\nMight & Delight:\nWe also released what we call a living book along with Paws called The Lonesome Fog. It’s an opportunity to explore other ways of conveying narrative we’re excited about. Apart from that stay tuned for more announcements from us in the coming weeks.\n\nRead the full review[gamereviewsau.com]","March 26","true","4.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Then on Saturday morning, the game wasn't working.  No matter what option she chose to try and play, it asked if she wanted to exit the game.  We have sent 2 emails to support and as of today (Monday) have yet to see a response.  If something isn't done soon, we plan to demand our money back.

Such as I'm not allowed to replay from my save file, and it keeps bringing me back to the main menu.\nI do enjoy the game play, albeit I wish some controls were a tad easier (mostly the jumping to high platforms) and I feel while riding your friend you could have better control instead of him just mozying around.\nAll around though, I give the game props on music, atmosphere, and story!","April 4","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
