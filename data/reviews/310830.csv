"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/recommended/310830/","CueZero","CueZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/","1640 products in account","There are games that cash-in on our nostalgic values and harken back to the 8 or 16-bit era without changing or adding much at all, in a way that just makes some content with taking a trip down memory lane.\n\nThen there are games that turn that nostalgia upside-down on it's head, taking the retro formula and bending it into an intense and cutting-edge new experience. Retrobooster falls into this second category, taking the familiar space shoot'emup concept and injecting it with refined and stylish modern flair.\n\nMost noticeable early on in the players' journey is the very responsive control of your ships main thrusters. Reminiscent of classics as far back as Asteroids all the way up to more recent space shooters such as Sub-Space or Continuum is the full 360Â° control as well as precise propelling forward and backwards.\n\nGetting a hang of the super sensitive and extremely spot-on controls of your individual thrusters is as imperative as it is fun, given that overshooting your propulsion will end in the humiliation of smashing your ship into pieces against the rocky surface of the terrain below. It takes a bit of practice and some determination but the better you get the smoother things feel, and the quicker you'll be powering your way through levels.\n\nRetrobooster is a game of skill, reflexes, brain power, and top-notch hand-eye coordination. The speed is set to overdrive and the only limit is your ability to master the maneuvering of your ship.\n\nThe game boasts some of the most impressive and engrossing visuals I've seen for any title in the genre, with the wonderfully detailed lighting and particle effects giving a realistic look to the dust flying up from nearby rocks, the exhaust from your individual thrusters, and the flames of burning enemies all powered by very convincing physics.\n\nThe puzzles, an element rarely seen in these sort of games, are actually enjoyable and very engaging even for those like myself who aren't too great at them, which really took me by surprise. They don't feel tedious or overly complex, giving a lot of breathing room for how players approach each solution.They require not just logic solving skills but the addition of quick reflexes and coordinated shooting in order to pass each cleverly constructed obstacle. This makes figuring out solutions challenging yet appealing and accessible to all levels and class of skill.\n\nWith elements in bullet-hell style shooter action, tricky physics evading cave exploration, the sometimes brain-wracking yet clever and engaging puzzles, this is a kind of space shooter any action fan can easily become hooked into.\n\nIt's insanely hard at times in classic retro fashion, but the controls and laser guiding system are intuitive and provide a robust learning curve which give it that edge of progression and accessibility that the classics just don't have, giving Retrobooster an addictive and lasting appeal.\n\nThe variety of diverse gameplay mechanics is incredible, especially for a shooter. There's a memorable experience to be found for all types of players; from speed running demons, puzzle masterminds, to reflex endowed shmup aficionados who remember the days of 1 credit clearing their favorite arcade games.\n\nRetrobooster has no "pre-fun B.S.", no filler or fluff, no complex systems to learn, hand-hold-y tutorials, or overcomplicated plots. You're thrown right into the thick of things. Just you and your ongoing struggle against gravity, the fear of realistic physics crushing you from all sides, and the terror of watching your human compatriots trampled by a robotic spider in your panic stricken efforts to save them.","July 23, 2014","true","1.2"," 42 of 50 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","42","50","0","0"

If you did, this game is a modern version of those games mashed together. The controls for the game are awesome, and the graphics are very nice. The game feels really polished, I haven't noticed any bugs or glitches yet. The only thing I would wish for that the game doesn't include is online co-op, everything else is spot on. Challenging and fun, everything this type of game should be. Thank you Really Slick for making a superb game!","December 23, 2014","true","17.0"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

Longpong","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dermtz/","1584 products in account","A tense but very fun to play game.\n\nI liked it from the start even when I was doing badly... or maybe because I was doing badly. Accidentally using the reverse button and flying in a swarm of bullets or total mishandling of a landing and incinerating all the little dudes I was suppose to be picking up with my thrusters.\n\nIt's easy to get the hang of but I can see a lot of room for skill and flare. Rotating your ship to avoid bullets rather than moving it and something I have come to thoroughly enjoy - gaining a lot of momentum and then using short bursts from the forward and reverse thrusters to arc over a large piece of terrain while raining hot ionic death.\n\nThere are weapon upgrades, ammo pickups, shields and pick ups to replenish shields and totally new weapons.\n\nThe way your thrusters interact with the walls/floors/ceilings is nice, kicking up dust and mushrooming in as realistic a way as I can say without being a spaceman. Also the aforementioned toasting of innocents.\n\nVanquished  enemies turn into chunks of debris and billowing smoke that can fall and hit the hull of your ship giving everything a nice sense of physicality.  The people you are to rescue shoot flares to draw your attention. Unfortunately in a lot of my games this just means their death is assured as I  hash the landing, crush and/or burn them as I bounce along the ground. Early days.\n\nYou can just pick up your controller and get going with this, so it's perfect for Big Picture mode users and while I haven't used the keyboard you can set your own keybinds. I've suffered no graphical or display issues. No bugs or glitches.\n\nDropzone, Thrust and Choplifter are all games I loved and this reminds me of them but thoroughly modern with lots of nice touches.\n\nTo end on a cheesy note.. .It's feels really slick.\n\nBuy it/11","November 13, 2014","true","10.8"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Lots of your little ship getting blown up/smashed/crushed like the tin can that it is. Lots of "wait, we're trying to fly a spaceship through what?" Lots of that sinking feeling when you realize that the maneuver you're supposed to pull off to get to the next level isn't even remotely close to being a sane thing to do in a spaceship. Lots of that awesome feeling when you manage to pull it off anyway, followed by despair when the levels abandon any pretense of being dangerous but essentially neutral and start actively trying to eat your ship. Sometimes, lots of spiders.\n\nIn short, it's excellent.","July 13, 2015","true","42.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Cave-flyers were made popular by indie game developers from Finland in the eraly 1990's with numerous titles in the genre. If you played the game Subterrania on Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, you will love this game.\nThis game makes everything right down to the last detail. The physics engine is what really puts this game on the map though. Physics affect everything from ship handeling to shots bouncing off walls and enemies falling down when shot. It's a bloody hard game because the physics engine makes it hard to navigate the ship without crashing into walls. It's also a very detailed game environment with tons of details that makes every map seem different even though it's mostly caves. Even the smoke from the booster rockets reacts to physics and bend around objects.\nPut short it's a hard, beautiful, detailed, fun game that works regardless if your play session is 5 minutes or hours.","April 15, 2015","true","3.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I'm sure the comparison has been made before but it reminds me of the old 8 bit game Thrust which appeared on various platforms and of the 16 bit title Oids. The game works really well with the xbox controller although it takes a while to get used to controlling the ship. Worth the effort though. I like the way the background text appears as you play and the reverse thruster is a nice touch as well.\nRecommended.","December 21, 2014","true","0.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"
