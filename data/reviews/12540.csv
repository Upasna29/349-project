Taipei-type tile puzzle, but as you solve it you get randomly-generated "clues" to logic out who done it.  One time a guy was murdered by three women who were each missing a leg, acting together.\n\nThe minigames are optional (they give more clues) but they're fun; there's a memory game, Fake Tetris and some kind of speed thing that isn't particularly difficult.  Still, it's a lot of terrible ideas that, all put together, make a really good, compelling whole.  Way better for that Mahjongg itch than most of the ones with over-the-top pseudo-Asian themes.","October 26, 2013","true","17.2"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","14","14","4","0"

But here, contrary to many other games, tiles are used to collect clues about a crime, the suspects, etc.. The scenarii are always different and like the game Criminal Cases on Facebook, with these clues, it's up to you to arrest the right people.\n\nThe soundtrack is good, the gameplay is good, the graphics are decent and the game is right balanced. But why do you sense that I will bring a problem?\n\nWell, you have minigames with it. A sort of Dr. Mario clone to check DNA, a pursuit, interrogations that are matching pairs... And it's these minigames that are a weak link:\n- The Dr. Mario clone is controlled by the arrows and not the mouse. I had an hard time to adjust.\n- The pursuit, while easy, is at least bugged. One tile stayed, I saw the suspect's car pass through the police one and disappear of my screen on the left while the police kept going to the right. I had to stop the pursuit because I was kinda stuck in limbo\n\nAnd I still didn't understand the paper tile. I never saw anything going with the press for example. However, the clues are really hepful: you can clear people from a crime easily, even when you have 4 perpetrators (the hair color or the blood type are what you're searching the most). My only downside in that matter is the fact that weight and height aren't in my metric system, which means that I can't say if the suspect is of "average, short, light" etc.. So, unless you're familiar with both systems, you can kiss goodbye to these clues.\n\nI'm enjoying it so far. However, given the fact that the game is nearly reaching the 10 years old mark, keep in mind that maybe, you'll have a problem to play this game (in other words, resolution).\n\nOh and it works under Windows 8.1 :).","July 26, 2015","true","5.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

It's nothing flashy, but it's solid. As you solve Mahjongg boards (with non-traditional tiles), some tiles give you clues toward solving a mystery. Your goal is to make a Carmen Sandiego/Guess Who-style identification of the suspect(s) based on identifying details and obtained clues.\n\nI enjoy Mahjongg, and I enjoyed this. It's a fun game, with straightforward puzzle gameplay and tutorials to gradually introduce you to your crime-solving tools.","March 29, 2013","true","2.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunaril/recommended/12540/","Lunaril","Lunaril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunaril/","880 products in account","Mahjongg Investigations: Under Suspicion is a really fun and interesting take on the traditional game of Mahjongg. As you match pieces, you unlock clues, uncover evidence, confirm alibies of various suspects and more, leading up to the moment you are ready to get a warrant against the perpetrator of whichever case you happen to be on. Each case begins with the initial crime scene where the timer begins. As you successfully complete each location, additional time is added to the clock. Once you have amassed enough clues and feel you are ready, you can review the clues, evidence and suspects, prior to requesting a warrant.\n\nI thought this was a really good way of adding a new dimension to the classic game of Mahjongg. I consider games like this to be "Time Wasters", something one does when they are bored and looking for something to do, when you don't really want to get to involved in a game. It is a good game, and I am glad I picked it up. There is only one level of difficulty and the way the game is setup, you have an evidence bag which can hold a few tiles at a time making it almost impossible to not be able to clear a board. In any case it is still fun to play.","July 25, 2015","true","0.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

The mahjonng part is what you'd expect, with traditional tiles switched out for modern tiles.  However, the whodunnit part kicks in by adding clue discovery, facts about suspects, and suspect elimination as you progress through boards in different locations on each case.  There's also an occasional car chase mode which involves matching tiles before the suspect gets away, as well as the interrogation mini-game, which is essentially the memory game.  As you nab suspects, you gain rep and get promoted.\n\nIt's not terribly challenging, but it's not meant to be.  It's a nice diversion that can become a little addicting.\n\nOverall, Mahjonng Investigations isn't spectaular, and the graphics would have been unimpressive a decade ago.  But, who cares?  What it does it does extremely well, and it's one of those casual games that makes me want to do "just one more" before quitting.\n\nAll that said, at $9.99, I'm not sure you'll get value unless you specifically enjoy mahjonng.  I got my game in a bundle... so keep an eye out in the usual places for that.  I'm giving it a positive with no reservations, as I would have felt the price was okay if I had paid full for it.","April 17","true","13.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I would have loved this game then. As it stands now, I have the choice of either "too small" (windowed on my 24" monitor), eye-bleedingly filtered/ pixelated at a full-screen resolution, or reducing my desktop to 1360x768 and playing windowed. The use of rendered background images instead of photographs or 2D art is also very 90s.\n\nIt's a good game, but unfortunately, unplayable for me.","July 6, 2015","false","1.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

As you match tiles you uncover clues to determine the killer. You have about 25 minutes to collect enough clues and get warrants to perform searches. With multiple locations and tons of potential targets this game has a good replay value.\n\nThis would be a good game to end the night on or just to unwind. I personally wouldn't pay $10. If you like Mahjongg then $5 would be reasonable.\n\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.
