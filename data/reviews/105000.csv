The game is not terrible: it has its good points, and if you've ever wanted to play a dimwitted token female with a seemingly quite severe case of scoliosis who wears a sweater that covers only her boobs, then this definitely is your game.\n\nPros:\n+Good message\n+The art is quite nice\n+The ruined future setting that occurs near the start of the game is very compelling\n+The support team answered my emails quickly and were very helpful when I encountered a game-breaking bug\n\nCons:\n-The English voice acting is atrocious. If you want to play the game, set the sound the German with English subtitles - the German voice acting isn't too bad.\n-The English translation is not very good. There are a lot of grammatical errors and problems with colloquialisms that really should have been caught by a native English speaking proofreader before the game was published.\n-There are a lot of bugs. Mainly I encountered translation bugs: various items popping up in Russian or Spanish. I also found a game-breaking bug, however, which required a replacement save file from the support team to get past.\n-Everyone moves so slowly that I found myself screaming at the monitor a few times. Quickly, we must hit that switch before the facility explodes! Now, let me just take a leisurely stroll across the room. Wouldn't want to work up a sweat.\n-The game is extremely resource-heavy, and I can't figure out why. My computer heats up while running this game as much as it does while playing a modern shooter.\n-Many of the puzzles are absurd. Several of them require knowledge that the average person just wouldn't have. I needed a walkthrough to get through most of it, and many times I realized I would never in a million years have thought to try the thing that ended up being necessary. There's also a fair amount of pixel-hunting for tiny items that blend in.\n-Between the slow movement speed of the characters and the seemingly never-ending cutscenes and dialog, by the time I was 1/3 of the way through the game I just wanted it to end.\n-The ending isn't nearly as clever as it's trying to be, and felt rather anti-climactic after all those hours of listening to people talk and watching them crawl across the screen to the sound of suspenseful music.\n\nIf you can get the game cheap, enjoy ridiculous puzzles, and have a lot of patience for slow movement and long cutscenes, then feel free to give this one a try. If you're used a faster pace or just want something you feel you can solve without a walkthrough, I'd pass this one over.","June 14, 2014","false","8.7"," 173 of 212 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","173","212","3","2"

The tone here is much darker as it complements the rather dire storyline.\n\nThe backdrops are beautiful and the character models have a much more realistic style to them than we’ve come to expect from the developer. The mixture of early 80s haircuts and futuristic technology somehow goes well together.\nIt also helps the aesthetic that the music in this game is perfect with a sensational orchestrated soundtrack that goes beyond expectations.\n\nWhile it can be a bit preachy about using up all natural resources, melting the polar icecaps, and destroying Earth through human ignorance and greed, you feel a bond between characters, and even the world, that a lot of games fail to establish.\n\nThe characters evolve through the story, properly accepting their roles and feelings towards certain situations.\n\nIt's not often that I consider a game hard to put down, but I found myself getting deeply invested in the plot as it unravelled thanks to its convincing characterisation and an increasingly gripping storyline. Although there's an obvious environmental focus, there's also a strong heart to the story and it's this that powers your desire to play on.\n\nThe puzzles are solid as I have found myself stumped on several for near half an hour.\n\nIn short, I highly recommend this game to those who enjoy point and click games. Be sure to check out the Deponia trilogy if you have not already.","February 3, 2014","true","8.8"," 77 of 90 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","77","90","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/recommended/105000/","Faudraline","Faudraline","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/","1196 products in account",""Steam. Not smoke."\n\nA New Beginning is one of Daedalic Entertainments' "pretty good idea, done nonchalantly" games. Thus, it is a great potential story wrecked with many bugs, bad translation and a half-baked ending. I had really some major expectations from this game, with themes such as time travelling, environmental pollution and mass awareness but... No, it doesn't cut. This is not how it's done. This is not how it should be done. All this tension, all these ominous warnings, all this thrill and this action... and this ending? This is not a climax! Are you mocking me?\n\nSorry, my annoyance gets the best of me sometimes. It's storytelling time. Here, we have the elderly Norwegian bioengineer Bent Svensson who spent all his life working in the laboratory to produce energy from algae for the production of safe energy in hopes for a better future for the planet. After a breakdown that he suffers due to exhaustion, Bent is sent to retirement - the purgatory of a workaholic. He now lives in a small cabin in Norwegian Fjords, away from work, away from stress and away from responsibility. "Calm down, Bent" says his psychiatrist. "You are not responsible of saving the world".\n\nOh, she couldn't be more wrong! Bent Svensson's silent misery in retirement is suddenly interrupted by the visit of Fay, an odd young woman who claims that she time travelled from the future to find him. According to Fay, she comes from a future where the mother earth is at her limits and about to perish for good due to years of pollution, violent climate changes and toxicity. As part of an operation called 'the Phoenix Plan' she is sent to the past to prevent a disaster from happening to alter the course of time. "Only you, Bent" says Fay, "Only you can save the world!”\n\nI know I was intrigued after the brief introduction to the game. The environmental theme, financial conspiracies, bioengineering, time travel, ecoterrorism... What else I can expect from a sci-fi environmental adventure? Right? Sadly there is a truckload of bugs and irritable mistakes within this game which will simmer down your enthusiasm. There is a common bug that makes your inventory unreachable, thus unable to complete an action to progress which triggers a couple of times, starting with the end of chapter 2. You should either ask Daedalic support for a save game where the bug isn't triggered, or pray you got plenty of your saves to try again.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful, this is already a trademark for Daedalic. Cinematic cut scenes are arranged in a comic-style manner where comic panels are presented with speech bubbles over characters, alongside voice acting. The comic style character artwork is a great idea of presentation, but my issue comes with the translation. As Daedalic being a German firm, I assume for original voice acting and script to be in German. So the English translation is... well, horrible. Word puns and scientific explanations are totally lost. There are many, many spelling errors within texts. The speaking animations do continue long after the voice acting is already stopped. With all these errors, it becomes really hard to get into mood and take either character or the story seriously.\n\nAbout the gameplay itself, it is your basic point and click adventure. Item combinations do make sense, and nearly always they go along with an engineering view point. Lots of things to fix, physical reactions to mind, machines to manage and operate. Thus, it becomes obscure sometimes for you to be able to think of needed ways to progress. Puzzles themselves are very realistic, to a degree of - yet again, becoming obscure. I am usually very good at solving such puzzles without a walkthrough, but in the case of this specific game, I gave up. I personally think there is no one who would be able to solve all puzzles without the help of a walkthrough for this game.\n\nI do not give up on games with good stories due to bugs, really. If I managed to play Anna to the end, and enjoyed every single moment of it, I'm positive bugs do not pull me down. My problem was the negligence in story persistency all together. Some characters made a shallow appearance and remain unvisited and unmentioned for the rest of the story, which prevents us from emphasizing with them altogether. Aside the character of Bent Svensson himself maybe, characters aren't more than some pictures with speech bubbles. There is no personality, no cause-effect relationship in their actions, no reasoning to their thoughts or dialogues. There were some character inconsistencies, like a trained radio operative like Fay being borderline clumsy, just to force the storyline in a predetermined course. Every disaster or twist in the storyline is foreseeable and determined, aside from a really anticlimactic ending.\n\nAll in all, this is a mediocre game with incredible potential wasted terribly. Am I sorry that I played this? No, not at all. Gave me some thinking to do on the theme itself of course. But nothing I wouldn't get from reading Greenpeace bulletin or National Geographic. On sci-fi terms, I'll keep reading H.G. Wells.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","October 4, 2015","false","9.2"," 67 of 87 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","67","87","3","5"

The problem-solving in the game can be solved with mostly logical thinking, but there might be some puzzles and problems that seems a bit out there - not Lucas Arts out there if you know what I mean.\n\nThe only thing that drags it down is the terrible english voice-acting (the voice-acting might be better in another language though). The lead female sounds like a robot from time to time. The story also gets a bit weird and "jumpy" at the end.\n\nBut still. I would recommend the game.

Everyone is going on about bad voice acting. Blah, blah. Really ? Ok, so let me help you if you are interested in this. Buy it. Play and finish it. This game is worth your money and your time. That is the bottom line. I loved the subject matter, and the game made me feel a sense of loss when i finished playing it as i grew close to the characters. Thus, it has a great story and great characters. Could the voice acting have been better ? Sure. But i played this for the adventure. There is a message here in this game, and i feel it is a good and honest message. Look after our planet and our children will have a place to live. It creates a sense of loss and longing as it shows you what could happen if we dont change our ways. It was a really great thought provoking graphic novel. And it will stick in my head for a long time to come. The puzzles are good, i could solve some of them quite easy. They are challenging, but not impossible at all. This game has a lot of emotion in it, It made me think back to old adventure games in the 80s. It has some great level design and locations.I love the art style and the color palette because it fits the game perfectly, creating the right mood. Helping to create a world that pulls you in and keeps you there. Everything compliments each other well, and creates the Ambience tied together with a great musical score. I really would like a sequel to the game, and would buy it for sure.","April 5, 2015","true","15.7"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","27","30","0","0"

The message that game tries to convey is pretty great and so far this is one of the point and click adventure with a different genre - "eco triller". Let's take a look at the pros and cons of the game and my verdict\n\nPros\n1. I really love the comic book style , it reminds me of XIII . Superb , something which was not done in this genre\n2. The game's humour is great as pointed out by someone in the review , you'll have some good laughs every now and then\n3. The length of game is long , it took me about 12 hours to complete it. It's not short , there are lots of things to explore\n4. The ending is superb\n5. Good price point (buy it during sales as it is worth it)\n6. The ability to skip puzzles\n\nNow there are some serious flaws in this game as well which sort of ruins the whole gameplay experience\n\nCons\n1.  Could not understand some puzzles at all . Some of it I was totally lost.  It was nice to have the skip button but I am a kind of person that wants to finish puzzle.\n\n2. The whle 4:3 resolution , it is very bad if you have a huge screen , this makes it annoying finding things. I did not know about the space bar feature to reveal all the clickable items , I had a hard time finding some of the pixels. I am guessing this is because of the hand-drawn graphics and such\n\n3. Spelling errors and gramamatical errors - There is a lot of the game. Some of the options are in another language such as in Russian or Greek. I do hope that the developers did put some effort at least in ensuring that these are ironed out. English is not my primary language but even I could see the errors that they make.\n\n4. Subpar voice acting , I felt the voice actors lacked of emotion especially in certain parts/events of the game. They just sounded bland , lacked of soul and depth\n\nVerdict\nJust grab this game if it goes on sale , and if you are an adventure fan who is into a totally new genre of story (not the typical ones you woul expect !). Despite the drawbacks , it is still a good game to play. You'll have to give credits to the details esepcially the backdrops and sch\n","June 15, 2014","true","12.6"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","29","36","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yerahi/recommended/105000/","yerahi","Sysa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yerahi/","72 products in account","Overall - lacking.\nThe graphics are pleasing enough, and the music is nice. That said, the English voice acting is simply atrocious. A reader program is better to listen to, the intonation has nothing to do with the emotional content of the dialogue, and sometimes it's just plain wrong for English.\nOh, and the character design. Why does Fay have a uniform including a sweater that ends under her boobs? And does she have a back problem? She stands and walks with her spine bent in a highly unnatural shape, which is just painful to look at.\nThe characters themselves are also shallow, and even though in some reviews I've read about 'character development', that mostly means that they grow from one-dimensional to maybe two. And that's for the protagonists. About one of the main supporting characters, Duve, all I got to know was that a: he's upset with his father (understandably) for sacrificing their family for his work, yet b: he continues his father's work out of some sort of duty perhaps, though he claims to hate it, and c: he's gay. The latter had nothing whatsoever to do with anything, apart from mentioning that Bent "would have been okay with it", and providing a clue for solving a puzzle. Talk about token minority.\nThe plot seemed forced sometimes, and after the final plot twist, had motivation issues at some points in retrospect. All-in-all, it felt rather forced and didactic, and the conclusion really didn't make much sense to me.\nCertainly not a game I will ever play again, and not one I could recommend, as much as I'd like to promote eco-conscious games. Only reason I played it through was that I hoped for satisfactory ending. I didn't get it.","November 7, 2014","false","16.7"," 53 of 78 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","53","78","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ajpos/recommended/105000/","ajpos","Andy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ajpos/","483 products in account","One of my first computers games was Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, and that game set me along life with a love of point 'n' click adventure games. I've played them all by now, but like a good addict, I am still trying to find the one that will give me an experience like playing Kings Quest VI, Day of the Tentacle, or Sam and Max: Hit the Road again for the first time. "A New Beginning" does not do the trick, but it is a good start for a genre that has seem some revitalization in the past few years.\n\nThe Good:\n\n* Although it may be odd to say this, I really love the menu UIs in this game. They're unique and very fitting for a game that has comic-book style cutscenes.\n\n* While many point 'n' click adventure games suffer from "find the pixel" syndrome, A New Beginning ends this frustration by letting the player highlight every point of interest on the screen by holding down the space bar. This might be a negative if you're a hardcore player, I  suppose.\n\n* I see people complaining about the game's length on the internet (they think it's too short). This game is long! I felt the game was about to end while I played chapter 6, and compared its length to Day of the Tentacle. Little did I realize the game was far from over and there were actually 8 chapters!\n\n* Puzzles are straight-forward - there are no ridiculous puzzles and I only resorted to the "try every item on every item" strategy once or twice. That being said, this game is slightly easier than every other point and click adventure game I have played in recent memory. The easiness is due largely to the generous verbal clues. A guy says "I can't hear?" Try the megaphone. Your character says "not with my bare hands?" Try using an item. If you play the first three chapters thinking the game is a walk in the park, though, just wait until the later chapters - it gets much more difficult!\n\n* Although it is now pretty much standard for the genre, I do appreciate the fact that there is no way to "screw up" and ruin your game by using the wrong item somewhere, or by dying.\n\n* The game's humor, although used much too infrequently, is top-notch and intelligent.\n\n* The ending is really, really, really good. I won't spoil it for you, but if you didn't enjoy the game, the ending might make it pay off for you.\n\n* Goes for as little as $2.49 during Steam sales.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n* Some puzzles are a bit weird. I thought I had assembled an antenna, but could not figure out why the game would not let me progress further despite having used all parts in all possible configurations. I used the handy "solve puzzle" feature and learned that I had only built about half of the antenna, somehow. With no way to go back and solve the puzzle legitimately, I shrugged and moved on.\n\n* Because of its hand-drawn graphics, the game only runs in a 4:3 aspect ratio.\n\n* No pause feature that I could find - I missed two semi-important cutscenes because I accidentally pressed escape, thinking it might pause the dialogue.\n\n* There are a large number of bug reports on the Steam Forums. The only bug I encountered was an item (a valve on an oil rig) that was not highlighted when I pressed space, and would not let me interact with it until I got very close to it. I encountered the same bug later with a receptionist at the power plant.\n\nThe Ugly:\n\n* Frequent grammar and spelling errors, and most of the dialogue is quite awkward. Although the voice-acting is remarkably bad, the voice artists honestly didn't have much to work with: awkward sentence constructions, phrases that should have been abbreviated, etc. At one infuriating point in the game, there is a puzzle having to do with language in Chapter 4, but the solution makes little to no sense in English. I stumbled upon the correct solution by accident. Some words in the game were never translated to English at all, or were incorrectly translated to Russian or Spanish. The developers could certainly have done a bit better with localization for the English version.\n\nThe Verdict:\n\nGive this one a play if you are into point 'n' click adventure games. It is not as good as Daedelic's other big game, "Deponia," but still a solid game and avoids some of the mistakes that Deponia made. I would definitely recommend anyone to at least give it a try if you see it on sale for $5 or less.","January 1, 2014","true","10.2"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","1"

Hence, the English dub of the game leaves a lot to be asked for. Many of the intonations are painfully out of place, though the voices do match the characters to some degree. The German version suffers from none of these issues and is quite nicely voiced. If you're able to, I'd recomend playing that version. The game itself is your standard adventure, not really genre defining or groundbreaking, but the puzzles are well designed and have a good flow to them. There is relatively little scrounging around for items, and although you may be stumped from time to time, you probably won't require a guide to help you through. The visuals are also quite nice, the game has a comic book aesthetic which is a good match. The game's biggest failing probably lies in its heavy handed plot which is constantly trying to shove the dangers of global warming and nuclear down your throat. Though the writing is at times quite clever most of the time the game sounds like that environmental science class you had to sit through in 7th grade. The story is generally pretty sound, but starts to fizzle out at the end. Overall it's a well-crafted game with a plot that doesn't live up to the polish of the rest.

SPOILERS]\n\nthis is the first Daedalic Entertainment game i've finished and... actually regretted playing.\n\nThis game has the potential to be a fun, enjoyable game. Puzzles, tricky areas that would not be the automatic response and even an additional level of depth to point and click that allows for pop-up actions (more about that in the negatives.). As always with Daedalic Entertainment, it's beautiful to look at and tha characters are... more or less believable. They make sense and seem easy enough to relate to. Daedalic Entertainment have also coined a 'hold Space to show Items you can interact with', this has made me so much more likley to buy one of their games just for that aspect alone! the character animations, although simple and repetative, always seem mostly in place and with exception of a few moments (if you want to pick) usually look perfectly fine and don't break immersion at all.\n\nHowever... the entire game paints the image of 'the world is ending, it's climate change but you can fix it'. at no point did I feel hopful for the characters.\nWe're dealing with an aeged man who has ruined his relationship with his family, estranged his son and apparently made very little effort to fix that. you're also playing as a person who, during the entire game I was expecting to turn out to be lying to me and was unfortunatley not dissapointed. The 'good guys' turn out to be... well... kind of pathetic, sad and myserable people that I didn't want to even think existed, let alone play them for the whole game. The antagonists were rather unbelievably over-evil (MWAHAHAHAA! I WILL PAVE OVER THE WORLD TO MAKE A GLORIOUS SEAL-SKIN CAR-PARK!) and the storyline rather felt overly preachy...\nThe entire cast were unpleasant in even degrees... in fact, the person I liked the most was a doorman with an anger problem and a complex about his baldness!\n\nThe general gameplay is point-and-click with the occasional puzzle. The puzzles were good and mostly self-explanatory, but the point-and-click was point-and-hold-aim-and-click for everytbing... that took extra time that was not needed when right-click-to-examine and left-click to walk to, pick up, adjust etc. would have sufficed.\nThe right-click for inventory was not actually needed at any point and could easily have been removed entirely and replaced by having the inventory there all the time. the only time it became needed to quickly open your inventory is if a game-event had closed it for you.\n\nI did not feel like I had anyone on my side in the entire game. When i'm playing as him, i'm waiting for her to ♥♥♥♥ him over. When i'm playing as her, i'm waiting for us to do something strange and un-kocher.\nThe son, he was downright unpleasant. The old-friend from work was needlessly suspicious and came across as kaniving in places. The best-friend seemed... well... i don't know all that well beause i was honestly expecting him to mess us over too! he was too nice compared to the rather unpleasant crowd we were already in!\nI can't complain enough about the worst of humanity in this. We have cheaters, liars, mercinaries, needless aggression, paranoia, disbelief, angst and all the other shades of things you don't want to spend an afternoon immersed in.\n\nThe storyline of 'time travlers come back to fix the world' is great. I was all for that! the idea of them coming back from a climate-desolate wasteland is a perfectly stable platform... what fails however is that they drop a plot-twist on us that... well, let's face it was rather un-needed!\n"we came to this reactor to stop it blowin up!" becomes "we came here to blow it up"... umm... why?\nHonestly, it boiled down to 'grab that stuff and run for it!'. the machevilian "let's tell the goodie all my plans" was old before this game was made and really made the ending of this... a total mess!\nI've seen twist endings, back-track endings, not-as-you-expeted-it endings, the-goodie-is-the-baddie-is-the-goodie endings... but the sudden change of heart makes your one character seem totally heartless or a derranged sociopath, the baddie is... let's face it, totally insane for his plans and the other baddie is desperatley in need of a lead-lobotomy!\n"it's ok, we reconciled this kid with his father and even managed to bring his sexuality into it almost out of the blue without any apparent reason"...\numm... yay?\nwhat have we resolved here? One character we were really not that set up to like has got fame, another character we probably should not dislike this much is going back to killing himself with over-work and his son, who needs to get a grip for most the game, is all right now?\nyou might as well have written "and they all lived happily ever after"!\nOh, but it's ok, that person who let themselves get baked in radioactive steam instead of getting into one of the many easy-to-access doors on that level left you a picture to remember how she and all the other people you met from her time betrayed your trust, nearly got you and your family killed, killed off one of your oldest friends, destroyed most of your life's work and... should I go on?\nThe ending felt forced, bolted on and almost irrelevant to the rest of the game. The problem was that whole areas of the game had the same feeling.\n"this is a great big conspiracy" why? everything points that way. Everyone says it's an accident and refuses to talk more about it... soooooooo? Why was everyone acting needlessly suspicious? No apparent reason. One person takes it to their grave and the other betrays you brutally without any kind of apology.\n\nI actually felt miserable finishing this game. The gaming completionist in me refused to step away, but I was damn close! had the ending not appeared when it did, i would not have finished the game.\n"No matter how beautiful the weapon is, it will hurt no less when turning against you"\n\nTechnical bugs were rife in the game. Many areas had options that were not translated. clicking on one item to examine blinked the subtitle and played no audio so if there was any useful information there, i missed that\nThere are parts where the subtitles run off in the FMV but the audio has not even started.\nThe dialogue overlaps itself, jumps pitch and volume mid-sentance, often lacks the correct inflection for the mood it's used and sometimes comes across as just plain wooden and eerie.\nOne moment, i'd be listening and the voice sounds warm and involving... while describing an inane object... then to describe something important, it sounds cold and emotionless? the mixed signals in this were easy enough to overlook, but when it changed pitch, volume and feel mid-sentance? split-personalities or bad dubbing...\nThere were miss-spelt subtitles, incorrect words and sometimes, the wrong used entirely.\n\nTop it all off with the common feel of mid-eighties cartoons where the baddie just wants to make a new motorway or spill oil into the sea and realising that they might as well be brow-beating you for having the light on. Honestly, i would not have been surprised to find that this was endorsed by an extremist wing of a climate change activist group!\nYes, we get that nuclear power isn't the best, let's all feel damn sad for this. now, how dare you have multiple monitors on. We all poison every living thing in the woods for no particularly well-explained reason. Deforestation, fossil fuels, melting ice-caps... Anyone remember this from school?\nI DO care about the environment, I'm happy to recycle, I proudly turn off lights and electrical devices not in use and rarely use more than what I need... I don't need a game to make me feel guilty for the environment change.\n\n\nI would urge point-and-click enthusiasts  to buy ANY Deponia title instead of this. If you want somethin a little more serious, buy 'night of the rabbit'. Daedalic Entertainment deserve all the support they can get, but this game is going to a special place in my "games I regretted playing" list.","November 6, 2014","false","8.4"," 35 of 52 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","35","52","0","2"

There's a lot of time that's gone into that.\n\n+ The story gets really good from around chapter 4 onwards.\n\n+ Around 10 hours of gameplay.\n\n- Some bugs. The ones I got most were 1. that the game would sometimes think I was clicking my mouse when I wasn't, causing the text to skip (meaning that I missed some of the dialogue) and 2. that there was sometimes a Russian or German word to click on or sentence spoken by a character, even though I played the game in English.\nThe latter only happened two or three times and I always knew what to do, so it wasn't that big a deal. The former I solved by saving often (or just not caring what was said).\n\n- "I'VE GOTTA SAVE THE PLANET. I'M GONNA CRY OVER THIS DEAD BIRD. WHY DOES THAT GUY DRIVE SUCH A WASTEFUL CAR? WHY DOES NO ONE LISTEN TO ME?" Every. Five. Minutes. If you're not necessarily into the whole "I must save the earth right now" thing, you'll need a LOT of patience to try and ignore Fay (and Bent)'s constant eco babble.\n\n- Baaaad voice acting (especially main character Bent).

I knew it would be based on the majority of the reviews here, but my god I wasn't prepared for how painful it actually was.  It's as if they grabbed random people off of the street and made them read lines of dialogue with no context.  It's so poorly done that it just doesn't make sense.  I was so turned off by it that I was going to give up after an hour.  I did find that I was able to continue by switching the language back to German.  While not perfect, they at least tried to emote and it synced up with the mouth animations on the panel scenes given that it was the native language of the game.  Just go into it as if it's a foreign subtitled game.  I know that turns a lot you off, but it's still better than the English voice track.\n\nthat said...\n\nA rather disappointing outing from Daedalic.  I tried harder than I usually would to give it a fair chance to impress but it never actually came through.\n\nScreens/Backgrounds are well done.  The biggest compliment I can give here.\nStory was lacking in my opinion.  Written too loosely and eco-preachy to the point of borderline annoyance.\nCharacters were weak and two dimentional.  Many of them so unlikable (looking at you Bent) that it was hard to care or empathise with them enough to desire any kind of resolution on my end other than soon forgetting them.\nPuzzles are challenging, but fair.  To be honest, I was so tired of it all by the third act that I power FAQ'd.\n\nIt's currently $2.  Hard to say "Don't Buy" at a price that low, but I sure wouldn't recommend paying more.  I'll remain a longtime Daedalic fan for what they've done to reintroduce and support P&C genre adventures in recent years, but this  is an effort that can easily be swept under the rug.","February 9, 2015","false","6.5"," 28 of 42 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","28","42","0","1"

So far:\nI've found a cyrillic alphabet (I think russian) option at one of the point of the oil rig\nGot a male guard referenced as she\n"Hier is it" (hier is german)\n"Savie the world" in epilogue\nThere are  options for modifying how loud are: speech, music, and sounds. But you can't modify the cutscenes, they will boom at you with your computer's  currently set volume.\nAlso the game doesn't saves your volume settings, they are getting reseted by restarting the program.\nLastly: the game CONSTANTLY changes between alga and algae. The whole plot is centered around this organism yet they can't decide how to spell it.\n\nThe voice acting is just terrible. I mean the characters are speaking clear, they are easy to hear, but they sounds like somebody's reading a really boring book. At one point the main character burst out, saying I think "no" numerous times, because  somebody just straight out accused him of not taking his experiments seriously, while his family and private life was non-existant, he was so dedicated to his work. Hell, I'm more angry about burning my hand like this guy was. They could have said "No, I don't want scrambled eggs", the emotions were just as "intense". The plot twist part's voice acting is just plain atrocious, no better word.\nEpilogue's voice and subtitles are out of synchron, too.\nAt the end:\nWell made story, poorly executed in english, but it doesn't hinder you in any ways in completing (and kinda, enjoying) the game. Full price is 10$/€, it's maybe a little too high considering there is no replay value. If you can get in a sale at/below 5$ or in a bundle, go for it!","September 7, 2014","true","28.9"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

But oh ,, my .. lord .. of .. pants .. the voice acting and dialogue is dreadful. Its as if they recorded each word individually and you've dialled an automated call centre for the conversations. I normally enjoy exhausting dialogue trees, but this is so jarring, I would find the path of least resistance most of the time.\n\nThis is a real shame as you feel there is some humour hiding behind the poorly translated dialogue and some characters come off as real ♥♥♥♥♥, making you cringe at some of their lines. Thats possibly the point for some characters, but it comes across poorly done and in some instances, just plain wrong,\n\nThe problems don't end here, plenty of bugs are scattered throughout, repeated text, scenes out of sync, characters pop around the screen and cut scene crashes. A tip here, if you do get stuck at a crash, you can skip the problem cut scene by hitting escape. These bugs are not frequent enough to be game breakers, but they do break the immersion.\n\nBut.. I played til the end, the story and puzzles kept me coming back. It would have been a thumbs up if the dialogue had been implemented better. However, I cannot recommend the English version at full price, so a wobble to a thumbs down for me, but point and click fans should consider it if its in a deal or part of a better package..","March 23","false","11.3"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Well, if you can look past the awkward audio timing, mediocre voice acting, and bugs, then you can still look past this game for something better. The story is pretty predictable and none of the characters are believable. The puzzles are either obtuse and illogical or just stupid. The San Fransico section is particularly bad. The animations are choppy and awkward throughout. There's a subplot that I guess they just forgot to conclude along with the unsatisfying ending. But at least the suffering doesn't last long as you'll reach that ending much faster than you might expect. 20 hours of gameplay is promised, less the 10 was delivered. I managed to stretch it to 13 by leaving it minimized to cook dinner, search the internet for a solution to a game breaking bug, and rebuild a server.\n\nSo, if you bored and this is on sale for less than a dollar, go ahead. Just do yourself a favor and turn off the voice acting. It would be a better game for it and there's no audio for the subtitles they forgot to translate anyway.

Almost. While it is not just some pro-environmentalist propaganda, and the theme is integrated well into the story, sometimes the message it tries to convey is little more than a PSA after a Saturday morning cartoon.\n\nSaid story is an interesting baggage as well, since it likes to switch narrative styles. Initially, it is a time-travel tale set in the apocalyptic future, as presented by the first protagonist, Fay, who went back to 1982 to convince a retired biologist, Bent, to continue his research into clean energy. This leads into a family drama between Bent and his son, which somehow turns into a James Bond movie against an evil energy mogul who hides in his private fortress in the jungle. And finally, the entire plot just ends in a very Shyamalan-like twist.\n\nGameplay is almost as varied as the storytelling: we start with relying on inventory-related puzzles in the future segments; dialogues, distraction, and some investigations in the initial chapters set in the present; and finally, old-school point ‘n’ click adventure insanity for the conclusion. This variance is refreshing to some degree, and it usually fits well within the current narrative, but it also feels like as if the game struggles to find its own identity and just experiments with whatever the creators just came up with. The result is an enjoyable, but probably too distracting product that can be recommended to adventure game fans only.","March 28","true","13.3"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

At the turn of the 26th century, mankind is about to be extinct as the last few hundred left won't survive the next solar flare. Sent back in time to prevent a climate catastrophy, Radio-operator Fay approaches Bent Svensson, a retired physicist, in hopes that his work an algae-based power source could save the world.\n\nPros: The story is interesting, having a slightly dark tone to it. You alternate between characters, viewing the story through their eyes, or through the way they tell their story. All cut-scenes are comicbook-styled boxes and text bubbles, while the gameplay scenes all appears hand-drawn in the most classical fashion of Point & Click games, topped with often dramatic tone-setting music. You must regularly interact with the environment and/or your inventory to solve puzzles, while standalone single-screen puzzles may be skipped after a few attempts, for those who want to.\n\nCons: The immersion is totally broken by the bad voice acting. The voices themselves would portray the characters fine for the most part while other times it's just silly, but the lack of any conviction in the way the dialog is so blatantly read directly off the script is what kills it. There are sync problems with the cutscenes, with reading pauses when the text changes line, sometimes even in mid sentence! There are a few translation glitches in some subtitles or interactions, and in a variety of languages, too (I saw some French and I believe some Russian, while playing the English version). The sprite animation is very frame-by-frame and not very smooth.\n\nVerdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to you\n\nI may have been harsh on the game's technical and audio flaws, but I nevertheless enjoyed my ride through the story. Sometimes optimistic, sometimes bitter, the game really made me wonder whether it would have a happy ending or not.

Outside of the obvious issues that the topic of time travel always carry with it (poorly thought out ramifications to actions being foremost on that list), the real issue with this game is that, since the sotry is so cliche, it really needs strong gameplay and voice acting to make it worth slogging though. The puzzles are in fact decent. Nothing too mind bending, but on the low end of Daedalic par for the course. The voice acting, however, is simply atrocious. If you are going to spend 10 or so hours with an adventure game, and the story is sub par, the voice acting better be on point.

It's fairly short, if you're dedicated to playing it, then it shouldn't take more than about 6 hours.

Prepare to hear a lot of clicks.\n\nMusic: Enjoyable enough to make this game a less arduous task.\n\nControls: Not really a fan of the “left click to bring up options wheel” scheme when left click is also move. Right click opens/closes your inventory.\n\nDid I Finish It: Yes.\n\nWill I Play it Again: If I really am bored and want to grab the four remaining achievements, maybe. I doubt that'll be any time soon though.\n\nShould You Buy It: If you really wanted to play every point and click adventure on Steam, you could probably do worse than this.","October 4, 2014","true","8.6"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Others also seem to 'overact'. Fays posture is also terrible, nobody can stand like that with a normally shaped spine.\n\nAnyways; the rest of the game is decent, but you will probably need a guide at some of the puzzles. There is normally a reset button, on only one puzzles (water pumps) it's possible to ♥♥♥♥up so you need to reload. Note that the game does not autosave outside of remembering where you are, so you must save in order to get around this one puzzle if you want the achievement for playing all minigames. I also had Fay get stuck at one point, forcing be to reload from a save.\n\nIt also has some weird bugs; for example a rock/plank puzzle I was obviously supposed to walk over the plank, then  pick it up and put it towards the next rock, but when I clicked to pick up the plank, Fay would walk over to the rock I was on before, then pick it up. She did this three times before she finally decided to pick it up on the rock she was supposed to be on. Had it not been such an obvious solution I would have thought I did something wrong and backtracked/messed about other things for a long time. I assume the puzzle requires perfect positioning or something.\nAlso 2 times in the game were the 'use item' options in Russian and near the end at an important scene the subtitles is in German with no English voiceacting. Very annoying.\n\nSome of the achievements are also mutually exclusive, so a save must be made before some puzzles/encounters to make life easier.\n\nThe story is about saving the world from environmental disaster, so yes, there is quite a lot of talk about saving the environment and all life is precious etc. It did not bother me much as it was part of the story.\nThe story is long, 12 hours+ without skipping anything and the ending was imo very interesting.\n\nRecommended; but be aware of possible bugs, lacking voice acting, and environmental talks. Save often in many slots, and keep a guide at hand for the most complicated puzzles.","May 19, 2015","true","14.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

I really did. Unfortunately, upon starting the game and playing through the very first puzzle, the chump that designed it decided it would be hilarious if they hid one of the items that you needed to solve the puzzle inside of the most illogical and horrifically stupid places possible. The methodology in which the first puzzle was completed was pretty much the way that a human being would have solved it after drinking a gallon of bleach while boiling their head in a vat of prune juice. First puzzle aside, the second puzzle was more enjoyable and the storyline progressed interestingly. However, it was at this point that my sound suddenly stopped working. I checked to see if I had accidentally hit my mute button, I triple checked the in-game sound volume, and I restarted my game about six times to try to get it to work. Alas, the sound did not return and the game decided to add further insult to injury by somehow eradicating my autosave and all of the progress that I had made so far. So yeah. I really wanted to play this game. Unfortunately, I could not play it in the end and I would rather watch someone else play it on YouTube so I don't have to experience the frustration of not only solving irrational and illogical puzzles but solving technical issues as well.","April 2, 2013","false","2.6"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","13","22","0","1"

I really got attached to the characters as the story progressed. This is a hard thing to do, but Daedalic has made it a red thread throughout their catalogue.\n\nTechnically you can see that this game has come of age, but it is a visually beautiful game. With great detail in the scenery, and nice classicaly animated characters, It holds up well. The cutscenes are done in a cartoon strip way and with little animation, but it does fit the style of the game, and I totally buy it, and get sucked right into the story.\n\nThe only real downside of the game as I see it, is that the audio sometimes break the immersion. There are some points in the game where characters speak or react in a tone that isn't natural. This does however only occur a few places, and the music and the rest of the dialogue makes up for it.\n\nI really recommend this game to any point and click fan!\n\nPS: Thought I spotted some nuclear plant pipes on the Oslo skyline, Daedalic.

The voice acting is terrible at times, and the voice audio is so choppy I didn't know if I could get used to it; but I eventually tuned it out because I wanted to see what happen's. Sometimes the actor's emotion doesn't match the emotion of the dialogue, which is also very annoying. Another big con for me is it's only in 4:3 ratio and no widescreen option is available, or coming. You would think all new games these days would take advantage of the whole screen. Another really annoying flaw.\n\nUsually I get quickly bored with point-and-click adventures, but for some strange reason, despite it's many flaws, I'm compelled to keep playing and see it to the end.

Still, most of the art is great (again, very much a throwback to the old LucasArts and Sierra games of my youth) and the score is wonderful as well. The script and voice acting at times leave a little something to be desired, but for whatever reason I actually found the voice actors' stiffness to be somewhat charming.

And while it's a much more serious game it does suffer from a lot of minor problems that spoil a reasonable point-n-click adventure.\n\nFirstly the tone is rather grim and layers on with some really heavy handed moralising about carbon emissions. There are some odd disjoints with our eco hero killing a bird he had just been talking to, seemingly without a care in the world.\n\nThe story is one of time travel, climate change, eco-terrorism, murder, corporate espionage and regrets. Sounds fun doesn't it. Sadly there are attempts to make the plot appear dynamic and urgent but the laconic movement and speech of the characters strip every ounce of drama way.\n\nIt doesn't help that our hero is called Bent Svenson and referred to as Bent continually and visually depicted as hunched over. This is counter balanced by the perky and optimistic Fay from the future whose odd posture has her back constantly arched with her breasts pointing skyward.\n\nThe voice acting stands out as particularly poor in the English version. The lead male character speaks with the same deadened tone if he is examining a phonebook, finding a dying friend or staging a dramatic escape. Similarly the lead female has the same chirpy readings no matter what the situation. Just as bad are the stock phrases that Bent utters, I never want to hear a character again utter "I am a Scientist. Not some sort of Dada artist." ever again.\n\nI was put in mind of a badly dubbed foreign movie where the tone was lost on the voice actor and so the performance feels mismatched to the situation. Despite this initial irritation I started to enjoy the ineptness of the voice performances, being a sucker for bad sci-fi movies I got more out of the game once I viewed it in that light.\n\nBy the time the game ended I was left wondering what the point of the time-travel plot was as the game would have played the same without it. Worse still I was left wondering what impact the events had on the future, which is what I was expecting to be the point of the game.\n\nThe Good:\n*The story is both interesting and underused.\n*The inventory and interaction system is simple and effective.\n*I was very rarely stuck for what to do, if a few puzzles were poorly explained.\n*Spacebar reveals all clickables in an area.\n*The visuals are all good, especially the backdrops.\n*The comic strip cut scenes were an interesting visual delivery method.\n*Clicking skips repeated dialogue, double clicks speed you to exits.\n\nThe Bad:\n*Terrible voice acting. The sound is clear but the actors obviously didn't rehearse, record together or care.\n*The stock 'I can't do that' phrases for Bent repeat often and sound really silly.\n*Dramatic scenes are setup as time sensitive but in reality are slow paced.\n*Some actions aren't translated into English, but you can figure them out.\n*Lack of puzzle variety.\n*The antenna puzzle was an early example of a simple puzzle made difficult through lack of information.\n*There are several deaths, some on screen and with blood, that seem to have zero impact on the characters or story.\n\nRecommended for:\nMature Point-and-click fans who like James Bondesque bombastic plotting, hammy sci-fi, badly dubbed movies and an interesting in climate change.\n\nConclusion.\n5/10. A decent idea with good mechanics and visuals ruined by poor English translation, nonsensical character actions and a grand plot idea that loses direction.","November 26, 2013","true","12.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It started with a cliche about saving the world and I thought it was going to be one of those dull sci-fi plots but as the story progressed, a lot of issues were explored with regards to that theme. The costs and consequences of our actions on the environment, the triggers needed to make us change our habits, and the ethos of different minded-individuals were questioned. The dramatics were well played out; the soundtrack compliments each scene perfectly, the build-ups to climatic events were exciting, and the graphics were outstanding in their details -- the images used had the right angles and impacts on the viewer. The game mechanics are simple, based on interactions with the environment through point-and-click. The challenging part of the game is more of its mental aspect. You have to use a bit of logic and maintain a lot of awareness of your environment or else you will miss out items or tasks integral to the story's progress. What I really like about this visual novel is its comic-styled graphics. It's like seeing a comic book played out in motion to you during its cut scenes and it places you in the comic book world when you are playing the game. Aside from a few subtitle errors and delays as well as frustrations that come with figuring things out, this game is a great puzzle action game. Also, it helps that you can skip some of the mind-boggling puzzles. You can get Steam achievements out of succeeding them as well as skipping them. Is it replayable? If you are an achievement-♥♥♥♥♥, then yes, there are things to play for so make multiple saves at various points if you do not wish to go back to the beginning all over again. If not, once is enough, which is about the only other discouragement from getting the game.","June 3, 2014","true","14.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You can either skip the mini game (they allow you) or you can restart and try again.\n\nBug 3: When you get the guard drunk towards the end you'll have to steal his keys. Here's where the bug can come in. If you don't replace his keys with the keys you have in your inventory you wont be able to move out from behind the table.\n\nThat being said I'd give gameplay and only the gameplay a 7/10","February 23, 2014","true","17.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

As a game, I really enjoyed the puzzle-solving aspect and the beautiful, hand-drawn backgrounds (though the character animation leaves a little to be desired - Fay's posture and walk are perplexing, to say the least). Like many good point-and-click adventure games, the puzzles involve thoroughly searching your surroundings to find needed objects, and then figuring out where and how to use them. Other times, making certain dialogue choices when interacting with other characters will lead you to your goals. I got stumped quite often - sometimes I'd just fumble into the right solution, and other times I'd work it out logically - but in the case of the latter, there were many times when I'd think I was on the right track, only to find I was still several steps away from the solution. While there are harder adventure and puzzle games out there, at least this one can be enjoyable for people who are both fans of the genre and newcomers.\n\nWhat may make the game less palatable is the story - if the heavy-handed, sometimes unintentionally-funny preaching about global warming doesn't put off even the environmentally-conscience, then the ending that seems to go against everything the rest of the game stood for probably will. The game's plot doesn't stay focused on one reason for mankind's destruction, shifting from global warming to a more catastrophic event, and then there's something about a solar flare which is going to wipe out everyone, anyway, no matter what they do to the environment. (Seriously, pick one disaster and go with it!) And the ending kind of makes you feel like it was all for nothing, along with leaving several questions unanswered.\n\nThe voice acting is mediocre - I've seen some pretty harsh criticisms of it, but I've heard worse, so I wasn't terribly bothered by it. Sometimes it doesn't match the onscreen text or gets details confused. Examples: "Chrome Dome" is said in one scene where the words "Bald Pate" are clearly spelled out, and at another point, the dialogue can't decide if it's DH54 algae or DH45 algae. Also, use the knife on Bent in the final puzzle if you want to see Fay mouth two lines of text in German (the game's original language) with no voiceover. These issues, plus weird glitches like dialogue cutting off at the end of a sentence and poorly matched lip-synching give the impression of a lack of polish for the English translation.\n\nOh yes, the world's savior is named Bent Svensson. Yeah, I know, maybe it's a legit Norwegian name, or maybe it's short for Bentley. It still sounds hilarious to English-speaking audiences.\n\nRating: 2.5/5","July 12, 2014","true","17.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

And while it's a much more serious game it does suffer from a lot of minor problems that spoil a reasonable point-n-click adventure.\n\nFirstly the tone is rather grim and layers on with some really heavy handed moralising about carbon emissions. There are some odd disjoints with our eco hero killing a bird he had just been talking to, seemingly without a care in the world.\n\nThe story is one of time travel, climate change, eco-terrorism, murder, corporate espionage and regrets. Sounds fun doesn't it. Sadly there are attempts to make the plot appear dynamic and urgent but the laconic movement and speech of the characters strip every ounce of drama way.\n\nIt doesn't help that our hero is called Bent Svenson and referred to as Bent continually and visually depicted as hunched over. This is counter balanced by the perky and optimistic Fay from the future whose odd posture has her back constantly arched with her breasts pointing skyward.\n\nThe voice acting stands out as particularly poor in the English version. The lead male character speaks with the same deadened tone if he is examining a phonebook, finding a dying friend or staging a dramatic escape. Similarly the lead female has the same chirpy readings no matter what the situation. Just as bad are the stock phrases that Bent utters, I never want to hear a character again utter "I am a Scientist. Not some sort of Dada artist." ever again.\n\nI was put in mind of a badly dubbed foreign movie where the tone was lost on the voice actor and so the performance feels mismatched to the situation. Despite this initial irritation I started to enjoy the ineptness of the voice performances, being a sucker for bad sci-fi movies I got more out of the game once I viewed it in that light.\n\nBy the time the game ended I was left wondering what the point of the time-travel plot was as the game would have played the same without it. Worse still I was left wondering what impact the events had on the future, which is what I was expecting to be the point of the game.\n\nThe Good:\n*The story is both interesting and underused.\n*The inventory and interaction system is simple and effective.\n*I was very rarely stuck for what to do, if a few puzzles were poorly explained.\n*Spacebar reveals all clickables in an area.\n*The visuals are all good, especially the backdrops.\n*The comic strip cut scenes were an interesting visual delivery method.\n*Clicking skips repeated dialogue, double clicks speed you to exits.\n\nThe Bad:\n*Terrible voice acting. The sound is clear but the actors obviously didn't rehearse, record together or care.\n*The stock 'I can't do that' phrases for Bent repeat often and sound really silly.\n*Dramatic scenes are setup as time sensitive but in reality are slow paced.\n*Some actions aren't translated into English, but you can figure them out.\n*Lack of puzzle variety.\n*The antenna puzzle was an early example of a simple puzzle made difficult through lack of information.\n*There are several deaths, some on screen and with blood, that seem to have zero impact on the characters or story.\n\nRecommended for:\nMature Point-and-click fans who like James Bondesque bombastic plotting, hammy sci-fi, badly dubbed movies and an interesting in climate change.\n\nConclusion.\n5/10. A decent idea with good mechanics and visuals ruined by poor English translation, nonsensical character actions and a grand plot idea that loses direction.","November 26, 2013","true","12.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It started with a cliche about saving the world and I thought it was going to be one of those dull sci-fi plots but as the story progressed, a lot of issues were explored with regards to that theme. The costs and consequences of our actions on the environment, the triggers needed to make us change our habits, and the ethos of different minded-individuals were questioned. The dramatics were well played out; the soundtrack compliments each scene perfectly, the build-ups to climatic events were exciting, and the graphics were outstanding in their details -- the images used had the right angles and impacts on the viewer. The game mechanics are simple, based on interactions with the environment through point-and-click. The challenging part of the game is more of its mental aspect. You have to use a bit of logic and maintain a lot of awareness of your environment or else you will miss out items or tasks integral to the story's progress. What I really like about this visual novel is its comic-styled graphics. It's like seeing a comic book played out in motion to you during its cut scenes and it places you in the comic book world when you are playing the game. Aside from a few subtitle errors and delays as well as frustrations that come with figuring things out, this game is a great puzzle action game. Also, it helps that you can skip some of the mind-boggling puzzles. You can get Steam achievements out of succeeding them as well as skipping them. Is it replayable? If you are an achievement-♥♥♥♥♥, then yes, there are things to play for so make multiple saves at various points if you do not wish to go back to the beginning all over again. If not, once is enough, which is about the only other discouragement from getting the game.","June 3, 2014","true","14.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

What to do and say about the things the band recorded before finding their own style and making a breakthrough? Listening to that may present new perspectives on their best work but is that reason enough to actually try and enjoy it on its own merits? This is the question I thought often during my hours with A New Beginning, one of the first titles from my recent favorite, Daedalic Entertainment.\n\nMany key strengths presented later are already here, particularly those related to craftsmanship. The whole of the story is well laid out and plotted, with twists all in place and the whole progressing logically throughout with interesting puzzles challenging the brain. Another trademark is the orchestral soundtrack covering a wide range of moods and emotions. And finally comes of course the hand-made art showing once again that no tesselations can ever replace the human touch.\n\nMaking parts and assembling them is one thing but then breathing life into the result is another and this is where the game sadly does not succeed. The eco-conscious bent of the story is laudable but the tone is too educational and the contrasts are simply much too black-and-white. There was no room to disagree about anything or anyone or make alternative interpretations to what the writing told me. Consequently there was an airless quality to the entire experience. No characters had enough detail to give them life beyond caricatures with calculated positions in the story (and the message). Dialogue contained many odd phrases that smack of poor translation. A grim security officer shuts off doubt with "Fiddlesticks!" and in more than one life-threatening situation "Good grief" gets used too.\n\nThese lecture-like qualities are made even drier by problems in presentation. The voice acting was of very poor quality throughout, there is simply no way around it. The entire cast managed to sound colorless as if concentrating on clear pronunciation and nothing else. The worst offender was perhaps the female lead who sounded so shrill and robotically cheerful I yearned for Lydia for the first time in my life. And while the artists did their best with the milieus there is only so much anyone can do with oil rigs and conference halls from 1982 where most of the action take place. The date makes sense from the thematic perspective but wastes the promise in the strong first chapter in the game, which happens in the future and has an interesting storytelling idea that was thrown out for the rest of the game. It is also unfortunate that while the places in this eco-thriller include Norway and Brazil the natural sights are not shown, unlike helicopter interiors or pump rooms. Overall the aesthetics are best described as having a metallic, inorganic quality to them which contrasts completely with the other Daedalic adventures I have seen so far.\n\nServing as the final coffin nail were many technical flaws and issues. First off, this is a game from 2010 -- without widescreen support. I had to set my screen resolution to 1024 x 768 before starting the game to avoid the black borders. Granted, the game did look good then but it was an odd thing to do regardless. The game is also littered with typos and words from other languages, including Spanish and Russian. "Grapeseed oil" without the G was the most unintentionally chilling typo I have seen in quite some time.\n\nI wanted to like A New Beginning and it actually feels a bit unfair to lay out so much criticism to an indie adventure made with very limited resources. But no matter what the comparison, the genre classics, contemporary games from other studios or other Daedalic adventures, A New Beginning falls short and cannot truly be enjoyed on its own either. I gained more insight than pleasure from my gametime and would recommend others interested in the genre to look at other options instead. Early demos or shaky debuts from good and great bands may find their way into record collections on the strength on their other albums but cannot truly be recommended to those without fan powers.","June 12, 2014","false","9.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Furthermore, combining an item in your inventory with another item in your inventory is another inexistent or superficial aspect of this game; most of puzzles are so intuitive that you are almost guided through the solution, so as you see from my playtime, you can easily complete the game in few hours, which is ridiculous if i remember how many years i spent in '80-'90 era, by playing games of the same genre.\n\nIn summary, i'm not crazy for this adventure, but i can't even say it's bad, considering that art and storyline are pretty good.

On the one hand, it has an ambitious story, a classic look and feel, pleasant music, puzzles which are challenging without being too terribly difficult (in most cases).  On the other hand, some of the puzzles were quite cryptic, and there are some bugs.  I saw a number of times where the popup choices on an item would suddenly show up in Russian; a few times where clicking on hotspots was simply ignored and I had to close out of the game through Task Manager and load an earlier save; a few times where dialog interactions would go by at the speed of light, important information was missed and I had to load an earlier save; once where I had clicked on an item to interact while the character was moving to use a dialog tree, the mouse was snapped to the item interaction but the game was waiting for dialog interaction--again, had to quit through Task Manager and reload.\n\nThat said, despite the bugs, despite the stilted voice acting, despite small and easily-missed hotspots that are required to proceed and can make you wander around for half an hour at a time, there is a well-crafted story in this game.  Just be prepared to overlook a lot of flaws to find it.  Of course, if you're a fan of the point-and-click adventure format, you're probably used to doing that.\n\nFinal verdict: Worthwhile, but wait for at least 50% off.","November 13, 2014","true","20.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a decent story, putting emphasis on an issue relevant to us today: the irreversible situation of uncontrolled enviromental damage (climate change influenced by man's actions). Or as the game would have it... reversible through time travel. The puzzles aren't very hard and they are even skippable if you can't figure them out in a few minutes. The game isn't very long, about 5-6 hours, which is both a strength, because it doesn't waste time with irrelevant details and makes the story more concentrated, and a weakness, because who doesn't want more of a good thing?\n\nOverall it's a very enjoyable experience, my only tips would be a) change spoken language to German because the voice acting in English is terrible to say the least (you can do this from the panel with little bubbles that contain flags, in the main menu as you start the game), it's very robotic - you can keep subtitles in English so you understand what's being said though; b) don't try to rush actions as the game can bug out, you can also speed things up by double-clicking the areas where the cursor changes into arrows for fast-loading (so you don't have to wait for animations to finish each time).","December 1, 2014","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But decent puzzle design. Buy it cheap, try to ignore the story and you’ll have a decent time with it.\n\nFull review:  You play as Bent Svensson, a retired and miserable algae researcher, and Fay, a time-travelling radio operator sent from the future to save humanity from global warming. She will do so by getting people to use Svensson’s algae to produce energy instead of fossil fuels and atomic power. As characters they are… okay. You can have a lot of comments about Fay, but at least she is not Goal from Deponia, who spends the entire game unconscious and is nothing but the “Goal” for the male protagonist. Fay’s not particularly funny, but she’s okay to play as. Same with Bent, not the most uplifting character, but decently portrayed. This can be contrasted with some of the side-characters that are just god-awful. Especially Duve, Bent’s son, who I would say is probably one of the worst designed characters I’ve even seen. The voice-acting also ranges from decent to pretty bad, though I often got the feeling it was not the voice-actors fault but rather how they recorded and handled the audio files.\n\nThe story is pretty stupid. Time-travel tends to bring that out in a story, but unfortunately it is not limited to just the time-travel. I appreciate the message they are trying to convey, I really do. Unfortunately it is told in such a heavy-handed manner and in such simplistic terms that it loses all meaning and is very unlikely to convince anyone. After a while they try to go a little deeper into the issues, but it is too little too late.  Other than that, the story is functional if uninteresting throughout most of the game… until the finale, which just utterly sucks. For the sake of a “twist” they completely disregard everything that has happened previously and what little rationale they had for their characters suddenly vanish. I mean, if the ending is true, why is Bent even in the game at all? Incredibly poorly written.\n\nThe puzzles then. They are the standard Deadalic mix of item-based puzzles with some minigames thrown in to add variety. Overall I found the puzzle design pretty good and really the only reason to play the game. Just like other games of the genre there were some instances of puzzles not making that much sense, but these instances were comparatively few. On the other hand, there are also no real head-scratchers or anything particularly inventive about the puzzles either. Pretty bog-standard.\n\nSo, why am I even recommending this game? Because the puzzles are pretty nice. And even though the story is not very good, it was not until the very end that it’s really awful. It’s an average title that you should buy cheap and play for the puzzles.

Made sense, was entertaining and rarely ever was I stuck. I'd like to see more in this style, it is unique, conveys drama and action in ways effective and appealing.\n\nWhat I didn't like so much was that several times (I'm in the English version) I had Russian labels for the left-click-and-hold menu, 2-3 times the menu would not trigger fully for several attempts (the laundry machine "search" for example), so I was stuck there and had to look up what was supposed to happen. And some storyline elements did not make sense (how would nuclear power plants destroy the Brazilian ecosystem if there is no accident? How can the Stevenson generator make no sense for an underground community if ... that is what they use?).\n\nOverall recommended but a certain polish is missing in my opinion for a "final cut".

The story is quite good as well. The environmentalist themes, although present throughout the plot, never get too preachy, and in the end the game comes across as a tale of personal redemption.\n\nThe puzzles are pretty solid. None of them are super far-fetched (I, for one, didn't feel the need to use a guide) but don't expect any huge moments of "A-ha!" either.\n\nI would go as far as say the sound design is lacklustre. The soundtrack is held-back and sparse, there are sections with no ambience whatsoever, and some of the sound effects are, frankly, awful (the car engine sound, for example). The English acting simply doesn't work at all, playing with subtitles over the original German cast is recommended.\n\nThe game, although finishable, is buggy. Some translations are not tagged properly in the data files, occasionally showing bits of text in foreign languages (e.g. Russian). Also, I'm almost certain that a few hotspots don't show up and work 100% consistently.","August 14, 2015","true","11.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If that is unacceptable stop reading now, I shall quickly summarize here: this game should be a 7/10 but is quite buggy so unfortunately I can only reward it a 5 or 6. The graphical style and voice acting are very nice and the storyline is somewhat engaging. If you are a fan of the genre then it is worth a try. None of the bugs I encountered broke the game and if you are willing to look past that then you may indeed rank the game higher.\n\n\nSo my quest to play all and review my games library finally got to A. Unfortunately my magpie sense tingled and I recently purchased another bundle which has set me back onto the numbers. Also steam recently reclassified this game into N which I suppose makes sense but its irked me a bit. Mind that is a issue I need to take with steam and not this game.\n\nSo this is a point and click 2d game, and a pretty competent one at that. You play as one of two characters that you change between during the story, Bent, an Eco scientist, and Fay who is a time traveler from a despotic future ruined by climate change. They are trying to create a green fuel and make it the primary power source for the world as to prevent the future. I ended up enjoying the characters I was playing as. They both seem to have well thought out personalities, there isn't tonnes of back story for them though, and they do focus a lot on the environment. I have a friend who has played this game who says that they found it very preachy and there is a little bit of that, but it is to be expected. They both have dedicated their lives to this working out after all.\n\nThe game has 2 main sections, one is your traditional 2d point and clicking, inventory puzzles and dialogue trees etc. the second is a single screen puzzle that you have to solve.\nA big problem I have seen with modern point and click games is that the difficulty level is much reduced. This is to encompass the casual tablet crowd as the lowest common denominator reaches the biggest market, and as a nerdy amiga/dosbox owning girl, I like my old school point and clicks. This game has a really nice feature which is rather than making all the interactive items stand out it keeps them plain in the background, however, holding down space will light them up. Also in the single screen puzzles which can take a while to figure out there is a skip button. I didn't use space or skip any of the puzzles but it is nice to see that they are optional. I do find the skip button a bit annoying as I feel that if you can't beat a game then you need to suck it up rather than whining to the developers to make it easier and easier however I do prefer it to them simplifying it even more. Modern point and click can be very bittersweet but this one is much more sweet than some of the rubbish on my friend's ipad.\n\nThere is one place that this game seriously falls down though, and thats in the Quality Assurance. I understand that English is not the first language of the developers, and I do want to take it easy on them, but it is a taint that makes what would be an adept example of the genre unfortunately adequate. It's a shame too, because a thorough testing session should have picked these up and it comes off feeling a bit lazy and sloppy, but the rest of the game wasn't. I really do feel for the developers and I hope that people don't criticise them too hard for this.\nThe game has numerous spelling errors but as I say, not a first language. However often the dialogue on the screen and the vocal speech are different and using completely different, albeit similar words. I found that the on screen text tended to be a bit more detailed than the dialogue so I treated that as canon. There was also an instance where a character was saying dialogue choice one when he should have been saying choice two. There are a few parts in the game where you can click to move your character into a spot where they shouldn't go, and they wander off getting smaller and smaller until they are but a pixel. Again, this is not the fault of the programmers. Character scaling while walking off into the distance is a good thing, these are boundaries that QA should be pointing out. Another time I got stuck in a bar, I could not get him out no matter how hard I tried, luckily an exit was just in view and I could double click to fast travel him out. Late in chapter 6 clicking on an inventory item was giving me dialogue all the way back from chapter 2. I'm sure if I was willing to give it a second play through I could find more bugs now that I know some of the triggers.\nIt is a shame it is so buggy but please don't let that put you off. If you like the genre there is nothing wrong with this game at all, just maybe think about waiting for a sale.\nI have other games from these guys, really looking forward to getting round to them!","July 10, 2014","true","27.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, the english version of the game has some pretty poor voice acting/english dialogue. Also, the gameplay was very linear in how you could solve the puzzles.\n\nPros - Great enviroments; the most memorable part of the game is at the beginning of the game in a post-apocalypse sci-fi enviroment. The art is beautiful. The story was gripping (until the end). There was also talk about philosophy, morality, and ethics. A good message at the end. I also enjoyed many of the characters, even a few which only appeared for a short amount of time. And, I enjoyed many of the puzzles in the game except that I thought some of them were a bit too straight forward. I like the self-awarness that the game had. For example, there is this part when you make this sci-fi antenna which had a frustrating yet satisfying part with the cubes. For the rest of the game the cubes were mentioned as being stupidly difficult.\n\nCons - People just don't talk like they do in the game. I suspect that the dialogue was originally written in a different language and translated to english. When I heard a character say something in a strange way, it took me out of the game momentarily. Also, the ending kind of rubbed me the wrong way. The game seemed to be building up to something but then the ending was predictable and implausible. Actually, several times during the game, there were details which were implausible even in the context of the sci-fi story. Also, some of the characters were very one-dimensional, like the main villan.\n\nOver all, I recommend the game if you enjoy adventure games with an interesting message and a good amount of attention paid to deatil.","July 27, 2014","true","17.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LukeWing/recommended/105000/","LukeWing","Griever","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LukeWing/","296 products in account","A New Beginning is a wonderfully crafted Point & Click adventure from Daedelic which weaves an intricate story around real world issues, namely climate change. The story is well paced and surprisingly enjoyable considering the premise and along with the subtle humour it results in a fun time which is arguably well spent. To help retain your attention the game jumps between contrasting environments and relies on a small cast of main characters to carry the story towards it's conclusion all the while fleshing out those individuals and subtly explaining how the events affect them on a personal level.\n\nYou play as both Bent Svenson and a mysterous woman called Faye who become involved in a plot that promises to change the world as we know it and then some. Both characters bring something fresh and new to the table, where Bent isn't exactly a spring chicken, he does have a sharp mind and deep pockets. His limitations are often covered by Faye as she goes to great lengths to achieve her goal but is limited by her naivety and her smaller pockets. The people they come into contact with are usually affected in some form or another in order to fully immerse the player in each sequence of events and make them think that their actions matter.\n\nThe voice acting for the main characters is very good as it helps to make them relatable and makes the events that transpire all the more harrowing when it directly involves them. Other characters such as Duve (pronounced Du-va) and Oggy show significant character progression over the course of the game which ultimately makes them likable people despite their inital negative impression and that is primarily down to their voice actors doing such a temendous job.\n\nPoint & Clicks are not known for their innovation so don't expect Batman: Arkham Asylum-style controls, but as this genre goes, A New Beginning does try to initivate where it can. A simple right click will bring up the inventory to use items, which is useful as it does not obstruct 10% of the scenery but the fact that it will not appear if the cursor is hovered over where it is makes the process needlessly elongated. In a game where many items are used on many things this small problem does become irritating. Other negatives include the subtitles occasionally not matching up with the dialogue from the characters which again is a small problem, but the fact it happens numerous times, does make it notable. The story also seems to tie up certain plot points rather abruptly or unsatisfactorily towards the middle of the game which leave the player confused and the wonderful music that often accompanies big moments is often missing through the majority of the game.\n\nOverall though A New Beginning is an incredibly fascinating piece that takes a controversial topic and makes it into art. That alone is worth praise in a market where Dev's just love to copy the concepts of War, Religion and violence from each other in order to make money. The fact that the plot is interesting, the characters are memorable and the in-game atmosphere is tense makes A New Beginning a good place to start for young gamers looking to get into the medium and old school adventurers who crave mind-bending puzzles and a thrilling story.","May 6, 2014","true","14.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atebash/recommended/105000/","atebash","Atebash","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atebash/","1019 products in account","A New Beginning is a classic point-and-click adventure made by Daedalic Entertainment in 2010. I've recently played and completed it and I wanted to share my thoughts about it with you. Also, it's currently on a week-long sale on Steam so you can save some money if you decide to get it.\n\nThe story of A New Beginning is set in the future where Earth is devastated by climate changes and human kind is facing extinction. A group of scientists sets up a team, provides them with a time travelling device and gives them a mission: go back in time and prevent the disaster! Their goal is Bent Svensson, an eco-scientist who "invented" blue-green algae that can supply enough energy to power the entire world... but is unfortunate enough to live in the time where money is everything and is impossible to fight the nuclear energy tycoons who pull all the strings. That time is late 20th century. During the game you will be playing with two characters: Fay, a radio-operator from the future and Bent Svensson, the scientist I mentioned before. You don't get to pick a character to control, instead the game switches from one to the other as the story progresses.\n\nAs I said, it's a typical point-and-click adventure with an incredibly simple interface and controls - right mouse button brings up the inventory on the bottom of the screen, while left mouse button moves your character and offers actions for highlighted objects. That's it - simple and easy. The puzzles in the game range from super easy to normal, they are rather logical and there are never too many available rooms in the same time, so getting stuck is nearly impossible. The only problem may be caused by the infamous pixel hunting, but it's far from annoying as in some other adventures. If I remember right, I only had problems with two items I couldn't see and one was at the very beginning.\n\nVoice acting is average. Some lines are rather good, but most are plain average. Same goes with graphics - it's just average. Cut scenes are made in a comic book fashion with "low frame rate" and the rest... well, look at the screenshots I posted. However, this being an adventure game, neither the sound nor graphics are all that important!\n\nIt took me about 9 hours to complete the game and if it wasn't for a bug I encountered I may have been even quicker. The bug I mentioned was at the very end when I had to connect some wires to get specific numbers, but after about 45 minutes of futile reconfiguring, I gave up and looked up the solution online. I was puzzled when I saw the solution because I already tried it and it didn't work. It did, after a reload. The other bugs are mainly language errors: when you click on an object you might get possible actions in a language different than the one you chose, but it really is a minor thing.\n\nOverall, it's a fun game. It has its flaws, but its simplicity makes it fun. The story progresses fast enough to make you want to see what comes next and that's what's really important. Steam version has 28 achievements and they are all rather easy to get if you don't skip mini games and explore everything on the screen.","April 10, 2014","true","17.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sure, the climate thing seems tired and apparently there are a few games about the climate out there, but people are over the subject I guess because it's all over the news all the time. Maybe we should have elves and orcs in the news more so we don't have to put up with more games featuring them.\n\nAnyway, if you can get past the voice acting, the occasional incorrect language error then you'll find a not too bad story.\n\nIf there was a button in between yes and no, that would be where this falls.\n2.6/5","November 13, 2015","true","19.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love how it has a comic feel to it at times. There are a couple things about this game I disliked\n1. Horrid voice acting/overs, just terriable.\n2.English version has mispelled words at times.\n3. Every once in a while the english point and click commands were in a different languge(but i had the commands pretty much memorized at that point)\nOver all I recomend this game, the good def outwieghed the bad and I wasn't bothered enough to stop playing.

It was ok. I've been playing point and clicks since LucasFilm so have a pretty extensive history with the genre. This game gets a 6.5 out of 10. Interesting enough to make me want to finish, but disappointed by how the game played out. The beginning was rich and interesting but about mid-way the creators ran out of steam and rushed the story telling and puzzles. Also, English is not the native language so one puzzle was unbelievably, insanely, impossible, "rip all my hair out until I'm bald", kind of puzzle. And it wasn't even a good puzzle :( The translation mean to they solution has no made no sense (Ok, it's not written bad like that but the puzzle just didn't work). Either way, I plowed through boring puzzles and all.\n\nLooks amazing the whole way through and it has an amazing atmosphere. The core of the plot is great as well. Deserves a run through because it's a real point and click and we don't see many these days.

He has of couse no intention of using the algae for fuel, but will insteed destroy the algae, so that nuclear power looks to be the only good way to stop pollution.\n\nBen and Fey are both great charecters, and they show a lot of potentiol in the game, I have a problem with the voiceacting thoe.\n\nNormally I can accept that voiceactors can be hard to come by, and don`t missunderstand me, it`s one of the hardest forms of acting, but in a point and click game, the voices and personas of the charecters in the game is so important, becouse the gameplay part is not a new invention or anything. The gameplay is a bit slow as you would expect, becouse it`s a point and click game. It is driven by the story, and this games story is great to follow, and some of the twists in the story is really well thought out.\n\nEventhough there is some bad voiceacting here and there (looking at you Fey) the story is great, and the overall experience is very good for a point and click game.\n\nOne minor thing to end on. I have troubles understanding why you can skip puzzels in the game. Now and again there will be puzzels in the game, and they are at times easy and other times hard. So why did they inclued a skip button? I mean don`t remove all the gameplay, let people think things out (or look it up, I know the gaming comunity to well by now).\n\nWell thats it, an ordinary pont and click game with a greaat story to share 6 out of 10","April 16, 2014","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They litter and pollute the environment.\n\nBack to the game.\n\nI really liked most of the voice acting. There were some parts where the story lacks of sufficient emotions but it's not so relevant.\n\nAmong the characters there were some weak and some strong too. To be honest I felt sorry for Fay when she died but I was happy because Salvador also died. The problem was mainly with the bad guys. They weren't so detailed and therefore you just sit here and think 'Yeah that's the bady guy and now comes the evil laugh...'.\n\nIf the story would have been a bit more detailed it would be better but I liked it anyway.\n\nDefinitely a 8/10 for me.\n\nBuy it when it's discounted - I bought it for 2,5 EUR - it's worth it.","December 30, 2014","true","17.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'd like to see more in this style, it is unique, conveys drama and action in ways effective and appealing.\n\nWhat I didn't like so much was that several times (I'm in the English version) I had Russian labels for the left-click-and-hold menu, 2-3 times the menu would not trigger fully for several attempts (the laundry machine "search" for example), so I was stuck there and had to look up what was supposed to happen. And some storyline elements did not make sense (how would nuclear power plants destroy the Brazilian ecosystem if there is no accident? How can the Stevenson generator make no sense for an underground community if ... that is what they use?).\n\nOverall recommended but a certain polish is missing in my opinion for a "final cut".

The story is quite good as well. The environmentalist themes, although present throughout the plot, never get too preachy, and in the end the game comes across as a tale of personal redemption.\n\nThe puzzles are pretty solid. None of them are super far-fetched (I, for one, didn't feel the need to use a guide) but don't expect any huge moments of "A-ha!" either.\n\nI would go as far as say the sound design is lacklustre. The soundtrack is held-back and sparse, there are sections with no ambience whatsoever, and some of the sound effects are, frankly, awful (the car engine sound, for example). The English acting simply doesn't work at all, playing with subtitles over the original German cast is recommended.\n\nThe game, although finishable, is buggy. Some translations are not tagged properly in the data files, occasionally showing bits of text in foreign languages (e.g. Russian).

Furthermore, combining an item in your inventory with another item in your inventory is another inexistent or superficial aspect of this game; most of puzzles are so intuitive that you are almost guided through the solution, so as you see from my playtime, you can easily complete the game in few hours, which is ridiculous if i remember how many years i spent in '80-'90 era, by playing games of the same genre.\n\nIn summary, i'm not crazy for this adventure, but i can't even say it's bad, considering that art and storyline are pretty good.

Ok, on with the review. This is a weird game, I don't know how to put it any other way. I love point and clicks, and the idea of one with a political relevent storyline appealed to me, so I picked this up. Unfortunately, the storyline is actually pretty nonsensical, which is a death-knell for a point and click. To be fair, it does manage to raise some interesting issues, but it doesn't do anything interesting with them. Also, characters often do/say things that make little sense, and really there are big structural issues in terms of how things play out, that conspire to make things barely coherant by the end (if you make it that long).\n\nOn the positive side, graphics are really quite good. Also, characters sometimes say things that are unintentionally pretty funny (I'm assuming because of an iffy translation). Also puzzles are okay I guess? Not really stand out, but not awful either.\n\nAll in all, this game is not terrible. If you really like point and clicks, you might get some mileage out of it. However, buy with caution, and be prepared to be let down by the storyline if you make it all the way through. 5/10","June 20, 2014","true","12.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The gameplay is solid with a nice art style, story, characters and logical puzzles. The English voice overs and occasional bug can break the flow of the game, also the climate change subject matter could be hit or miss. see below for more details\n\n"A New Beginning" is a sci-fi point n' click game that takes you on a journey to save the world from the irreversible effects of climate change. Daedalic take the eco subject matter straight on, which may appear as edgy or preachy, but whatever the case it's the purpose of the adventure.\n\nYou take control of one or two protagonists at separate times, each with their own purpose in the game - retired bioengineer Bent Swensson and his alternative energy theories, and radio operator Fay, from our doomed future. Both characters are easy to get along with, though Fay's English voiceover sounds too robotic. Playing though the game I took her robotic tone to reflect her "stoic" personality. It's been mentioned that the German voice overs carry more emotion.\n\nAs a point 'n click game you will spend most of the time walking from scene to scene talking with characters, and collecting this and that to solve puzzles. The puzzles in the game did not give me too much trouble, and that was because they're logical and made sense in their execution. I used the guide a couple of times, because I was invested in the story, and had to finish it! All access points and interactive objects will highlight the cursor when it's hovered over, but visually they are part of the environment and can make noticing some elements difficult. This is solved by pressing the space bar to highlight all access points and interactive objects. You can also double left-click to hasten moving between scenes.\n\nVisually, this game is really nice to look at. The hand-drawn art style of the characters and their animation is executed really well. The German to English translation has led to many spelling errors, grammar confusion. There are also miss matched numerical data in text/speech which should have been caught regardless. Music and sound effects in general help the game, but the voice overs really do fall flat. They re-used the the same voice actor for different characters, but just altered their tone/accent a little.\n\nThe game has bugged out on me a few times. Game crashing during a cutscene, which was solved by hitting esc to bypass it. I lost sound on one machine and couldn't get it back, at this point I had moved to another computer in the house anyway so I continued of that one.","May 27, 2014","true","15.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This is the first game of it's series I've played and while it isn't my usual cup of tea it is very much enjoyable. The story is simple enough to follow, so far anyway, and the gameplay is easy to pick up. The design and style of the game is different, with a classic cartoon feel, and it's one I feel partners the game well, and with the comic style dialogue too, gives texture to the game.\n\nPuzzles can be difficult but then when you do complete them you are surprised with yourself that you couldn't solve them any quicker. There is also a skip puzzle option for when you are stuck. What a life saver.\n\nWhile not the usual game I would consider playing, this is definitely worth picking up in a sale.","December 9, 2014","true","4.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

If you are looking for a old Point and Click games like Lucas Arts released long ago, there are options more suitable than this one out there. The biggest improvement in comparison to older adventure titles is the care put into puzzle mechanics. They don´t feel tedious, the logical distribution of the inventory carried throughout the game helps a lot. You will not carry more than 6 items at a time. This severely reduces the amount of times players will get stuck solving a puzzle. It is also notable that they were clever enough to lock areas where the players actions would not help progress the story.\n\nThe plot is entertaining enough to keep you playing but the characters are either too obvious, the kind that deducts immersion to the story.\n\n6.5/10","September 8, 2014","true","14.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The emotions are unstable and chaotic, fluctuating between too intense and frustratingly bland.\n- The female protagonist is clearly made by men. No further comment.\n- The puzzles involve a level of creativity I cannot seem to manifest within myself. Most item combinations require you to think far outside the box.\n\nOverall, I would recommend the game if you are a casual gamer that doesn't mind looking up help online.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/victorstan/recommended/105000/","victorstan","Riot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/victorstan/","85 products in account","I have to admit from the start: I am an adventure fanatic. I love point and click games and the adventure genre is probably the only one that can immerse me fully in the story, it feels at times like I am directing my own movie based on a very strict script. I have been playing a few titles from Daedalic lately and find them all to be pretty good, especially on the artwork side of things.\n\nA New Beginning is simply put: gorgeous! The sceneries are beautifully drawn and the comic book style cutscenes are beautiful, engaging and quite unique, I haven't seen them done in any other game so far. The only issue with the graphics side of things that I can find is the actual characters. They feel extremely out of place in some of the scenes, they difference in detail is quite striking at times and their placement in the scene looks off from time to time. A little more attention to animation and placement would have been nice to see. The interface is minimalistic and easy to access, there's no extra buttons to be pressed, a right click on the mouse and you can easily toggle the inventory.\n\nThe soundtrack is also great, the composed songs really fit the game and its circumstances so it also scores high points for sound design. The only issue that I can find with this game is voice acting. Seriously, this could have been a perfect game if not for the lousy voice acting. It really sounds like the actors read line after line without putting them into context, more like a monologue than a dialogue which sounds extremely silly at times and quite unprofessional. And speaking of lines, the script is quite poorly written. You get the feeling that the characters are either uneducated or plain ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Don't get me wrong, I don't expect people in a game to speak like a Literature PhD, but definitely not like someone who barely finished high school.\n\nSpeaking of the script I should also address the story. It's a little cliche if you ask me, the kind of story that reminds you of those 90's television-made movies that try to blend action with drama, but also convey a strong message and meaning while not bothering the viewer with questions and instead putting any answers straight on the table. A New Beginning also tries to send a message but it does poorly and scarcely and only focuses on this aspect by the end of the game. It also tries to do it via the aforementioned poor voice acting leaving you rather facepalmed and laughing out loud that deeply moved and touched. It does, however, make up for it in the final scene, which unfortunately appears right at the end of the credits which can be skipped so most of the players will definitely miss this one.\n\nAll in all this was a great game to play with an immersive story, great sound design and loads of puzzles ranging from moderate to hard and many actions that require out-of-the box thinking so it can be both challenging and frustrating at times. The game also has a seamless auto-save feature so if your game happens to crash just hit continue on the main screen (the autosave is not visible in the load menu).\n\nI give this one a 8.5/10","January 9, 2015","true","10.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I am not a professional video game reviewer.  I am not a professional journalist or writer.  I play and review games because I am a gamer and I enjoy doing so.  My opinions are just that, opinions.  Just because I like and recommend a purchase does not mean you have to agree with all or any of what I have said.  Please consider this while reading this review.  The goal is to share my personal opinions of a game, because I enjoy doing so, and in turn if it helps someone with their decision to purchase, then that is wonderful.\n\nReview\nI purchased "A New Beginning - Final Cut" because I am an adventure genre fan.  I hold these games in high regard since they are what officially started my obsession with PC gaming, back when Sierra reigned in the industry.\n\nI am aware of the rather mixed reviews that the game has received here on Steam in the reviews section, which is why I try to base all my reviews on value for the money.\n\nSome may disagree with this method, but it is the one I choose to use when it comes to older games.\n\nCurrently, at the time of writing this, the game is on sale for $2.49 which is what I paid.  Based on that cost I would definitely recommend this to any fans of the genre.  I will not hesitate to warn of the immediate problems with the game though.  The dialogue is quite juvenile and the voice acting is some of the worst I have ever heard in a game.  According to the research this is due to poor localization.  Apparently, in Germany where this game was made, there are not a lot of American (or other language) voice actors  available to do localization for games.  The dialogue though, I am not sure if it just translated poorly or was just that poorly written.\n\nStill, despite these flaws I was able to play through the story and overall, enjoy the experience.  It might not be the most original story, or the best written, but the way it is presented to me is fresh and enjoyable.  I find the art style and animation to be appealing and the little comic style cutscenes to be a good fit.  I would say the length of the game is just about right.  At about 8 hours for completion, this is just enough without being too drawn out, or too short.\n\nThere is a decent mix of simple puzzles and your typical item combinations that make this a decent classic adventure.\n\nSo, if you can overlook it's faults, and are an adventure game fan, I think you will enjoy this purchase.\n\nPros:\n- Appealing Art and style\n- Enjoyable soundtrack\n- Charming\n\nCons:\n- Voice Acting is abysmal\n- Poorly written dialogue (bad translation or just bad writing? Not sure)\n- Characters are unlikable (likely due to the above two points)","December 21, 2013","true","7.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The characters are cringe-worthy and largely unlikeable or unrelateable, and it's a shame that the polish of the rest of the game is interrupted by such amateur writing.\nFay is portrayed quite negatively as a highly-strung trope of a girl with idiotic naivety and rampantly uncontrolled emotions. Her looks and good heart seem to be her only selling points; it's as if the only reason she's on her time-travelling mission is because there were simply no others left for the job. (that may have been implied...? Can't recall.) She's scolded frequently by Bent Svensson for her emotional frailty--and I couldn't help feeling that her femininity was implied as the cause for that--and the very mechanics of the game set her up to fail in her own narrative. While playing through her perspective, I found myself only able to continue the story and solve the puzzles by doing something obviously *wrong*, to which Fay seemed to respond every time with giggles and suggestions of "whoops, oh well, I'm sure it doesn't matter." (paraphrasing slightly, but that's essentially it.) It's insulting. It doesn't build character, it alienates any players hoping to have someone intelligent, youthful and capable to align themselves with.\nAs for Bent Svensson, I don't even want to get started. The entire start of the game is completely uncompelling, having to play along a boring retiree fixing his motor and shunning all connections to humanity. He stares at pictures of his family mournfully, monologuing about how "oh, if I wasn't so focussed on saving the world, I might have had time to enjoy my wife before she passed away! I ruined my marriage with my higher calling! IF ONLY I WASN'T SO SELFLESS. Woe is me." Eeeeeuuuuurgh. Somehow I doubt his job is the reason his wife might have passed away feeling unloved in the marriage. He must also have pretty low opinions of his deceased wife and family, if he thinks they all put themselves before work that could solve problems for thousands/millions of people.\nHis odd combination of self-pity, self-doubt and inflated self-importance/righteousness make for very dreary dialogue. At one point you even have to repeat the phrase "I am not responsible for the whole world" into the phone to his therapist, before immediately being confronted with Fay telling Bent "YOu are the only one who can save the world!" The timing couldn't make me roll my eyes more. I cannot even imagine what that juxtaposition was meant to achieve, apart from recreating the typical everyman hero who manages to be important without having any admirable traits whatsoever.\nBent is abrasive, slow, perhaps realistic but certainly not the kind of realistic that makes for compelling drama or makes you want to root for the characters. More the type that you try to avoid in day-to-day life.\nFay and Bent could have been good foils for each other's characters, but Bent doesn't seem to hold enough respect for Fay for her to improve his character in any way, and instead of Fay's youthful exuberance being played out as a good counterbalance to Bent's dragged feet, the balance between the two doesn't quite match up. Perhaps the teeth-gratingly bad dialogue is due to poor translation, perhaps it wasn't even good to begin with. I'll never know. The voice-acting is pretty wooden, too. There are certainly sections of dialogue that wouldn't have sounded quite as bad with better delivery, but let's be honest; no actors can make a truly bad script sound good. Good dialogue can survive bad delivery, but this is not good dialogue.\nOverall I haven't even managed to finish the game because the characters and their chemistry are so distractingly negative and cringe-worthy. It's one thing to aim for realistic flaws that add conflict, it's another to disrupt flow and immersion with their problems. It's embarrassing that a narrative-focussed game would rely on such badly written characters to draw players into the story. I'm certainly not impressed enough to pull through to the end, not with all that I've experienced of it so far.","December 18, 2013","false","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You constantly have to solve puzzles with non-obvious solutions, even though there might be an obvious solution. Example: you need a paddle for a "boat" at some point. You're not allowed to use the broom that's sitting right there in the background; instead you have to combine a rope with a dustpan in your inventory and then combine dustpan-with-rope with a metal rod. The metal rod itself was part of a stairway's normal-looking metal handrail, and somehow you can rip it off from the rest of the handrail.

Yeager","http://steamcommunity.com/id/infindima/","680 products in account","Time traveling hippies are trying to save the world by begging a grumpy norwegian scientist to help them. The story really isn't too interesting, it's the kinda ”I started reading it, now I have to see it through until the end, as it would bother me not to know.” It's pretty predictable with a standard cheesy bad guy involved.\n\nAs for the characters, there really wasn't anyone I particularly liked or stood out to me. Fay could have been a very interesting character by telling of her time and how she grew up, but you only get a few ideas of how her world is like. Appearently she is supposed to be so clueless about the world as she doesn't even know what coffee is, yet she knows how to use a fax. She seems to swap knowledge throughout the story. The main character Bent is unlikable. Grumpy man who can't admit being wrong and doesn't really try either even though the plot gives him several oppertunities to make things right between himself and his family.\nI do give the game credit for featuring a gay character.\n\nThe game is extremely buggy and utterly clumsy at times. The main problem being the cursor and how you interact with things. To interact with something, you have to leftclick and hold, then steer the mouse towards the option you want and then let go. Many times I found myself struggling to select the choice I wanted. The control feels extremely unresponsive at times. Sometimes it's also hard to interact with the objects on the screen. I had to look at a guide on the internet to advance at one point, because I really couldn't make the cursor register a pair of keys unless I knew exactly in what area to click. Other times I followed a guide and I still had problems activating certain items. The game can be annoyingly picky at times. Certain times you need to open every drawer, other times you only need to click on one drawer to open them all. Due to being forced into this awkward click-hold-and-steer combination, I often find myself being unable to deselect items without having the character comment on it. Sometimes the dialogue can be quite long, so missclicks becomes tedious.\n\nSecondly, the game wasn't obviously throughouly tested. One part of the game, the dialogue skipped completely and the objects I interacted with were so unresponsive, that I missed the whole dialogue in one of the important scenes. And it wasn't just some random talk, it was a key plot event.\nSometimes certain objects wouldn't trigger any reactions at all, making me wonder if I failed to click it. Other times, it caused the character to suddenly speak german! There are options in the games that are not translated at all. One door only has two russian options, neither which I could understand what they meant.\nThe end credits are bugged, you only get to see half before the game skips and loads something else.\nThe subtitles in the game don't always match up with what the characters say and sometimes the text loads long before the dialogue is even spoken.\n\nThe voiceacting in the game was horrible! Almost every actor in the game has a wooden, monotone speech. No matter the situation, they have the same level of emotion. During critical situations or emotionally charged scenes, you really notice how terrible it is. It's obvious at times the actors aren't even trying. The main characters are unfortunately among the worst actors.\n\nI don't know whether it was a fault of the translation or because I just couldn't follow the plot, but more than half the time I had no idea what the characters wanted me to do. The characters don't give any good clues when you use objects, just some random nonsense like ”No”, ”Um”, ”Nope”, ”Hm”, ”Nah”. I don't feel like I have had this problem before with these kinds of games, usually you are provided with a clear objective. There are also times where I was quite baffled as the game seemed to skip out on it's own plot and advanced anyway. As an example, Fay decides to go looking for a person, but then she just... forgets about it? And that's even after making a huge deal about finding the person.\n\nIt's unfortunate the game is riddled with so many bad things, because the artwork and style is amazing. I loved how the game plays out like a comic and the characters look drawn in every environment, blending in perfectly with the background. Visually, this game is so pleasing to the eyes. The way the comic styled art is drawn during the ”cutscenes” is interesting to watch and feels very unique. The whole game feels like reading a comic book rather than just playing a PC game.\nUnfortunately, the horrendous voiceacting manages to ruin it. You see Bent or Fay expressing a strong emotion, but the only thing you hear is the emotional investment of a decaying zombie.","December 23, 2013","false","10.6"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

The translation, grammar and vocabulary was also very poor.\n\nOverall, the game has the feeling of being a rushed product which is a shame as the visuals are pretty good.  But when faced with such terrible voice acting it really detracts from the good stuff and for that reason it has zero replayability.","April 2, 2014","false","14.8"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

Its the end of the world and they are sending some one back to the past. So we start with a sad sack of a man who mostly wallows in self pity at his life. We start with him trying to fix a fogger machine. So the adventure starts for 10 to 15 minutes you have to work on getting a fogger activated. Wow. Heavy stuff. You later need a part in a locked up shed. Does the sad sack know where its at? No because he got drunk and hid it. Spoiler its behind a picture on the wall. Now you would have to be very dexterous with you hands to put a key behind a picture in a framed photo. However this guy was drunk and some how  managed it.\n\nI found this game to be very tedious and nit picky. Example for the key to work you have to select said key and then direct it to the door. If you try and click on the guy to open the door you will get a I dont know where the key is I got drunk.? Ugh. So its very tedious like that. Graphics are fine. Sound is good. Gameplay bored me to tears.\n\nI watched a youtube to figure out where the key was hidden. The game is an exercise in tedium. The game might be for some who want to take a hands on approach.

All of the people treated as bad guys by the narrative are also not white. Coincidence?\n\nThe art is good, but I really don't understand why Fay has to swing her hips when she's otherwise always in a strict, disciplined position. It took me out of the puzzles every time. Unfortunately, the art looks creepy when paired with the voice acting, most of which was frighteningly bad. Duve's actor was the best one, and everyone else was either between "Meh" and "oh god make it stop".\n\nThe game has this duality in that it's a puzzle game and a story game, and while the puzzles are pretty good and some were real brain-scratchers, the story was so flat, forced, and nonsensical that the whole game suffers.\n\nThere are also a lot of glitches. Half of the time I clicked on an item, the selection text would come up in Cryllic letters, or Italian. Some cutscenes never played at all, and the game crashed at least 3 times. This game is not ready to be published, and I'm annoyed that I had to pay money for it. Even if you like the story, I imagine everyone would be annoyed by the glitches.\n\nIf the developers want to make another game in the future, I'd say to stick to the puzzle aspect, don't try so hard to make the story so epic, work on the uncanny-valley-ness of the voiceovers and art, fix the glitches, and create women characters who don't have to be sexy every second, because that's super distracting.","March 8","false","14.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

It's a point and click, which I have played and have enjoyed previously, but this one just has so little action and puzzle that I sit there eventually skipping through lines to get to the good stuff. I feel like I don't need to say this for anyone who has access to watching some gameplay, but the voices--the voice acting--is terrible. Constantly line after line, the characters lead off into everchanging moods and tones so that one sentence they are mourning the complete annihilation of San Francisco and then the next line that literally overlaps their own voice, they are making a joke about an antenna.\n\nThe story is really cheesy too.

Some people love to hate on it simply because of its story; an environmental "save the planet OMG" tale.  However, taking the game as a whole, I'd just say it's ok.  Not great, not terrible.  The voice-acting is mostly passable, the story is moderately interesting despite feeling like an EPA advertisement, and the graphics and environments were pretty nice.  The game also, unfortunately, falls into the same traps that many other point and click adventure games have: obscure (and I mean OBSCURE) connections between items that are necessary to complete puzzles, etc. in order to progress.  I had to use a walkthrough to complete the game...the puzzles just didn't flow naturally to me.  Most of it I could figure out, but I wanted to finish the story, not revisit the same place over and over again to find out I needed one guy in a room watching a microwave in order to steal something.\n\nIt's worth it I think if you get it in a cheap bundle or on sale.  $4 or $5 at the most.","June 15, 2014","false","7.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's a point and click, which I have played and have enjoyed previously, but this one just has so little action and puzzle that I sit there eventually skipping through lines to get to the good stuff. I feel like I don't need to say this for anyone who has access to watching some gameplay, but the voices--the voice acting--is terrible. Constantly line after line, the characters lead off into everchanging moods and tones so that one sentence they are mourning the complete annihilation of San Francisco and then the next line that literally overlaps their own voice, they are making a joke about an antenna.\n\nThe story is really cheesy too.

Apart from the base artwork (not including the average comic cutscenes), the whole thing feels really amateurish. The gameplay is ridiculously messy and tedious (for example, why do we have to hold the mouse button for every single interaction, why?? and why are some elements in big puzzles so hard to click?), which is quite mind-boggling for a point & click game. Add some terrible puzzle designs to this and you get a pretty unpleasant game to play overall. Hell, you just need to go 5 minutes into the game to feel something is wrong thanks to this crazy non-sensical 1st puzzle. For this reason, I ended up using a walkthrough to get through after a few hours in, because I still wanted to know where the story was going.\n\nSpeaking of the story, it feels like it's been written by some naive 14 years old who just got into environmental activism. The poor translation and dreadful acting probably doesn't help, but it still feels incredibly cheesy and convoluted, especially near the end. In fact, it felt like watching a really bad 80s movie where everything gets so ridiculous it becomes funny and that's probably what kept me playing till the end! For this reason alone, I'd recommend this game, if the gameplay wasn't so painful.\n\nAnyway, if you like point & click games, don't let this deter you from other Daedelic titles. They're usually quite successful at crafting very nice characters and universes. I especially enjoyed the Edna & Harvey and the Deponia series for instance.","January 8, 2014","false","7.1"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

Forget about them or hate yourself for spending money on this bugfest like me!)\n\nI'm sorry, but I cannot recommend the normal user to buy this sh*t.\n\nWant to know why? Well, read on ...\n\nThis game here features unexpected crashes, sound stopping to work at all, overall laggyness out of nowhere and no stretching on 16:9 / 16:10 monitors.\n\nThe funny thing is, when you finally got the sound working the levels for the different type of sounds are totally nuts. There really is no better way to describe this. You have to fiddle around endlessly with the in game configuration to somehow get it all working together in a way you could finally sort of enjoy this game and when this hassle is done you're blown away from the next cutscene because the levels in these are crazy loud compared to the rest of the game.\n\nWTF ?!? ... I mean really ... WTF ?!? ... I am no professional sound-editor but I know how to join different sources together so they sound fine alltogether (and nearly every other game producing company seems to know too), but the thing is, that is not my work but the work of Daedalic. The levels are so far out, sorry, but everyone in production should have easily mentioned this.\n\nAt least the voice overs in this game are finally sort of enjoyable. In most older games from this company they just did sound ridiculous. So this is a plus for this game here. The graphics viewes as stills look nice to, because they feature nicely handdrawn backgrounds with wisely chosen colour palettes but the animation is horrible. In some way it's better than in other games from Daedalic (like the whispered world for eg.) but in now way are they appealing to look at.\n\nThe story sound interesting too, but until now I couldn't really investigate it because the game won't let me to, at least not with sound. I mean, after every restart of the game the sound is gone. And I haven't got a clue why.\n\nWell ... after all ... As said before this game has many issues:\n\n- Sound not working or working bad,\n- Laggy gameplay,\n- Devs that won't answer in these forums here only by email (guess why),\n- Configuration spread over ingame and out-of- game configuration tools,\n- Horrbile startup loading time\n- No Background music in the menus\n- Cutoff Background music in the credits and the intro\n- No widescreen support (devs don't like it though gamers ask them all over the internet *lol*),\n- Game-breaking save-game failures\n- And not reproducable crashes of the whole game at random times.\n\nAnd those mentioned before are just the errors that I did encounter personally while trying it ot for 2 hours (actually playing just maybe about 1 hour, the rest was problem solving and waiting for the game to load). But there are a lot more mentioned here and over the internet wich include:\n\n- No sound during Cutscenes\n- Wrong language in Cutscenes\n- Game reproducable crashing as soon as a cutscene appears\n\nBecause of all the flaws I can only hardly recommend this game for lovers of the genre, as long as you can get it to work properly on your setup, but I would never buy it for the normal price. I got mine in a bundle so I think it's ok. But don't pay more for this game than 1,99 €.\n\nAnd remember to avoid all other games from Daedalic unless they finally get these things addressed, because after searching the internet a little I found out that even in other (newer) games from Daedalic there are many people experiencing exactly the same problems, what leads me to think, that the problem lays in the engine underneath the games. What again is leading me to the question why these bugs aren't finally addressed so presumably a nice and simple fix for every game of the company could be released without much problems.\n\nMaybe instead of releasing one mediocre made game after the other Daedalic should start releasing fewer but well made games so they could honestly ask real money for it? They have damned so many good ideas and concepts in the past it just makes me sad, because back in the days I loved adventure games so much and Daedalic is one of the few companies still (trying to) making them today ...\n\nSo the overhelming question is:\n\nWill Daedalic ever produce a fully working adventure title? Sadly chances are very low. I can only hope they don't ♥♥♥♥ up the Blackguards series ...","October 6, 2014","false","2.3"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","1"

It's a point-and-click puzzle game, but the puzzles are seldom of the "reasonable challenge" variety; they're either painfully obvious, or painfully obtuse where you only stumble across them by trying absolutely every way to be wrong (e.g., boosting a laser's power by adding a lens cut away from the plastic cover for a neon sign, which you may recognize as a technique that wouldn't work). This is often magnified by the puzzles having perfectly logical solutions that the game ignores in favor of going around in circles and repeating the same action several times until it finally gives a different result. (It even gives an achievement for putting up with the "Quickie" computer character that embodies one of these moments.)\n\nI grew up with the puzzle games from Sierra and LucasArts; I get that lateral thinking is a large part of the genre, and that it's easy for developers to miss the mark and come up with a "solution" that can only be seen in hindsight. But those games balanced it out by making it worthwhile with good stories. This game does not. It's an extremely heavy-handed story about climate change, bearing a strong resemblance to the film 2012 in its "We're all doomed RIGHT NOW" approach. It's not that I object to the message itself; it's that the message isn't entertaining, which is the one and only possible purpose of a video game. I'm not really geared up to spend several hours lecturing myself. Coupled with protagonists who are utterly unlikeable (one terminally depressed, one aggressively arrogant, both humorless), and there's simply nothing to make me want to play much past the beginning of A New Beginning.","August 1, 2014","false","7.2"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

But unfortunately "A New Beginnig - Final Cut" couldn't convince me at all.\nFirst, the story (in my opinion the most important part about a P&C): at the start the plot sounded quite interesting: a myserious woman from the future asks you to help her save the world but while I was waiting for a mindblowing story to evolve, I was disappointed by a rigmarole that didn't take any step forward until the end of the game when a "sudden" turning point tried to save my day ... in vain. Not only was the story's outcome in my opinion totally obvious, it also turned into an annoying preaching and made the last cutscene seem to take forever.\nThe difficulty is quite low. I can understand that no one wants to search each and every pixel to find necessary items. That's why I decided to rather evaluate the mini-game-difficulty, and that is really poor: little puzzles in P&Cs are ment to let you enjoy a little, fresh breeze because searching for clickables can be awefully teasing. But "A New Beginning" doesn't offer any good or original ideas in this case; within seconds you can master all of the riddles and so they just contribute to lengthening the game time without increasing the fun.\nThe gameplay is solid, but all animations take too much time and simply turn out to be frustrating when you're forced to backtrack or simply can't find the essential piece that's missing. Moving-Animations are not of the best quality, they look clunky and sometimes over-stylized (e.g. character postures) so that they almost appear unrealistic and ridiciulous. This might be a possible design-decision that comes along with the cartoonish graphic-style, that - in general - is rather mediocre (dreary color-set, unimpressive location-design, no high-resolution). But even if, I would state that this design-decision was a bad one, because it brakes the sympathy for the protagonists.\nThe replayability is in my honest opinion practically zero. I personally didn't use any guides for the achievements but still it was easy-going to earn all of them in "one playthrough": I simply saved before every special interaction and when I unlocked one of the badges I went back to see if I could get an alternative answer/question/interaction. Unfortunately, all of the alternatives don't contribute to the story, at all.\n\n~Conclusion~\n"A New Beginning - Final Cut" is - in my opinion - one of the suboptimal Point&Click-Adventures. It rather confirms some people's opinion that this genre is boring and has no challenges, at all. Additionally, it can't even convince with its story or characters. I personally really disliked the female protagonist, who took a lot of wrong decisions that simply made her look stupid, impertinent and immature; and none of this contributed to the plot in a positive way. If you're looking for a good P&C you should rather consider buying another game that is able to build up tension with a really compelling mystery that keeps you going because you want to know the secret behind the curtain (not because you want to grind achievements :P).\nBut at least one positive thing has to be added: the game worked without any bugs or losses for me; savegames loaded and saved as intended, no glitches were found or other similar broken game-parts that let you crash or get stuck. No technical issues, at all.","April 23, 2014","false","6.9"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

I don't write reviews. I write opinion and impressions pieces, meaning the detalization may vary from just general feelings about a game to indepth critique of particular game mechanics. Read if you're interested to know if I like a game or not (and for what reasons), which parts intrigue me and which parts push me away, but don't expect in-depth description of all gameplay and systems. Thank you.\n\nI am a fan of classic point & click adventure games. And as a fan of adventure games, I want to really like A New Beginning, but I can’t. Which is sad, because the story really intrigues me, but there’s just too many flaws that accumulate and are hard to look past by in a title of this genre.\n\nThe interface is very laggy. To interact with objects, you hold the mouse button, a wheel appears, and you select the action from that wheel by moving the mouse around and then releasing it. In theory that’s a nice system, but in practice the way it’s implemented in A New Beginning is very annoying. It takes like half a second to a second for the game to realize that you’re holding the mouse, and then there’s a half a second to a second animation of the wheel appearing. And this really messes with the game flow. You interact with a lot of objects in an adventure game, and check what contextual actions are available, so in a minute of gameplay approximately 15 seconds are just waiting for the wheel to appear.\n\nAnd speaking of actions, the wheel doesn’t have a set amount of them, it depends on the object itself. Which is why it’s so annoying when there’s a ‘Take’ action on an object which exists for the character to say that he doesn’t need it (the fact that you’ve spent a whole second or two initiating the action doesn’t help). And you get this feeling that maybe in the future you’ll have to backtrack to take this object and you’re gonna be angry on the character for not taking it in the first place (I actually can’t confirm this, since after the location with this example we go to a flashback of the second main character, but if we won’t ever have to use a fishing rod and a fishing net in the game, I’ll be angry). And you know, an argument can be applied that it was an attempt to remove the ‘adventure game logic’, when you take everything with you and possibly solve puzzles before they appear, but considering that in a later section I’ve recharged a battery before knowing why I need it, I’m not sure that applies (also I still don’t know what certain objects in my inventory in later part of the game are for, I took them just because).\n\nWhen it comes to ‘adventure game logic’, I think that gameplay flow should be a bigger priority than having everything make perfect chronological sense. Speaking of sense, there was a moment in the prologue when I needed to ask a second character for help. I had to ask her to hold a shutter so nothing would fall out from the fogger. But I couldn’t. I knew I had to ask her because as I failed to close the shutter and looked at it, my character said that he needs a second person to hold it before turning the fogger on, but the actual topic of the conversation with said person doesn’t appear until I actually try turning the fogger on (which leads to the exact same thought line, by the way). These kind of specific things in an adventure game are very detrimental to the experience.\n\nAdventure games are usually very story heavy. And dialogue heavy. And most of them are quite linear. This problem is usually tackled in two ways. In adventure games with linear dialogue (without ability to choose topics), conversations are usually relatively short and to the point, so you can continue exploring and figuring things out rather quickly. And in adventure with non-linear dialogue, there’s, well, there’s all the topics to choose from, and you don’t have to go through them all, you might want to just select only the important ones if you feel like it (so even though overall you’re more passive in an adventure game, you’re still active). But there was only just one (and a half-ish) non-linear conversation during the parts that I’ve played. Everything else was just comic-style cutscenes which also really slowed down the pace – you had to wait for the panels to appear in a cool way before a line was spoken. Each panel animation is not too long in and on its own, but, again, it adds up. So A New Beginning felt more like watching a visual novel rather than playing an adventure game. And even then, the conversations are slow due to a considerable delay between each line.\n\nAnd there’s also the fact that English voice acting is so monotone and boring that I would recommend to just switch to the original German (or maybe other translation that is actually good) immediately.\n\nBut what A New Beginning has really got going for it is the beautiful art style (although, admittedly, the quality of animations may vary from action to action) and a story that has managed to intrigue me, and I want to know how it all turns out in the end. This may seem like a very short point, but it’s actually huge, and plays a lot to the game’s favor. It will have to wait though, until I don’t really have anything else to play. Sadly, I don’t think A New Beginning is well designed as a point & click adventure game. There’s too much passivity, and gameplay doesn’t flow well at all. Maybe I’m missing out. Maybe further down the road things get better. And if they do, I’ll make another post. But as it stands, this particular adventure game wouldn’t be on the top of my recommend list.","May 4, 2014","false","1.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

But that only lead me so far. The story wasn't entertaining enough. It feels like I'm being force-fed into being a hippie by being Eco-friendly and crap. It felt more like a tedious lecture like I was in class or something. And the script felt so weak. having stereotypes of a washed-out scientist and a female protagonist being put-down by a superior officer with gender equality issues (and I live in a country where gender is no longer an issue for work and family). And I'm supposed to believe that these other characters are from the future?!\n\nI'm not even complaining about the voice-acting because of this being "indie". I can forgive that.\n\nAgain, being "indie" isn't an excuse for telling a bad story. Adventure games are for me, 90% story and 10% gameplay.\n\nOverall, It's not entertaining. It's not hilarious like most LucasArts Classics. It's not epic as the ones from Sierra's. I really think that the developers did a great job with the items and the puzzles (and the puzzles are actually better than some of Sierra's classics.).\n\nEven if this did just cost me less than Php 40.00 (less than US$ 1.00) I wouldn't recommend it.\n\n","December 8, 2014","false","4.7"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

The voice acting is stilted and makes me wonder if they had just gotten Siri to voice Fay.\nI also found myself wishing I could click through the laborious comic book panels; I read at a fast pace and found it frustrating to sit through 10 minutes of panels slogging through the rote of being in front then fitting in "place".","June 11, 2014","false","8.3"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

It sounds preachy and the message is rather banal and simple all the way until the very end of the game. There, the plot twist contains the true message of the game, one that is honest and brutal.\n\nIs the game worth buying just for that message? Probably not, it certainly won't amuse anyone who hates climate activism, it isn't going to be a glorious cup of tea for anyone outside of adventure / point and click hardcore nuts, but I think the message it holds is a rather reasonable and interesting one to listen to.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NeoGalaxy/recommended/105000/","NeoGalaxy","[EDF] Shadow Dragon™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NeoGalaxy/","444 products in account","I wanted to play this game after I saw the 1st trailer but sadly due to having a lot of games, I've just finished it like one hour ago :P\n\nLet me start with saying that the story is interesting even if the ending is a little bit strange, not what I would have expected, but it offers a story that probably just one game had the courage to tell (Singularity). A New Beginning is about different possible future paths that we, humanity, can take along the way. There's no one future that has 100% certainty, there's like thousands of different paths to take, each leading into thousands of other possibilities.\n\nI will not tell anything about the story since you need to play the game to descover it,  but I can say that sometimes is hard to see what you need to do, and it's quite often. Most of the time it's quite hard to see what you need to do to advance the story, lots of tries, saves, reloading and trying again, but you can manage.\n\nThere's a lot of characters, and while the characters are nice, the voice over doesn't seem credible but that's not really a problem since you'll understand a lot about these characters while exploring the game and story. Sadly here you find the 1st problem also, the slow loading of the screens between different places, which should be very very fast. Also the graphic engine seems very old, I've wondered since the start... what's the resolution of the game and why does it have... to big black zones on both sides.\n\nThe graphic direction is ok, it's like reading a manga book mostly but the slow loading of different section is annoying and sadly won't be fixed since the game was abandoned last year or something like that. The slow loading of different sections will do just one thing: slow you down, just that. Based on the speed of my computer, the loading should have been instant but well... I managed to finish the game even with it.\n\nThe inventory is simple to use, fast also, exploring different points of the screen is easy since only what you need to advance the story will be click-able. Also you can't destroy stuff so trying different things won't lead to you losing the game, which is very good. Also the game has an autosave feature, one can save anytime he wants, load also but can't delete the saves... no idea why.\n\nThe story offers an interesting opportunity to understand climate changes, and since humanity doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about it, the story in this game might really be a path we might one day take. Sadly, I can't say with 100% certainty that the story offered to us is impossible in reality, so you should play the game and see what you think about it.\n\nThere's 8 chapters, each with different puzzles, different characters, some interesting and used more, while others used less, which maybe could change in a future "A New Beginning II"?\n\nIf you like adventure games, try it, you might find it interesting. Yes it has some technical problems, but none is that powerfull to kill your interest (I hope :P). I liked it a lot and I am quite glad that I've finished the story since well... I care about my home planet. Maybe you care also,\n\n\nP.S. Maybe Steam can put this game at "A" and not at "T"? For a strange reason I do think that A New Beginning, start with "A".","February 22","true","38.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd say the money was well spent. It was around 12 bucks for like 9 games and almost all of them had cards. No, they were not all great games but good enough to be playable. I'd say this one was above the bad ones like Edna and Harvey but still below the rest. The story was good, it was green but you knew it going in. The problem was the voice acting. It wasn't that they were bad, they were good but their acting feld wooden and the editing was choppy. The main female protagonist sounded like she was a computer. The comic book style of cutscenes were good but it made the talking look really strange and all the characters talked like they were puppets. The puzzles were not too hard and I only had to use the walkthrough once or twice. They were not completely outlandish like Edna or Deponia. This game focused on the which was good but needed way better voice editing that doesn't make all the characters sound like computer generated voices. All in all, I'm really glad I bought the pack and I think everyone should, its totally worth the money. Now I'll look forward to their next titles such as the last Deponia game, the next Whispered world and the new games they are working on. I wish them the best and I shall await for them to be on a cheap sale. For now, I doubt I'll be playing any point and click adventure games any time soon.","April 15","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Apart from that it was enterntaining : dialogues and comments are meaningful and sometimes funny, artwork is great - comic style (reminded Deponia game from the same developer), music is nice, puzzles are solvable (possibility to skip if stuck), the storyline is good (in the end I got a little bit confused - maybe I didn't pay enugh attention).\nOverall, it is very nice game to play.\n\nI highly recommend this game!\n\nWill be looking for more games from this developer!","May 26","true","16.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sure, A New Beginning - Final Cut looks great, style which I really love in adventure games. Sadly, it's not really interesting and it have some annoying stuff. The story is hit or miss and in my case, it was miss. I could get into this game, so finally after 3rd time installing and playing it, I managed to reach ending. But what's much worse are english voices - during comic sequences it's just sad to watch. At least puzzles were a little interesting but that's all, I don't think that those little things are worth spending your time, and money, with this game. There are tons of adventure games which were made much better, and yes, there are even more games with "adult" stories than the one in A New Beginning - Final Cut. Maybe if you are some hardcore fan of point and click adventure games then you can try it but if you are just looking for something fun to play - you came to the wrong neighbourhood, look around for something more popular and something that can be enjoyed no matter what.","May 30","false","21.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't buy it for more than 4-5 euros.\n\n\nThe game isn't too hard, but not to easy (as long as you don't skip the puzzles, but who would ?). It demands thinking, logic and memory. The "hard" parts, the puzzle, can be skipped, so if you're just here to live an adventure, it will do.\n\nThe drawing are most of the time beautiful, especially landscapes and large pictures. Unfortunately, the animations are sometimes really odd (or totally ♥♥♥♥ed up, but you can't say that on Steam). During the cut scenes, the sound / image / subtitles are way too often no synchronized, so the narration is hardly enjoyable. Moreover, Fay is suffering so hard of scoliosis, I wonder how she still stand.\n\nAs for me, I separate the the game in two parts : First part, you discover the plot, the characters, the goals. It's a nice part, well written, with various environment, the year 2050 was particularly nice to go through. The second part, on the other hand, is heavy and not that interesting.\n\nOne of the biggest problems I found in this game, is the lack of psychology and deepness in the character. Someone close to you dies ? Ok, nevermind, just go on. You are betrayed by everybody ? Ok, nevermind, just excuse yourself and I'll forget it. Someone who tried to harm you died ? Ho my god, bring the sad music and the cut scene ! That's not making sense at all, even if Fay is used to see dead people, and even if Bent is an old  disillusioned man, there is no way they would react like that. Add this to some cheesy dialogues, and you might want to punch them in the face once in a while.\n\nThe scenario is quite good however. Climate change, collective responsibility, how far will people go to save mankind, sounds good to me. Too bad the activists are, once again in a video game, represented as fanatics or stupid hippies, but nevermind, the storytelling is good (if you can pass over the synch problems I spoke before).\n\nI'm a bit frustrated though, because I find the game way too short, and the ending too quick. But it IS a good game, a good point and click where you should think and reason. Even if my review is mostly negative, but it's harder  to me to describe why I enjoyed rather than what I didn't enjoyed in the game, in particular because english isn't my native language.","June 2","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
