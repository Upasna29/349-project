You can spend a lot more on multiplayer though.\nController recommended\n\nInjustice: Gods Among Us had a free weekend recently and I decided to give it a try, maybe rake in some easy achievements since it’s supposed to be a pretty short game campaign wise.  I managed to beat the game on normal mode in a little over 5 hours but didn’t really try any multiplayer because my internet was acting up. Since Injustice is a fighting game I originally thought the “story mode” would be like Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat where everything is really just character backstory with a general tournament plotline.  Instead, it’s more like a 5 hour movie where you take control during the fight scenes.\n\nSpoilers:\nIn an alternate universe, the Joker somehow tricked Superman into killing his family and destroying Metropolis. In a rage, Superman kills the Joker and seizes control, creating the One World government where he and a bunch of other heroes rule with an iron fist to make sure something like that never happens again. Anyone who disagrees with him is killed, even some of his friends in the Justice League. Most of them join up with him though, including a few villains. Batman (who is still good) uses a dimensional transporter to pull in a bunch of heroes from “our” universe in an attempt to stop Evil Superman. By the way, Evil Superman has used Kryptonian technology to create a pill that makes his teammates stronger and tougher (and Batman has stolen some of them). It’s the game’s way of evening the odds so super powered characters like Superman or Doomsday don’t squash regular humans like Batman or Green Arrow in one punch.  Unlike other fighting games, you don’t choose one person to play through the story. In the campaign you start off as Batman and as the story goes along you switch between people like Flash, Aquaman, Green Arrow, Green Lantern, and Wonder Woman. You also play as a few villains who opposed Evil Superman and are now counted as “good guys” during the campaign. As I mentioned earlier, the game is telling a story, and you only take control during the fight scenes.\n\nDespite its high graphics and environmental interactions (like throwing background objects at your enemy) Injustice is still a 2D fighting game like Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter. Each character has a bunch of special moves and a “super bar” (I forgot what the actual name is). You charge your super bar by using special moves or by taking damage. You can use sections of the super bar to give additional power to your special moves, or do special things like push your enemy away when the enemy has you in a combo (obviously this is a great tool for pros). Since I’m a newb I only used it for the character specific super moves. These can only be used when the super bar is completely full and can deal massive damage to the enemy if they don’t block (If they block the first hit, the super move kind of fizzles out). All the super moves are cinematic attacks like Final Fantasy moves where your character smashes the enemy around showcasing the characters super power (or technology). And during the fight don’t forget to exploit environmental hazards. Doing things like triggering a background missile launcher or picking up and throwing a car can do a lot of damage, and is unblockable. Most stages also have a couple of “transitions” where you can knock your enemy through the wall at the edge and follow him through to a new area (does a lot of damage too).\n\nI used an Xbox 360 controller to play and I would definitely advise against playing with just a keyboard. The special moves might be easier with a keyboard, but you’d have a lot of trouble actually fighting. Since I’m inexperienced with game controllers, I had trouble doing special moves that require reversing directions. For example, Batman’s batarang attack is Back->Forward + Medium attack. Whenever I tried, it would just do a regular punch, and it was the same with every other special move that requires reverse directions. I’m sure there’s just something I’m missing though. The game has combos as you’d expect in a modern fighting game and I didn’t realize until later that you’re supposed to press the buttons fast, not wait for a hit to connect before starting the next attack. This means that by the time your character has thrown the first punch, you should have already punched in all the buttons to the combo, unless you’re trying to juggle the enemy (keep hitting them while they’re in the air and can’t react). I haven’t played many modern fighting games so I don’t know if this is commonplace.\n\nPros:\n+Excellent graphics and story. I especially liked trying out the supermoves of all the characters. If the game had fatalities like Mortal Kombat, I probably would have spent the whole weekend trying them all out.\n+A lot of variety in the game, from environmental hazards, to character special attacks, to the 29 different playable characters. During the campaign it actually seemed pretty easy most of the time. I didn’t lose a round until I met Catwoman, who kicked my ♥♥♥.\n\nCons:\n-A lot of the Steam achievements for Injustice are basically impossible unless the opponent is cooperating (or it’s just you with 2 controllers). For example, using every environmental interaction in one fight, or winning a fight using only one kind of attack. Also, a lot of the achievements are grinds. For example, using every single super move of every character or do 10 hit combos with every character in the game. I got all the “easy” achievements, which was about 50%.\n-The game download is huge. I probably spent twice as long downloading as I did playing. I backed the game files up though, so I’ll have the game available if there’s another free weekend. The system requirements aren’t that bad, I could run it smoothly with my AMD 555 processor and Radeon 7850 video card (for reference, I run Watch Dogs at 10 fps – unplayable). I was worried in the beginning because when I first ran Injustice I got about 20 frames per second. I guess it was just “settling in” though, because after a few minutes I got a steady 60 fps.\n\nOverall Injustice is a fantastic game, though I don’t play many fighting games so I don’t have anything modern to compare it to. It’s one of those games where I would go back and play (multiplayer) if I had a half hour or so to kill. I’m sure everyone online would destroy me pretty easily though.","November 3, 2014","true","5.3"," 344 of 381 people (90%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","90","344","381","17","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OdddddLlamaaaa/recommended/242700/","OdddddLlamaaaa","OddLlama","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OdddddLlamaaaa/","607 products in account","Let me preface this review by stating a few facts:\n\n1) I'm not a fan of fighting games.\n2) I'm not a big comic fan, though I enjoy the Marvel movies (not the DC movies).\n3) I rarely play a game to the end.\n\nThat being said, here is my opinion of Injustice:\n\nSingle player campaign:\nI started playing at about 2AM thinking I would just check it out before bed. It is now 7:30 AM and I just finished the single player campaign and a few of the S.T.A.R. Labs. I lost 8 matches and made one run to the store, so I got nearly 5 hours out of the campaign. That's not bad considering I only paid about 8 dollars on amazon. Luckily I didn't buy it for the multiplayer (well, sort of), more on that in a bit.\nAs soon as the game started, I was hooked. The transitions between the story sequences and the fights were spot on. You smoothly flow into a fight and it does not break the immersion. The action in the cuts scenes will be amazing for any comic/action/superhero fan. The graphics are great and match the cut scenes and the only loading scenes I can recall are after I lost a battle, and those were very short. There may have been more, but I was so sucked into the game I did not notice them. After you complete the game, there are other modes you can play to unlock a plethora of costumes, concept art, backgrounds, music, and other neat stuff.\n\nControls: If you have ever played Mortal Kombat you will be pretty comfortable with the controls. The combos are not as extensive (at least none that I could pull off). I used a wireless xbox controller, and as happens with a lot of games, the analog stick does not have adjustable or proper deadzones. This meant I was relegated to the D-pad as my analog has a tendency to stick in the upwards position (on all four of my controllers). This doesn't happen on my xbox, only the PC. Sometimes it felt a little cluncky or unresponsive pulling off special moves and semed to execute a move I had not intended.\n\nI played the game on the default difficulty, but noticed something odd. If you lose a fight, the game seems to lower the difficulty. While fighting one particular character, I lost twice in a row. The first time I had my ♥♥♥ handed to me, the second time was nearly even, but the third time...the third time I could stand next to him and he would do the same. He became dissapointingly easy. This happened on more than one occasion. Whith each failure, I found myself facing a weaker AI. To me, that was very dissapointing as I felt I was not being challenged. You may want to play the game on a harder difficulty if you want a challenge. It's been years since I played a fighter, yet I pretty much blazed though most of the enemies. Even later in the game I was able to beat a few without taking damage.\n\nMultiplayer:  Is non-existant. I attempted multiple times to jump into a random match in each mode and never had any luck. So I joined a lobby looking to challenge someone only to find 1 person in the lobby, and they were unresponsive. As I said earlier, I didn't exactly buy it for the multiplayer, I bought a copy for me an a friend so he could fulfill his fantasy of of being Wonder Woman while get getting spanked by me playing Superman, so I'm not terribly dissapointed by the lack of any community in MP. If you don't have people to play with, and are looking to fight random nerds on the interwebs, you may want to look elsewhere. Luckily the single player mode was insanely fulfilling. Only twice before have I spent hours in front of my computer beating a game to it's end.\n\nSummary: Awesome single-player campaign that is well worth the money if bought on sale (it's $7.50 on Amazon right now, get it). Non-existant MP may turn some players away.","May 23, 2014","true","11.2"," 381 of 450 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","381","450","0","13"

Well, if slippers could make you capable of supernatural speed and strength as well as giving you the power to shoot lasers out of your eyes, that is.\n\nThe resemblance is no surprise: developer NetherRealm Studios has worked on Mortal Kombat for years. And everything that's good about Mortal Kombat - including the huge, cinematic moments, the boatload of extra features and unlockables, and a surprisingly robust story - is its doing.\n\nInjustice is based on a group of characters from the DC Comics universe, including everyone's favourite superhero, Batman. All the rest of the big guns are here, too - Superman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Green Lantern. There's also a well-rounded line-up of DC villains, from the Joker (who is disappointingly not voiced by Mark Hamill) to lesser-known characters such as Killer Frost and Black Adam.\n\nIt's great to play a fighting game with a story, and in this case it's one that's true to the characters and the universe comic fans know and love. But because there are so many duplicate characters, the story can at times be a bit confusing. In comic form, stories like this work because people have time to process the differences - you can look at a panel and figure out whether that's 'regular' Batman or 'alternate universe' Batman. Some of the characters' costumes are changed enough in the game that the difference is unmistakable, but others take more time to spot.\n\nInjustice’s main point of interest and distinction is tying in the background to gameplay and providing reasons why you’d want to pick between one location over another. You’re able to interact with objects in the environment, meaning that you can kick someone into the Batcomputer or open up a water valve into their face. Along with this you can perform an attack that transitions from one scene to another. There’s a unique cutscene for doing this in every level. Some involve characters being crushed by harrier jets, others throw inmates from Arkham Asylum on them. The inclusion of interactive environmental content might also provide difficulty with balance as different sides of the map confer different advantages and it might be unfair in high-level competition, but they’re great to watch.\n\nWith some soft-bans on characters or dedicated work in not falling victim to cheap tricks, Injustice is a great fighting game that’s not only a lot of fun, but provides a lot of answers for problems with the genre. It’s accessible, it’s intense and it’s a great spectacle.\n","December 27, 2013","true","4.9"," 197 of 270 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","197","270","0","3"

Within this evolving landscape, ‘Injustice: Gods Among Us (The Ultimate Edition)’ manages to brawl its way into contention as a polished, well crafted fighter, that despite its issues, is a fine addition to any Fight Game enthusiast’s collection.\n\nCampaign:  Released in late 2013, NetherRealm | Warner Bros. follow up on the commercial success of ‘Mortal Kombat: The Komplete Edition’ by essentially replicating that game within the DC Comics universe. The ‘Campaign’ mode follows the story arc from the ‘Injustice’ comic books, wherein a crazed Joker has killed Lois Lane and detonated a nuclear device in Metropolis. The game picks up with an enraged Superman asserting martial law over the planet and slowly turning from protector to oppressor. Narrated through well conceived animated cut-scenes and interspersed with 1-on-1 battles, gamers assume control of all their favorite characters as well as some others they might not have been so inclined to. The usual suspects are all here – from Batman, Superman, The Joker, Lex Luthor, Wonder Woman, Harley Quinn, Green Arrow and Bane to a host of newer faces like Doomsday, Solomon Grundy, Frost, DeathStroke and Aquaman. A variety of Single Player Arcade-style Tournaments, Challenges, and lots of unlockable comic lore round out a content-rich title.\n\nGameplay | Graphics | Sound:  Gameplay is fast and fluid, and the use of destructible environments and interactible objects work particularly well to convey the massive destruction wrought by epic battles between superheroes. PC controls are tight, responsive and well optimized for both M&K and Controller. Newcomers to fighting games will also relish the fact that unlike other fighters (which can be notoriously difficult to master), ‘Injustice’ utilizes a manageable 3-5 buttons for even its more complex combos making elaborate ‘Throwdowns’, ‘Special Moves’, and ‘In-Level Transitions’ executable even for non-veterans. Another positive is that all playable characters come already un-locked, eliminating the usual grind. Graphics and Sound are great overall as well.\n\nFlaws:  In considering its flaws – Continuing issues with Multiplayer | Online Connectivity are a major concern – with poor matchmaking and worse stability making dropped connections nearly constant. Given that these same issues were identified, and displeasure loudly voiced with ‘Mortal Kombat’, the fact that they remain prevalent with the developer’s next release is almost unforgiveable. With a campaign of low replayability, limitations of other SP options and a nearly unplayable | dead Multiplayer, the overall package is dragged well down.\n\nOverall, ‘Injustice: Gods Among Us’ is a polished modern fighting game - with a large collection of fighters (30+) to choose from, a well-crafted campaign, and satisfying fight mechanics – and is well worth your consideration particularly if you are a fan of the DC Comics Universe. A broken Multiplayer component and an overwhelming sense of déjà-vu (if you’ve also played NetherRealm’s ‘Mortal Kombat: The Komplete Edition’) blemish this otherwise ambitious fighter.

On one hand, I think it's a highly enjoyable fighting game with a pretty decent story mode, a ton of options if you're into playing single player and offline with friends, but on the other hand, the online mode has been highly inconsistent in terms of stability. The game plays a lot like Mortal Kombat, but ditches the block button and 4 attack buttons in favor of 3 attacks (light,  medium, and heavy) and a power button that does different things depending on the character you choose. Another thing that helps to differentiate Injustice is that all of the fighters are separated into two tiers, which effects how they use different items in the background. A powerhouse like Bane is able to pick up cars in the background and slam them down from a decent range on opponents, whereas Nightwing will use the same vehicle either to place explosives on or flip to the other side of the screen, evading danger. It's a neat feature that somehow manages to never feel cheap and really conveys the sense of being a superhero.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of Mortal Kombat (2011), this game does include a decent story, although it is significantly shorter. The other key features of the game I feel get overlooked is the Battles mode, which is just a ladder where you fight through the AI, but includes probably about 20 variations such as classic (fighting anyone) villains only, survivor (one life bar), and combo heaven (you must land combos to damage your enemy). If these modes aren't your thing, the game also includes a mode called STAR Labs, which offers up different missions for each character that vary from just fighting.\n\nDespite the online being kind of rough to this day, there is still a lot of fun to be had here, and it's also nice that you get all of the characters that were previously available as DLC on consoles for just the regular price of the PC version. Worth a look if you're a fan of fighting games, and I definitely think this is easier for newcomers than any Street Fighter game, but be wary if you're planning on sticking strictly to online play. It's easier if you have friends to play with that you know have good connections.","October 10, 2014","true","40.6"," 48 of 54 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","48","54","3","1"

For first, beware, as its WB's tradition for ported games from consoles, even Injustice may not perform on your computer, considering possible low FPS and need to lower the details (though that's been a bigger problem at the time of the release).\n\nGameplay-wise it doesn't offer much new from classic scheme you may already know from other similar games (Mortal Kombat, Tekken and Street Fighter series). Combos are based on fast button mashing (specific combinations, not random) and not checking for the right moment in the character's animation. Player's speed just needs to be high, so don't expect the game letting you be lazy and mashing gamepad buttons slowly, every milisecond counts.\n\nWhat stands out about the game are DC Universe characters (obviously) and the level details and variety. Levels have more floors where you can move your fight to, and you can interact with many objects in the level, as you can take them and throw at your opponent.\n\nThe game offers single-player story mode where you always fight few fights with specific character, moving on to another after. There is totally 12 chapters of the story that should provide you more than 5 hours of gameplay, depending on your set difficulty.\n\nI haven't tried the multiplayer, but as far as the single-player content goes, the game felt mediocre and if you're not a big fan of DC Universe, you might feel similarly. For me, it ends up in "just another fighting game" category. It's worth recommending but don't expect anything superior to other games in the genre.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","February 26","true","6.8"," 50 of 58 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","50","58","2","2"

While their first effort, Mortal Kombat Vs. DC Universe, was generally considered mediocre the quality of their Mortal Kombat reboot injected a lot of hope that their future titles would continue to be top notch. Injustice: Gods Among Us, is a strictly DC character affair that  follows in the footsteps of the MK reboot and offers an original narrative that pits heroes and villains alike in one on one beat downs. If you have always fantasized about Batman punching Aquaman in the face or Ares turning Wonder Woman into a pin cushion with a volley of arrows, this may be your best chance to bring such day dream to fruition.\n\nInjustice: Gods Among Us offers up an original narrative that involves a parallel universe in which the Joker has tricked Superman into killing Lois Lane—an act that causes Superman to kill Joker and assume the role of a tyrant. Batman leads an insurgency against Superman's regime and, to add to the chaos, the heroes from the canon timeline cross into the Injustice universe to take up the fight against  Superfacist Superman. The tale is rather campy and thoroughly peppered with groan worthy dialogue and one liners that may induce vomiting. It does an serviceable job of bringing a mix of iconic and somewhat obscure characters together for super-sized throw downs. Comic book  fans will likely pitch a tent over the fan service and cameos while most everyone else will shrug off this delightfully absurd scenario in anticipation of the next round of fisticuffs.\n\nWhile the plot in itself is not Shakespeare, the structure of the campaign mode is something that fighting game developers should take note of. Following in the footsteps of Mortal Kombat, Injustice tells it's tale by switching between characters who have some sort of objective to move the plot forward. You play a few rounds with a character as cutscenes move the events forward between fights before you are handed over to the next character who, in turn, tells their part of the tale. Quick time events also pop up on occasion and can have an impact on how much health your character and your opponent have at the onset of a match. It's a far more cohesive narrative experience than what is offered by most fighting games since you see how characters relate to one another as well as the overarching plot line. The main campaign takes about four to six hours to finish off and you will take control of about half of the 24 character roster (the ultimate edition contains 30 fighters) as part of the experience. A more traditional arcade style mode called battle mode allows you to pick a character and run through a gauntlet of opponents before seeing a character specific ending. There are also modifiers and variations of battle mode to be unlocked while playing Injustice adding masochistic options like trying to tackle the entire ladder without health regeneration between rounds.\n\nAt first, Injustice may come off as a re-skinned Mortal Kombat. Character movement and move sets are similar but God Among Us offers many new additions as well as a decent tutorial to introduce you to the mechanics. A light, medium and heavy attack are mapped to the face buttons as well as a special power button. The special power button allows the Green Arrow to fire arrows, Batman to summon mechanical bats and Superman to get a power buff. No more low punch, high punch or low kick, high kick. It must be said that many of the character's powers just don't fit the goals of the special button and thus only a few make it look like a natural addition to the game since, for many characters, the special button just triggers a power and speed buff. Blocking has been revised as well. Holding back blocks high attacks and crouching will block low attacks. Using special attacks fills up a gauge that can be used in a few ways such as enhancing special moves and of course dazzling super combos. The most unique feature however is the clash system. You basically bet your super gauge against your opponent and the highest bet wins. If you initiate a clash you can regain health by out-betting an opponent, though loosing will cost a significant chunk of health. It's a system that interrupts the flow of combat and could be used to strategically interrupt combos but often it feels like an irritation—particularly since the AI loves to use it after you have depleted your gauge to gain health back. Stages are also littered with objects to use against your foes and power attacks can be used to trigger ostentatious cinematic sequences that hurl your opponent into another part of the battlefield. This is a wonderful addition that makes stages come alive and adds some strategy in terms of where you are on the stage as well as augmenting your options for delivering skeleton shattering blows.\n\nNot content with just a story mode and an arcade ladder, Injustice also features S.T.A.R. Labs which is a collection of challenges and mini games. Each individual challenge has three separate goals that is worth a star. More stars are required to unlock later challenges so getting as many as possible in each challenge is recommended to speed up progress. These additional objectives can become rather tedious and even frustrating, just like those in Mortal Kombat's Challenge Tower. There are a lot of challenges available and you will be busy for quite some time if you have the patience and the skill to take all of them on. Additionally there is a huge amount of content to unlock in the game's archives section. Costumes, music, concept art, and portraits for you online avatar can all be unlocked by completing various objectives and though purchase in the games archives with access cards that can be obtained through leveling.\n\nOnline mode offers up solid one on one bouts as well as King of the hill and Survival game types. King of the hill allows the winning player to continue competing against an entire lobby of people and survival is much the same only without a regenerating life bar between rounds. Lobbies offer some interaction to keep you entertained while waiting your turn. Connections are only as stable as the person you are fighting with so if you run into anyone with a third world internet connection prepare to have a bad time.\n\nVisually, Injustice is a bit of a mixed bag. The stages are wonderfully detailed and crumble around the combatants on screen as your heroes deliver punishing blows. The characters themselves generally look good but skin textures are woefully plain, devoid of details like pours or variation in skin tone, while their costumes are richly detailed. This incongruency is a bit of a distraction, particularly during cutscenes. The cutscenes themselves can seem pretty empty at times with austere buildings and simple textures making up the environments. Some effects, like splashing water, are a bit bland and fail to enhance the cinematic vibe NetherRealm was going for in the story. Luckily most of this doesn't matter when the pugilism starts. Fights are smooth and they look pretty damn exciting. Expect people in your household to spectate should they catch you playing.\n","June 11, 2014","true","5.3"," 89 of 126 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","89","126","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Juxtavarious/recommended/242700/","Juxtavarious","Juxtavarious","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Juxtavarious/","132 products in account","GAMEPLAY: The PC port of this game is increasingly infamous for bugs and glitches.  Particularly with key binding.  Several of the minigames in the main story are bugged so that you have to push the default buttons for it to register.  It still shows you the keys that you've set but it won't count if that's what you hit.  Beyond that, combos don't always properly register, even simple ones.  The battle style is rather simple, somewhere between Super Smash Brothers and Soul Calibur.  The combos don't take fifty different buttons and an understanding of calculus to pull off so that's a plus for me.  The moves do get a little repetetive and seem to encourage button mashing at times.\n\nNot everyone seemed to like the story mode but I actually thought that it was pretty well done with some beautiful references to the comics and a few movies/shows.  It felt consistent with the way the characters are in the comics for the most part.  The story mode flows well and increases in difficulty evenly.  I thought it was a great way to get to know the fighters and their individual abilities.  The button issues made that more difficult but it was still manageable.\n\nAUDIO: The music in this game seems a bit broken.  During most of the fight scenes I couldn't hear anything with the volume on maximum.  What I could hear just came across as underwhelming.  The music just wasn't that Impressive, it didn't feel like it added to the story or make the battles feel more intense.  This left me with turning off the game's music and just substituting my own.  The only thing more annoying than the music was the voice work (specifically in battle).  The voices were spot on for the most part, maybe except for Raven which seemed REALLY out of place, but the lines are very limited.  VERY limited.  All of the characters, regardless of costumes, have exactly one opening, one half-life, and one victory line.  That's it.  I don't expect a hundred lines per character but is a half dozen really asking too much?  Especially for ♥♥♥♥ Grayson, the original punny smart mouth.  It just makes the characters feel less deep when they have such a limited vocabulary.  I would have loved it if the characters had more commentary for specific characters, areas, and attack combos.  One of the staples of comics has been the witty banter and it is entirely absent from the free play.  There's a small amount in the story but even that is limited to opening and closing statements.  I just wish there had been more on an auditory level with this game.\n\nIn the PC version, all the characters and costumes are already unlocked.  Several of the costumes represent entirely different characters such as Batman's "Flashpoint" costume which is actually Thomas Wayne, an entirely differnet Batman.  There are a few others that fall under the same category but don't have any difference which takes away some of the immersion.  They are literally costumes and bring nothing to the table that isn't a slight visual cameo.  The audio work in this game really killed it for me.  There was so much ground to cover and I don't even think they reached the bare minimum of what I wanted from it.\n\nVISUAL: The game looks amazing.  The trailers did the work of showing off what the game actually looks like and it maintains consistency between cut scenes and fight scenes.  My biggest issue here was the costuming, several in particular.  I'll start with my favorite girl, Harley Quinn.  I'm annoyed with a few costuming choices but hers in particular with her 'original' look.  I didn't care for it in Batman Arkham Asylum when they made her buxom, she's supposed to be athleticly built so being buxom would inhibit her gymnastics style of fighting, but this costume seems like it went the other way.  I nor my friends could figure out why she wasn't wearing a bra for her costuming.  It just makes her look off.  It just doesn't make sense.\n\nThe most notable female character in all of DC probably has to be Wonder Woman.  I like all of her costumes in this game except for her Regime costume.  In one scene in particular her chest is laughably oversized.  It's like watching X-Men the Anime all over again.  The way that her costume is cut, and the leisure dress she's wearing in a cutscene in the story mode, just make her look a little too 'fan service.'  She comes off looking ridiculous at times.  This is more noticable in the cut scenes than the battles but it's there.\n\nI'm going to lump the 'mega macho' male characters togethere here because from what we noticed during gameplay that nearly all of the male characters walk bow legged.  It's like they just got off a horse or took a super in their shorts.  They just look awkward.  It's really apparent when Green Lantern is walking down a corridor in an early scene and his thighs don't touch.  They're huge, but they don't touch.  This just looks like it's meant to be a spoof on comic books because of the overly hulky guys not being able to move properly in reality.\n\nOther than than some costume choices and some awkward clipping/shaking, the rest of the characters look great and it's nice to flip through  the costumes and scenes.  Though I hope that they will add more costumes for Zatanna, Bat Girl, Lobo, and Martian Manhunter (the characters they have on the 'cover image' for the game).  They have given no support for what were originally DLC characters in terms of costumes.  Manhunter should have several looks from various periods.  And if they came out with the Earth 2 costumes from "Crisis on Two Earths" I would be endlessly extatic!\n\nOVERALL:  After the novelty of the DC characters goes away, the game is pretty basic.  It's not bad it just doesn't feel like it brings anything new to the table.  As a DC fan, I don't find it believable that certain characters should be able to have a 'fight,' in several scenarios it should be slaughter.  If you follow the story in the game, the characters have a pill based on Kryptonian nanotech that gives  them extreme durability, it should give it to all of them relatively equally so that the weaker characters should still be powerless to characters like Superman and Doomsday.  Seeing all other characters keep up with Flash or go toe to toe with Superman and Wonder Woman just doesn't seem consistent with the DC universe.  It's nit picking, I know, and if it were going to be faithful to the comics then a game like this couldn't even exist so guess I just have to accept that this is a universe where Superman doesn't have that much power (and I can deal with that).  I'm still glad that I have the game and I got it half off, but if not for that then I wouldn't have even bothered.  There is just too much that this game needs to fix and deal with before it's on par with its console based coutnerparts.\n\nIt's biggest problems are functionality.  Keys don't bind properly, moves don't always execute properly, some moves don't execute at all, the game lags on single player, and sometimes the game runs in slow motion.  It has too many glitches and the response time is lacking.  The game needs to be patched.  Once this happens, I will change my rating from negative to a positive.  If you can get this for more than 50% off then I definitely say go for it, but there is no way that this game is worth $50 as it is.  It's just not.","December 31, 2013","false","14.6"," 27 of 37 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","27","37","0","0"

You might think that they only use the 'saxxy popular' characters like Harley Quinn, Catwoman, Batman and Superman, but it's really not like that. For instance, i like Raven, Zatanna and Killer Frost (who aren't so 'saxxy popular' and used in the Arkham series.)\n\n- Good and fun gameplay, stop saying it looks like MK. I like the way every character has a unique power. using the power really helps sometimes, like Harley's present, if You're low on health the present picks Ivy's rose which regenerates some of her health or the Joker picture which Increases attack damage on the opponent. I also like the 'launch' option which helps you in fighting to your opponent. These don't exist in MK.\n\n- The S.T.A.R.S lab missions, they're unique, challenging and fun.\n\n- The fact that you can have a single fight.\n\n- Various Level Transitions and Interactive objects. It's not the typical: Punch, Kick and Stab/Freeze/Shoot/Pummel. These make the game more Fun.\n\n-The game runs on my crappy PC.\n\n- Character's clothes start ripping off when they take damage\n\n- The menu music is catchy.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- The WBID iOS B-♥♥♥♥. Really? I have to own an ishitphone to get Harley Quinn's AC outfit? I'd get it if the unlocks are available through the Android version of the app too, but just iOShit? Really?\n\n- Scorpion... Really? Injustice is a GAME not a mod for MK. It really looks more different than MK. Why put Scorpion instead of any other DC character like Robin, Poison Ivy or Starfire?\n\n- Some gameplay mechanics, Combos are really just the way you are going to spam 2 buttons. But also there are the special moves, when i play, i either choose to fight with just combos or just special moves. It's really hard to use them both in one battle, because when i do try, i usually start loosing the match, but maybe it's just me.\n\n- Online fighting.\n\n- Killer Frost, Catwoman's Ame-comi outfit and Batgirl Don't have Hair physics, it looks really stiff and un-realistic.\n\n- Well, the design on men with tights and underwear, they don't have 'ball drops' which makes them look like they don't have  a..... male reproductive organ. (or it's just pervy me)\n\n\nThat's all really. 9.5/10.

Why? Because they don't even care if the online lags like hell, they just got our money and didn't fix ♥♥♥♥, like they did to Mortal Kombat Komplete Edition.\nAnyway, so, this is a good fighting game overall, very similar to MK, in almost every possible way, and i don't mind that at all, i know it was developed by the same people (which i guess they are some lazy ♥♥♥♥s with a limited imagination, you will see why i do think this way).\n\nShort story, it's a 2D fighting game with heroes and villains from the DC Universe, the game is very fun to play. The story is short (some guy said in a review that he finished the story in about 10 hours, i was a little happy to hear that, of course, i didn't actually believe it 100%), i finished the story in about 1.5 hours, and i was dissapointed.\nYou can do regular fights vs AI, you even have lots of fight types to choose from.\nYou have a level-up system, but it doesn't do much, i mean, you only get new "player calling cards" and badges for the calling cards by leveling up, nothing big.\nGraphics are well-done, and the games was greatly optimized.\nYou can use pieces of enviroment like i don't know, trash cans, cars, to hurt your opponent. Also, you have many possibilities to destroy the level you play on.\nThe fights are always very unique, and fun, you never get bored or tired.\n\nNow, about the problems and what i didn't like:\n- Roster, well, it has pretty much everyone that was important in the DC Universe, but something bugs me. They put Scorpion (Don't get me wrong, i love mortal kombat and i love scorpion alot, but c'mon, it's probably the worst decision they come up with. Total lack of imagination, a horrible idea), but they didn't put Deadshot, KGBeast, Red Arrow, Black Canary, Beastboy, Darkseid, Scarecrow, Ra's Al Ghul, Pandora, Starfire, Robin. I mean, they had so many options, they could've make us so happy. But no, let's put ♥♥♥♥ing scorpion, because, everyone wants to play with a MK character in a superheroes game. I would've preferred if they've put ♥♥♥♥ing Krypto (the dog) rather than scorpion, and i tell you again, i am a fan of Mortal Kombat, and a fan of Scorpion. But he has no place in this game. That was one of their biggest mistakes. What's next? Brian Griffin? Stalin? Or, hey, ♥♥♥♥, i don't know, let's put Ben 10 maybe, because, ♥♥♥♥ it.\n- Online mode, really? again? Lags like hell, some times you don't see anyone in the rooms. Also, the fighting system which is good in single player, online it's a big problem, you see kids that play with no purpose of actually having fun, only trolling, that use the same move repeatedly until you die. Another fail from WB.\n\nLazy ♥♥♥ developers that don't even try to fix the problems, they only talk ♥♥♥♥ about fixing, and how it was "fixed" but i don't see any difference, i have a strong internet connection, i have a decent computer, yet, i can't play Injustice or MK online because of the lag. They are too lazy to repair this problem, even tho, they ripped us off, again, for the second time.\nMK and Injustice sold so many copies, and at first they both were 60 euros, imagine, if only 500.000 customers bought each game. 1.000.000 customers in total, do some math, They got so much money, and yet, they treat us like ♥♥♥♥.\n\nI didn't set this review as 'not recommended' only because i am a fan of DC comics, and i am happy to see this game. But these 'developers'.... Until i see more DC characters instead of some scorpion in the game, and the onlinde mode fixed. You won't have my respect, i won't be a happy customer (but i guess, you didn't even care about that since you don't even fix a god damned online mode).\n\nThe story was good, but short. Graphics are great. Gameplay is awesome.\nBut don't buy this if you want to play on-line.","December 11, 2013","true","25.2"," 25 of 38 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","25","38","0","0"

When the game first came out, I had a 'do not recommend' rating on it because of the non-working multiplayer and the numerous bugs and crashes, even though my system is well above the recommended specs for this game.  It seems many of these issues have been corrected so I am now recommending based on my recent experience.\n\nFirstly the game screams "really bad console port" upon navigating the UI of the game.  Having to use WASD keys to navigate and press "G" to accept options seemed very lazy to me and tells me that there was very little to no effort placed on UI conversion from console to PC.  There appears to be no mouse support at all for UI navigation.  Makes it very confusing unless you are dedicated to using controller only.  Controller support however was very good and the game worked great with my Logitech F310.  This is a minor issue since the 2D fighting games are usually best played with gamepad anyway.\n\nThe single player story is actually pretty good for this type of game.  The story explores the concept of an alternate comic reality where the heroes have determined that man cannot rule themselves.  The heroes take on an authoritarian rule and attempt to justify their means as what must be done for the good of man.  The heroes of our universe end-up getting pulled into this "mirror" universe to take on their counterparts and keep the battle from coming to our reality and doing what is right while they are there.  While the story was very good it was also very short.  Took me only 4 hours to complete the single player story and I was taking my time doing it.\n\nThe levels are very well designed for a 2D fighter.  The levels have destructible elements and also have various means of interaction that can be used in the fight, like kicking a character into an object,  throwing an object or activating a technology item to use against the opponent.  The levels also have transitions where you can smack an opponent through the wall with a nice animation and have land in a different part of the level.  The destructible items, object interactions and level transitions are features that make a super themed fighter feel more "super".\n\nThere are also a ton of extra features like S.T.A.R. labs which acts as a sort of challenge mode and allows you to unlock more content.  There is also a practice mode and a quick match mode for those wanting to get a quick versus fight against the AI in.  There are a lot of unlockables in this game like portraits, icons and backgrounds for your Hero card.  There is also a lot of unlockable concept art and music as well.  A collector will find a lot of things to do here.\n\nThe multiplayer did not work at launch but it appears that these issues have been recently fixed.  I have only played a very small amount of MP but had not trouble finding a match when trying to do so.  I have read reviews where there are still some multiplayer stability and connection issues and the developers have mentioned that further patches to correct these issues are still coming.\n\nThe Ultimate Edition comes with all of the previously released DLC characters that were on the console versions of the game.  This is nice since the game will include all of the characters without any more investment.\n\nOnce the initial issues were patched the game was fairly enjoyable.  I am not sure that I would recommend paying full price for this title, but if you enjoy 2D fighting games then you will probably like this one.  A pretty good buy at the recent 50% sale price that I seen on Steam.","November 12, 2013","true","6.0"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

The few times I could connect or tried to play the bonus S.T.A.R. Labs challenge mode also resulted in my keyboard control settings getting reset to default without even telling me. Yes, this is a game apparently so hastily ported that it can't handle customized controls for certain areas of play, even though the default keyboard controls are atrocious and seem to be designed by someone who has never played on a PC before.\n\nThis is made up for by great balancing (save for Green Lantern), fluid animation, easy to execute but hard to master combos, and some of the best ideas to open up fighting games to the general masses. Seriously, if you've ever wanted to get into a fighting game but couldn't and like DC, then this is the game for you. They have a full training level, practice mode, and very scalable AI that lets you get better at your own pace. If you are using a controller, then you can even practice most of your combos in the S.T.A.R. Labs for each character and get a better feel for them. There's no sense of shame having to start on Easy once you realize you've got enough memorized to move on up to far greater challenges.\n\nSo it's entirely about what you want in a fighting game. Do you enjoy battling AI? Do you enjoy just fighting it out, even if it isn't another human opponent? Then this is an excellent game for you. Do you want to fight people online? Then you're better off getting a console version or the PS Vita version of Ultimate Edition. Do you want to fight with a controller or keyboard? I frankly think you shouldn't have to decide, but that actually impacts your decision here to, sad as it is. I'm going to probably get plenty more hours out of it than I already have; but there are far better, more complete experiences for the same price as this game. Get it on sale if you can, unless the simple idea of a good DC fighting game in of itself is too hard to resist.","September 23, 2015","true","19.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","3"

If however, you are looking for a story or are a fan of Mortal Kombat Komplete edition and how they did their stories, this might be for you.\n\nThis game is literally Mortal Kombat Komplete minus the fatalities. The special moves are all still there with an abundance of characters. Abilities vary whereas some may powerup as their special while others may choose a different fighting stance ( such as Wonder Woman going from a lasso to her sword). What I particularly like about this game what made me feel like I was playing MK Deception was the ability to use the environment as a weapon. Some stages have missiles, cars, or barrels hanging around waiting to be tossed at your opponent. Some stages become death traps as you may knock a character off center and into something in the scenery and bounce them back for a combination hit (such as you can kick someone into something in the background and they'll come flying back). My favorite though hands down is in some stages you send someone flying through a wall with a power hit, they go flying through multiple buildings or floors into another stage. The fighting itself is alright with nothing extremely spectacular and difficulty levels are appropriate.\n\nThe visuals are neat. Everything is kept clean and the cut scenes are very nice to watch.\n\nI played this game for it's story as it was quite a cliffhanger. I play this once in a while when a friend comes over but as for replayability, not quite here.\n\nIt's an average game that will most likely appeal to MK Komplete fans in how they ran their story.\n\nRating : 7/10","April 2, 2015","true","4.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

Amazing game!\n\nInjustice: Gods Among Us Ultimate Edition is one of the best fighting games I've ever played, and I've played a few!\n\nI will be comparing this to one of my favourite fighting games, Mortal Kombat Komplete Edition, which was also made by NetherRealm Studios.\nInjustice brings new mechanics to the table, such as throwing random objects (such as barrels and monitors) found in the different stages at your opponent, and some stage (not all though) changes when you hit your opponent hard enough into one of the corners. Also, your health bar doesn't refill after winning a round. Combat has also been improved, much faster and fluid combos, and different blocking controls.\n\nBut there's also stuff missing. In this title you can only fight 1vs1, you don't have the tag-team fights which Mortal Kombat has.\n\nThe rest, I'll just make a list with Pros & Cons to make it simple.\n\nPros:\nAmazing graphics and dynamic lighting;\n30 fighters to choose from;\nInteractable and a decent number of stages;\nDecent story mode;\nVery neat menus;\nLots of fighting to do;\nIn-depth combat but simple controls;\nLots of costumes;\nGlorious animations;\nXP based levelling system (for unlockables, etc);\nScorpion!\nCons:\nNo tag-team battles;\nEverything is unlocked from the start (except for the icons, backgrounds and badges)**In my opinion, it takes away the joy of unlocking new costumes and other stuff.\n\n\nI haven't really tried the multiplayer online, so I can't express my feelings on it. But the local multiplayer is a joy, the fighting is very fun and addictive when having a friend on the same skill level as you are.\n\nI'm sure there is more positive stuff and probably some bad stuff too, but I can't seem to remember any right now.\n\nAll in all, this game is very, very good! If you're a fan of fighting games like me, you are definitely going to enjoy this title, and if you're into super heroes, then you absolutely MUST get it!\nIt is well worth the full price, but if you catch it on sale, well...

Game is packed full of content and is worth the £40, but i was lucky enough to get it for £40. The game is an amazing fighting game which i love to play with friends, its very very fast and combos are easily executed. However i do not really like the single player campaign, it is a nice addition but i buy fighting games for the actual fighting, not story. Decent story but a bit meh at times. The worst thing about this in my opinion is the stupid mini games they have added, they are a waste of time and you have to do them in the story else you wont progress and if you fail them you will have a penalty in the next fight, ie health reduction. I do not like that idea at all, but apart from that the game is amazing, online play is near to perfect on a smooth connection. Played some online games and there is a slight delay with combo-ing, i have noticed but only in longer combos. Apart from that i ♥♥♥♥ing love this game to bits and will carry on playing it for a long time.","December 3, 2013","true","12.7"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

And that's still enough to make me post a negative review. Maybe the gameplay will be enough to redeem it. But it better be pretty damn spectacular.\n\nI started the game and was presented with an unskippable vanity movie displaying the studio names. Not even actual story content, just, "hey, we made this, and you must watch for the next ten seconds while we preen. Every time." But hey, whatever. It's only ten seconds out of my life.\n\nNext up, a splash screen, prompting me to press space before I could access the menu. Because again, I wanted to look at a splash screen rather than the menu where I could actually do something, but again, this is common enough in ports from the consoles, so I'll overlook it.\n\nA bafflingly long load time, then... the menu. With an offer for a special skin for the Flash that I can accept by pressing 4, or decline by pressing 6. Well, thanks, but no. EXCEPT PRESSING 6 DOES NOTHING! Wow, strong arm techniques much? Wait, 4 DOES NOTHING EITHER?!? Is my numlock on? No? Is it the keys above the letters instead of the number pad? Can I click on the buttons? DOES ANYTHING %$@!^#% WORK? I can't even pick an option that lets me close the game, so I have to ungracefully close the program via Windows.\n\nOkay, has anyone else had this problem? Turns out, yes. And it's not a recent thing, either, the problem was in game when it launched on Steam, and has never been addressed. It turns out, the 4 and 6 I'm expected to be pressing are the 4 and 6 on my gamepad. I... don't have a gamepad. However, if when the splash screen prompted me to press space, I instead randomly decided to press 4 (not even suggested as an option), I'd have keyboard support. Well, okay, maybe they just assumed that I didn't have a keyboard, and that... wait, THEY REQUIRED I PRESS SPACE?!? THEY KNEW I HAD A %$@!^#% KEYBOARD!\n\nOkay, whatever. I'm past this hurdle, maybe I can at least play the game now. Let's see... navigating the menu...\n\nOh. Excellent.\n\nTo navigate the menu, you use the oh-so-intuitive keys "G" and "J", which you can use to get past the game's first level of defeating the obnoxious marketing pop-up. A quick peek into the controls set up shows that these will apparently also be the keys that you use to control your character, so get used to them. There's at least a reminder lurking down in the bottom right that you access the menu via "G" and "J", unless it's gone weird and reverted back to "4" and "6" for whatever reason.\n\nLook. I know I've only got 10 minutes on record as of this review. I know I've not even experienced any actual gameplay. Maybe NetherRealms have something engaging back there. But those ten minutes alone are enough to make me want to punch every so-called developer at High Voltage for this travesty of a port, and frankly, how the heck can it take me ten minutes to see any actual gameplay?\n\nI'm going to try to at least get some value out of my spent money. For your part, go and pay a random stranger in the street $10 to punch you in the face. It'll be quicker, easier to understand, and probably more fun.","January 23","false","20.9"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","13","20","2","0"

I usually wait a bit more time to give a game a thorough review but I find that fighting games, initially don't require as much time to review (as say for example an rpg, or adventure game). Especially since fighting games typically have a short story/single player campaign/arcade mode that you can finish rather quickly. That being said, this review is going to be based solely on the single player portions of the game. Sorry guys, take a look at my library, I'm not a multiplayer kind of guy...\n\nInjustice is a Fighting game set in the universe if DC Comics and is brought to you by the makers of the Mortal Kombat franchise.\n\nIn Injustice's case, the game has a great presentation. The story mode is probably the most well done story mode I've seen in a fighting game. The campaign allows you to experience a well written dialogue worthy of the DC Comic's name brand, the scenes transition seemlessly in the fights. There is a fine balance between the story, the fights, quick time events and mini-games to break the repetitiveness that may occur and Injustice does this exceedingly well. Keeping things fresh for gamers all around.\n\nThe controls are buttery smooth, they feel natural and are never flailing. There seems to be no lag or delay between button response and character's reaction to them. There are different levels of a.i fighters and each of them are executed well, leaving for alot of replayability and player growth.\n\nThere is a good array of characters to choose from. Pretty much the biggest names of DC Comics and a few not so much. Whether you're a fan of the heroes or a fan of the villains, there's something here for you, although to be honest I did find myself at times, wanting more. Moving on, there is a fair amount of unlockables to keep playing for so other than just mastering each character, there is alot of replayability to be had through unlockables -such as Hero cards- and a sly feature mode called Star Labs.\n\nOne thing I did find to be a tad odd was the developer's choice to not include a blocking mechanic in-battle. You don't have a block button, it's just a bit strange but the gameplay is fun enough to keep this from becoming any real issue.\n\nI myself, am a big fan of the DC Comic's universe had to purchase this game eventually. I like the watching the shows Arrow, The Flash, Legends Of Tomorrow and Gotham, I also own all of the Arkham games as well as the Lego Batman games as well so hopefully this fees my DC Comic hunger for a bit until something new comes out.\n\nI recommend this game if you are a fan of DC Comics and Mortal Kombat type fighting. Of course, the moves aren't as brutal but the feelingis very similar to that of Mortal Kombat.\n\nReview based on the current build of the single-player portions of the game, bought at a conveniently low pricepoint.","February 25","true","6.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","4"

Injustice: Gods Among Us is quite the opposite in my personal opinion.\n\nI'll start out by discussing the single-player of the game. The story is fairly interesting, but it isn't exactly the most riveting tale in my opinion. It's pretty straightforward, and there are not really any surprise twists that make it seem any less generic. With that said however, it does provide a good 4-5 hours of fun. It may seem like that is incredibly short, but there is more to single-player. Battle mode is an interesting feature than has you facing several foes in a row with various modes. For example, there is one mode that has you facing all villains, another all heroes, and another facing several random foes with only a quarter of your health. These are fairly challenging, and do make the game worth playing outside of the campaign. Additionally, there are missions under the heading "STAR Labs", which are essentially trials that test your ability to make combos, defeat your ememy quickly, and other things. These are also a fun thing that extend the overall length of the single-player game. Of course, last but not least, you can do solo battles against the AI if you so please.\n\nNow for the multi-player. You are able to play with someone else assuming you have some other sort of peripheral for control(second controller, keyboard, etc). It's basically the same as the console version of the game in this respect. In regards to the online however...it's a bit of a different story. I have found matches difficult to find, and they are fairly laggy and not very enjoyable. It just does not work well at all. If you're a person who is thinking about purchasing this with the hopes of playing online, I would not make this purchase. It's not worth your money if you do not believe that you will get a good amount of enjoyment out of just the single-player elements of the game.\n\nTo conclude, Injustice: Gods Among Us is an enjoyable experience. The controls work fine, and there are no serious issues as far as I can see with the game technically, outside of the basically unplayable multiplayer. If you're a person who is looking for a fun fighting game on PC, and don't care too much about online play, then it is worth a buy. If the online play is a major factor for you, I would pass this game by.","January 24, 2014","true","66.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","3"

Many users have reported having a plethra of issues ranging from resolution problems, to issues where the game refuses to run. By this game at your own risk.\n\nThis game costs $22 at the time when I bought it. For 5 hours gameplay, it was a dissapointment. I was expecting ATLEAST 10 hours, but I could see how it would become boring with such a linear gameplay. The game first wouldn't go above 800x600 @ 75Hz in the options menu, but after some mucking around within the ini file I got it working.

I didn't played enough of fighting games before so I might miss few points you look for, but I still can easily recommend this game to everyone around just to try it out. It have everything you might require from fighting game - plenty of character to choose from (missing some minor DC heroes), good graphics, lots of combos to learn and, what I liked most, high level of enviroment interaction. Must-have for every DC fan.\n\nAdvantages\nFighting system is full of combos and sweet moves with super powers usage\nGraphics are quite good looking with nicely detailed enviroment\nLevel design is almost perfect and fun, full of interactive elements and possible transitions to 2nd part of the level\nCharacters design is even better, properly recreated look and behavior of all 30 DC characters you can play as, along with nicely done relations between allies and enemies\nMultiplayer is working properly for me and it's suprisingly hard, guess I'm really bad at fighting games but it's hard to keep up with some of players that I was matched with\nRich single-player content - you can choose between story mode, few types of arcade modes and mission mode. It also explains some relations between characters (for players not familiar with DC universe)\nDisadvantages\nJust as I thought, hard to play without a controller\nLow activity in multi-player\nFPS drops occur from time to time\nIn my opinion low balance between few characters\nNot all DC characters are in game so I guess some people will be disappointed not seeing their favourite ones\n\nIf you find my review helpful or funny be sure to follow Opium Pulses curator page right here for more reviewed games!","February 11","true","11.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

What it does have are power struggles where you run at each other at high speed and try to beat the other one up. It's basically just pressing a button but it does look cool. It just doesn't manage to impress. I expected more epic battles.\n\nKnocking someone through the stage is cool (not only cool looking, see ?), however and using the environments to damage your opponents definitely keeps things fresh and exciting.\n\nThe story itself is good, as is the voice acting. The graphics are hit and miss; the environments can look beautiful but the characters miss some fine detail and the faces are a bit messed up if you ask me.\n\nStill, there's plenty of gameplay to be found here. The story can be completed in 4-5 hours. After that, you can still do tens of missions, battle your friends or strangers and collect artwork, outfits and things like that. If you're really into fighters I think there's enough gameplay to keep you playing for at least another 15 hours.\n\nIn the end, Injustice is no Mortal Kombat, but as long as you can keep that in mind you'll have a great time with it !

With Injustice, it finally came true. The comics are excellent, and the idea of making the conclusion in the form of a game like this was one of the best I've seen. The game itself is great, as it has a Mortal Kombat-esque gameplay (not much of a surprise since it's the same team), it has an amazing art direction and the voice acting is super.\n\nHowever, it has a few downsides. The PC port, while it looks waaaay better than its console counterparts, has all of the cinematics locked to 720p, which looks watered down after seeing the game itself run in 1080p with amazing effects and HD textures. The multiplayer doesn't work properly, and some of the achievements are bugged.\n\nAll in all, adding all DLC in a single pack for this release was a good bonus, so I'd say it's worth buying when it's on sale.

The result is that Injustice's gameplay  would be closer to a Tekken or a Mortal kombat.\n\nMultiplayer isn't that bad, but like many games which have been around for long, the people left are often veterans, making it noob-unfriendly.\n\nI am still bummed that some of my favorite DC characters are not in it. No Supergirl, Starfire or Brainiac for instance. But I guess it was impossible to please everybody when electing the roster.\n\nThe Pros : 30 characters. Famous ones from DC no less.\nGood fighting system. Based around premade combos but offer options to chain them.\nLots of single player content. (story, various "arcade" modes, mission mode)\nYou can interact with the environment during the fight. Interactions change depending on your character type (agile, super strong, gadget-based...).\nMultiplayer exists and works decently\nYou can play as (character you like here)\nThe Cons : You might like it better when a game has no premade combos\nThe environment interactions are most of the time enabled. Could be a problem for those who don't like that system.\nMultiplayer not very active and not revolutionary in general.\n"Character powers" (specific mechanic on a button) are not as unique as in Blazblue\n(character you like here) might not be playable.\nThe game is currently on sale for 5 euros. It is just incredible value.\nUnless you are allergic to superheroes and/or fighting games with premade combos, this is a great opportunity to pick it up. If the sale is over when you read this, a future one is likely to happen as I bought it at the previous sale for about the same.\n\nEven at its current full price of about 20 euros this game is far from being a scam anyways. Worth it even if your favorite character is not in it.","September 19, 2015","true","53.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

However, the PC thing is only half good, since I have to recommend for all PC users to stay away from the game. The port is horribly done in that many users will experience gameplay in slow motion even on very high end machines with no real permanent fix and no patch in sight. I consider this a broken port and hardly playable at all.\nThat said, the visuals in this game are pretty spectacular and I like the character-pecific design of the moves as well. The gameplay is on the defend by moving backwards variety, there are several types of cancels, each character has a list of special moves and a super move as well as a special ability. The stages feature interactive objects which can enhance mobility and deal damage as well as stage transitions presented in impressive cinematics. Unfortunately not only can the high damage stage interactions be a balance problem in competitive play but the cinematics for super moves and stage transitions are very long, unskippable and always the same, as are the entrances and victory animations that you'll be forced to watch over and over and quickly lose their wow-factor.\nTL;DR The game is good but not great, however the port is broken and you shouldn't buy it.","July 15, 2014","false","63.9"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

Also, you might want to know I prefer older, simpler fighting games over the more complex new ones of today (given the chance to play Super Turbo or USFIV I would always go for ST). I am telling you all this, because as refined as Injustice may be, I had considerably less amounts of fun with it, compared to it's "sort of" prequel MK9.\n\nMy main gripes with Injustice can be separated into two categories: gameplay and presentation. Let us talk about gameplay first. Injustice plays somehow more clunky than the previous Mortal Kombats. There are many design decisions that changed the game into a direction that I find less enjoyable to play than MK9. One of the big selling points of Mortal Kombat had always been the huge characters and the somewhat up close and personal fighting. For whatever reason the characters in Injustice are about half the size of the fighters from MK9 - now, this leads to a couple of problems, mainly different spacing/zoning to what I am used to and also a messed up perception of ranges, particularly normals. Simply put: a lot of the characters feel like they have short arms. Sure, this is something you can and will get used to over time - but (and I will get to that later) I am not willing to invest that time.  They also changed the Button-layout from the previous game by Netherrealm. You are down to three actual attack-buttons, and lots of buttons that do all kinds of weird things. It may be simplified, but I had a harder time playing like that to be honest. I guess the main reason for that is that I am so used to even number button layouts (at least 2 for kicks and 2 for punches) that I get confused - because attacks are actually no longer punches or kicks bu can be pretty much everything - a light attack could be a kick, a heavy attack could be a punch and vice versa. Now add directions to those attacks and it is a real mess, it feels kinda hard to tell what button will do what in certain situations. The troubling thing is, I have trouble "reading" the game because of this. You gotta learn that stuff, and in many cases it is pretty much non-sensical - not my cup of tea. The same applies for the special moves which are often highly situational and seemingly don't fit very well together sometimes almost contradicting themselves, letting me guess what their purpose might be - and how they fit with the character. As a result characters can be played with more diversity in an actual fight compared to something like Street Fighter but again, I would prefer it simpler, more clear cut.\n\nThe engine itself feels very stiff, compared to something like the excellent Skullgirls, that allows you to make combos on the fly, Injustice is super-strict about what can and cannot be chained together. It is not like you can really come up with something yourself - everything seems so preset/defined already. The principle seems to be always the same, do a one of the combos the game has built in, maybe mix it up with special move and then link it together at the cost of meter and repeat for more hits/higher damage. It seems very limited and I personally very much prefer the freeform style of something like Skullgirls. It also suffers a bit from Tekken-Syndrome, meaning that if you don't have Meter for a combo breaker you are forced to endure that 20hit extended combo that almost drains your entire life. Too add insult to injury, if you combo into a super move or stage transition there is some serious downtime where you are forced to simply watch for extended periods of time - a lot more than the X-Rays in the previous Mortal Kombat or the Ultras in Street Fighter.\n\nMentioning meter, they added a new "comeback" mechanic to the game: "Clash" - at the cost of meter you can either gain HP or do additional damage. Now, Clashes don't require any skill to execute and basically are another cutscene. Considering what it does, Clashes annoy me because they are slow and boring, break the (already not exactly amazing) flow of battles and usually just extend the time before the inevitable happens anyway. Stuff like X-Factor at least kept the downtime low, but Injustice goes for cutscenes whenever it can. Super Moves (which basically replace the X-Rays but are generally longer) are another offender when it comes to downtime and really take you out of the action. It sure is satisfying to combo into a Super but they take too long, which is a bit of theme with Injustice since "interactables" and especially the Stage transitions are the same - sometimes lengthy cutscenes that you watch while either you or your opponent is taking damage. It is too much. They may be fun the first couple of times but got really old, very quickly. So boring in fact, that I actually turned them off in local multiplayer. It kind of feels like all these mechanics are a diversion from the somewhat underwhelming core of the game, that, as far as I am concerned, doesn't quite click and simply doesn't feel as good as it could be. Overall, they tacked a lot of stuff onto the MK9 core and somehow made it worse.\n\nAnother reason the game doesn't feel right to me are the mostly boring and unspired special attacks. Some of these are downright embarassing in how wimpy they feel and and unexciting they look. Making Lobo (probably the coolest DC character ever) a slow, boring clutz of a shotgun-wielding grappler - really? And no additional costumes either, I want Simon Bisley represented! This is the part of the game I am actually really disappointed in.\n\nInjustice simply doesn't pack a punch. I don't know how they could make a game about superheroes that it so bland. Injustice has mostly muted, almost monochromatic colorpalettes and the stages are mostly war-torn, urban enviroments with few exceptions - compared to the incredible Mortal Kombat 9 backgrounds Injustice simply fails. Sure, destruction as you battle on is nice, but this is hardly an excuse for the boring setpieces.\nSame goes for the fighters themselves who got a pseudo-realistic treatment that I find unfitting for comicbook heroes. In comparison to Marvel vs. CAPCOM, Injustice doesn't do a good job of making these characters explode on the screen and presenting colorful, over the top action. Instead, you get stuff like Batmans supermove where he basically calls the Batmobile to crash into his opponent. A character like Batman and that is what they came up with for his "super" move? It is lame and lacking the excitement a fighting game should have in my book. I play fighting games for that rush you get from the sights and sounds too, you know, not only for pure gameplay (and even in that regard Injustice is sub-par as I have established earlier) - but I am not feeling Injustice's cast at all. There is not a single character that is visually pleasing or who looks cool when fighting. If you pull off some of those aforementioned combos it becomes decent, but outside of that it looks pretty rough animations-wise but the overall grittiness and lifelessness drags the game down.\n\nThe rest of the presentation - from font-choice to announcer voice and the incredibly underwhelming music (you will hardly notice it, it is that unremarkable) suffers from the same issues the rest of the game has. It is simply not exciting - you get this understated, somewhat serious vibe from it that I feel unfitting for comicbook-brawls. I don't know who thought this was the way to go - but in my opinion this game could have been a lot more over the top and more importantly more colorful. In fact, they took out everything I really liked about MK9 and instead made it this drab, uninspired game that feels more like something they had to do, instead of something they wanted to do. As it is I can't really recommend this game, instead grab MK9 for an overall better experience.","August 11, 2014","false","7.8"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","1"

It suffers from the usual story mode dryness and silliness, and as it is made by the people behind Mortal Kombat 9 share many of the mechanics and even basic story elements of that game (both the good, bad and ugly you might say). However, it feels a lot more welcome in this universe, and the explanation behind the excessive violence is satisfying and the lack of fatalities and brutalities - all be it the Super Moves kind of count as an X-Ray move and are still over the top, but not too bad for superheroes - means that it is more believable as to how the fighters survive. There are some interesting moments in the story, and the characters are well voiced for the most part. Head nods to iterations in games, movies, tv shows, and famous comic series - especially in regard to their costumes - abound. This game is thoroughly good fun and a must for fans of fighting games, superheroes, or anything like that especially.","May 16, 2015","true","21.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The neat thing about this game is you can send your enemies flying into different stages which causes extra damage.  The stages all have interactable objects to inflict pain.  For instance in the Batcave, you can use the Batmobile to fire rockets at the other player if you're near the computer console.  It has a story mode very similar to Mortal Kombat where you play different characters for 4 fights and then switch characters.  They added in minigames for the story which isn't much, but at least adds something to the fights.  If you win the minigames, the opponent starts with less health.  It has online and everything with different modes (but I haven't really checked that out.)  The one big complaint I have of this game is it ties in with the mobile game.  It doesn't affect the gameplay, but it does lock certain playercard artwork.  Basically you have to login to the mobile app beat the battles in it to unlock more artwork.  The mobile app looks amazing it just takes up 1GB of space on your phone and in my opinion the game isn't great enough to warrent that.  Overall, if you're a fan of fighting games this is a must have for your collection and if you're a fan of DC Comics I'd recommend checking this out.","March 17, 2014","true","14.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Get it on sale if you can, unless the simple idea of a good DC fighting game in of itself is too hard to resist.","February 14, 2014","true","27.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Even my almost game-illiterate girlfriend has enjoyed playing this with me.\n\nThe Great:\nThe roster of characters\nThe actual variety between characters' styles\nThe game modes, especially the ability to just fight individual matches between opponents.\n\nThe Good:\nThe combos are relatively intuitive and easy to learn\nThe arenas\nThe interaction with the scenery - which is rather wooden and limited at times, however\nThe ability to display combos out of the moves list onto the fighting screen itself as part of the HUD, making learning and practising moves much easier\n\nThe Meh;\nThe storymode is rather dry, and is almost summed up simply in the ladder fight mode\nThe Ultimate Edition extra characters are mostly tedious\nThe costumes are not that exciting, and cannot be seen when selecting characters so it is hard to know what they all look at without going through a separate menu\nThis leads on to the rather clumsy menu screens which are less than intuitive\n\nThe Bad:\nVery little, besides the rather superfluous and often tedious 'extra' game modes/challenges for each character that bear no relation to the fighting game, are mere fan service, and for the most part seem to be clumsy and awkward\n\nMy Summary:\nThe game is great fun, especially with friends in local coop, like all the best fighting games. It suffers from the usual story mode dryness and silliness, and as it is made by the people behind Mortal Kombat 9 share many of the mechanics and even basic story elements of that game (both the good, bad and ugly you might say). However, it feels a lot more welcome in this universe, and the explanation behind the excessive violence is satisfying and the lack of fatalities and brutalities - all be it the Super Moves kind of count as an X-Ray move and are still over the top, but not too bad for superheroes - means that it is more believable as to how the fighters survive. There are some interesting moments in the story, and the characters are well voiced for the most part. Head nods to iterations in games, movies, tv shows, and famous comic series - especially in regard to their costumes - abound. This game is thoroughly good fun and a must for fans of fighting games, superheroes, or anything like that especially.","May 16, 2015","true","21.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scrubsauce/recommended/242700/","scrubsauce","Scrubsauce","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scrubsauce/","394 products in account","A better Batman vs Superman story than "Dawn of Justice"?  Probably...?  As someone who was raised on Batman TAS, Justice League and Unlimited (but not Superman TAS, just personally can never buy into Superman), that animated universe and its interpretation of the characters make up the majority of my experience with the DC Universe.  So whenever a movie or game (see: Arkham series) can reunite some of the cast for those shows it will immediately have my attention.  Injustice fills that role perfectly, with most of the voice actors reprising their roles from my childhood memories.  Notable exclusions include The Joker and Lex Luthor, but it didn't detract too much, especially since I never felt this story was explicitly set in the same unvierse as the animated shows.  Most fights between characters seem fair, you never actually get someone like Arrow fighting Superman, though the plot provides a small explanation that is almost throwaway early in the campaign as to why all of the metahumans and vigilantes of various levels of abilities are able to square off with each other on even footing.\nGameplay wise, the game plays like your typical 2D fighter with 3D assets (there is no depth movement around the level like you'd find in games like Soul Calibur, etc.).  Levels have dynamic transitions you can trigger by smashing your enemy through the edge of the map with a specific move, that will usually transition to somewhere else entirely (like from inside Wayne Manor to the driveway).  There are also props in levels you can interact with to throw your enemy into or vice-versa.  As you play and build meter, you'll be able to "wager" against your opponent, where you quickly select how many chunks of your meter to put on the line, and the game then animates both characters heading towards each other in a flash of white.  If you win the wager, you'll be rewarded with a proportionate amount of health, if you lose, the same proportion will be expelled from your health bar.  Filling the meter entirely allows you to execute your special move, which often involves big, cinematic, multi-hitting combos that are executed for you.  Batman's has you beating an enemy senseless and backflipping in the air as the Batmobile literally runs them over.  Certain fights will have introduction sequences, like Green Arrow firing at Grundy, which feature quicktime events that can give you an edge against your opponent in the inevitable fight if you execute them correctly.\nBetween the DC alumni voice cast and the adequete fighting mechanics, even as a player who doesn't usually seek out fighting games I found myself enjoying the campaign.  I did not fiddle with online play or any of the special DLC characters that come in the ported bundle, but the campaign has you play plenty of face offs I've always wanted to see as a fan, and the cinematics could have been presented entirely on their own as stand-alone pre-rendered movie and I'd have enjoyed it.  If you're a DCAU fan, it wouldn't hurt to give this a look for the campaign by itself.","April 16","true","6.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

This game borrows heavily from MK9's combo system, but adds it own unique mechanics to the DC universe. A decently fun fighting game but its held back from reaching the upper echelon, by its wonky input system, i.e certain moves buffering into others, causing numerous missed or incorrect attacks. This game also boggles my mind as to why the combo system is so heavily scaled the more hits you put into a combo. I understand they didnt want players to have Touch of Death (T.O.D) combos for balance reasons, but they have other mechanics in place to prevent that from happening, like the clash system. It just feels wrong to di a long combo and have it deal less damage than a shorter more efficient one.

Many of DC's most iconic characters make it to the well-balanced roster and many of the others might show up to beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of your character if you allow your opponent to knock you through the stage's boundaries.\n\nInjustice's story mode is an enjoyable one, similar to Mortal Kombat in the sense that you play as one character in the story for a chapter and kick ♥♥♥ with them before moving onto the next.  Though I am not a DC Super Fan and may be incorrect in this statement, the story mode is an entirely new one written for this game with an exciting turn that answers one of the most popular what-if questions ever posed.\n\nI would highly recommend this game to DC fans looking for a solid fighting game as well as those who have enjoyed the more recent Mortal Kombat games (9 and X).

Looking at it today, $7 was actually a really low price for this masterpiece.\nI've never been a great fan of fighters, nor DC Comics, but damn, this game is good.\nI know you probably won't read a long long review, so let's summarise:\n--------PROS:\n-It's from the creators of Mortal Kombat, but it's much, much better than MK9. Definitely worth buying!\n-Gameplay: flows a lot better than any other fighting game yet. Controls are simple, gameplay is fun and addictive, and I even think I've had a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ playing it once. No, really.\n-Story: awesome. Netherrealm never did achieve a great storyline in the MK series, but this is PURE GOLD. It is based on DC's comic book "Injustice", and these guys did a ♥♥♥♥ing awesome job here. Not gonna spoil it, but it's definitely worth playing.\n-Each character has their own ending (even the DLC characters!), which you unlock by completing a series of battles (similar of what we have in MK9). This adds a lot more playtime to the game, and it's really badass to check out Netherrealm's great illustrations in the end.\n-Skins! You can equip various skins to the characters, adding a lot more replayability to the game. Also, there are the unofficial DLCs that you can download, that adds user-created costumes to the game, most of them comic-based.\n-Stages: interactive, beautiful and fast-paced.\n-Characters interact with each other, saying quotes to their opponent.\n-Graphics: gorgeous. While not as good as the ones we're having on MKX, it's still a joy to the eyes to see Batman kicking Superman's ♥♥♥ in 1080p.\n-Soundtrack: as to be expected, very good. Not much to comment here.\n-Voice acting is one of the best I've seen.\n-Ultimate Edition gives you 60 new missions, 6 new characters (including MK's all-time favourite Scorpion) and 30+ skins.\n-S.T.A.R. Labs missions add a lot of more challenge and gameplay time.\n-You can check out all of the character's bios, of every skin.\n-Aquaman is surprisingly not useless in this game.\n---------CONS:\n-Has and end.\n-Multiplayer services are not the best. Matchmaking is bad, but playing private matches with friends and splitscreen works fine.\n-Graphics may look a little without colour on some configurations, but there are mods that easily fix that.\n-Some FPS problems at map transitions and more complex moves.\n-Sometimes, small delay on sound effects, but these don't stay for long.\n-WBID Unlocks. In order to unlock some content on this PC version, you have to complete some tasks in the Injustice Mobile App. You then link your account to this version, and get your itens, that can be skins, badges and etc. While a nice idea, not everyone has the patience to play it, and it is really glitchy (I've waited four days in order to get my Batman: Beyond skin after completing the mobile version task).\n-Some irrelevant characthers were added to the game, which could be replaced by much much better ones. Killer Frost? Really? Zod? And who the ♥♥♥♥ is Zatanna?\n-No Adam West skin for Batman.\nFinal veredict: 9.5/10. Worth buying even when not in sale, but waiting for one is wise (it's been down to 75% of it's full price already),","October 10, 2014","true","26.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I can't remember another fighting game where I mainly played it because of the story.\n\nSure, there are also a few weird moments but the heck, it's sometimes EPIC what you get there.\n\nIn the forums there is a lot of rage about the multiplayer but for me it worked well. Not perfect (you have to wait a few mins to be able to play a match) but it's ok.\n\nGo for it if you like fighting games and even if it's not your most favourite genre, you will see a lot of super heroes and villians and experience a well made story.","January 1, 2014","true","5.9"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/242700/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Who would win a fight: Batman or Superman? It's an age-old question for comic book fans, and the reason a game like Injustice: Gods Among Us Ultimate Edition exists. We want to see our favorite heroes and villains beat the snot out of each other.\n\nDeveloper NetherRealm Studios finds a suitably comic book way for this to happen, using a dimension-hopping story to smash alternative versions of familiar characters against one another. It's a conceit typical of the DC Comics multiverse, but it opens the door for Injustice's greatest strength—its story mode.\n\nMuch like its stablemate Mortal Kombat: Komplete Edition, Injustice's main single-player mode is an eight-hour campaign told from multiple perspectives. Each chapter puts you in control of a different character—including the villains—and mixes up traditional 1 vs 1 fights with QTE minigames. The story mode autosaves at each fight so if you lose you can quickly start again, but transitions between smooth 60fps fights and the pre-rendered 30fps movie cinematics can be a little jarring. That said, the story's quality compares pretty well to the recent Justice League animated series—it's not Shakespeare, but I wanted to find out what was going to happen next.\n\nNetherRealm has streamlined its typical MK fighting engine into a four-button configuration. Each of the game's 30 characters have light, medium, and heavy attacks as well as a quick button for a “character trait” power. Batman summons robot bat-droids, while Green Lantern glows, well, green, and hits harder for a short time. You can throw enemies with a simple tap, or, if your Super Power gauge is full, use an ultra combo that launches into a character-specific cutscene of carnage. It's nice that these spectacles are easy to pull off, especially compared to more complicated fighting games, and I'll never tire of launching a foe into near-earth orbit as Superman, then slamming them back down for massive damage. But their ease of use also means you'll see these cutscenes a lot.\n\nEach stage also includes interactive elements: massive rockets to throw, thrones you can bounce an enemy off of. Aquaman's Atlantis level, for example, lets you shatter its sides to drown your foe in a massive tidal wave. Many levels have secondary areas as well. With a well-timed kick, I sent Hawkgirl tumbling forcefully through the outer walls of Wayne Manor, right through to the mansion's dining room. The interactivity enhances the over-the-top comic violence on display, as does the sound of each brutal hit connecting. I feel like a superhero while playing, leaving wanton destruction in my wake.\n\nOutside of Battle mode, which offers a wide variety of ladder-style challenges, Injustice's big time sink is S.T.A.R. Labs, where you try to complete more than 240 character-specific challenges that serve to teach you the game's more complex techniques. Points earned here and in other modes let you unlock concept art, music, and more in the Hall of Justice Archives. Notably, new character skins are already unlocked in Ultimate Edition, as are the console version's six DLC characters.\n\nInjustice's longevity is tied to its multiplayer, which unfortunately is an issue. Local battles work without a hitch, but are limited to one-on-one fights. Online is a different story: finding someone to play against often doesn't work (whether due to matchmaking issues or lack of a player base is unclear), and when it does, the incredible levels of input lag make the fight frustrating. King Of The Hill and Survival modes sound great, but unless the lag issues are resolved soon, they're wasted.\n\nIf NetherRealm can get its online issues sorted, Injustice could be a top-notch fighting game.There's a tremendous amount of content here, including a ton of easter eggs for fans in both Story mode and unlockable content. It'd be a shame if no one plays it.\n\nAll in all, a great fighting game with extremely well-known characters using a familar fighting engine. Mortal Kombat vets should feel right at home with Injustice.\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 27, 2014","true","79.8"," 22 of 41 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","22","41","2","0"

The greatness of Mortal Kombat incorportated in the DC Universe. The ability to play as such a wide variety of your favorite villains and heroes makes this game so great. As far as the story goes I would definately say that it is quite entertaining. With impressive cutscenes inbetween fights to help mix things up a bit, the story mode is something that could be played a couple times and still be able to enjoy it. Keep in mind of course that this is still a fight game, and like all fight games, you will lose interest after a while. But I can honestly say though I'm not as devoted to the game as I used to be. I still play it probably once a week just because it really is that fun. The multiplayer in it is also a great feature in which you can enjoy playing on the same computer with a friend (a controller or extra keyboard is recommended) or online. This game will always be a challenge and something in which you can definately get your money's woth out of.","November 21, 2014","true","77.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

All the important heroes and villains appear, including Lex Luthor, Aquaman, Joker, Harlequin, Cyborg, Deathstroke, etc. This is one of the best part in the game, the player is got caught in the story and don't want to finish it.\n\n2-FUN: Injustcie was made by Netherrealm Studios, famous for create the Mortal Kombat 9 in 2011 and Mortal Kombat X (is got to be launch in fall 2015) the gameplay is very easy to learn and the movements is the key to victory, some characters has special abilities, like Nightwing, he can transform his bat in two weapons and aquaman, who can use his fork to attack and even grab the opponent. The scenarios was based in DC Universe famous locations, such as the batcave, metropolis, atlantis, the JLA Tower and etc.\n\n3-GRAPHICS: this is the less important point, but I need to talk about, the graphics are not the best in the game world, textures and shadows apparently were not finished, but this not interfere in the gameplay or in the history.\n\nFINAL CONSIDERATIONS:\nINJUSTICE is a great game and I recommend it, if you want a game to play alone, multiplayer and with your friends, Injustice is a good alternative between the rivalry Street Fighter x Mortal Kombat\n\n\n\n","September 25, 2014","true","3.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The greatness of Mortal Kombat incorportated in the DC Universe. The ability to play as such a wide variety of your favorite villains and heroes makes this game so great. As far as the story goes I would definately say that it is quite entertaining. With impressive cutscenes inbetween fights to help mix things up a bit, the story mode is something that could be played a couple times and still be able to enjoy it. Keep in mind of course that this is still a fight game, and like all fight games, you will lose interest after a while. But I can honestly say though I'm not as devoted to the game as I used to be. I still play it probably once a week just because it really is that fun. The multiplayer in it is also a great feature in which you can enjoy playing on the same computer with a friend (a controller or extra keyboard is recommended) or online. This game will always be a challenge and something in which you can definately get your money's woth out of.","November 21, 2014","true","77.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

With only a few hours on the game I have come to a reasonable and thoughtful conclusion;\nInjustice; Ultimate Edition runs smoothly, smoother than the original one - giving a better run game. The twist on SuperMan is intense, bringing a darker atmosphere into the DC Universe; rather than the typical mind-controlling larky that SuperMan has usually... Ultimate Edition brings in an additional six playable characters which ultimately fulfils ever DC fans fantasy. I love the unique power-mechanism that each character has, making each character diverse and fun to play - rather than keeping them all rather similar.

With only a few hours on the game I have come to a reasonable and thoughtful conclusion;\nInjustice; Ultimate Edition runs smoothly, smoother than the original one - giving a better run game. The twist on SuperMan is intense, bringing a darker atmosphere into the DC Universe; rather than the typical mind-controlling larky that SuperMan has usually... Ultimate Edition brings in an additional six playable characters which ultimately fulfils ever DC fans fantasy. I love the unique power-mechanism that each character has, making each character diverse and fun to play - rather than keeping them all rather similar.

However; when I heard the praise Nether Relm were getting for Mortal Kombat, it piqued my interest in their DC fighting game Injustice: Gods Among Us. What grabbed my attention even more was the fact that it had a decent story mode! Well I can say I'm enjoying it immensely, and has definitely opened up my potential appreciation of the genre. The combat is fast, fluid and intuitive, with a wide range of well animated and flashy moves that are both unique and reflective of the characters. The roster, on that note, is top notch - little dissappointed in the absence of some of my personal favourites like Poison Ivy, Scarecrow, Starfire and Beastboy - but the characters that are available are varied and interesting to say the least. The inclusion of all the DLC characters is very nice indeed.\nAs for the PC port, I've played both on xbox 360 and PC, and it definitely looks and runs better on PC (as expected!) The overall quality is vastly improved, as well as silky smooth performance giving constant 60 fps. There are a decent amount of options, though more would be appreciated. Full controller support is available, which is nice as I prefer to use one in this case - However; I will note that the keyboard menu controls are rather wonky, a somewhat bizzarre choice of keys for certain actions, and unfortunately no mouse controlled menus :(\nOverall I urge you to give it a try, or at least look in to it more. If you're a fan of DC you'll enjoy it hands down - And if you're a bit skeptical of fighting games well fear not, there is a wealth of content to keep you occupied!

The DC/marvel universe surely opened up to many of the players, with the sentiment;"I never knew that hero existed".\n\nApart from the similarity with Mortal Kombat Komplete Edition, this should be a genre, like rail-shooters are a seperate genre of their own. The storyline is set and it's plot is fixed. I found it favourable to play this with your xbox controller.\n\nI am playing the android version of this game and was delighted to find how faithful the 2 are to each other. It can be found on Google Play for free, but be certain your phone is compatible to play it (many are not compatible).\n\nI also found this game an amicable companion to the Batman games we have on Steam, & my willingness to explore this world not only through the main game but the other modes which offer content too. Stirred my imagination.\n\n"READ A COMIC". I grew up reading these comics, I find it interesting how the canon of the comics is laid out in media, like, say;"Lord of the rings". How it is translated truly or not into media-format. So what is said or unsaid in the game compared to what (we) I already know :-) How many among us have read a multitude of comics on "Raven", or "Hawkgirl", not many I am convinced. I may have come across them hardly remembering.\n\nI have completed the main story. It made me want madly a FULL game of only Flash, only Green Lantern I would even be accepting toward a full game of only Wonder Woman. Like what we have in Arkham Origins; can you imagine it? Or even to the extent of Middle Earth:Shadow of Mordor :-) Put us on Krypton! A full Superman game, growing up in Metropolis, like our Amazing Spider Man games! If dev's read this and were positive on this idea that's the best thing.\n\nNote: under correction from a gamer friend; there is a difference with DC & Marvel, though, I am convinced we have all encountered the crossovers.   Here is a recent crossover example.[whatculture.com] When fantastic 4 arrives on PC, chances are many more crossovers will be born.\n\nAwesome.\n\nGame on","January 13, 2015","true","8.5"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","9","16","2","5"

The storyline has had enough of an effect that they decided to write-up the five year backstory in comics. The inciting incident of which is the Joker coming to Metropolis to play on "easy mode", kidnapping Lois, wiring a dead-man's switch to her heart, luring Superman to save her, dosing him with Scarecrow gas (with a little kryptonite kicker), which makes Supes think Lois is Doomsday, so he takes her into orbit, only then realizing his mistake as she (and their unborn child) dies. Oh, and then the dead-man's switch triggers and a nuke wipes out Metropolis. Superman then... kills the Joker (though after a few taunts). (Joker: "You think he'll ever be the same?" Batman: "Of course, he'll never cross the line." Joker: "No, I think it's going to be far funnier.")\n\nYou play as an assortment of regular DC heroes (and one villain) who get sucked into this alternate universe by its Batman to activate his contingency plan to deal with Supes. Do note: One hero and the one villain were not intended to take the journey (considering the villain is "real world" Joker, that is certainly the case). (The hero being "real" Bats.) Later, through certain attempts to retrieve the "taken" individuals Cyborg shows up. The story deals with you taking down Supes and his Regime. Without spoiling it, they need a little extra "real world" help in the end.\n\nThere is an online function, which I have yet to attempt. As well, there is the Battle format, which includes the tournament of Mortal Kombat fame (Classic, I believe), and some STAR Labs missions, which can be tricky.\n\nThe Ultimate Edition adds in the six DLC characters and a lot of skins for some of the heroes. The six DLC characters are Lobo, Batgirl, Martian Manhunter, Zatanna, Zod, and... Scorpion. Have fun with that. At this point my favorite characters to use are Scorpion, Bane, Grundy, Joker, and... Harley (who is just insane fun).","December 24, 2014","true","36.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's possible to experience issues like the screen going completely black and game joins endlessly looping that require an end task to stop. It also suffers from slightly unpredictable netcode that can sometimes drop a game out of nowhere -- but it's not nearly as bad as MK9.\n\nThe PC port is graphically stunning. Seeing this game on Xbox 360 and then on PC nearly made my head explode. Those who want to show off what their Gaben shrines can really do should look no further than this game as proof of their labors.\n\nOverall, the port is solid.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dravvad/recommended/242700/","Dravvad","Dravvad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dravvad/","218 products in account","Another game where I wish Steam had an "OK" option and not just Yes/No. Firstly, if you are a hardcore fighting game player, then you will probably like this game (and in all actuality, will have probably played it already). But putting that aside, I think that this game overall isn't anything special, despite the love it got at first release.\n\nHave I enjoyed the game? Yes and no. I'm not exactly a person who plays fighting games that often. There are a handful of them that I've gotten hooked into over the years, and I have played such games for a long time, back to the original Mortal Kombat on Sega Genesis. But I'm not exactly an expert with them.\n\nThe story of Injustice was very interesting, I'll give it that. It was an unexpected turn of events. Sadly, it sort of wore down about halfway through because nothing really "new" occurred after that point. Then it felt like you were generically just fighting random people again, without more story development. Now, fighting games have and haven't exactly been the most into the story, and I will still give the game that it pulled me in with its beginnings.\n\nIn terms of the fighting mechanics, the game is decent. I've played as all of the characters in the game, but only a few really struck me as ones I enjoy playing as often, such as Batman, Flash, Joker, Solomon Grundy, Aquaman, and a couple others (including Scorpion for making a cameo). Surprisingly, Aquaman is really overpowered so I feel like they beefed him up as a revenge against all of the jokes he has had made against him throughout the years for being helpless without water nearby.\n\nBut as I said above, despite the hefty list of playable characters, less than half of them are characters I want to play as. Though that is somewhat understandable, as nothing can suit every person. Most of the characters have relatively decent skill lists, though some are easily more outstanding than the others (e.g., Aquaman as I just mentioned), but for the most part, you should be able to fight pretty well after getting used to their abilities. Learning each character's moves isn't really that tough, thankfully.\n\nBut the problems come with the game's difficulty (for me) and the online multiplayer, which is ruined for just about everyone. As a whole, I was able to make my way through the story, but a handful of fights along the way randomly spiked in difficulty for me, and I got killed several times. For the most part, I didn't hate it that much. But when you go into Battle Mode and are able to select difficulty, the same problem exists. Medium difficulty is somewhat fine, depending on the characters that you fight against, while Hard difficulty and above just floor you.\n\nAs I said, I'm not an expert with fighting games, but what I'm getting at is that the AI overall isn't that great. Playing on Easy or below, the AI is just worthless for the most part, and no challenge is presented. Playing on Medium, the AI can be okay but then randomly spike and suddenly swarm you with attacks that you can't block and you may lose half of your health bar. On Hard, I pretty much can't play at all.\n\nThe thing is, with AI in fighting games, especially as the years have gone by, is that more "difficulty" doesn't actually mean better AI. It seems to mean abusive AI. What I mean is... say you're playing Battleships against a computer. You have to tell the computer (indirectly) where you placed your ships. So the AI knows where your ships are and can theoretically blast you immediately because it possesses the information.\n\nThe same applies here. It seems like more "difficulty" in the fighting games now just means the AI quickly learns your input and will immediately respond by blocking with the appropriate action or grabbing you to stop your attack. So many times on Hard (and don't get me started on Very Hard) did I get wiped out without barely doing damage to the opponent. It's just not fun.\n\nThen the online play... I can't really say much here other than that it is ruined. It is really hard to find matches, at least for me, and 99% of the time the connection is terrible and I lose because I'm lagging like hell but the opponent isn't, even though I can play pretty much any other game online just fine. Then it's even worse to search for a match and have it drop immediately, so you're stuck repeating a search multiple times.\n\nPeople have mostly ditched the online community because of its issues, and the game was never fixed here. Thus, you're mostly stuck with the single-player unless you can get online at the right times or you have a group of people whom you can play with regularly.\n\nThus, the game overall is actually average for me. It isn't anything special, mostly because only a fraction of the characters actualy seem that good, because the AI becomes ridiculous if you try to add more challenge, and the online playing is basically impossible to do half of the time.","March 6, 2015","true","21.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Honestly, it's one of those that is good enough, but you definitely wouldn't want to pay full price for it. The fighting is good, the selection of characters is pretty good (although there are some glaring omissions that would have been preferable to some of the inclusions), and the game itself has more than enough modes and unlockables to keep you amused for a good long while.\n\nUnfortunately, the worst part of it is the story, which most will probably play. It's a filmsy, poorly-written affair that engages too much in going too far, and then gives us nothing satisfying out of it. There are some interesting moments and even exciting moments, but overall it is not only misogynistic, but also clearly written by someone who was completely unaware of the characters or their capabilities. It fails the characters in pretty much every way, and while there are moments that seem thrilling, it's overall a train wreck that employs fridge logic too often.\n\nThe story ends up coming off as highly contrived and is just more or less entirely worthless, which is a shame since it's well-animated and the voice acting is excellent. The very premise, though, is extremely questionable, and overall you get a far more interesting experience simply by playing through Battles, the 'arcade mode' of this game. If only the main story had better pacing, even a slight grasp of the characters, and a sense of when things go too far, it would have been vastly improved. It also really could have used a significant amount of work on making the premise more believable and consistent with itself.\n\nThe moves are interesting, but not every character is as accessible as one may expect. Some of the special moves, additionally, are kind of ridiculous and some are too graphic and over-the-top, which really takes out of the immersion of fighting. The stages are great, and the gimmicks and interactions are really fun, but there are also some details that also interfere with immersion, such as fighting Doomsday on the stage where, in the background...Doomsday's standing around.\n\nThere are at least plenty of modes, though, to keep anyone amused for some time. There's a very thorough training mode, and the game itself is extremely accessible to players of all skill levels. Want to just have fun beating up bad guys? You can do that. Want to be challenged? You can do that too. You'll probably have all kinds of fun in the single match and arcade modes, and there are also challenge missions that will bring further entertainment. The best part of these is that you can usually choose the characters you like, and at the very least it's more believable than the story mode's narrative. Unfortunately, none of the DLC characters have any STAR Labs challenge missions, nor do they have alternate costumes, which seem like significant oversights. It would have been much more fun if they had.\n\nAll in all, it's a good game if you ignore its faults and shortcomings. If you're familiar with the characters, you'll be more than a bit annoyed at times by the writing being clearly wrong for them, but if you are looking for a good superhero fighter, you should have some solid fun with this.","December 29, 2013","true","8.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The characters feel real and sympathetic, and I like the voice acting, it's just too bad that it seems wasted in a lame excuse to get everybody to fight each other.\nI doubt anybody buys this for the story though.\nMy only suggestion is that you look up bug fixes, because there are plenty of those. 10 minutes online will help you fix them, but they're annoying and frequent.\nThat being said, I'm enjoying myself when the bugs aren't around.","June 27, 2014","true","18.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I admit, I've never been a fan of Mortal Kombat and this game's lineage sort of turned me off of it. Boy, do I wish I got into it sooner. It's very different from what I expected (there is almost no gore and the story makes sense) and I plan on picking it up for Wii U really soon. I've played through the story mode once but would like to again as well as get some buddies together and smash each other. This is the sort of game that doesn't require someone to memorize a ton of combos and special moves. They exist but the game is a bit easier to handle right off the bat. The real shining point is the story mode which is engaging if you like DC and is very unique for a fighting game. I love how cinematics blend seamlessly into fights. Even mini games are occassionally stuck in but unlike bashing sedans on a pier, these games make sense in the story.

It's a fighting game, but with superheroes. Has a solid story mode, and multiplayer is pretty sweet. The moves are a bit deceptive because it feels a little Street Fightery (hold back to block), but a bit Mortal Kombaty (both triggers to use your super), yet the attacks feel a little unique to this game.\n\nThere isn't really any "rounds", but you do have a double-life bar which breaks into two "sections" and the loser still has to take down the winner's remaining life from his first "section". This works pretty well, except the timer for multiplayer games is on 99 seconds to kill off both "sections" from your opponent - which is usually only enough for a single round, and doesn't reset in this game. This is the game's low point, so you have to win fairly quickly.\n\nIn multiplayer, you can press start just before the round begins and during supers (or anytime, at your own risk - the game continues) to get a "quick reference" on your special moves, which is a very, very welcome addition for choosing characters you've never played before. Getting a quick glance at "down-forward-X" "back-forward A" is a huge help, even if you don't know what that move does.\n\nThere's a good tutorial that'll get you rolling pretty quickly, and the newer players that pick up this game seem to have a knack for killing the experienced players in the first game.","September 21, 2014","true","18.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

His moveset is actually one of the best in the game. So if you really want to settle which superhero would win in a fight against each other, this game won't do that for you. On the otherhand, don't expect balanced gameplay either. The special character Scorpion is OP for instance, and so is Aquaman. The reason I love this game is because its fun and the story mode was a blast to play through. If you've ever been exposed to comic books, then you know that an alternate universe where Superman is the bad guy is nothing new, but somehow this game makes it feel fresh even though it isn't. I used a controller when playing the game, and I will say that the pre-set controls for an xbox controller are excellent. Unfortunately, this means that I can't comment on how gameplay works with the keyboard. I'd recommend this game if you like superheroes and DC comics. Bottom line: The story mode was pretty fun to play through, and the gameplay was fun, but beware of balancing issues when playing multiplayer.","June 20, 2015","true","12.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The story mode was well written and fun to progress through the different fighters. It's fairly easy to unlock all the battles just by completing the story mode, so that was a bonus to the progression from story to fighting game. Each battle type has certain restrictions placed upon them in order to successfully complete them.\n\nThe S.T.A.R.S. missions are another good way to waste some time in the game. They also help with mastering certain fighters and their moves. A good challenge, as they eventually introduce some outside characters (such as Lobo and Scorpion) to add to the roster.\n\nI havent done any online fighting, so no comment will be made on that apart from the daily challenge seems like a great idea to throw some diversity into the mix.\n\nOverall, with me being a mediocre player of fighting games, Injustice: Gods Among Us was incredibly accessible and fun to play.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dravvad/recommended/242700/","Dravvad","Dravvad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dravvad/","218 products in account","Another game where I wish Steam had an "OK" option and not just Yes/No. Firstly, if you are a hardcore fighting game player, then you will probably like this game (and in all actuality, will have probably played it already). But putting that aside, I think that this game overall isn't anything special, despite the love it got at first release.\n\nHave I enjoyed the game? Yes and no. I'm not exactly a person who plays fighting games that often. There are a handful of them that I've gotten hooked into over the years, and I have played such games for a long time, back to the original Mortal Kombat on Sega Genesis. But I'm not exactly an expert with them.\n\nThe story of Injustice was very interesting, I'll give it that. It was an unexpected turn of events. Sadly, it sort of wore down about halfway through because nothing really "new" occurred after that point. Then it felt like you were generically just fighting random people again, without more story development. Now, fighting games have and haven't exactly been the most into the story, and I will still give the game that it pulled me in with its beginnings.\n\nIn terms of the fighting mechanics, the game is decent. I've played as all of the characters in the game, but only a few really struck me as ones I enjoy playing as often, such as Batman, Flash, Joker, Solomon Grundy, Aquaman, and a couple others (including Scorpion for making a cameo). Surprisingly, Aquaman is really overpowered so I feel like they beefed him up as a revenge against all of the jokes he has had made against him throughout the years for being helpless without water nearby.\n\nBut as I said above, despite the hefty list of playable characters, less than half of them are characters I want to play as. Though that is somewhat understandable, as nothing can suit every person. Most of the characters have relatively decent skill lists, though some are easily more outstanding than the others (e.g., Aquaman as I just mentioned), but for the most part, you should be able to fight pretty well after getting used to their abilities. Learning each character's moves isn't really that tough, thankfully.\n\nBut the problems come with the game's difficulty (for me) and the online multiplayer, which is ruined for just about everyone. As a whole, I was able to make my way through the story, but a handful of fights along the way randomly spiked in difficulty for me, and I got killed several times. For the most part, I didn't hate it that much. But when you go into Battle Mode and are able to select difficulty, the same problem exists. Medium difficulty is somewhat fine, depending on the characters that you fight against, while Hard difficulty and above just floor you.\n\nAs I said, I'm not an expert with fighting games, but what I'm getting at is that the AI overall isn't that great. Playing on Easy or below, the AI is just worthless for the most part, and no challenge is presented. Playing on Medium, the AI can be okay but then randomly spike and suddenly swarm you with attacks that you can't block and you may lose half of your health bar. On Hard, I pretty much can't play at all.\n\nThe thing is, with AI in fighting games, especially as the years have gone by, is that more "difficulty" doesn't actually mean better AI. It seems to mean abusive AI. What I mean is... say you're playing Battleships against a computer. You have to tell the computer (indirectly) where you placed your ships. So the AI knows where your ships are and can theoretically blast you immediately because it possesses the information.\n\nThe same applies here. It seems like more "difficulty" in the fighting games now just means the AI quickly learns your input and will immediately respond by blocking with the appropriate action or grabbing you to stop your attack. So many times on Hard (and don't get me started on Very Hard) did I get wiped out without barely doing damage to the opponent. It's just not fun.\n\nThen the online play... I can't really say much here other than that it is ruined. It is really hard to find matches, at least for me, and 99% of the time the connection is terrible and I lose because I'm lagging like hell but the opponent isn't, even though I can play pretty much any other game online just fine. Then it's even worse to search for a match and have it drop immediately, so you're stuck repeating a search multiple times.\n\nPeople have mostly ditched the online community because of its issues, and the game was never fixed here. Thus, you're mostly stuck with the single-player unless you can get online at the right times or you have a group of people whom you can play with regularly.\n\nThus, the game overall is actually average for me. It isn't anything special, mostly because only a fraction of the characters actualy seem that good, because the AI becomes ridiculous if you try to add more challenge, and the online playing is basically impossible to do half of the time.","March 6, 2015","true","21.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

His moveset is actually one of the best in the game. So if you really want to settle which superhero would win in a fight against each other, this game won't do that for you. On the otherhand, don't expect balanced gameplay either. The special character Scorpion is OP for instance, and so is Aquaman. The reason I love this game is because its fun and the story mode was a blast to play through. If you've ever been exposed to comic books, then you know that an alternate universe where Superman is the bad guy is nothing new, but somehow this game makes it feel fresh even though it isn't. I used a controller when playing the game, and I will say that the pre-set controls for an xbox controller are excellent. Unfortunately, this means that I can't comment on how gameplay works with the keyboard. I'd recommend this game if you like superheroes and DC comics. Bottom line: The story mode was pretty fun to play through, and the gameplay was fun, but beware of balancing issues when playing multiplayer.","June 20, 2015","true","12.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I never could learn all those moves.\n\nThat said, I just finished the single-player campaign, and I highly recommend the game.\n\nThe Good:\nGreat story.  Loved every minute of the story.  Sure, the story is on the simple side, but there was a lot of feeling to it.  I'm not a HUGE comic book reader.  I read my last Justice League comic over 20 years ago, so there were a lot of characters I didn't know, but I was familiar enough with the classic characters to get along pretty well.\n\nThe fighting was fun.  I'm no good at it.  I button mash a lot, but overall, the gameplay was fun.\n\nSometimes it seemed to me that the game was PROGRAMMED to beat me the first round, and then get steadily easier each time I lost.  It was a little suspicious, but now that I think about it, it rewarded my lack of skill by giving me a chance to keep playing.  That's actually quite nice, because I could continue the story, even being not good at the game.\n\nI had a few times where I said "WTF was THAT!!!" when a character pulled a particular move, or did something spectacular that destroyed my character.  The big one was when Doomsday did something outrageous like THIRTY hits on Superman by throwing him through a wall.\n\nStill, fun game, and I highly recommend it for people who aren't so good at fighting games.  Now that the main campaign is finished, I'm slowly working through the single-player battles, and it's quite fun.","July 11, 2014","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story felt like a Justice League movie and it was a very good attempt to spice up the content in the midst of battles, Well, it does have the flashpoint paradox vibes during my playthrough. The combat felt good and I will highly recommend players who are new to fighting games to try out easy or at most medium settings to get the feel of the game. Do get a responsive gamepad when you play this as enemies will pounce on you within seconds to break your moves.\n\nHowever, the story is really short, you shoud clear this on the same day you purchased it. I completed the story mode in less than 5 hours at a casual pace and felt that the story could have been alot longer, maybe even doubled. In addition, during character selection before a match, there are no way to see previews of your alternate skins of your heroes which will probably be a little better if they have added that function.\n\nAll in all, Injustice is a very good gme and it is currently on sold at a discounted price. I bought it for half of what it is now but it is still worth the money to play for DC fans and even neutrals.","June 19, 2015","true","8.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While I love DC, I don't tend to play fighting games so much these days. I also didn't anticipate that I was going to play it with friends or even against others on the internet. So the appeal was potentially limited.\n\nI wasn't convinced playing the tutorial - to be honest I was a little intimidated. While there are a lot of combat options to choose from, some of them were quite fiddly and would no doubt take a while to master. This is great if you want to play against others, but I only wanted to play the story. I wondered how far button mashing was going to take me.\n\nI started playing through the story mode thinking that I would play a fight or two, and then stop, but I didn't.\n\nWhy?\n\nSimply put, the story in I:GAU is fantastic. I don't think I have played a fighting game with such a solid story. Nor have I  played a game where the cuts scenes are so well integrated with the game. The writing is excellent. The voice talent - some of whom you will know from other DC games (or cartoons) is spot on. The same goes for the character's physical and facial expression. Whle the story isn't long, it's very satisfying.\n\nin terms of gameplay, while button mashing got me a long way (I played on normal difficulty) it was very easy to pause and flick to a quick list of moves that I could try in combat. Fighting was fun! I enjoyed the variety of powers on offer, and I was pleased that the power discrepancy between characters is acknowledged and (kind of) addressed.\n\nSo. If you love DC, but are not sure about fighting games, give it a shot. If you love DC and love fighting games, it's a no brainer.","June 10, 2014","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics were slick, the levels well detailed and even interactive, and the fighter roster was brimming with most of my favorites. Add in a pretty competent fighting system and tons of unlockables for the characters and you got one of the better DC based games, forget the fact that it's a fighting game. The story came together incredibly well and felt like a complete 10-20 issue story arc. The best part was that it was structured in a way that you swapped out fighters to progress and this swapping played into the cohesiveness of the story, which is something seldom done well in a fighter. My only quibble is the terrific buildup of tension and amazing moments punctuated by a rather anti-climatic or boring conclusion.

It's very pleasant to watch and a vital part of gameplay. Beside that, Injustice is a pretty solid fighting game: each hero or villain has a wide moveset that defines his play style, unique lines, intros, outros and special, cinematic, devastating moves. The developers have used the DC license very well: the characters design is mostly faithful and fitting, the story makes full use of the heroes and villains various backstories and attitudes and they interact differently between themselves in battle. While the main plot of the game is nothing new in the DC universe, it mantains itself entertaining and interesting. It even throws some mini-games in from time to time to keep things interesting.\nThe title's controls are the only thing worth criticizing. The controller's movement patterns make pulling off certain moves far harder than it needs to be, and the keyboard mapping is just plain awful to play with.\nInjustice spots both single and multiplayers modes. The former is about a story mode, a series of battle modes with unique challenges and a free battles mode; the latter is about competing with other players online or with a friend. The most peculiar mode in Injustice are the S.T.A.R. labs missions: a series of battles with special conditions making use of the different characters. There is also an unlock system to gain new skins for the fighters, concept art, music and more.\nThe Ultimate Edition only introduces the five DLC characters (Zatanna, General Zod, Batgirl, Lobo and Martian Manhunter) and unlocks all the costume packs released this far. Aside from that, there isn't any new feature to be found.\nAll things considered, Injustice: Gods Among Us is a very interesting game for a DC fan and a good fighting game to boot","May 13, 2014","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics were slick, the levels well detailed and even interactive, and the fighter roster was brimming with most of my favorites. Add in a pretty competent fighting system and tons of unlockables for the characters and you got one of the better DC based games, forget the fact that it's a fighting game. The story came together incredibly well and felt like a complete 10-20 issue story arc. The best part was that it was structured in a way that you swapped out fighters to progress and this swapping played into the cohesiveness of the story, which is something seldom done well in a fighter. My only quibble is the terrific buildup of tension and amazing moments punctuated by a rather anti-climatic or boring conclusion. In this case the journey is far greater than the destination.","June 25, 2014","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's really good. Injustice is without doubt one of the best fighting games I have ever played, next to Mortal Kombat and Soul Calibour. What Injustice does well... is mostly everything. It has very good graphics, tight controls, many playable characters from whom every single is different, several arenas, most of which have two stages each, and I could not even tell if it was a console port. Most heroes have several different outfits, which is good in most cases, but looking at Teen Titans costumes for Raven and Cyborg I didn't find them similiar in any degree to their cartoon counterparts. And I kind of missed a Starfire character. On the other hand there is a version of Batman that wears a Russian ushanka, and there is Superman skin with a hammer'n'sickle emblem on his chest, and that is just plain awesome. Every character also has their own exclusive super move, or whatever it is called, which is a counterpart of the X-ray moves from Mortal Kombat. So in addition to pummeling the crap out of his foes, Batman can run someone over with the Batmobile, and Joker can blast someone with a bazooka, which I have no idea where he keeps.There are several game modes for singleplayer, which will keep you playing for a long time. There is story mode, classic battle and lots of its variations, and S.T.A.R. labs, which consists of lots and lots of minigames and small quests. Overall, this game has some minor flaws, like the completly redundant clash mechanic, or rare issues with attacks ghost range, but it is still solid and fun fighting game. But there is one thing that keeps it from ranking higher, at least in PC version, and it is the multiplayer mode. It sucks. It sucks so bad...I didn't even have a chance to play it. Seriously. You can wait for an hour and not find a single (!) match. And it is not even the game's fault. It is just that nobody plays it, which makes me sad. So, for the love of all gods, buy this game and play it, because for now, from my experience, about 20 people own it.\n\nInjustice: Gods Among Us gets my eight points out of ten.","May 30","true","20.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It always creates 60 frames, even if it can't display them all, so if you get, say, 40fps instead of the 60 it's doing, your game runs at 2/3rds speed. The game wants me to play on what's basically a Gamecube resolution to fix this problem. Not cool. Not cool at all.\n\nEDIT: So, a LOT of my problems were because the game was trying to use my motherboard's graphics chip instead of my video card. Once I fixed that, I turned down the AA and shadows settings and it looks and runs great, but I still say you need to be wary of technical problems on this one. Any sort of slowdown makes it very hard to play.\n\nThe actual gameplay is great- very similiar to MK9, with simple to perform specials and a servicable combo system that I do wish was something more traditional. The biggest improvement is the Character Powers, which open up a lot of possibilities and really inform the character's playstyle by adding effects to attacks, acting as parries, etc. And once again, NRS made a great story mode. Really, the only issue I have are the technical aspects.","December 31, 2013","true","8.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aekabeer/recommended/242700/","aekabeer","Yub Yub","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aekabeer/","588 products in account","Despite it's flaws, Injustuce is a rock solid fighter, in single and multiplayer modes. I've played through the story mode and played a good amount vs on the XBOX so here's the difference to the pc version. In a nutshell, not a whole lot and that's not a bad thing. The controls are identicle, which is to say they're responsive and the moves are natural to execute for anyone that's played any Street Fighter/Mortal Kombat style fighter. The game play is fluid and effects such as AF and AA make a difference to the graphics but it's not enough to write home about.\n\nThis version includes the DLC characters like Zod and Zatanna and has kept all the original characters in the same state as when the game first launched. This is unfortunately the case for the broken (almost unstoppable) characters (see Deathstroke, Doomsday and Superman) are still broken and in dire need of a mild nerf or in the case of Deathstroke a complete overhaul, the stuff he pulls off even has a visual effect that suggests he's glitched.\n\nThe local multiplayer works well, but online is affected by heavy latency issues attributed to the lack of a local server in Australia.\n\nThis is one of the few fighting games that does the story so right that even the enjoyable fight sequences are pushed to the background, almost becomming a chore... almost. I wonder if the game might have pulled it off better if they didn't use the standard 2 round fight system and had the 1 round with longer health bars. That extra few seconds between the rounds just takes something away from the atmosphere. The one element to the story that irked me was Wonder Woman's depiction, despite her strength and nobility she was relegated to 'love interest' always needing to be saved/helped... Also what the hell were they thinking with Harley Quinn's street walker outfit? I like skin as much as the next guy, but damn that was over the top!\n\nAnyway...\n\nIf you like superheroes this game is a must! If you like fighting games, it's still damned good, Injustice plays more like Mortal Kombat (naturally since it's the same studio as the prior release) than Street Fighter or King of Fighters, but it's not bound by the same rules and feel. There seems to be a large competetive scene but be warned again. if you're not in a region with a server you're not going to have the best experience.\n\nMy experience with with 'modern' superheroes was mostly limited to the 90's cartoons, in particular the 90's Batman, Spiderman and X-men cartoons and their successors, before that it was the usuall Transformers, Ninja Turtles, M.A.S.K, etc. Back then it was all about Marvel cartoons, with the exception of the afformentioned Batman, DC just felt tired and tried too hard. Fast forward to the present or a few years ago to my late 20's and I've found a whole new respect for the DC line of characters and stories. Thanks mostly to the more recent animated movies and catoon series' like The Justice League. WB seems to know how to put out good feature length animated movies over their big budget attempts, and the story arc's are more in line with what the fans know to be true to the comics. Whatever the case, Injustice: Gods Among Us does real justice to the DC universe.","January 31, 2014","true","3.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Don't get me wrong the game is great, but the online is god awful. No matter how low your opponets ping is there will be lag in the character selection screen. The delay makes the fighting turn into "Who can remember that one combo first" since it is hard to block or fight because of the delays.\n\nThe Controls are very different from most fighting games. Instead of having buttons for punches or kicks you get 3 main buttons for light, medium, and hard moves. There are things called wagers in the game that are quite annoying, when a player has a bar of health lost he can trigger a wager, each opponet selects the ammount of meter they want to wager and whoever wagers the most gets a health boost. You are also given a special move when your meter is full. Stuff like General Zod punching the opponet through the moon, or Lex Luther pointing a death ray at you. But this gets so annoying since it takes so long and it's the same animation every time.The game doesn't even try to use different opening or winning animations at the beggining or end of the fight. They're the same animation every time., they even use the same exact voice clips every time. So when playing this game for long periods at a time it can drive you mad.\n\n\nI'd recommend this game, just not for PC. Get the game on a Console if you want good online play, the online community died faster than the Dreamcast on the PC. The Devs may have said that they will fix online, but they have not shown progress.","January 5, 2014","false","4.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

In fact, the single player story line is actually pretty interesting if that's all you care about. Sadly, that's about the only thing that was good about this game.\n\nThe controls were terrible both with the keyboard & using controller support (Xbox 360). Sensitivity & response with the analog sticks on the controller were terrible. For example, your intention was to push the stick away to the left/right of your opponent, resulting in a block, but your character ends up jumping & gets pounded in mid-air. The D-pad was slightly better, but still terrible. Now for the keyboard. Some very effective melee combos are literally close to impossible to perform, as the game requires you to hit 4+ keys in a timely manner with your right hand, all while your left hand is pushing another 4 keys for movement. It feels like you're playing Twister with your fingers.\n\nPros:\n- Solid single player campaign.\n- Good graphics.\n- Assortment of characters & costumes to choose from = excellent.\n- Cool animations & combos when you can actually perform them.\n\nCons:\n- Little to no control over character movement with controller support.\n- Combo success rate almost nonexistent with keyboard.\n- Multiplayer matchmaking nonexistent at times.\n\nThis is not a terrible game. Unfortunately, I personally don't think this game is worth recommending to others because of its poor character control/movement.","July 6, 2014","false","9.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There's no real need to know anything about the characters just so long as you know there names and my knowledge of DC is pretty thin, but that didn't stop me from enjoying this game as I was mostly interested because of Batman as he's the only DC character I know well.\n\nBut this game truly makes you like all the characters each character has a different unique fighting style and powers, which make each fight different I found myself liking other characters apart from Bats although he's my favourite character to play normally, I grew to like Green Arrow, The Flash, and surprisingly Aquaman. But the most interesting character in this game is Superman we get to see him at his worst and at his best, this game shows how evil Superman can be and it's quite scary because of the things he does he clearly shows that he's not afraid to kill anyone.\n\nThe way the game does this is that there are alternate universers so the evil Supes is the result of what happened when The Joker destroyed Metropolis and tricked Superman into thining he himself did it, and so drives him down a dark path meanwhile the Batman from their universe brings over the original Good heroes from the other dimension and they team up to try and bring evil Supes down. It's a pretty good story and the cutscenes are enjoyable to watch with great visuals and even better voice acting it's hands down the best Super Hero fighter i've played.\n\nI highly reccommend you get this game if you enjoy fighing games like Mortal Kombat which this game can be compared to but I prefer this over it, so whenever you get a chance grab it I guarantee you will have fun.","December 10, 2013","true","59.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Injustice is fun and visceral and plays pretty well on the PC, at least in terms of performance and responsiveness.\n\nThe story line is a hot mess as seems to be standard for comic books but it serves well enough as a framework for a number of entertaining fights. The ramping of difficutly seems very nicely tuned with the AI slowly ramping up the challenge as you hone your skills in the game. Outside the story line the game options are robust, far more here than a casual fight player such as myself can be a good judge of.\n\nI can't say enough good things about the animation and character models. Its a damned pretty game with a wide range very interesting characters. The transition scenes you can trigger to go from one stage to another are pure delight and easily the viusal highlight of the game.","January 27, 2014","true","11.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But I played further the game showed me that it is not just a clone of MK with DC characters. Actually, the game has similar patterns but branches out to something different. The story feels good and sits well with the Injustice story line of DC Comics. With the various battle modes available it gives for many hours of gaming. The combos and gameplay of most characters feel unique and interesting. However, this comes at a price to balance because some characters are simply better than others when it comes to fighting. Some other negatives are an occassonal frame dip caused by game coding. Online Multiplayer is not what it used to be when it comes to the amount of players so make sure to have some friends to play this with. But all that aside I went and rated this from Good to Very Good because it's DC ... because I am a big fan of comics. There is nothing like punching Superman with Batman ... or destroying Doomsday with Harley Quinn.

So much lag even with a good connection. This game has a steep learning curve unless you're used to Mortal Kombat style of fighting games (this is made by the same developer after all). Compared to Mortal Kombat, this blows it out of the water. Great game, though disappointingly some key DC characters are missing in favor of obscure characters that no one cares about. Still, it's the best fighting game that I've played in recent years, only getting beaten out by Marvel VS Capcom. This is the only fighting game on steam that I personally think is worth the money that they charge. I usually only play single player so it's ok for me, but if you want to play online, steer clear until they fix it, if they ever do. 8/10","November 26, 2013","true","23.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

And you're right, at it's core this is a magnificent game(A good roster,perfectly balanced)\n\nNow let's talk about the singleplayer:\nIn the singleplayer the members of the justice league get teleported to an alternate dimension where superman went rogue and runs a dictatorship, you progress through the story by doing 1v1's with all the characters and doing some minigames along the way. Aside from the story you get the classic modes that yoou can expect in a fighting game(training, arcade battles,local 1v1's)\n\nAnd now the multiplayer:\nDON'T BUY THIS GAME\nThis is a fighting game, so you are going to want to show of your skills with your favorite character, right ?\nHOWEVER NetherRealm doesn't give A ♥♥♥♥ about this PC-port (yes i have the 360 version) the game just doesn't work.\nYou can find people but you can't actually connect to their games. Now i managed to host a lobby with my friends but after a couple matches the game just glitches and everyone leaves the lobby.(And this didn't happen once)\n\nCONCLUSION:\nDon't buy this game. If the multiplayer worked then this would be a whole different game. But seeing how the modes what you are going to be playing most don't work this game isn't worth the money.

It was like watching a Justice League movie, something you need to experience for urself. The combat mechanics are pretty fluid, nearly perfect, equal to Mortal Combat style, thanks to Ed Boon, who's the co-creator of that dynasty; both of these titles come from the same studio. Backgrounds musics were also awesome. Probably the only minus I can give to this game will be its online part. There'll be no problem with versus mode on the same computer/console when you're playing with your friend. But matchmaking with other people around the world will hurt your time and patience, I can guarentee that. You can also read about other gamers talking about the empty lobbies.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fireflipper/recommended/242700/","fireflipper","fireflipper™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fireflipper/","74 products in account","This game is easily the best fighter game I have ever played. Like most, it has the combos, chain of moves, characters (each with different abilities) but it does all this plus more. It's not like mortal combat where you rip heads off and punch arms off, it is more calm than that, as it is DC, and is not killing, but KOing, like tekkan or street fighter.\n\nIt contains 'stage transitions' kicking or punching people through the side of a map, causing another DC hero/villain to beat them up, or punching/kicking them through a building of some sort to get to a new map, changing the scenery. This leads onto the objects in the background that can be used to your advantage. Such as swinging on chandelier to kick your opponent, or sending a robot to self-destruct under a player's feet. The players even have they're own strengths, such as superman and bane being able to rip off chandeliers from the ceiling and smashing them onto people, whilst others settle for swinging off the chandelier and kicking the opponent in the face. If your disappointed that your favourite DC character wasnt in this game, look closer. If your fav character isnt a playable character, they're most probably in the background, as a stage transition, or a 'usable object' or just a moving player in the background.\n\nThe story makes sense and is incredibly gripping. I was excited to play on throughout the entire story. Then you have the S.T.A.R lab missions and the battles to complete. I was amazed at how well they included objects, and how well they captured each arena. If you have ever played any batman games, it's good to see how similar they look in this game. e.g. Arkham Asylum. even Hugo Strange can be seen in Arkham Asylum arena observing your fight, unfortunatley you cant pick him up and slam him into the opponent, as much as we know everyone would love to.\n\nOverall, this game is amazing form me i'd give it a 9.6/10 - 96/100","January 10, 2014","true","12.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I've only done local games and ladder match/story mode*\n\nInjustice is actually a really fun fighting game. I really like what they've done with the mechanics: it's Mortal Kombat (9) minus the block button and fatalities, opting for the standard "Back is Block" option. It plays smooth on my rig and the control feels good on an Xbox 360 controller. The graphics are sharp. And the actual mechanics of the game feel solid. I'm a big fan of the roster, with my only complaint being that some of the characters are a little overpowered, but nothing that ruins the game. For the 15+ hours I've sunk in, I still haven't gone through everything the game has to offer. So if you're looking for a fighting game for the PC, pick this up.\n\nAgain, I can't comment on the online play. I enjoy actually playing fighting games with someone in the room, so chances are I never will. And as far as that goes, Injustice is great for that.\n\nAbridged review aside, it's nice to see that Warner Brothers Interactive isn't skipping over the PC for releasing Netherrealm franchises. And to boot, not jerking the PC crowd over with DLC, opting to leave it all in the game. I really hope this starts a trend of more developers making more fighting games for PC. Looking at you, Capcom, for releasing MvC3 Ultimate and not making half the roster DLC.","January 8, 2014","true","20.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It doesn't stand a chance with other fighting games such as Mortal Kombat or Tekken but it's really good to finally have an amazing and creative DC video game that isn't a Batman: Arkham game. It lacks a few features but it makes up for it by having really good voice acting, stunning graphics (especially on my laptop), an exciting roster, over the top combos and supermoves and original story that we will remember. However, I do recommend not buying this game if you already have an XBoxx 360 or PS3 edition. If you do have this for your console, then you'll only see the unlockables unlocked and some DLC. Trust me, you'll save money. As for PC gamers, this is awesome. Thanks a lot Netherrealm for making it easy for us PC gamers.\n\nHope you update with this stuff, or at least make a sequel:\n1. Mini-games like The Joker throwing cards at Nightwing or Green Lantern and Sinestro in a buildig battle should not only be in Story Mode\n2.

Comes with all DLC to date (and I'm pretty sure there isn't going to be anymore).\nIf you don't want to fight other people online, there is a full story mode to go through with a DC Comics quality story (which is to say, there is an alternate universe, so nothing really matters). There is also STAR Labs, which is similar to the challenge tower from Mortal Kombat (2011). However all the rewards that come from doing STAR Labs are automatically unlocked already in the Ultimate Edition, so there isn't a whole lot of point to play it, since it can become quite frustrating and doesn't really have much to do with the main fighting game.\n\nThe hype has died down for this game, but there are still people that play it both online and offline, but there seem to be issues with the online. The netcode is not good, by any means. It can be bearable, or it can be 5 seconds of input lag, followed by frame drops, followed by losing connection to your opponent. The game is no longer region locked, however playing against someone on the otherside of the world is not going to go very well.\n\nThe game has gone through some significant balance reworks, so a lot of characters are now viable, but the game is very zoner dominated, so if you prefer fighters that are all about getting in your opponents face, you should probably give Injustice a miss.\n\nOverall, if you're already a fighting game enthusiast, you have no doubt played many games that are better than Injustice that you should stick to. But if you are new to fighting games, or just a DC fan, then Injustice is very worth picking up, combos are a lot easier to do than in other fighting games since they are less time restrictive. Blocking is simplified; hold back to standing block in one direction, hold down to crouching block in both directions. Forward and backward throws can be broken with the same button. All characters share some attack moves, such as uppercuts, sweeps and bounces. All characters have a character power, which is a gimmick that can be used to help you play that character better.","December 15, 2013","true","23.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The fighting system is a slightly altered and refined version of NetherRealm's very popular Mortal Kombat.\n\nThe story of Injustice takes place in an alternative version of the DC Universe where Superman has killed The Joker and now rules over One Earth with supreme authority. You play as several fighters ranging from Batman, Green Arrow, Deathstroke, and even Joker himself (albeit another version) along with many others as you go through the campaign. The narrative is very enjoyable and somewhat inspired by plots found in DC Animated Movies.\n\nStages in this game are interesting, containing many interactable objects for damaging and escaping, and some may allow you to knock your opponent into another portion of that stage. Several minigames break up the monotony of the battles, but some of them are hit-or-miss. Success or failure during these minigames will determine how much health you and your opponent will start the battle with.\n\nIn addition to the single player campaign, there are both the S.T.A.R. Labs Missions and Battles with which you can hone your skills. Achievement hunters will spend a lot of time in this game due to the multitude of unlockables within the Archives. Be warned that some of the achievements, especially "Top Rung," requires grinding out Battles with the entire roster of fighters.\n\nAs a whole, Injustice is an entertaining fighter featuring some of the most popular DC characters to date. If you can find this game on a sale, I highly recommend it if you are a fighting game enthusiast or even a DC Comics fan just for the story."","January 8, 2014","true","26.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Everyone should get it specially because it's on deal today. This game is well worth the 50. This game was originally made for the PS3/XBox , so they decided to put it onto the pc. Unfortunatly, it has its own little bugs (Hoping they fix them...). The game is playable but you MUST lower the graphics a little just so your game could run better (Yes it will look somewhat "ugly" but you can still see the game and it runs a heck of a lot faster). This game has some really cool characters, with many easy combos, this game isn't hard at all when it comes to those, if you take your time and practice a little you'll make some good moves. This comes with all DLC, which means it has all outfits, and some characters added along. The maps are REALLY interactive! You can throw cars around, jump into portals, and most of them have stage transtions (meaning the stage has multiple stages within that one stage). Story mode is rather short, it took me a good 6 hours to complete but you can always just replay, and give yourself somewhat of a challenge by increasing the hardness. This game comes with a lot of fun mini games as well. Now onto online . . . The downside to this part is that there's barely anyone on so its really rare to find someone, and when you do have someone to fight with, it logs you out . . . (If you're lucky you could have an actual match with this person). As I said, all characters have easy combos, anyone could really master them, and also every character has their own unique styles, phrases, etc. If you've played Mortal Kombat, Tekken, Street Fighter, Dead or Alive, or any other fighter, and liked it, then this game is for you! Hoping the team fixes the bugs, but the game is playable!\n\n9/10","December 7, 2013","true","42.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I am big fan of Tekken and Mortal Combat franchises and I love these games very much. But this game has taken the hand to hand combat genre to a different level. Since, the game is entirely based on the DC universe - it will appeal to people who love DC comics (any comics lovers, for that matter) as well as people like me who plays and enjoys hand to hand combat games.\n\nSo, let me just carry on with the review in detailed segments.\n\n1) Story:\n\nThis game has a variety of single player options. One of them is the "Story mode". As it is described in the game, Superman from another parallel dimension looses control of his emotion - as the Joker tricked him to kill Louis and their unborn child along with the destruction of the entire Metropolis. After that he "crosses the line" and kills joker. This alters his personality and thus forms a "Earth 1 Govt." and ushers his reign. Some of his fellow league members joins him as a ruler and most of the rest of the heroes who stood against him dies. The remaining heroes, who are not with this "evil" superman forms the resistance, led by none other than Batman. The story starts as this resistance leader asks for for help from the heroes of our world by snatching them from our dimension. What happens next ??... play the game !\n\n2) Graphics :\n\nThis the next thing that you would feel - is awesome! The effects are stunning and the scripts are seamlessly integrated to the context of the screen. The model details are very very accurate. Since I am using a stone age 9500 GT my system could only manage a bearable FPS only at 640x480 (ridiculous, I know) I can't elaborate the graphics too much here ; but if I crank up the settings (and sacrifice the FPS) just to get the feel of the graphics - they really looked great on my 22" HD monitor.\n\n3) Gameplay:\n\nThe game play is a bit difficult in the keyboard as it ported straight out of the console platform to PC. But anyway - its not Call of Duty either and most of the hand to hand combat games are created keeping consoles in mind. But after you get used to the controls a bit you will find that its a hell of an enjoyment in playing the game. The ghosting effects are pretty less once you get the feel of your system's I/O lags- still its easy to carry on combos or streaks of attacks.\n\nThe environment is engaging and interactive to a large extent (considering the genre)- things that you can pick up and throw at your opponents. the maps(levels) may have multiple sections where you can hit the wall along with your opponent and smash it to transit to next area. And this entire functions can generate combo hits.\n\nOverall the game is a "go" from my side , hope that it will do justice to you as well.\n\n- Justice -","July 16, 2014","true","13.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But certain previews at least gave me some hope. I'm also not some elite player in all those games, but I can pull my own weight to at least offer some perspective about certain fighting games. And based on what I've played so far, I was actually impressed. I'll try to note some of the highlights that caught my attention. I've completed the single player campaign and played many hours of online vs mode. This review may assist with someone still on the fence about the game, and wanting certain answers.\n\n[GAMEPLAY Highlights]\n\n- Fight style is very similar to Mortal Kombat, as one would assume. However, there is no more need for a block button. This time, just hold back (away from opponent). This makes it easier for new players, unfamiliar to MK, to pick up. Basically, allows for a larger audience. However, hardcore MK fans may or may not appreciate this.\n\n- There is a meter bar that is built up with attacks. Up to four meters to be used individually for move cancellations, or full meter for Super Signature moves.\n\n- Ability to cancel certain abilities/combos (uses a meter bar), helps to connect long chained combos.\n\n- Basic combos are simple enough for newbies to make use of. But, it can get complex enough to keep the hardcore entertained in finding long combo strings.\n\n- Meter bar also used for wager mode. While you're being chain hit, you can cancel the opponent's chain by initiating a "clash". During this phase you and the opponent place a "bet" of your meter. 1-4 of your meter to be used in the wager, against the opponent's. Once the wager is placed, the two figthers do a slow motion power clash. If the initiator of the clash wins, he/she gains a % of health based on the difference of the meter waged. If the initiator of the clash loses, then the opponent does an amount of damage that is the difference of the wager. However, this can only be performed once per character, within a game, and when you're down to your 2nd health bar. In-game should explain this more clearly, but it is a pretty nice touch, imo. Additionally, it can be used as a bait/psych move against another player. For example, you could choose to initiate the clash, and not wage any of your meter. Yet, your opponent might panic and wage all of his meter. You take some damage, but it may be worth taking that damage over possibly the opponent using their meter for more damaging combos or supers. And of course, whoever has no meter during this will automatically lose. Ties will just end up in a Tie with no damage nor health bonus.\n\n- Rather than rounds, you have 2 health bars. This is great to keep the fight flowing. It wouldn't make sense for some voice to announce "ROUND 2", anyway. But once you deplete the first bar, there is a slight pause... kinda feels like you knocked the wind out of the other char, and he's regaining his senses. Something to note, with two health bars, it is not continuous. Meaning, if you do more damage than is necessary to deplete the first health bar, it doesn't carry over to the second health bar. So, you would be wasting a super when the opponent only has 5% left of their first health bar.\n\n- Very interactive stages. This could be a hit or miss with the crowd, but I feel it's fitting for a Super Hero game. Certain objects in the stages can be thrown, activated, or jumped off of. For example, a hovering vehicle could be picked up in mid air and slammed at the opponent. A button on a panel would activate the missiles on the Batmobile. Some heavy objects on the stage may be picked up by a stronger character, but a more agile character would jump off it as a defensive maneuver. Objects thrown/activated this way is unblockable.\n\n- Characters can also be knocked through walls to other sections of the stage. In the process you see them hitting various objects, which differs from stage to stage. For example, hit through a wall, into a helicopter, which then crashes into another area. The character does take damage along the way.\n\n- Character specific special, activated, abilities. One button is assigned for this, and it can be activated any time when it's off cooldown. Every character has a different ability. IE: Batman activates radio controlled Batarangs that circle around him. These can then be use to shoot at the target, or create a defensive barrier. Green Arrow just shoots an arrow when pressing his button, but if you did a half circle back + button he loads up an ice arrow head. Next time you press that button, he shoots the ice arrow which freezes the opponent briefly. Another motion would load up fire arrows. Doomsday activates power armor that decreases damage for a short period. All these abilities do have a cooldown, amongst other conditions. Another nice addition for this type of game, imo.","July 25, 2014","true","67.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","8"

(ie, The Dark Knight, vs "Batman: The Dark Knight")\n\nYou may consider Injustice to be a sort of spiritual continuation of Nether Realms' Mortal Kombat series, but without needlessly excessive gore, some easier combos to pull off, and some interesting fighting game mechanics I personally like.\n\n- Arena weapons; a button is dedicated to interacting with the 2.5D arena's near-foreground, for instance rebounding off a parked car or throwing an obstacle at your enemy. Additionally, performing a certain attack close to an arena's edge will do a "level transition", which on its own deals quite a lot of damage to your opponent.\n- Like with Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat, some special abilities can be "powered up", sacrificing a section of your ability meter to have a stronger effect. What makes this different is that you don't need to hit that 12th button at the same time; you're free to press the trigger button about a half-second after your ability starts, to perform a follow-on attack.\n- An uncommon difference is that the concept of "rounds" (Round 2. FIGHT!) is replaced with simply a dual health bar. When one's first health bar runs out, the combo ends, characters spread their distance and pose for a moment, but your super meter and health bar remain the same. (So, for instance, winning round 1 with 1 hp left isn't going to leave you much of an advantage)\n\nThe game has a story mode that tends to work at a pretty low difficulty, and sometimes breaks up the fighting with quick-time events. It also has a "Challenge tower" in the form of the "STAR Labs", using very simple text-based quick stories to rationalize the teaching of particular techniques. (ie, repeatedly use Superman's heat vision input to protect a civilian)\n\nOne of the better fighting games I've played - from the POV of someone who's constantly aggravated by the need to memorize combos.

But certain previews at least gave me some hope. I'm also not some elite player in all those games, but I can pull my own weight to at least offer some perspective about certain fighting games. And based on what I've played so far, I was actually impressed. I'll try to note some of the highlights that caught my attention. I've completed the single player campaign and played many hours of online vs mode. This review may assist with someone still on the fence about the game, and wanting certain answers.\n\n[GAMEPLAY Highlights]\n\n- Fight style is very similar to Mortal Kombat, as one would assume. However, there is no more need for a block button. This time, just hold back (away from opponent). This makes it easier for new players, unfamiliar to MK, to pick up. Basically, allows for a larger audience. However, hardcore MK fans may or may not appreciate this.\n\n- There is a meter bar that is built up with attacks. Up to four meters to be used individually for move cancellations, or full meter for Super Signature moves.\n\n- Ability to cancel certain abilities/combos (uses a meter bar), helps to connect long chained combos.\n\n- Basic combos are simple enough for newbies to make use of. But, it can get complex enough to keep the hardcore entertained in finding long combo strings.\n\n- Meter bar also used for wager mode. While you're being chain hit, you can cancel the opponent's chain by initiating a "clash". During this phase you and the opponent place a "bet" of your meter. 1-4 of your meter to be used in the wager, against the opponent's. Once the wager is placed, the two figthers do a slow motion power clash. If the initiator of the clash wins, he/she gains a % of health based on the difference of the meter waged.

I am big fan of Tekken and Mortal Combat franchises and I love these games very much. But this game has taken the hand to hand combat genre to a different level. Since, the game is entirely based on the DC universe - it will appeal to people who love DC comics (any comics lovers, for that matter) as well as people like me who plays and enjoys hand to hand combat games.\n\nSo, let me just carry on with the review in detailed segments.\n\n1) Story:\n\nThis game has a variety of single player options. One of them is the "Story mode". As it is described in the game, Superman from another parallel dimension looses control of his emotion - as the Joker tricked him to kill Louis and their unborn child along with the destruction of the entire Metropolis. After that he "crosses the line" and kills joker. This alters his personality and thus forms a "Earth 1 Govt." and ushers his reign. Some of his fellow league members joins him as a ruler and most of the rest of the heroes who stood against him dies. The remaining heroes, who are not with this "evil" superman forms the resistance, led by none other than Batman. The story starts as this resistance leader asks for for help from the heroes of our world by snatching them from our dimension. What happens next ??... play the game !\n\n2) Graphics :\n\nThis the next thing that you would feel - is awesome! The effects are stunning and the scripts are seamlessly integrated to the context of the screen. The model details are very very accurate. Since I am using a stone age 9500 GT my system could only manage a bearable FPS only at 640x480 (ridiculous, I know) I can't elaborate the graphics too much here ; but if I crank up the settings (and sacrifice the FPS) just to get the feel of the graphics - they really looked great on my 22" HD monitor.\n\n3) Gameplay:\n\nThe game play is a bit difficult in the keyboard as it ported straight out of the console platform to PC. But anyway - its not Call of Duty either and most of the hand to hand combat games are created keeping consoles in mind. But after you get used to the controls a bit you will find that its a hell of an enjoyment in playing the game. The ghosting effects are pretty less once you get the feel of your system's I/O lags- still its easy to carry on combos or streaks of attacks.\n\nThe environment is engaging and interactive to a large extent (considering the genre)- things that you can pick up and throw at your opponents. the maps(levels) may have multiple sections where you can hit the wall along with your opponent and smash it to transit to next area. And this entire functions can generate combo hits.\n\nOverall the game is a "go" from my side , hope that it will do justice to you as well.\n\n- Justice -","July 16, 2014","true","13.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There are many playable characters and way more combo's and tricks than i can remember from the tutorial, the performance of the game is good.

How is it Capcom was able to make fighting games 20 years ago that were fluid and responsive and these yahoos still can't figure it out?\n\nI have been playing it on medium difficulty- Well, "playing" is being generous. More like having my rear end handed to me in almost every match because the computer doesn't have to slog through terrible controls and can react faster than my character on screen can animate the move I told it to do. Hey developers- it's called a difficulty curve for a reason- the game starts off easier and gets progressively harder. Also, medium difficulty should mean that someone with experience in the genre can pick it up fairly quickly. Frustration is not fun- why is this such a difficult concept for game developers to grasp?\n\nThe graphics look beautiful- provided you have a very high end video card to run it. Anything less looks like crap. I don't know how, since almost every other game I play looks prety good, but in order to make this game run fluidly I had to drop the resolution and turn down most of the antialiasing. The game ends up looking like an original xbox game.\n\nFortunately I bought it on sale, but I could think of many more useful and more productive things I could have done with that money, including setting it on fire and using it as toilet paper. Also, 20 gig of space- what the frak? What in blue bloody blazes are they using 20 friggin' gig of hard drive space for? I could store a lot of other, much more enjoyable games in that 20 gig of space.\n\nOverall, if you like fighting games, stay away from this one. If you like superhero games, stay away from it as well so it doesn't sully games like the Arkham series. Or even sully the name of Superman 64 for that matter; At least back then no one knew any better.\n\nIf, however, you enjoy frustrating controls, poor difficulty curves, and sub-par graphics on mid grade hardware, then this game is right up your alley but I still can't condone anyone else spending money on it; Maybe if the game developers suffer they will learn a lesson.","November 28, 2014","false","4.7"," 15 of 31 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","15","31","0","0"

It has plenty of characters that are all very interesting and familiar if you're a big fan of DC Comics. The environmnets are interesting, interactive, and dynamic to certain extents, which makes combat even more fun. I managed to play through Batman's chapter in the Story mode, which was entertaining and good. The story seemed interesting enough to play through, yet nothing amazing or far too great.\n\nThe fighting is cool and good since all characters have their own finishes, moves, and combat styles. It's well balanced between the characters and it feels like as if this could have been a competetive fighter even.\n\nIn the end, I recommend this to those of you who have Windows 7.

I think not. Yes, the game has ported with pseudo-joystick support, and even has a convenient icon to remind idiots they are using a joystick. The problems begin with the fact that this game uses direct-controller mapping, meaning those of us who have invested in programmable pc peripherals, such as the aforementioned sticks or, say, expensive mice and keyboards are sol (excuse my french). Add to this the fact that your expensive flight stick gets direct-mapped to an axis range of less than 1mm -yes, 1 milimeter- in any direction with a deadzone of roughly 2 nanometers -yes, we're now talking the distance between diodes on your processor- and you see where the "fun" really begins. Your alternatives are to buy an xbox 360 controller and hope for better luck or try to use keyboard controls that are by necessity difficult for anyone with less than thirty fingers, especially folks like myself, who are trying to get by with just five. By the way, this is the only PC game I have ever played that makes no use whatsoever of the mouse. That's right, my 80-dollar mouse has no function here whatsoever. On the bright side, the game does appear to be relatively gorgeous on fairly decent hardware. This seems to be the pattern with both WB games I have played thus far, namely "look, but don't touch." Those of us who even vaguely remember the Clinton years will feel nostalgic. I imagine this could be a very fun game for those of us who own and use the exact controller configuration WB envisioned for the port, or any of us who have already been exposed to radioactive spiders, etc. and sprouted extra limbs. (On a side note, having already received my lifetime dose of radiation, I can tell you useful mutations are unlikely, but rapid aging and unpleasant side-effects are medically guaranteed) In short, this game requires perfect health and  the perfect PC, or perhaps patience of biblical proportions. The rest of us are going to be pulling out whatever hair we still possess. I didn't pay full price for this nightmare, but there isn't a discount steep enough to make it worth my time.","January 20, 2015","false","8.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I think not. Yes, the game has ported with pseudo-joystick support, and even has a convenient icon to remind idiots they are using a joystick. The problems begin with the fact that this game uses direct-controller mapping, meaning those of us who have invested in programmable pc peripherals, such as the aforementioned sticks or, say, expensive mice and keyboards are sol (excuse my french). Add to this the fact that your expensive flight stick gets direct-mapped to an axis range of less than 1mm -yes, 1 milimeter- in any direction with a deadzone of roughly 2 nanometers -yes, we're now talking the distance between diodes on your processor- and you see where the "fun" really begins. Your alternatives are to buy an xbox 360 controller and hope for better luck or try to use keyboard controls that are by necessity difficult for anyone with less than thirty fingers, especially folks like myself, who are trying to get by with just five. By the way, this is the only PC game I have ever played that makes no use whatsoever of the mouse. That's right, my 80-dollar mouse has no function here whatsoever. On the bright side, the game does appear to be relatively gorgeous on fairly decent hardware. This seems to be the pattern with both WB games I have played thus far, namely "look, but don't touch." Those of us who even vaguely remember the Clinton years will feel nostalgic. I imagine this could be a very fun game for those of us who own and use the exact controller configuration WB envisioned for the port, or any of us who have already been exposed to radioactive spiders, etc. and sprouted extra limbs. (On a side note, having already received my lifetime dose of radiation, I can tell you useful mutations are unlikely, but rapid aging and unpleasant side-effects are medically guaranteed) In short, this game requires perfect health and  the perfect PC, or perhaps patience of biblical proportions. The rest of us are going to be pulling out whatever hair we still possess. I didn't pay full price for this nightmare, but there isn't a discount steep enough to make it worth my time.","January 20, 2015","false","8.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Yes, the single player experience is largely the same as it's console counterparts, but the PC version HAD an online mode, and now that Netherealms has sold thousands of copies during their June 2014 Steam Sale, they have taken the online servers down for some reason.  Not only that, but the April "update" stated that the online experience should be working better for all players.  Well it worked for a little while and now the servers are down.  What a CRAPTACULAR experience.  The single player mode is enjoyable, but if you don't have a PS3 / PS4 or an Xbox 360 controller then I wouldn't bother with this one, unless you like playing your fighting games with the keyboard (which by and large simply doesn't work well).  It's quite sad, because A LOT of people wanted to play and enjoy this game, both online and offline.

I purchased this game when I had a computer that met the recommended specs and it worked perfectly at max settings. A nice, smooth 60 FPS.\n\nBut then, I made a big mistake! I felt that Injustice, a game not even two years old, could handle a good computer! A computer with eight cores instead of four and a solid graphics card. What a fool I was! No, Injustice showed me the error of my ways. It was sure to not even utilize my GPU. It was sure to spike furiously between 27 and 50 FPS whenever I dared play a match.\n\nInjustice looked at its two brothers, Mortal Kombat (2011) and Mortal Kombat X, and sneered in disgust. How DARE they function normally? How DARE they properly utilize the hardware of a computer? How DARE they work like games that were made in their respective years and not an alpha version of a 1991 MS-DOS script. Injustice would show them, Injustice would show them all!\n\nThe only real Injustice here is that I was screwed out of my money. I contacted WB Games and I was sure to get my buddy Marcus, who doesn't speak a lick of English but is fluent in copy-and-paste and corporate spittle. I stayed up all night and am writing this review while sleep-deprived and consumed by the fury of the gods. They don't care. As soon as they get their money, you mean nothing to them. I managed to rig my game to a somewhat working state through the equivalent of applying huge amounts of duct tape and WD-40 to it, yet the game still isn't entirely working right. I'll never get to play this game again and that saddens me.","June 5, 2015","false","19.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

I played it for 30 minutes and decided to put it down.  This is the first time I've ever requested a refund for a game on Steam.  It's just not fun in any way.\nIf you have ever played a fighting game, then you've played this.  You're not going to find anything new here.\n\nThe controls just don't work.  15 of my 30 minutes were in the tutorial.  10 of those 15 minutes were spent on one move: Left, Right + X.  I don't know why, but it just doesn't work.  Must be a timing thing.  Do you have to hold down Left for a certain amount of time?  The game doesn't give you any hints.\n\nFighting games need to feel tight.  The hits need to feel like they're actually connecting.  The fighting in this game is clumsy and is very similar to those Street Fighter ripoff clones from the 90s.  The so-called combo attack system is very weak, when it actually works, which is rarely as the controls are pitiful.\n\nThe animation is awful.  Something is just wrong about Batman's face.  It's like his mouth is being sucked into a black hole hidden in his throat.  It's difficult to describe, but imagine what a lemon looks like if it were turned inside out.\n\nStory is boring... The game just isn't good.  I'm a huge fan of the DC universe, but even my fanboyism couldn't make this game enjoyable.  I wish there was a demo so I could have avoided wasting Steam Support's time with my refund request.","June 19, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

So far, aside from a couple of gripes, I've been pretty happy with my spend.\n\nI haven't yet played it to completion, but have been enjoying the playthrough so far. Visuals look beautiful on my rig even though it's getting pretty dated, and it runs quick and smooth without lagging or otherwise choking on those visuals without the need for turning any settings down, which is more than I can say for some of the other recent titles I've bought. The environments (and their interactions) look great but still don't draw attention away from the action when you're in the middle of it, and the cutscenes/cinematics I've seen so far don't summarily stop the action and butt in to the middle of a fight sequence right when you're on a roll.\n\nThe controls are crisp and responsive, but this is also where I feel more than a bit frustrated, as having no gamepad, I'm stuck using keyboard for the time being - the default controls aren't the most intutitive, and I've had some difficulties remapping them to what I'd like, which seems to possibly be due to the (admittedly cool) keyboard-based local multiplayer capability. That said, it's not an insurmountable, and I eventually figured out a layout that works well enough till I decide to spring for a controller.\n\n8/10 so far - Good and fun, story where it counts, and a good way of tuning out for a bit at the end of the day.","October 30, 2014","true","4.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Im running it on a high end laptop and my frames are craptastic they can barely stay at 30.\nOther than that the game is enjoyable, and I am pretty picky. The animations are good; they really spent their time bringing the characters to life, not just for the cinematic parts which take up most of the story mode. The character moves and combos leave a little to be desired but what really makes the gameplay dissapointing is that the framerate is worse than a lot of emulators. SO CHOPPY is the only way to describe it. I would wait to hear if they fix this before I buy this game for more than a few bucks. Right now it's not worth more than that, and even then I would consider it an "investment" that I would have to wait on. Hopefull this gets fixed. It's at horrible console port  level right now. If I didn't buy games for so cheap these lemons would have me researching these titles to see how buggy they are (looking at you too, muri.)\n\nGameplay  3.5/5\n\nGraphics 4/5\n\nStory  3/5\n\nControls get a 0 or a 1 or w.e right now.

Everything works exactly as it should. Controls are fully responsive, combos always work but can be changed up as desired, so lack of variety isn't an issue. This game has single-handedly turned me from hating fighting games to loving them, though after playing Injustice, I'm not entirely certain I want to play anything else the genre currently has to offer.\n\nPros:\n- Awesome voice acting, especially the Clash quotes, which are fun, creative and varied\n- Fun and creatively designed special moves, combos, and finishers\n- Short but sweet story mode\n- Solid tutorial\n- Plenty of things to unlock even playing single player after beating the story mode\n- Great animations, in terms of both speed and graphical feedback accuracy\n- Fun terrain-based attacks, which add to variety and can be added into combos\n\nCons:\n- No one is playing online on the PC version, so I assume it isn't cross-platform multiplayer, but honestly, I'm having fun just playing single player, as odd as that is for a fighting game, so this doesn't spoil the experience for me, and if I ever get a home console, I'll be grabbing this title first thing","June 10, 2014","true","11.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Don't get me wrong, I like a challenge. But the single player missions force you to change character every 3 or 4 fights, so you cannot really get used to a single character and its moves. Also, almost every 5 or 6 fights, you get to fight against your own character. This is very confusing, because the visual differences between each character are minimal.\nLater on in the single player missions, the fights get harder. You do minimal damage, while your enemy does a lot of damage, even with a single basic attack. When you lose, the difficulty is set back, which makes the same fight too easy. All these annoyances make that I cannot recommend this game.\n\nSo, in short:\n\nPros:\nGreat graphics\nNice physics\nFinally a nice fighting game for PC\n\nCons:\nVery long and boring cutscenes\nVisual differences between same superheroes too minimal\nForced change of character in single player mission\nNeed to learn new moves each 3 or 4 fights\nDifficulty-settings change dramatically when a fight is lost.\nNew missions are too hard when playing a new character and damage-balance is way off.","June 13, 2014","false","8.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

All in all, while it takes a lot to get me into a fighting game (I also play streetfighter IV acrade edition when I'm being held at gunpoint), the combat mechanics ar simplistic enough for me to get to grips with, to the point that in combination with the characters on screen...I have an excellent time playing the game.\n\nThere's also a lot to keep teh comic book reader as well - the unlocks offer references to the comics, the skins look fantastic, and while some of the voice work is patchy at best, the fact that some effort has been put into at least TRYING to make them fit the character is gratifying in the least.\n\nThat said - despite all the DLC and the hope that more DLC will be released for the game, Injustice isn't a £40 (or $60) game. If you were willing to early adopt the game, it might have been worth that price, had it been released at the same time as the xbox 360 and ps3 version - the fact that people with both console and PC have a CLEAR advantage when it comes to knowing combos actually kind of diminishes it, and I feel the publishers missed a trick, as I would have loved to be in the crowd that inticipated which character would be released next.\n\nAll in all...If you see this game drop to £20 over the coming weeks, don't hesitate in buying it. the online co-op is fantasically smooth to the point that I doubt you'd have a problem matchmaking, and the storyline is absolutely brilliant - it's rare to have a game that has as strong a single player as it does a multiplayer.","December 7, 2013","true","8.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you have played MK-9 Before you will get used to this game fast enough. The graphics and the heroes are very good, you can hardly see any bad meshes in this game. The effects are outstanding and amazingly good.\n\nComparing this MK-9, you have the DC heroes, better graphics, better mechanics, more combos and more fighting variations, and the sounds are good. Plus, you can use your environment to change the arena in-game! And also use the environment to do harm to your enemy fighter in many ways.\n\nIf you're a fan of fighting games, you wouldn't care about multiplayer since we played all MKs on singleplayer before for the story and for arcade. Haven't tried online and not planning to anytime soon.\n\nFor the keyboard support there are two layouts. Both are great, and easy to learn.\n\nCombos and special movements are now really easier than ever to learn thanks to the quick pause menu.\n\nFinally, this game is absolutly worth it.","December 6, 2013","true","12.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'm not a fan of them but this one draws me in with a reasonably good story-mode and "side-mission" via the Star Labs section. The graphics are good if not outstanding but the sound design is spot on, including a brilliant menu screen score. The fighting is fluid and most of all fun and the super-moves are great. Only downside, a lot of the characters only have 1 entrance animation and comment so it gets a little dull if playing multiple matches at once. Huge bonus to the PC version is fast loading times, where the consoles were awful.

They do add a cool feeling to the fight and make it look cool, but I find that they become too much as you play. I found myself messing a combo up because an interactalbe would be there. Just kinda annoying but not to bad. Also like the Roster but I still feel like it's lacking, 22 Males and only 8 Females. We need more Female fighters and there are a bunch of good ones out there too. Finishing off the Teen Titans would be a smart choice and that adds Starfire and Donna Troy... and Tera. Black Canary... one of the best Fighters in DC, with a canary cry that would have cool combo flows. She was in a picture in the game, I think she should be on the roster. Poison Ivy would be a great addition, and Cheetah as well. So many more to increase the Female list. Huntress, Supergirl, Star Sapphire, Circe, Powergirl, Talia Al ghul. Maybe just as an add on since his armour was in the hall of justice map, add Doctor Fate. So Far though loving the Ultimate Edition and the skins. Hopefully we can get more out of this game in the New year, like skins for the DLC Characters and maybe even a addition to the story, that brings in the DLC Characters and possible additions.","January 1, 2014","true","16.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The campaign had really bad graphics when it came to the cutscenes. Other than that it was an amazing expirience. There are battles after that where you can find out what happened to each and every character after the events of the main campaign which is a good add on. However multiplayer is completely dead and when you do find a server the opposing player either disconnects before losing or the lag is too bad to play.

Voice acting is clear but music and sound effects have suffered and are low quality. This game is not optimised for the pc and I would streer clear.

Don't get me wrong, I like a challenge. But the single player missions force you to change character every 3 or 4 fights, so you cannot really get used to a single character and its moves. Also, almost every 5 or 6 fights, you get to fight against your own character. This is very confusing, because the visual differences between each character are minimal.\nLater on in the single player missions, the fights get harder. You do minimal damage, while your enemy does a lot of damage, even with a single basic attack. When you lose, the difficulty is set back, which makes the same fight too easy. All these annoyances make that I cannot recommend this game.\n\nSo, in short:\n\nPros:\nGreat graphics\nNice physics\nFinally a nice fighting game for PC\n\nCons:\nVery long and boring cutscenes\nVisual differences between same superheroes too minimal\nForced change of character in single player mission\nNeed to learn new moves each 3 or 4 fights\nDifficulty-settings change dramatically when a fight is lost.\nNew missions are too hard when playing a new character and damage-balance is way off.","June 13, 2014","false","8.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Great game, great graphics and really cool roster of DC and one character from Mortal Kombat. All the DLCs are included in this edition. Plays a little like MK, but with a couple of differences. Your special attacks are identical to that of MK, but the blocking techniques are more like Street Fighter, so there will be a bit of a learning curve, if you're used to MK's style. Gameplay is also much faster to that of Mortal Kombat.

I like fighting games (although being a noob at them) and I didn't expect much from it as I am not a big fan of Mortal Kombat or DC.\n\nGod was I in for a surprise.\n\nIt has some very fun unique concepts like how you can use the environnement against your opponement and the way it does it differs with every character (for instance, with a car, Batman will just jump off of it to go behind the opponement while Superman will hit you with the same car) The interactions also are stage-unique which makes stages more than comestic.\n\nUltimate moves can be pulled off easely even for beginners which is a nice touch for noobs like me. Zone transitions are very satisfying as well.\n\nThe story is very well written, it could easely be a movie and every fight has a purpose story-wise. Also, The Joker has some nice one-liners in it. I recommend doing it in one sitting which will last about 2 to 3 hours. You will still have character-unique endings by going through the arcade mode.\n\nOverall, it is worth getting it even if you're not a DC fan and just looking for a fun fighter. It revolutionnes the way fighting games are made and I hope many other fighters like Street Fighter or King Of Fighters get some inspiration from some of the game's mechanics and the way the story mode is made.","December 28, 2013","true","9.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Also keep in mind I am not the best at fighters. Fairly easy for a novice to feel like they know what they are doing. Did not try the online yet; which I hear issues still exist, but with that said still think this is worth the buy on sale.","December 7, 2013","true","4.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Gameplay is actually pretty good altough its not the best compared to Street Fighter or Tekken. Gameplay is more like Mortal Kombat and every Character got his own moves, so its different than SF where you got 30 Ryu copies. The story so far is kinda silly but still a nice Elseworld-Story. All in all a good brawler and perfect fanservice in form of the skins related to the "Red Son" comic.","December 7, 2013","true","15.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/agadudes/recommended/242700/","agadudes","Heavy is a Spy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/agadudes/","13 products in account","After a long wait for a PC port, finally got to play this game. As a DC Comics fan, this is just awesome and I never expected this to be so great. As a fighting game, it's pretty straight forward that any fan of the fighting game genre may feel at home here. However, for people like me who got used to Tekken, it took me a while to learn the moves, as the game has a very noob-unfriendly difficulty curve, where the level between easy & medium would just spike and the fights would be unforgiving if you don't know your moves. But once you learn the combos, the game would definitely be enjoyable and not as frustrating. Highly recommend!","December 12, 2013","true","41.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
