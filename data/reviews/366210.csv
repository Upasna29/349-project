I'm all for trying something new when it comes to a predefined genre. However, the spinning of the map just didn't fit for me personally. I'm sure many people will enjoy it and that is fine. I'm just not a fan of puzzle games and I feel like that's what this feature brings to the game. I found it very tedious and it quickly ruined the overall Tower Defense experience for me. Tower Defense is probably my favorite genre and without the map rotations feature, this would have been right up my alley. For me personally I would rate it 6/10.","June 2, 2015","false","0.9"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

You can tell alot of love was put into this game, the art is superb for what it is. However, the soundtrack did seem to be lacking in alot of areas, it seems to loop rather quickly. But the gameplay has good bit of variety in terms of your towers the enemy, also upgrading your towers gives a nice visual difference for each one, which I can appreciate . Also the whole "twist the map" thing is actually a good way to stop the gameplay from getting stale, you have to actively be involved if you want to move forward. If this were a mobile game I would definitely buy it, it has a the gimmicks of a good ol' time waster, however as a full PC release, me personally would not be interested. If they can port this it would be awesome to play this on my iPad or my phone.\n\nHonestly, if you are into this type of genre be wary that the puzzle elements are pretty important, but for the price it's well worth a look at.","September 12, 2015","true","0.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Not only does it have bright, vibrant colors that catches the eye, but it also has fun, quirky music that immediately puts a smile to my face. Furthermore, Sleep Attack has a great puzzle/strategy aspect to it that challenges your mind a bit more than a typical Tower Defense game would, so it‚Äôs great for people who want something thats been revamped. And although at times it can become pretty difficult (especially with controlling the map) I, personally, think it makes the game even more worth buying because of how innovated it is. Overall, I would highly recommend Sleep Attack to gamers that enjoy a challenge and want something new from the original Tower Defense genre.","September 14, 2015","true","1.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Be careful though, there are always multiple routes to control!\n\nCombine tactical planning with strategic tower upgrades to slow, divert and damage your enemies.

Not much you can do in some levels other than be lucky.  Spinning the board around could have been a nice change to the genre, but is just a  gimmick that is broken and you are always pausing the game. Takes you out of the game mentally. Not the worst  T.D. game i have ever played but surely the most broken.","April 9","false","3.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
