I would rather prefer that the game worked more around a score attack instead of make a perfect run-through to be able to hear the story.\n\nthis for kids wouldn't be good given how much it requires to be exact and remember how to go through and avoids storytelling. and for adults looking for a challenge there are many better games which won't irritate you by saying the same things over and over again.","April 26, 2014","false","0.1"," 119 of 152 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","119","152","0","5"

You have to dodge between the letters and thereby pick them up as you go; if you fill out the words "rabbit hole" you get an extra life, i.e. an extra chance, when you inevitably die.\n\nAs someone who thoroughly enjoyed Super Hexagon, I can't say I reccomend. It's hard, not just because it tests your reflexes, but 3D objects flying at you without any indication of which plane you're positioned on makes it difficult to tell if you're in going to make it in the gap or not. And each time you move left or right the camera does an awful jerk that's strainful to the eyes.

Even if you try to map a controller in the Unity options, the game ignores it.\n\nGameplay in a nutshell: you are glued to either the top or bottom of the screen, and need to pass through the gaps between letters in order to collect them to form the word shown at the bottom of the screen. Unfortunately you have very little time to react, and combine that with a tilting camera that makes it extra unclear where exactly your block is located compared to the upcoming letters, and this game becomes less about skill and more about luck.\n\nThis game either needs to get rid of the tilting camera, or give some kind of indication where exactly your cursor is, by a shadow or light in front perhaps. In its current state it only serves as a source of frustration.","July 29, 2014","false","1.0"," 37 of 49 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","37","49","0","0"

As of now you can buy the game for less than a dollar. As far as the jerking motion is concerned it should jerk because it needs to have dimension to it. This is a minimalist game so nothing spectacular should be expected. Now if you are having trouble with getting through the game then don't write a bad review because you are having difficulties. Instead just focus on what you need to work on and try again. Some of the things I like best of this game is the effect of the letters coming straight out you as well as the electronic music. I thought the story of Alice and Wonderland played the whole time and not have sudden pauses in the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/unpageable/recommended/283660/","unpageable","Unpageable","http://steamcommunity.com/id/unpageable/","477 products in account","A minimalist game in which Alice is depicted as a cube falling through Wonderland, passages of the novel would be read out as you play and words would form up as obstacles inhibiting your progress. A creative take on an otherwise old formula that’s been done plenty of times on Steam. What was initially a fun concept turned into a mighty struggle against repetition, it was a chore in exercise when I was barely minutes into the game.\n\nFirst of all, this game only contain parts of the novel and not the entire thing, I fail to grasp why that is the case besides laziness. Secondly, the stages will always play out the same since it was fixed in stone by what was written in novel, so you’ll hear certain lines so often that you’ll come to hate them and Lewis Carroll (no offence to the great author). Lastly this game only featured a practice mode (stage select) and a ranked mode (leader board), which is the same thing in reality, thus there is no replay value what so ever.\n\nThe biggest bane of this game came from its atrocious controls. Tapping the arrow keys moves too slow in the faster stages, but holding the shift key moves way too fast. The animation would also turn jerky as you move, so the game essentially forces you to hug the top or bottom lane for much of its duration and to limit movement unless absolutely necessary.\n\nCamera angles also worked against you in the worst manner possible, most evident when the game decided to make sharp corners just to spite you. By the time the next word (obstacle) appeared on screen, you will be too late to react but to start anew from the beginning. In fact, I beat the game solely by writing down the key sequence I used to dodge, and beat it on trial and error alone.\n\nI really wanted to say something good about this, but the concept was its only saving grace, which is nowhere near enough for me to recommend a purchase. If you see this on sale with a huge discount, you’ll still be better off with some other game.","June 3","false","9.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

This game is basically that. And that's fine! I like that kind of game. But the controls here kill it.\n\nYou fly through the holes in letters and avoid touching the letters themselves. While you're free to move whereever you want horizontally, there are only two vertical planes: top and bottom. So you can't fly through the center of the letter O; you have to fly around the upper or lower corners of it. So that takes getting used to.\n\nBut the WORST thing, by far, is the camera. The whole game is about lining up your block to make it through the empty spaces. But every time you move, no matter how small of a move it is, the camera violently whips around so you can't see straight. Imagine trying to thread a needle while shaking your head back and forth. It's nigh unplayable when you can't figure out where your block is going in a game about percision.\n\nYou know what would fix this ENTIRE game? Lock the camera behind the cube you control. That way you can actually see what's going on. The way this game is now, it's an unplayable mess.","July 3, 2014","false","0.4"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","1"

Part of the catch is trying to spell out phrases like Rabbit Hole as you sail through letters. How ever, it is very punishing when it comes to colliding with a letter. It is not always easy to quickly choose a path. Even then, you must decide to aim for the needed letters or take the safe way to the next set of words.\n\nThis game is simple but fun and addicting.

Nothing special, but as long as it's not annoying, I'm alright with it.\n\nThe concept of the game where the narrator tells you what to expect is rather intriguing and unique. Doesn't hurt that I have read the story and enjoyed it.\n\nOnly disappointment is how short it was. I didn't expect them to do the game for the whole story, but only eleven and a half minutes?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nickel2sulfate/recommended/283660/","Nickel2sulfate","Nickel II Sulfate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nickel2sulfate/","79 products in account","I think what gets to me more than just an awful game is a game that could NOT have been awful. A game with potential to actually be fun and difficult and full of smooth techno dance music that helps you get into the jam. But this game just wasn't it. I can't say much about a game I've loggeed barely an hour on. But I promise there is a reason for that.\n\nThe premise of Rabbit Hole 3D is similar to games like Velocibox or to some extent Impossible Game, Geometry Dash, and Super Hexagon. They consist of one stagnant object (that you control) juxtaposed with a constantly moving surrounding area. These areas have tons of walls and colors and twists and turns that you as the poor afixed object must dodge while jamming out to hardcore techno. A lot of the times what makes these games so enticing isn't the challenge (and boy, can they be challenging) but the progression of the music as you go deeper and deeper into...the rabbit hole.\n\nA lot of these games are made to be really hard--they're made to keep you pressing to keep going and jamming to that hardcore dubstep. You want to find out what happens next in the song or the space around you. And this time you'll get passed that hard jump...or turn...or whatever it is you just. keep. running. into.\n\nAnd all of the above games I've mentioned would probably be way more fun than Rabbit Hole. Because a lot of the previously mentioned games don't have the one problem that Rabbit Hole DOES have: A shoddy camera.\n\nRabbit Hole's camera is presented behind you almost directly behind the box. You can't really tell your position on the plane--nor the position of the words. Everytime you move the camera jerks disorientingly with you--changing the angle to one that is even harder to differentiate. Am I in front of a hole or a letter?  Will I make it through or will I be forced to fall flat on my face and start ALL the way over? You can move what feels like infinitely left and right--but when it comes to up and down you can only move twice: once up and once down. It just feels awkward. You FEEL like you should be able to move similarly on the y axis as you do the x but you just can't. Why did you do this developer?...Why?...\n\nI've tried to play this game. I've made it maybe four seconds into the song? Hell the songs aren't even that great...or maybe they are and I just can't be bothered to tear my hair out trying to differentate how far off my character is from the L or I!\n\nPerhaps this is a beef I have only...perhaps this game is actually not as disorienting and frustrating as I've made it out to be. But if you really want a well thought out ryhthmy challenge game just get Geometry Dash or Super Hexagon. Because honestly...if you needed to know what happened when Alice went down the rabbit hole you'd have a less frustrating time just reading Lewis Carol's original story.","June 11, 2015","false","1.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While you do this there is a voice telling you bits of story which is the only nice part about this game. The movement and gameplay was just too much of a pain to recommend the game.","December 4, 2015","false","5.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Truth be told, I didn't know what to expect, I likely got the game in a bundle somewhere.\n\nThe idea of this game isn't bad, but the graphics are coarse and unrefined, the music and speech is OK.\n\nHowever, what annoys me most is that the "tutorial" does NOT introduce you to the game. In the game, you move constantly. In the tutorial, you only move after you confirm having set the block (representing Alice apparently).\n\nQuite a difference, especially since the game didn't seem it necessary to inform me of this.","August 1, 2015","false","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The music is is sub par in my opinion, maybe a 3/10 even with all of the music I like to listen to. The gameplay is linear, but the controls are probably the most offputting of all. Sometimes you move 1 space at a time, sometimes you move to the opposite side of the board. I dont know if this is some odd mechanic but one game after the last card I thought I was actually going to get past the first sentance for once, and I tapped up to dodge an E after passing under an H, and hit the top of the E.

The controls are a little jerky, that much is certain. Coupled with the frantic pacing, however, this game transforms from children's read-along to a game that will test the reflexes of even the most seasoned gamers. The best way to describe the difficulty is to liken it to I Wanna Be The Guy and Super Meat Boy- Beating each level is doable, and the frustration that comes from attempting this game is of a fun sort.\n\nNot much else can be said about this. It is a bit of a shame that the game is based around a children's story, as the difficulty is so great that you likely won't see any playing it. Also, a feature to buy audio books as DLC, the ability to adjust the speed, and possibly a feature that would allow the game as an audiobook visualizer are much desired. 6/10.","April 27, 2014","true","1.2"," 24 of 88 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","24","88","0","0"
