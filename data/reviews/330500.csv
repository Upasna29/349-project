The graphics are very nice for a game at this low price point.  More of a puzzle game then action for sure.  I got stuck on where to go as you can see in my first impressions video, but looks like it might easily be worth the money if you enjoy these kind of casual, relaxing games.\n\nIt's a hard game to explain, but you essentially swim around possessing different types of nearby fish as you progress and release captured special "elder fish" by connecting energy lasers in crystal formations that you find.  There doesn't look to be any real threat of death or any enemy fish, its much more of a leisurely exploratory type of game.\n\nNot for everyone, but I think some people will really enjoy this one and it is certainly unique.","February 6","true","0.8"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","0"

Today we feature Blot Interactive’s planktOs and it’s one helluva underwater adventure. That’s what the game is. I can’t describe it any better than that. It’s just very different. For some that will be in a very good way but for others I understand that they may find the game too abstract for their liking. Therefore it’s a work that will divide people. But it is another game that you can essentially relax to and play when you’re stressed.\n\nYou start off as some type of magical being that can cleanse the ocean and the fish. Once you’ve cleansed a part of the surrounds you can take possession – in the demonic form of possession (that’s the best way of describing it, I wouldn’t view it as evil) – and swim to the next part and solve the next puzzle by cleansing that area and taking over the next fish and so on and so forth. Sounds kinda simple and it really is to a certain degree. There’s no tutorial at this stage of the release beyond coral, fish and other things giving you a “LT” and “RT” icons (if you’re using a controller) and because the game is different I was left wondering what I had to do for a few moments but looking at the controls screen gave me a fair idea of what I had to do. In my time with the game I never experienced anything that could kill me – it’s just a relaxing experience\n\nThe graphics and the sound are what you would expect from a soothing experience. In fact, I would argue that planktOs handles underwater graphics better than the vast majority of titles that have come before it. You do feel as though you are under water and that things are moving and swimming around as they should.\n\nThere’s really not a lot more to it than that. I recommend it for those  of you who are looking for a peaceful and unique under water experience.\n\nFor our other reviews and our popular daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/\nTo join in our great community join: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Steamified","February 13","true","3.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","1"
