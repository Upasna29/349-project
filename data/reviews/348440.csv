Some of the things it includes with the two previous Quell games are the amazing level of polish, and the spectacular soundtrack. This game also retains the challenging puzzle aspect of the other games, but manages to add so much new content that it feels like a whole new world.\n\nIn Quell Reflect several new mechanics had been added over the original game, Quell Memento takes those mechanics and multiplies them three-fold. Adding in whole new puzzle types, and at least a half dozen new mechanics, this game is a whole new experience on the old puzzle game we’ve all grown to love.\n\nIt just takes to the second shelf before you start seeing some of the major new mechanics (Illumination), and it does not take long until you start seeing why these can be so challenging!\n\nAnother aspect new to Quell Memento, and one of its strongest components is that the game has added a sort of storyline to it. For the first time in the series the game has a voice over that talks as you reach new stages. This story helps put the entire Quell series into perspective, and gives the game a life of its own. When I first played Quell Memento I was truly touched when I reached the end.\n\nThe Quell series is truly spectacular, and I cannot recommend these games enough, Quell Memento is the final installment in the series, and if you’ve played either of the others, you owe it to yourself to pick this game up today.\n","May 14, 2015","true","0.6"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","15","16","2","0"

The puzzles are not a copy of the old ones\n- This game takes a couple of seconds to start. Something that I rarely noticed in the other games\n\nYou don't need to have played the previous games. You can start with this one.\nIf possible, though, I'd recommend playing the whole collection in the proper order: Quell, Quell Reflection and Quell Memento.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- The levels are well designed with a difficulty going from easy to hard (but not too hard) levels\n- No timer at all\n- You can play as as little as you want and continue where you left off or go back to previous levels to complete unfinished objectives\n- A few levels are hard to finish but a perfect number of moves but there's no penalty for retrying them (there's even an achievement for that!) so you can be persistent or use coins that you obtain by perfecting levels\n- Finding and getting the jewel in every level gives you a different objective. There are also 24 secret levels and the clocks in it\n- Good fun for the price\n\nIt's very well done too:\n- Graphics, music and sound are nice and polished\n- Graphic options work as the should (several fixed resolutions, full screen, windowed mode)\n- Music and sounds can be muted separately\n- Movement can be controlled with keyboard\n- Resetting a level or going to the next one can also be done with keyboard","May 5","true","9.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

If you like a true challenge, where you have to do every move right, but without the pressure of time, definitely get this. Not only that but the artwork, audio, and even the storyline all go together to create what I believe should be considered a masterpiece. The Quell Series just keeps getting better and better, perhaps they will astound me yet again with a fourth ;)","June 19, 2015","true","5.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

If I couldn't solved a level in the optimal number of moves, it was because I screwed up.\n\nIn an effort to add variety, Quell Memento adds a number of new gameplay elements. Some of them work well but many of them don't. Some just add complexity, but not in a good way. It's easy to make an puzzle game with every increasing complexity that is hard to solve. The tricky part is designing something relatively simple, yet so clever that solving it is a challenge.\n\nQuell Memento isn't a bad game, but the first one was much better, so there was no need to make Memento. If you're desperate for some more Quell levels after completing the first two games, then Memento might be for you, otherwise I would suggest giving it a miss.","January 5","false","5.3"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","0"

A various number of newly introduced game-mechanics were sensefully used to design mind-provoking puzzles, that go into deep without being unfair. The presentation of the game is more than professional. No time limits, so you can chillout on the sounds and let your mind do the work. Excellent !\n\nSometimes the music is a little bit too melancholic where it should be more relaxing. The music in the bonus-levels, that are entered over the bronze rings, is like tense drum-tremor - i dont like that. But beyond these two blemishes Quell Memento is an excellent puzzle game for a friendly price !","February 14","true","20.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
