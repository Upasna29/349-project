This game takes the cake. Hidden in Plain Sight is the single best and most fun local co-op game I've ever played out of over 50 that I've bought and tried.\n\nI've had a room full of people cursing at each other, laughing their asses off to tears, and jumping up and down, while at other times the whole room is silent in concentration and suspense, every set of eyes dead-focused on trying not to be caught by the others' - all caused by this wonderfully simple yet strategically genius video game.\n\nGET IT!","June 18, 2015","true","5.7"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","25","27","0","0"

Hidden in Plain Sight is a collection of five minigames, all of which are best played with four players, right there at in the same room as you. They all insanely fun (Ninja Party is my favourite) and rely on you keeping your cool as others try to reveal and capture you, while at the same time, you're trying to capture everyone else.\n\nNinja Party, for example, has 2-4 players all as identical ninjas, amongst 30 other identical ninjas. Each player must either be the last one standing by eliminating the other players, or by touching 5 statues scattered around the room, which play a sound each time they're touched. Do you run straight for all the statues, aiming for a quick win but putting yourself in danger of being noticed? Or do you wait for an unsuspecting player to set off the statue, and slay them from behind?\n\nThis is one of the most fun, if not THE most fun local multiplayer games I've ever played, hands down. This is what multiplayer gaming was about: having fun with REAL PEOPLE, before it all became about leaderboards and strangers from halfway across the world. People that you know; friends, family, whoever. Anyone can play this game, from your pro MLG 360 noscopers to your filthy pleb casuals.\n\nAnd it's so refreshing to see local multiplayer games make a comeback, even if most of them are indie titles. Hidden in Plain Sight is a prime example of a simple and brilliant idea with simple and brilliant excecution. It doesn't fall prey to other indie game tropes such an annoyingly pretentious storyline or an obsession with "unique" and overused gimmicks.\n\nYeah, it might not look a treat, but the graphics really, really don't matter. Same goes for the sound, as most of the time you'll be yelling anyway. The gameplay is incredibly unique, tense, and just insanely fun. It's as simple as that. If you're looking for a local multiplayer game, then buy this. At $5 it's an absolute steal. I cannot recommend it enough.\n\n4.5/5","July 17, 2014","true","5.9"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","24","27","0","0"

This has the same customization options as on other platforms now, which I feel is a must-have addition, since I sometimes feel the need to tweak the settings the way we want to play (for example, I occasionally feel that 3 sniper shots is way too much for Catch a Thief, or I want bots to run as well in Death Race).

The concept behind this game is certainly cool, but core gameplay needs more work. While there are many game modes, the game boils down to some portion of friends are trying to blend in with the computer controlled characters, and the other friends are trying to pick the humans out. Usually picking them out is controlling a cross-hair and having only 3 bullets to do so. The main problem is that picking out the humans is almost random - for most modes there is no easy mechanism to tell who your friends are. When we put this to the test with four friends last night, we got bored because of the randomness - it is surprisingly easy to act like a computer-driven character.\n\nPros:\n+There are different modes of gameplay that are fairly distinct\n+Controller support is good, and there are great ways to 'swap' roles each round\n+Its cheap\n\nCons:\n-The game modes and core design need to be worked out more, some way to make it more competitive\n-Graphics look stock from some game-building program - there is no unifying theme (i.e. skeletons, ninjas, snowmen, and then hand-drawn images etc.)\n-Local co-op only, although this would not be fun online\n\nWhen it comes to local co-op, I'd steer away from this one.","August 22, 2015","false","0.6"," 7 of 27 people (26%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","26","7","27","2","5"

It takes about 3 minutes to understand and is a game about pure psychological mindgames.\n\nThe ninja-mode comes especially recommended, as it possibly has the most tactical decisions involved.\n\nGraphics are indie and remind me of the 16-bit pixelish era, controls simple and responsive - only played with pads - music uncanny.\n\nIf you ever want to play anything with one or more friends next to you and have a blast, there is no triple A-title that will come close to what this gem will deliver.\n\n","March 15, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
