Fun guaranteed.\nGreat ammount  of levels, each unique and harder then one before, with each set of levels completed comes juicy boss fight.\nAnother + is level editor and new levels coming out every week so you dont get bored ^^\nNothing special to say about graphic and sound, its just ok for this type of game.\nGame is easy to get and start playing for beginers, but will require a skill to master it.\n\nOverall:\nA fun casual game with reasonable price, will give you enough of good play time for that money.\nRecommended to everyone above age of 10","September 3, 2015","true","3.0"," 26 of 36 people (72%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","72","26","36","5","0"

These are the types of critters that one would expect to find wandering around aimlessly in a flower bed, through grassy planes, or even in a lightly wooded forest area. However, as I said, the player has a choice, and that choice may lead the player into causing a certain and painful death. Either intentionally, or even quite possibly accidentally. The player may choose to throw these critters onto spikes, into fire hazards, within a bolt of lightning, cause death due to falling, or the player’s choice of small to large buzzsaws can be utilized as well. I really think the developer watched one too many “Saw” movies.\n\nCute Things Dying Violently is created by ApathyWorks. The game has 60 pre-designed levels. However, with the integration of Steam Workshop and a Level Editor, the potential amount of levels is pretty limitless. This game is heavily integrated onto the Steam PC platform, and as such it also possesses Steam Trading Cards and Steam Achievements. The developer truly went all in, on the Steam platform. Another nice feature is the weekly challenge through the level of the week format from the main menu.\n\nClick the link below to read the full Review:\nhttp://www.gamerheadlines.com/reviews/cute-things-dying-violently/","October 11, 2015","true","5.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

The controls are easy, left click to move your critter around, right click to throw it.\n\nI really suggest that you choose the inverted option because if your critters are on too low, you won`t be able to have them fly hard enough, it takes a little while to\n\nadjust moving your cursor up to have them go up I must say but it will make your life so much easier.\n\nGame play is basic, you need to save at least 1 critter to beat the level, to do this, they must enter the elevator waiting for them. Sounds easy right? Not so fast. You will find obstacle blocking your path, buzzsaw, fire, solid block, spikes. You will have to use switches, springs and everything not tied down to help you get out.\n\nFor achievement hunters, you`ll find 23 of them and to get that mischievous complete game, you will have to ace all of the levels in this game, I.E. complete each level with the minimum death allowed.\n\nJust because of that, there is replay ability and on top of that, you get a Level of the week and Steam Workshop support to add player created levels.Level editor is also in the game so no need to download another app to do it.\n\nFinal thought: If you like this genre of game, get it and you`ll be happy with your purchase.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_YVG0XruCM&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=bobv702000","October 5, 2015","true","4.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seranth/recommended/305820/","Seranth","Seranth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seranth/","1189 products in account","A decent puzzle game where you try and flick things to the exit. The closest thing I can think of is a cross of lemmings and golf.\n\nIt's annoying that there isn't a setting to keep the mouse cursor inside the window in windowed mode. Once your cursor moves outside your flick gets messed up so you need to up the sensitivity and try to keep your mouse inside when flicking. And because they don't let you move the camera the objects are almost always near the edge of the screen.\n\nNon-16:9 resolution options are 'broken' in the sense that you can't move the camera so parts of the screen are cut off. It only matters in the wider stages. For example, in stage 2-3 you can't see the button that will stop the fan (so the level is impossible). For another example, in stage 2-7 the creature can walk offscreen and part of a button is offscreen).\n\nThe aim trajectory guide isn't 100% accurate but is passable. However, it can get really terrible in certain circumstances.\n\nIn order to unlock the next set of puzzles, you're forced to complete all 7 and then beat the boss (level 8). I think that requirement shouldn't be there or it should be relaxed (complete half the puzzles and boss to progress). It's a puzzle game so it's easy to gate people from seeing all the mechanics that are introduced. There are a lot of things introduced in the second set and I'm guessing a lot of casual puzzle players will have trouble. There are six sets of 8 puzzles to try in the main mode so if you get stuck on a puzzle on the second set you miss out on over half the game. They offer 'level of the week' and user-made levels so if you can't progress at least you can try alternative levels.\n\nI'm not really a fan of puzzle games but if you want a more polished game that has a similar basic premise (get the guy to the exit), you can try something like Eets Munchies. However, I'm not sure there is another game that does this exact premise. If you like the premise but care about any of the problems above you may want to wait for an update. These problems seem like they could be fixable so you might want to wait and see if the developer changes anything.","October 4, 2015","false","2.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
