"http://steamcommunity.com/id/V36a/recommended/225640/","V36a","Viper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/V36a/","401 products in account","Personal opinion: Get this game instead of Sacred 3 if you're looking for an Action RPG!\n\nMy first impression playing this game back in 2010 was pretty special. I started a Dryad (hey, they looked hot and I love Druids) and watched the fairly epic cinematic, after which I was placed on a beach with a kind of a mentor beside me. I guess the gods didn't smile upon him on that day though, because somehow I ended up having to tutor myself. First thing I noticed when gaining control was the graphics. One word. Wow. They are incredible, and the attention to detail is pretty much un-parallelled. Leaves being side swept, a little bird making his nest - hundreds of small things that leave you with a warm and fuzzy feeling inside. Even now in 2014, it still looks great.\n\nI still have that Dryad - but I specced her so badly that she is broken beyond repair. I highly recommend using the Sacred 2 Wiki for help with builds. There is no respec option, and if you find yourself wanting to play it all the way to Niob, your spec pretty much needs to be perfect.\n\nThe sound is good as well, although the voice acting is bad. Not terribad but bad enough that you treasure the fact that only the main quests have voiced dialogue.\n\nMoving on; most of the classes in the game are innovative and fresh. Whoever saw an ancient Egyptian-inspired Anubis-like robot thingie before as a class? Packing an alien blaster along with his hammer no less. Very fresh, very fun. You diversify a bit by choosing a god and one of two campaigns (good or evil), which adds a good deal of replayability. Rather annoyed by the fact that you can't select gender for the classes though. Some years ago I never touched any female class, for some reason. Thankfully I outgrew it, or I would have missed out on half of this game.\n\nThe story is fairly weak, but the focus doesn't really lie there either, as it gives you hundreds of side quests left and right. In fact there are so many, I find myself skipping half of them. Many of them are kind of like MMO quests in a sense. Very generic; a silly story behind it and mediocre rewards. But it works, somehow. In one early side quest though, you are pitted against the game's first boss. This was a pleasant surprise - as once you engage a boss monster, the camera centers on the boss and the game spits out some cool music. He took a serious pounding too, so it was a good moment.\n\nThe map is gigantic; as far as I know it has the biggest world in an action RPG, ever. I have still not explored everything after well over 100 hours of play (played it on a disc version most of the time), and there are several optional bosses where you can see how good (or bad) your build is. Bosses can be incredibly punishing, but they are also a lot of fun. Keep your thumb on the spacebar.\n\nThe difficulty level when playing Bronze is extremely easy the first 2-3 hours. I considered re-starting several times and selecting Silver instead. But it's gotten more challenging. This really depends on the class and spec you want to play. I have one character in Platinum; a Seraphim, and I still find the class a lot of fun. I have chosen to spec her both with Sword / Shield and Ranged (for BeeEffGee). This'll likely hurt me quite a bit if I reach Niob, but for now it works well. I like being able to change things up now and then.\n\nMultiplayer is dead, unfortunately. Seems Ascaron went and got themselves bankrupt, and was forced to shut down their US servers. EU servers still worked when I started playing it back in 2010, but I believe they are shut down as well.\n\nAll in all though, great game. Sort of a diamond in the rough but if you can see past some bugs, crashes and general hiccups, you may find yourself in love with this game, like me. I've played it for about 120 hours; I am on my third version of the game now, and after experiencing just one in-game crash in 14 hours of playing, I can finally, after many years, recommend this game. On the previous versions it probably crashed between 2-300 times in 100 hours of playing.\n\nSince I wrote the review the game has crashed 7 times in 28 hours of play. Still not too bad, considering I've had PhysX enabled all that time.","February 18, 2014","true","28.2"," 213 of 238 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","213","238","0","10"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Angel9RakouCobra/recommended/225640/","Angel9RakouCobra","Angel.9 Rakou Cobra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Angel9RakouCobra/","3592 products in account","Sacred 2 is a Diablo-style action RPG set in a truly massive world. Its largest selling point is probably just that – this game is almost excessively huge. Sacred 2 features an incredible world packed with nearly 600 quests and a sprawling map that you’ll be unlikely to have seen even a quarter of in 20 hours. Every building is able to be entered (many with multiple floors), every NPC speaks, and most containers have loot stashed away in them. As typical of the genre, Sacred 2 offers multiple difficulties to unlock for even more replayability.\n\nLooting is another huge draw – practically every enemy will drop loot, all with different stats and colorations. If one enemy doesn’t drop anything, you’ll soon have another 10 or more on screen anyway. Monsters, animals, and humanoids alike creep in every corner, waiting to swarm your character. To cope with this, you’re given a wide range of distinctly different player characters, each with an array of different armor, weaponry, special moves, and unique mounts (although all may buy horses as well).\n\nCombat is fast, though oftentimes mindless, fun. No matter the character, you’re always open to many ways to play, from magic, to ranged, to multiple forms of melee (sword & shield, dual wielding, axes, clubs, etc.). Your mount, whether unique to your class or a horse, also opens up another combat style with its own unique stats and, for some, attacks. Enemies range from normal humans to mythical beasts such as harpies and werewolves, each with variations in stats, attacks, and appearances, guaranteeing you’ll have plenty of new monsters to slay your entire journey.\n\nSacred 2’s saving grace to the argument of it being “just another clone” is that it’s already fully aware of being a clone filled with various clichés. The game doesn’t take itself seriously; one moment you have men in bunny suits attacking you, another moment you’re fending off mutated sheep who’ve decided you should be food instead. Sacred 2 plays on its light-hearted silliness with quests such as those, jokes galore (cemeteries house plenty in particular), and fourth wall breaking moments – for instance, the Seraphim is fully aware she can’t proceed without the player and will make her grievances known quite vocally if you leave her standing alone for a short while. This both saves it from coming across as a simple clone and gives it plenty of character of its own.\n\nIt has its flaws, like all games. The biggest irritant might possibly be its camera, which attempts to be both isometric and standard 3rd person at the same time, often leading to it spiraling around awkwardly. Another point to make is not necessarily a flaw, but could be a massive turn off for some: the bright colors, voice acting, and purposeful ridiculousness of Sacred 2 could easily put off someone looking for a serious RPG, or possibly come across as poor quality before it becomes more apparent the game is using its clichés as a joke.\n\nOverall, I’d happily recommend it to fans of Diablo style games, particularly those who love to explore, as you’ll have a lot to see, and hours and hours of combat-filled gameplay. Sacred 2 is truly an overlooked gem.","December 12, 2013","true","22.5"," 132 of 138 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","132","138","0","7"

If you purchase t his game, you should make sure that you search for, and download the community patch.   You can also download a community addon patch, and there are some other mods out there.   I'd also highly recommend taking a look at the sacred 2 characters, their skills, and possibly  some guides on how to build them.    You can play through with any character in this game, but if you build them wrong, you will pay for it at higher difficulty levels.\n\nThis is a very good action RPG/Hack N Slash.   It is a huge, beautiful, open ended world.   The graphics are incredible if you turn the settings to maximum.   The world is a living breathing world, like other reviewers have said, there are lots of small things like birds building nests, people talking to each other in towns,  etc in the game that make it feel alive.   If you have a Nvidia card with physx (however it is spelled), leaves will blow around and react to your spells.   This happens in all environments like in dungeons.\n\nIgnore the warning about not being optimized for WIndows 7 PCs.   IF you google Sacred 2 crashing windows PC, you'll get a guide on how to create a shortcut that has a few command line options enabled, while also changing the shortcut to run the game in windows xp SP3 compatibility mode.   If you do that you should be fine.   The game also frequently auto saves when you teleport or change areas, so in the even of a crash, just load the game back up and you'll be right where you left off.\nIf you have played this game on a console and are wondering if its worth purchasing on the PC, the answer is yes.  The expansion pack is included in this PC version, and with the community patch you can unlock Christmas island.   You also get a carrier imp included with the gold package which helps store extra inventory.\n\nIf you download Tunngle beta (Free) you can play this with your friends CO-Op.\n\nEndless loot, endless enemies, endless hack n slash action RPG adventure goodness.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nobody1441/recommended/225640/","Nobody1441","Nobdy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nobody1441/","101 products in account","So a friend recommended this game to me while, by chance, he noticed it was 80% off. Never bought a better 5$ game. I am not, or have ever been, a big fan of Diablo style games. I just kind of missed that train. But this game broke my pre-concieved ideas about it in just the first few hours.\n\nThe world is pretty rich and just when I thought I was making progress on the map, I discovered I had only uncovered a dot of it. Every level, while comes slower than my personal taste, gives back benefits you can see each time, rather than a ton of levels all the time with hardly anything to show for each one. Another one of the games strong points is customization. Oh man the customization. It's not as intimidating as 'Path of Exile' (a Diablo-style game I tried), though a tad confusing at first. Even with reading up I still had that "trash first character" with my points being in places that were less than helpful. The 'runes' you get to increase your skills are pretty abundant as well, but not always with the ones you need, which can be solved by trading in 1-4 runes of any kind to pick the one you want, increasing your power at a good pace (for a small fee). Combine all that with a rich world, much like Skyrim, open and with entirely too much to do, with so much exploring to do, and you've got a game that will have your style of play, with the story and pacing that you want.\n\nHowever the game's not perfect. Some annoying things like having to drop items and pick them back up to stack them, certain moves having a hard time targeting an enemy making you dance in place until you find that sweet spot, and not having a very clear chart of where your stats are coming from (though it does list which ones you have, just not if it's on your gear, temporary effect, etc). But if you aren't terribly anal about little bumps in the road, it's a great game to buy.\n\n8.5/10, just a step bellow 9 for the minor issues.","October 25, 2014","true","44.8"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","31","34","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bronzekey/recommended/225640/","Bronzekey","Bronze Key","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bronzekey/","73 products in account","This is probably my all-time favorite Isometric loot Pinata Action RPG (i.e "Diablo clone" - you can see now why most people prefer that term).   Set in a huge, beautiful Elder Scrolls-like open world, it is immediately set apart from its contemporaries in other ways as well - some good, some bad, some simply arbitrary.\n\nThe Good - The character customization/development is second to none compared to others in the genre, the loot/gear is extensive (the armor sets look incredible for the most part) and the art style is impeccable.  The world is varied and interesting, really a joy to explore as it is handcrafted with all kinds of cool side areas and vignettes waiting to be discovered.\n\nAs far as I know this is the only game in its genre to have mounts, and they are badass.  Starting off, every class has access to various types of horse, but soon can acquire unique class mounts (like the Seraphim's Tiger or the Dryad's Lizard) and later several advanced horse-types (flaming horse, unicorn, war horse) to ride and fight on.  Did I say fight on? Yes - this game has mounted combat and it's really not much different from the usual bipedal mob-mowing method. In fact, my shadow warrior fights exclusively on his Hellhound (while in the overworld, at least - in dungeons and other subterranean locales you have to hoof it the old fashioned way)\n\n\nThe Bad - It suffers in a few areas that may matter more to others than myself - such as the writing - and although many quests are genuinely interesting, no one reads text any more. The actual "plot" is fairly abysmal and sparse but hey, this is a Diablo clone - we just want to click and kill and get loot.  Many game mechanics are not explained properly in-game so research or an experienced friend are recommended.\n\nThe "Could go Either Way" - While the classes are, as always, unique and cool - they are still gender locked (as Sacred 1 was).  I personally hate this approach to class design but I put up with it because these games are so damned great.  The classes aren't as appealing to me as Sacred's were (where's the vampiress? she was awesome)  Also the voice work is inconsistent - but that is merely a minor complaint.  The game is a bit "old school" with a lack of respec and the ability to totally bork your character development, so lots of rerolls are in store for a new player.\n\nThe usual Diablo-type mechanics are also thrown a bit on their heads in some cases, which may discomfort those taking the 'clone' portion of the genre name for granted.  There are no skill trees, but a set of skills you can learn from a pool (and put points into every level, up to 200 or so i think) that provide passive bonuses.  This is the open-ended aspect of character development here, taking a cue from the elder scrolls series; which skills you select and level shape your toon's flavor.\n\nThe "active' skills, called Combat Arts or CAs; come as runes, loot that drops from enemies that you can 'eat' to improve each one's power. They can range from healing spells to gap closers to AOE attacks, etc. All the usual abilities we are accustomed to in ARPGs.  Like sacred 1, eating lots of runes increases not only their power but their cooldown time as well (which can be countered in many ways including the aforementioned skills) so there is a balancing game with power vs spammability.  Path of Exile took a version of this concept for use in their gem-based skill system, highlighting Sacred's influence and innovation.\n\nThe Lowdown - Although the multiplayer servers were shut down, one can still play through a tunnelling service such as hamachi or Tunngle and I suggest someone try to utilize these as I'm looking for people to play with!  Despite its age I still feel like the graphics are among best in class for the Diablo Clone/loot ARPG genre.  The soundtrack (done by the band Blind Guardian) is a bit different for the genre - a power metal vibe to it, also giving you gentle pastoral pieces that help keep the fantasy cohesion intact.  Also each character class has its own flavor of battle music!  There are so many little details- evidence of the developer love that was put into this game - that it breaks my heart it never caught on as much as some other, less-deserving titles have.\n\nAlso to note - for some reason, the screenshots in the steam store page are all stretched-out looking and strange.  The game looks way better than that in motion lol.  I recommend the community patch (now v.0105 or something) and the camera mod if that is not already included, but otherwise I use no other mods.","May 28, 2015","true","85.8"," 31 of 35 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","31","35","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/angrytigerp/recommended/225640/","angrytigerp","Angrytiger [USN IRL]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/angrytigerp/","738 products in account","When the point-and-click genre finds itself bereft of recent hits, Sacred 2 is a breath of fresh air, albeit with the slightest of bad odors..\n\nBy no means is it a perfect game. It's got a painfully complex UI that will probably be confusing to you for the first 5 or so hours, especially as you unlock whatever skill/items go in whatever slot and you're like "oh, so THAT'S what that was for..."\n\nThat said, it's a competent isometric along the same lines as Titan Quest, the Diablo franchise, Path of Exile, etc. Actually, let's just say Titan Quest, because realistically, this game is NOT a skill-spamming, screen-exploding, 24/7 fireworks-esque carnagefest like Diablo. Most of your actual fighting is with the weapons of the game, with skills supplementing rather than replacing it. Much like Diablo 3, Sacred 2 shrugs off convoluted skill trees with skills that grow redundant over time; instead, it adds in secondary effects that can tweak your skills. Depending on your class selection (of which there's 6, or rather 7 as if you're reading this you'll get the expansion if you buy via steam), you get a fairly normal spread of buffs, debuffs, single-target and AoE skills to use.\n\nOr rather... okay, rewind a bit. You acquire "Combat Arts". This is what the game calls skills/spells/whatever. These are your on-call abilities for damage, utility, and defensive purposes. Unlike most other RPGs, Sacred 2 doesn't have mana, or energy, or what have you; instead, each Combat Art has its own unique cooldown, with a small global cooldown for all abilities on top of that. This means you can theoretically use the same CA all game, if you felt so inclined, with the only limit on casting being its cooldown. Cooldown is affected by factors such as armor weight, with the heaviest armor reducing CA cooldowns, and lighter, more... breathable caster-oriented gear actually giving you a cooldown DECREASE; specific stats reducing cooldown that is an affix/prefix to gear; through points into the Stamina stat; or through the use of relevant skills.\n\nNow "Skills", as Sacred 2 views them, are actually a series of passive buffs that have their own progression (no having to wonder whether to give yourself +stat or more damage for that one spell you like). This is one of those convoluted systems I mentioned. See, you get this page full of assignable skills (assigned to get their effects, mind you, no other interaction required). They do all sorts of stuff -- buff damage with certain weapon types, increase status effect chance, gain new gameplay aspects (smith your own stuff out in the field, see what items will cost without having to be at a merchant, ride better horses (yes, there's mounts, and the world is huge so it's kind of necessary)). Think of these as perks, in a sense, with most being passive buffs, but a few unlocking key features -- everything from the utility skill Alchemy letting you use one-time temporary buff items, or the weapon specific Magic Staff skill giving you the ability to fire ranged magic attacks (without at least one level of this skill, you'll just bash enemies over the head with the staff, no matter how magical your character actually is). There's a set limit to the number of skills you can choose (note that Combat Arts are separate, and you could theoretically level EVERY CA if you wanted).\n\nSkills also, in addition to these catch-all generics, contain class-specific skills that buff one Combat Art Tree or another (of which classes have 3) with damage, duration, cooldown, and so on. It isn't just raw buffs, however -- you need these CA skills to level your individual Combat Arts (if you've played Titan Quest or Grim Dawn, just think about how you need to consciously level up your Mastery to unlock skills). And Combat Arts are actually acquired in a really roundabout way -- rather than 95% of other ARPGs, you don't gain points to distribute upon leveling up; instead, you have to find Runes, consume-on-use items that increase your Combat Arts by one point. Let me emphasize -- there is no such thing as "end-game" CAs, because you could feasibly find ANY CA as a rune at any one time. Unfortunately, you can only level CAs so far before needing -- you guessed it -- points in the Skill for that Combat Art -- still with me? Also, you have to have self-control, because leveling increases EVERYTHING about the CA, including cooldown timer. So you might quickly find yourself pouring runes into a skill, then realize you're missing the cooldown-reduction, late-game gear, or points in the Combat Art's governing skills, that would make using it at that level feasible.\n\nThe aforementioned CA modifications are actually a binary system, where you have three points of upgrade for each Combat Art. Once you put a certain amount of points into the Skill governing that Combat Art's tree, you get an option to upgrade one of your 'discovered' Combat Arts. This modification is usually a choice between something like damage vs. status. It's not a huge difference, but its effect stacks with the baseline increases of leveling that Combat Art via runes, and offers some degree of customization.\n\nOn level up, in addition to a few skill points (and a new skill slot unlocked every few levels per a set formula), you get to choose from 6 stats to put a point in. I'm not gonna run them all down (as review space is precious), but it ranges from health and health regen out-of-battle (Vitality) to chance to hit (Dexterity) to cooldown for Combat Arts (Stamina). Fairly normal RPG spread, really.\n\nEquipment-wise, the game is pretty generous. You've got a full spread of torso, legs, feet, arms, shoulders, and more; varying amounts of rings and necklaces (per character class); a few unique things like "Batteries" for the Temple Guardian (basically a cybernetic Anubis sort of robot thing). There are a LOT of places to fill on the inventory screen. On the High Elf I'm playing right now, alone, I've got 4 rings, 2 amulets, torso, legs, feet, arms, hands, shoulders, and I'm pretty sure I'm missing some without opening the game to look. It's crazy, really.\n\nAll that said, there are downfalls to the game. Its graphical interface is, as mentioned, clunky, not to mention has very odd choices (transparencies everywhere, lots of ill-defined edges on UI elements, etc.) Animations are... okay, but not anything to drop your jaw at. Same thing with general appearance -- it looks fine, but it's not an eye-candy sort of game. The earliest few hours, on top of overloading you with stats and numbers and mechanics, will also be very slow, as a lack of skill variety (until you find the appropriate runes, of course) and a painfully-slow movement speed before you start getting mounts will make the game a tiring slog.\n\nAnd boy, howdy, is the voicework friggin' painful. The game does NOT take itself too seriously outside of the specific story arc, so you've got stuff like enemies going "Arrrggh! I was... just an... extra..." or 'pirate' enemies going "I guess you weren't such a landlubber after all..." Your character spews an unhealthy amount of lines, ranging from generic hero stuff ("You would dare hit a High Elf?") to... 4th-wall breaking stuff ("Ugh, can we remove animals from the spawn table, please?") Very fortunately, an option in the menu enables drastically, or even completely, reducing this commentary (that's even what the menu calls it), so that's an option if it gets a bit much for you.\n\nBesides the general usability of the game, though, the multi-tiered depth of character-building is a great change of pace from certain games that railroad your builds (-cough- Diablo 3), without forcing something like having to min/max a billion different passive buffs (-cough- Path of Exile). If nothing else, there's a demo available (if not here, then on the internet in general). Check it out, try to tolerate its rough edges, and you'll get a fairly competent and fun game, worth at least one or two replays.","March 11, 2015","true","51.8"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","29","32","3","0"

If you are burned out from other Action RPG games such as Diablo 3, this game will definitely be fun for you. I recommend getting the community patch to fix some crucial bugs as this game is not supported by the developer anymore. Online gameplay has been taken down some years ago aswell, but LAN is still possible obviously.\n\nHowever, if you reach level 50+ in this game (usually by the time you finish the campaign for the first time on silver difficulty), xp gain really slows down a hell lot, so I recommend tweaking balance.txt xp gain by x10 multiplier to keep the game somewhat motivating.\n\nOther than that it's a well designed game, the classes are very different from each other and deliver extremly solid character development and the loot system is very rewarding and motivating, even if the sets don't change from level 15 to 200 (max) they just gain higher stats which makes a 2nd, respectively third playthrough rather obsolete. The sound / voice acting in this game is brilliant and the enemies have some humourous / hillarious lines whenever you encounter / beat them. The heroes itself have witty and cheesy lines upon accepting quests / defeating bosses / hordes of mobs.\n\nAlthough the quests are as simple as they could be (fetch me X of Y, go talk to Z) and the story being basically only a plot device to advance through the land, the world is very big and you can explore a hell lot of content.\n\nI do recommend buying this game, if you want a fun timesink and like tinkering around with builds and combat arts (plenty of them available).","June 25, 2015","true","43.7"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"

Others have pointed this out but it's easy fixed. It moves for you at the worst angles.

Full disclosure, I own multiple copies of the game, including a PC version that is not on Steam, and a 360 version that I have put hundreds of hours into. Sacred 2 is the game that I compare all other isometric ARPGs to, and none have come close to its perfection for me yet.\n\nWhat makes Sacred 2 unique? Addicting? More memorable than others in its genre? Well, a couple of things. First off, it's crystal clear to anyone who has played the game for more than a dozen hours that the game is an absolute labor of love from a development team that has a love for details. The genre is not too well known for in-depth storylines or crazy memorable characters, and while Sacred 2 admittedly does little to change this, what the game does better than others in its genre is build a breathable, diverse, varied world full of detail. For video gamers who consider themselves explorers by nature (*raises hand*), Sacred 2 is an unparalleled heaven. The game map is 22 square miles (larger even than Just Cause 2's massive map) and can easily intimidate or overwhelm new players with the massive amount of things to explore and do. Many large games fall into the trap of having large expanses of nothing, or not very detailed areas of interest due to the map simply being large to take up space; Sacred 2 rarely falls into this trap. Each of the game's 42 cities is architecturally different or geographically unique. There are hidden areas of the map (including cities) that can only be accessed by traveling through cave systems. Each home in each city is decorated in the sense that it actually appears lived in (papers left strewn over desks, decorations unique to various homes, etc.). So while yes, Sacred 2 has one of the largest game worlds ever created, it doesn't feel as if you're treading through repetitive territory. This is a game for people looking to explore, find secrets, hidden treasures and areas, etc.\n\nSacred 2 has a sense of humor that will be either hit or miss depending on your personality. Characters (both yours and enemies) have hilarious or corny one liners while fighting that change depending on who (or what) you're fighting. Delightfully over-dramatic rock music plays when an enemy catches sight of you and engages combat. The massive amount of enemies that try to fight you sometimes overwhelm the screen and make me laugh due to the simple ridiculousness of it all (or, it's also humorous to me if I'm running from combat for whatever reason and have a following of over a dozen enemies, for example). Depending on what class you choose, your character's personality can change, and she/he can have different responses to quests because of how she/he feels about the situation. Sacred's world is highly detailed and full of lore, but it's not afraid to let loose and have humor, and I love that.\n\nMultiple playthroughs can yield drastically different playstyles, and multiple playthroughs of even the same class can bring newness that few others in the genre offer. Sacred 2 offers so many upgrade paths and skill trees (all of which are impossible to pursue in one playthrough, even within one class) that it can, quite frankly, be overwhelming to a new player. Leveling up in this game grants you so many options that you probably are best off seeking a tutorial or guide to make sure you know what you're doing and where you want your character to go. After you "get it," though, you get it...and you're set for life.\n\nWhat are some of Sacred 2's problems? Like mentioned earlier, the game is simply massive, and gives you so many options that your first playthrough is bound to be full of errors in judgment on leveling among other things. Also, the use of element weaknesses is crucial to the game, and renders some bosses nearly impossible unless you have the right set up for a fight. The game requires some light work to get to work on any system after Vista (update your PhysX and DirectX, both found handily in your Sacred 2 Steam folder, and everything should work fine for 99% of people). The game also suffers from occasional glitches (sometimes bodies of enemies flip around, quest markers "stick" to the map until you re-select another quest). The game has no loading screens (Edit: This is apparently just a glitch that happens to me; the game has the same loading screens as the 360 version), and so it can make new players scared that it has frozen and crashed when it has not (the screen freezes for a few seconds before loading up the new area). On the plus side, I'm running Sacred 2 on a non-gaming laptop on low settings, and it looks beautiful and loads like a charm in mere seconds.\n\nIn summary, I adore this game. It has set such high standards in a genre that I love that I find myself disappointed in other games whose feats pale in comparison. It took the development team over four years to work on this massive project (and even longer to port it over to consoles) that they declared bankruptcy, and the only good thing about that is that you can tell this game was immensely cherished by those who slaved over it. (For those of you who don't already know, the critically panned Sacred 3 was not developed by the same people and is not really considered a true successor of the franchise to fans of the original Sacred and Sacred 2.) I don't have enough room to write all of the good things about this game that I'd like to, so I'll end this here. Moral of the story: if you enjoy isometric ARPGs, you owe it to yourself to at least try this game.","April 12","true","34.3"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","7"

What I do like is there are many different ways to customize your character using skills, runes, buffs, armor enhancements, and even special weapons.  This is also a very loot-heavy game.  Unlike Kingdoms of Amalur, the combat is very hack-n-slash.  So what's left is the quests and anything off the main path is really substandard.  "Go deliver this letter", "Go kill this guy", "My cat ran into a cave" etc.  They are godawful, much like Amalur's side quests.  Unforunately you need to do then to get those sweet level-ups.  :(  It seems like a single player MMO much like Amalur did so if you like that game you may enjoy this one.

More open world, the better. I enjoy involved locales, scenic vistas, random quests which are not part of the main quest.\n\nSacred 2 has all of these things. As well as a complicated, involved character-building system, allowing you to customize your class from top to bottom. It's an ARPG, which involves more hack and slash than story, and I think that's a better side of "adventure" than long, drawn out speeches.\n\nThat being said, I didn't find this game entertaining. Don't get me wrong, the game has all of these things. In spades. There's more packed into this game than the last four or five I've played. And the control scheme and game play is almost identical to one of my old favorites, the original Dungeon Siege, as well as NWN1.\n\nI just felt that as of the beginning, there was no real motivation aside from "level" and "loot" which takes me to the next region. I'm not talking themepark handholding. There are some bad mechanics at play here; like outleveling content and quests far before you've finished even a third of them. I'm still killing critters about 2-3 levels below me, forcing me to just walk off from 5 active quests to get into something a bit more challenging.\n\nSecondarily, the "dungeon crawling" wasn't really done with anything interesting in most of the dungeons. Very few traps, no real reason to be there, just lots of slaughter and walking bags of XP and treasure. There was very little lore involved, so it's not like you're in "The Chaves of Chaos" or something, you're just in "RandomCave4332". There is some good humor here and there, and I can tell PnP players made this game. But aside from the few grave stones and a random floaty message, there's just.. something missing from these areas to make me WANT to explore them.\n\nI'll probably come back to this in time and re-evaluate, but my initial 8 hours leaves me sort of wanting a reason (aside from the 1 minute cutscene at the beginning of the game) with what I'm doing, the places I'm visiting. Dungeon Siege sort of left you with a sense of wonder at seeing the lost dwarven caverns, crawling through the swamps of sadness or whatever.\n\nThis game is far more open world than most ARPGs, but has far less personality than many I've played. This is probably sacrilege to some, I just felt the mechanics were great, but the overall theme and feel left me wanting something with substance.","August 15, 2014","false","8.2"," 43 of 71 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","43","71","0","0"

Many quests are still buggy, some of them can be resolved usually by reloading a save game but others are more messy, especially one quest I personally just failed (Hunting Fever 1) which was to kill 31 specific monsters within 10 minutes, normally that would be easy enough if there was actually enough of those monsters to kill in that time limit! I found 11..smh\n\nIn a nut shell, Sacred 2 could have been a really awesome ARPG, I personally think it could have been one of the very best if it wasn't rushed to market.  There are many positive aspects, but the bugs, pathing issues and camera issues can really cause serious problems and that is the reason why I'm not recommending this game,   its a shame really because even by todays standards - I still think its better than Diablo 3 and thats saying something.\n\nARPG fans can pick up this game for practically nothing these days, and if anyone has free time to burn then honestly, I'd still recommend giving this a play through, there is a massive gameworld to explore - literally 10x larger than all the Diablo series combined, granted that size and the amount of side quests added to the amount of bugs in the end but still, the games main quest lines are usually bug free at least...usually.\n\n+ Large open world\n+ tons of items and customization\n\n- Very buggy\n- Possible to lose progress due to crashes\n- Possible to lose your save game entirely due to corruption\n- Pathing problems\n- Poor camera angles\n- Dead Multiplayer (can be played with 3rd party programs)\n\n* As a note, Sacred 2 is no longer working to constant crashing on start up (Setup managers phase) which has been a known problem for years -","March 3","false","44.5"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","17","24","0","0"

Even though there are countles forum posts and youtube videos claiming they have a way of fixing random crashes - none of the "fixes" actually work on a x64 system (which is pretty much any PC that's not 10+ years old).\n\nAnd even if you're lucky not to bump into any major crashes (some people can't even start the game) - there's always the core bug that makes the game crash 100% when it reaches aprox 1,3-1,5 Gb of RAM. It's the way the game is coded and if running on a x64 system it WILL crash due to the way it handles RAM allocation for game assets. There is no way around it.\n\nAt one point there was even a "4gb ram" fix which just breaks the .exe file nowadays so even that's not an option any more.\n\nIt's so sad since the game looks brilliantly, feels epic and the maps are HUGE and insanely detailed with amazing eyecandy effects.\n\nSo - if you're planing on playing Sacred 2 - get a x86 OS, preferably WinXP/7 because apart from crashes and mashing your head against the table - you won't have much fun :(","May 10","false","6.7"," 21 of 34 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","21","34","0","2"

I will explain why.\n\nI have been a huge fan of the first one, i've completed the game on multiple characters, with most of the classes and told most of my friends about this awesome game called ''Sacred''.\n\nSo several years later I was browsing the internet and found that the second one was released since a while. Few weeks later, luckily it got into a bundle! What a perfect occasion to buy this game which looked better than the first right? I was wrong.\n\nThis game as quite a few bad things about it that wasn't in the first... The quest pathing is horrible, I kept getting lost and I had to reload/ check the map several times. The game dosen't run smoothly at all. The camera... Even with a lot of custom settings I gave up, it looks weird, either follows you around and switch angles or just gets stuck. Also I've read many people have issues with Nvidia graphics, such as crashes, personally I don't recall crashing but It feels a bit laggy.\n\nThe graphics looks fine. The combat, item system and rune system is just as good as the firstl! You could easily like this game, i'm not saying it's bad, I am really sad because of all those issues I encountered. I will probably try it again one day, I want to like this game, but for now I still really prefer the first one... I just cannot recommend this to a friend, I would recommend Sacred 1 instead.\n\nI doubt the developers would patch a game that came out 6+ years ago but if they could make the camera any better, it would make the game so much more enjoyable.","February 23, 2014","false","9.2"," 38 of 67 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","38","67","0","8"

None of the areas are randomly generated, and the entire map (not including the numerous subterranean dungeons littered here and there) spans over 22 square miles of real-world distance. In a nutshell: it's freaking huge. Navigation in the overworld is seamless, and load times during transitions to the underground are very brief. All of the terrain is packed with detail and different regions have their own unique climates, inhabitants, and land features. Also, the characters, monsters, and other elements look excellent.\n\nSacred 2: Fallen Angel screenshot\n\nOne of the downsides, which will likely be fixed with patches, is the game's general bugginess. There are times when the pop-up map disappeared completely, making it damn tedious to navigate. Sometimes clicking on people to speak with them had no effect whatsoever, and certain actions would yield sounds but no visual or gameplay effects. In one instance, a crucial item required to proceed in the main quest was not where it was supposed to be, making it impossible to proceed. Occasionally, the direction indicator that points to the next main object disappeared completely. Most of these issues were remedied by quitting and reloading the game, but they were a nuisance when they arose.\n\nA hack-and-slash RPG quest of massive proportion, Sacred 2 caters to the throng of players who are anxiously awaiting the eventual release of Diablo III. PC gamers who've been salivating over the prospect of the next Diablo will undoubtedly seek temporary solace in the familiar gameplay found in Sacred 2 and be willing to turn a blind eye to the title's annoying bugs and occasionally repetitious play mechanics just to get their fix. Indeed, overlook the few minor irritating aspects of the game, and you'll find Sacred 2 to be surprisingly enjoyable.\n\nRATING OUT OF 5\nRATING DESCRIPTION\n\nGraphics\nIt's generally a beautiful world to explore.\n3.8\n\nControl\nIncessant clicking is still a winning yet repetitive formula.\n3.7\n\nMusic / Sound FX / Voice Acting\nFunny dialogue.

It's so vast that it could even put some of the MMORPGs (or Skyrim) to shame. But it's not that amazing - what makes it truly unique is it's quality. Repetitive scenery, reused parts of the map, areas that look like being done using procedure generation? Nope - totally not the case. It's astonishingly detailed.\nCharacter building. This game is a goldmine for people thinking that character building is what makes ARPG. 7 characters, each has around half a dozen of core builds, with unaccountable amount of stuff that could be tweaked "to taste".\nDoesn't feels too dated. It supports 1920x1080, special effects are an eye-candy, and it has autoloot - not many old ARPGs could boast with this.\nNEUTRAL:\nVery Bright. And by "very" I mean it's the most colorful ARPG I've ever played. Have to mention it, because currently there's a trend of people liking more gritty games.\nLore and Story. To be precise, this game has decent lore and terrible storyline.  Like, you start with delivering a parcel, then searching for missing elven expedition, then doing some laundry job for different parties, then some seemingly unrelated quests that just used to push you through locations - and voila, you're storming the final boss's hold. An excuse of a plot, just some side quests stitched together.\nItemization. Dull, but efficient. I mean, items are more or less good from the gameplay point of view, and this twist with certain items having unlockable traits depending on your character skills is pretty peculiar. But I'm pretty sure after going off for a year I won't be able to recall even one item/set - they are just not inspiring enough to me.\nBAD:\nObscure game mechanics. The game is far from being keen to explain how stuff works. It doesn't help that it's mechanics are very different from other ARPGs, as well as knowledge of mechanics is more important in Sacred 2 by a noticeable margin. If you don't dig forums/wiki you'll probably be left crawling in the dark and screw up your first character (and second too) beyond salvation.\nUninformative and misleading tooltips. Related to the previous, sort of. If you're choosing a perk between more damage or bigger aoe the game will never tell you beforehand how much extra damage or AOE you get. The only way is to check on the sacred wiki.\nSimplistic combat. The combat is what typically separates Action RPGs from Classical RPGs. Action elements usually involve kiting enemies, positioning, targeting skills, dodging enemy attacks or skills, avoiding area damage, etc.  So, back to the point. Sacred 2 combat is closer to that of a classical RPGs. It comes down to whether your character is strong enough to facetank and kill enemies, or not. There's no "I'm on the weak side, but I can do it with my gaming madskillz". Some bosses do possess an element of tactics, but that's it.\nBOTTOMLINE:\nSacred 2 is rather niche - it's not easy enough for beginners and not action-oriented enough for the ARPG veterans. People not used to the game will have a hard time shaking off the feeling they are playing some long forgotten MMORPG, alone on an empty server. I'd say it's worth a try if you're a fan of character building.","April 11","true","65.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Saving is as simple as hitting F7, which I do at least once every 30mins (and game autosaves every time you enter/exit a cave or complete a quest), so losing lots of progress is odd complaint unless you consider 15mins as lots.\n\nWell worth the little money it costs.

Its jam packed with content, has a HUGE game world to explore.Theres even mounts you can buy to ride around the huge game world with that get their own abilities. The best way i can sum this up is its like diablo with actual quests and a storyline to it.Theres still all the hack and slash you love in ARPGs but alot more. I wont say its an amazing storyline or anything like that as i havent finished it yet so i dont honestly know ill probably update this review once i beat the game and let you know. I will say though I truly feel this game is a work of art and sacred 3 i havent played it yet but i heard they broke the formula from this one and the first one and thats  shame because this is a really great game.\n\nNow onto the downsides, there are some flaws its not a perfect game.\n\nIf you alt tab out of the game and tab back in sometimes it drops the framerate a LOT. I solved this by playing in fullscreen windowed mode. I did this using a utility called fullscreenizer. You can find this also if you google it. Great utility.\n\nThe AI of npcs that follow you is pretty borked, they get hung on things, quests get broken etc. But theres a community made patch you can google and download that fixes most of the issues. Id post the link to it but steam would probably remove it. Its pretty easy to find if you google though.\n\nThe game also has lots of hidden humorous things to find throughout the world. I dont want to say anymore than that because i dont want to give spoilers but some of its at least in my opinion is pretty hillarious. Youll be surprised what you run across in this game lol, thats all i can say. It doesnt take itself too seriously at all which is a good thing.\n\nAlso for a game that was made in 2010 it has held up really REALLY well as far as the environments, I think they really still look great for what they are. I know a lot of people will disagree, thats just my opinion like all reviews, just peoples opinion. Trying to think of what else i can say. Basically if you can get this game on sale, definitely pick it up or even at full price its worth it. It has some age on it but all in all a good solid game.","February 7","true","25.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fluffybish/recommended/225640/","fluffybish","Alessondria","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fluffybish/","87 products in account","Sacred 2 is an open world hack-n-slash RPG. While there are many games like that this one does it well. The game does not take itself seriously, first off. A lot of things you will come across try to wiggle a joke or a smile into it, though not to the point of it being immature... it just does a good job of letting you know its a game, if that makes sense.\n\nIts an open world so you can go [mostly] any place pretty much anytime. You are not bound to the regions. There is no level locking. Enemies will generally scale to you but there are indeed regions where you need to have serious gear and have a decent build to take them on.\n\nThe other aspect of the game, which is my favorite, is its size. This game is 22 square ♥♥♥♥ing miles. Even the large area 'in the mountains' can be accessed by a kinda hidden portal. To put this in terms most gamers can understand: the world is about 5% larger then Skyrim. On top of that you don't move like a dart. This may seem daunting, but each location is PACKED with just tons of hand placed props. It creates a world that looks and feels alive. Tons of easter eggs. Tons of hidden loot caches. Tons of things to explore and see over 12 areas ... including 500 quests.\n\nYa... lots of quests. Nothing very engaging, and if you take too many (which is easy) you can start to not remeber the details of the quest/ chain clearly. But I find the strong points of the game to be exploration, combat, loot, and character building. The combat is simple to learn and fairly simple to master. But somehow its just so flippin rewarding. The monsters you fight are well done and there's just so so many different kinds... I don't mean black wolf/ blue wolf. I mean detailed completely different. So that adds to the fun element of exploration. And bosses are exceptionally tough!\n\nOn max settings with physics on high this game is PRETTY. And its amusing. And kinda addictive. But it feels laid back in a way somehow.\n\n-------------\n\nNow outta the box this game is buggy. The company who made it went under, so there are no online official servers or future patch support. HOWEVER! the community of super smart loyal geek fans created a community patch that fixed crashing, memory leaks, and overall stability. It adds new weapons, armor, item sets, and even quests. It does a few more things like always make enemies scale to your level (before there was a min/ max level enemies had... now everything is your level or higher!). If you buy this game then find the community patch. Its essential.\n\nYou can play online LAN via a program that is free and simple to use: Tungle. There's not a HUGE community that plays active 24-7 but you can host a server for your friends or join up to play with some friends you didn't know you had!\n\nThe other downside to the game is that if you wanna play on hardest setting (eventually) your build is essential. On easier settings (where you have to start every character) its hard to mess up a build. But as you level and start on higher difficulty tiers... ya, you can get squished easy. Why this is a downside is because you cannot respec your build. All skill points, attribute points, even combat art runes you use cannot be exchanged. I did a bit of digging and was able to find a caharacter editor. So if I get screwed later I can switch around my skill points. Its that or re-do 100 hours ^_^\n\nThe last bit is the camera and movement keys... W and S move forward and back but A and D turn you. This can't be changed to FPS-like controls. Camera is top-down but you can zoom in a bit behind your character and look around. You attack where you click/ mouse direction. Was a little different for me and hard to get used to. Also the default camera angle is crap. You may wanna use google to change some settings in an ini file.\n\n-----------\n\nSo despite the lack of new content for Sacred 2 its a sound game with TONS to do over 22 square miles and multiple difficulty settings. Randomly made loot... and tons of it! This is an RPG where its a lotta fun to both level up and spend time looking over gear to tweak your build. No official servers but LAN co-op is indeed fun still. But its shining achivement is the amount of detail put into every place.\n\nIf you like huge long game worlds, loot, and action RPGs that are not too serious I would encourage you to buy this. A $20 price tag IS a bit much so wait for a sale. The game performs its best once a few tweaks (listed above) are applied.\n\n4.7/ 5  ...nearly perfect! I just wish there were more combat spells per each character class and a way to change item appearance.","July 15, 2014","true","37.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Also, if you don't die, the monsters become insanely hard to kill.  In the first region of the map, I'm level 30, but the opponents are already 4 levels higher, which is a huge level difference.

However, once I got into Diablo-style RPGs, I decided to give it a try. It was better than I expected, but definitely not as good as it's competitors such as Torchlight II or Path of Exile (though I'll admit I haven't played Diablo 3). The animation is subpar, and the combat doesn't have quite the punch that Torchlight has. The RPG systems are pretty good once you understand them, but they're a little confusing at first. Where it does shine is it's ludicrously large world map, non-linear structure, and mood. You'll probably notice in the above screenshots that this game is....over the top, to be nice. But rather than try and take itself seriously like most ridiculous medieval fantasy RPGs do, it's all very light hearted and silly, which works very well. The game would be really just stupid if it wasn't for the fact that the game KNOWS that it's stupid. The embracing rather than resisting of tropes saves this game from being an crappy Diablo rip off and instead gives it a tiny niche to fill, combining the action of Torchlight with the scope of the Elder Scrolls, failing slightly but not completely and succeeeding enough but not very much at both. 5/10, will probably complete and even play through multiple times.\n\nEdit: Better than Diablo 3.","December 10, 2013","true","9.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

Main story quest is more of a key to unlock new areas however it doesnt make game less fun. You can roam freely around the world of sacred and await what other mysteries you are about to find. There is quite specific skill system that allows builidng character in diffrent ways and also lack of mana bar in this game makes it a bit diffrent. There is also a special accent of joke in the game. The developers made characters be sometimes even mean which is hilarious. There is also one more thing. Developers took care of slightiest details which makes this game have quite beautiful lanscapes. Lots of gaems in that genre or not that are sometimes underrated also use map system. The problem  is that most of developers have time and funds to do a proper job but skip most of details leving their maps nearly empty. Thats not what happened with sacred. What bugs me is escort quests and the amount of mobs that spawn. Sometimes i want to simply walk around but i end up with 20 mobs to kill. Additionally the battle music keeps changing alot, it could become annoying after a while. If you wanted to listen to area music you would have to stand still and better do it in a town. About the escort quest, the ai seems to be quite bugged.

Local MP works and I have Fam to dork arround with so there's that.","July 3, 2014","true","54.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

So, by the devs leaving this game for the fans to take care of that means LOTS of unfinished work and bugs!  But the community's got your back.  There a massive patch (as in content not size) that addresses MANY of the issues that lie with this title.\n\nThe game has beautiful graphics.  Many have complained about it being too colorful and/or bright.  While the game is kinda bright I really liked it.  Very vibrant colors and a lot of detail went into this game.  Speaking of detail.. the learning curve is quite high.  Do some homework before starting out in the adventure and start the game in Silver.  Bronze is pointless!\n\nMost likely you'll never run out of quests to do either.  There's reports of over 500+ side quests.  Initially I was running for 100% quest run, but after 15 straight hours of doing NOTHING but side quests I let it go.  It got very overwhelming and I lost interest.  The main quests are extremely short though.  So, in order to build your toon up you may want to tackle some of those side quests.  There's 10 chapters total and each chapter has 2 main quests and 1 boss.  Exploration is like an Elder Scrolls game if you will.  You don't necessarily need to go straight to the end.  you can venture out and see what's in that dark cave you just passed up.  :)\n\nLooking for a LONG and fun ARPG?  You really can't go wrong with this title.  That is.. if you can get it to work.  Windows 7 is iffy.  When I first tried to get it to work there was NO hope for it.  Two years later (yes, 2 years) it's up and running and playing beautifully!  Worth the $20, but if weary of bugs grab it on sale.","April 18, 2014","true","42.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

If that's all you want from a game, then give sacred 2 a whirl. Some games do the b-movie thing well, see Typing of the Dead if you want a game that nails the vibe perfectly, and while Sacred 2's qualitative shortcomings are at times hilarious, these moments did not come often enough to really keep me entertained.\n\nI might be missing the point here, but the lack of strong narrative, the ambiguous quests, terrible voice acting and implausible technological gaps between the player and your enemies made me wonder how effort really went into this game.\nEverything about Sacred 2 either frustrated or failed to engage me and after a good few hours I simply gave up; I didn't want to just be clicking on an endless stream of monsters with no real interst in why for any longer.\n\nWhile Sacred 2's character designs and progression systems have always been genuinely novel, the world that your character inhabits feels a little underdeveloped:\n\nThe open world vibe is totally subverted by linear quests and map design; when you get to a new place, you walk a set path around the area like you're on a go kart track rather than exploring and engaging with it. The side quests are uninspiring and revolve around the usual getting items, rescuing trapped elves and picking herbs.\n\nThe monsters are repetitive and while there are often quite a few of them to cut through, there's not enough diversity to differentiate engagements or to create any real challenges.\n\nThe environments feel devoid of personality; you walk through cities of people having randomly generated conversations which make little sense; it's like being trapped inside a bad parody of a game world, which can be funny at times but it becomes tiresome quickly.\n\nThe camera is oddly positioned and always left me craning my neck to see what's coming up ahead. Either when zoomed out or in I just couldn't see more than a few paces in front of me. Given that the camera follows the rotation of the player it can get a little disorientating at times, kind of like being trapped in a tumble dryer full of orcs.\n\nMaybe I've been ruined by RPGs which either do the action better (D3 & Dark souls) or the story better (Dungeon Siege 3 & Skyrim) or both (the Witcher 2), but I really am starting to expect a little more substance from ARPGs. In a market as flooded as this one I really recommend looking elsewhere, it's a shame because this title has potential but it's let down by phoned in mechanics and a lack of attention to detail.","May 4, 2014","false","9.0"," 83 of 161 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","83","161","0","3"

This game has gameplay mechanics like Diablo, but goes in a completely new direction. The game isn't very serious so it's fun for casual players but can get extremely challenging by upping the difficulty to the point where it takes careful planning and strategy to get through fights. Some of the dialogue is especially humorous including a couple of quest lines which are completely joking. The classes are diverse, fighting style can change radically, and leveling is amazing. It's very free form so the player holds the power as to what THEY want to do in the game. Graphics are awesome and very fluid.\nMy personal recommendation, if you are looking for an entertaining RPG that is massive in size, playable for probably 100+ hours, and absolutely entertaining the entire time, pick this up.","July 2, 2014","true","26.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

As far as I know, this is a standalone title.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about the game was that despite everything it represents visually, the game had no remote support, thankfully, a little fooling around with the remote and some trial and error and I have it in good with the controller, The game came off as a bards tale, just because of the annoying camera, and this is hindered even moreso by dodgy mouse controls, in rare occasions you'll find yourself tapping at one stair to get out of a bad see through stairwel. After fiddling with the camera angles a bit and tweaking the zoom I realized this game is absolutely magnificent.\n\nUnlike most looting games, this one takes the form of every one of them in a way that gives you a morrowind feeling but all of the time, whether it's a lucky store visit or another cave run your eyes are always oopen for that rare grab that'll make you drop your inventory in front of enemies just to get the item for sure. The save anywhere do anything aspect really shines when you realize you have to take a long trek again and have to do a lot of walking.\n\nI only have about 9 hours in, so I don't have too much of an opinion but I'm pretty much camping in the level 3-5 area completing all of the quests. A big problem I may face later in the game is having that rare level 2 item that's way better than the items beyond. But I'm almost certain this game will have a very nice way to go about it.\n\nIf the shared box works as I would hope, you may be able to share items across all saves, making the game progress in a fairly breezy yet new way, and since you get drops of all races from the game, you may be able to start a more serious difficulty after you get rick rolled about how easy bronze is feeling.\n\nI've had one bad encounter with an ally npc... he ran in the middle of a mob with a bow... I was so mad. However no other npc has behaved that way, the npcs that don't fight actually run away and know very well and how to stay back I could sit in the inventory menu in deep thought while trolls are running amok and the npc will be seen crossing the screen staying away from enemies. It's a very nice sight.\n\nFor me, This game is a deliverance. You get that mmo feel of being strong and having loads of opportunities to make armor builds with great purpose, you have gear that differs by race that drop often and are sold on an average occasion, characters that look really sharp and have cheesy one liners that go great with the enemies, who have their own. and an all around experience that will go from bards tale to a point and click mmo just by changing the camera.\n\nEdit: After about two more days I decided to change the difficulty and wanted to flip out. All of the quests were reset but my stuff was still intact, map data was intact but no portals were active. I went back to bronze, and all of the data returned. In my opinion, you should use one data to complete the story and another to enjoy the quests, This feature is probably the best I have seen, thougrh the repetitiveness will probably make you sick, this is one of those games that even when you get finished... Lol in about 4 months, youre not really finished. I have 4 days of game time in bronze and i still have about 14 circles in the large city just sitting there. And I probably wont address them until I've caught up in silver, So I can speed through bronze. This is one of those games that would make you gain hope in an era of games just because of the sheer value it gives to you. Though it is not the era, It is only this game.\n\nIn another light, the way that the quests are displayed will bring out the completionist in anyone... seeing failed red circles in select spots bombarded with green is sort of depressing, as well as a log book that has 2 red Xs among chapters of pure green. So if you do a quest, make it count and don't mess up if that sort of thing bothers you. Since there are two datas, (and possaibly more) You should do well to take at least one of them seriously in an attempt to wow someone with a pure green quest map.\n\nI would reccomend it it anyone who needs a game. If they like story they can do quests, if they like a challenge, tell them to just run ahead. I'm sure everyone has paid much more for way less in this day and age. And I would hope people would want a game they would want to play after they beat it, and this game emphasizes on concepts that make you okay with playing it again. Even if it's just to be powerful and slap monsters around for a chance at seeing an item with beast stats.","June 3, 2014","true","5.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arcament/recommended/225640/","Arcament","Baby Red ☭","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arcament/","160 products in account","Welcome to Skyrim of hack and slash games!!!\n\n\nSacred 2 is to hack and slash games what skyrim is to rpgs. A grand world filled with life where every corner,every item and every npc can tell u a whole new story if u are careful enough to listen.One of the most massive sized games i have ever played, im really not ashamed to say i thought it wasnt worth my time (i got it on humble bundle sale long time ago for 1 euro - package deal), so it just sat there unused just to shine my library of games. Having finished fallout 3 i wanted something simple to cool off and since i saw it there, i said to myself lets give it a try. And that was the moment i realized how stupid i was all this time for not giving this game a chance.\n\n\nWhere should i even start with this game... From the moment u enter, until the moment u log out those awesome detailed graphics are the thing thats in your mind. Flowers blossom, birds fly, water is so smooth and realistic, npcs talk to u and everything feels so damn alive and stunning. Whether its a forest zone, an island, a cave or frosty peak from the tinniest rock to the grandest cathedral everything has such detail that i can honestly say it works to perfection.If u have modern age graphic cards u are in a big treat i can tell u that much. Also the music and sounds are so deeply connected to the game , that u will feel u stepped in a real life market or in a god damned brawl everytime u fight. The game gets u and pumps you up or smooths u depending on the situation. Also the character design is so freaking awesome and even more so when u will finally be  able to ride all their unique mounts :P\n\n\nIn terms of gameplay i cant say that this title offers anything revolutionary but it goes a step further than most rpgs of this kind dare to do. Offering a unique set of 7 playable characters, this game goes beyond in what u call normal characters. Here u will find the dragon mage(the guy can turn into a dragon or summon one so thats all u need to know :P), the dryad(druid style magic and range), the seraphim(the fallen angel that can do everything), the inquisitor(like the name suggests u will burn in hell mf), the shadow warrior(the most brutal close fighter u will see), the high elf(the magician) and the temple guardian(anubis dog warrior that can use a wide range of support skills and kick ♥♥♥ while doing so). Each character has a unique skill tree branching into 3 seperate styles and thus can be used according to your style and needs of play. Also depending on your morality u can choose what deity u will want to follow which adds a new support mega spell for u to use in time of need. Also note that u can either chose to play the campaign as the good guy or the bad guy which is really cool considering your choices matter.\n\n\nNow as u move into the game itself u will notice if u press m the map. And here my friends is where the strength of this title unfolds. Everything u see can be explored and everything can be opened. When i said above that this game is the skyrim of hack and slash games i meant it. With the addition of the expansion in the gold edition of the game there are over 600 quests for u to do meaning that if u want to start now u will approximately finish around some time next summer. The map is so huge that each player can walk round and round for ages and still not opening it completely. Thats why u can teleport from great town to great town and use monoliths that act as resurrection points and safe spots for when u log out. And if u think thats not enough u can buy mounts so u can run faster than before and if u are lucky prolly use the unique mounts of each class if u got what it takes. There is a magic feel when u see in my case an angel moving on mounting a sabertooth tiger :P\n\n\nNow like usual if  u play hack and slash games the idea is to use your char to kill/loot and then becoming the ultimate badass hero or in this case a villain too.Thats why this game offers u over 600 side quests so u can do everything and find everything this game has to offer. Be careful though cause as u lvl up the enemies lvl up with u as well. Dont be surprised when u see a rat lvl 30 killing u if u are not too cautious and think its an easy drill. Personally im not that much into side quests but truth be told there are some that u absolutelly must do like helping The Blind Guardian group make its concert. The game satire and real life references will make u lol especially in cases like this. And dont worry if u dont side quests. U can take all the gear u want just by following the main story and killing the champion monsters along the way. Sure the side quests reward with greater loot but u wont be disappointed by the stuff u get when u play the main mission as well.\n\nNow for the not so good...\n\nIn terms of storytelling the story itself is not so good, not that bad just the typical u would expect in a title of this kind. It serves nice though cause it makes u see the whole continent and experience what it means to be good or bad depending on your choice of playthrough. Still it could have been better and more polished.\n\nAnd the most annoying thing for most players:the use of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ camera. U wont know how many times i swore before i looked into to forums in order to fix it to more standard hack and slash rpgs formulas. If u dont have a problem with it then by all means skip my previous comment, but if u do search online for various guides in order to fix it. Each guide offers a different approach so be sure to check if thats your way of gaming.\n\nOverall i think sacred 2 is one of the most underrated hack and slash rpgs. U always hear about diablo(now mostly bad comments, but 2 still rocks), titan quest and torchlight and this little gem is always pushed to the side. For me it has become a favourite and i hope that if u buy it u will enjoy it as much as i do.\n\n9/10","July 29, 2014","true","14.9"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

It was so hideously unstable that it couldn't be played, not with whatver setup I had back then.\n\nTime has moved on and I've managed a good five hours of play with only two crashes.  Once in the main menu and once whilst trying to defeat whats-his-name the giant kobold boss.  Unfortunatey it turned out that Sacred 2 seldom autosaves and I lost two levels and a whole lot of loot there.\n\nNow I'm not that upset about it - for four dollars I got a decent five hours of enterainment.  It's just that I can't easilly recommend it either.\n\nThe camera is still a broken mess; even after editing the option's file.  The fog is too close, the voice acting is terrible (but in an endearing sort of way).  There's very little to the game beyond kill X number of things, go back for reward.  There's also very little variety between items: generally variations on damage or armour with maybe a change to a stat or two.\n\nThis is grindy clicking at it's best.  You'll not find any tactical depth beyond left-click, right-click, left-click, right-click.

It plays basically more like the latter, but in terms of mechanics, it's a proper RPG (unlike Diablo), with skills like Bargaining and Perception alongside your more common combat and magic skills. Character builds are highly variable and extremely customizable, and the graphics are fantastic; the character models would not be out of place in a 2013 third-person game! I picked it up on the cheap in a Humble Bundle, but it's easily worth the regular Steam price.","August 8, 2013","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Essentially it's a Diablo clone, it's quite long at around 30 hours to complete the single player campaign - and that's with skipping the DLC islands and pretty much skipping the side quests from chapter three onwards.  It's a big old game, I'd uncovered about half the map before I stopped playing.  I hit level 41 by the time I finished it, max level is 200 (though that is only achieveable on subsequent playthoughs at a higher difficulty level)\n\nThe comabt etc gets very repetitive fairly quickly, as there is no penalty on using the plentiful healing potions you gather - your main risk of dying is from not paying attention rather than any sort of tactical challenge.\n\nMy main complaint with this game is the extremely complex mechanics and poor help/documentation that go with it.  Half the challenge in this game is understanding what mechanics interact with each other and what gear is best to use.  One example; I initially took the swords skill (one of ten slots you get, I unlocked 8 in my playthrough) and invested a bunch of points in it - I then took dual-wield; expecting that dual-wielding swords would provide double the bonus as it does in most other RPGs.  Instead I found that the moment you equip two weapons, all points in the sword skill are wasted and only the dual-wield skill provides a bonus.\n\nIf you min-max and read the (limited) guides on the internet this does become clear - but nothing in the game even hints at this.\n\nPlayed through as a Seraphim "Exalted Warrior" character, if you get it cheaply and like the Diablo/Torchlight genre of games then you'll get a solid couple of days playtime out of this I reckon.\n\nThere's lots to do, but its not a very deep game - it's mostly just hack and slash with courier/kill sidequests thrown in.  A special mention goes to the NPC AI, your companions which some missions have you babysit, are the most suicidal folks you'll ever come across - they constantly run in the wrong direction pulling vast swathes of enemies and dying - I gave up on any escort missions after the first chapter.","January 21, 2014","true","41.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is absolutley amazing; its so well developed and just full of content. There is seriously hundreds of quests to find and finish, tons of weapons, hundreds of runes/armor/items and other things to loot. Graphics are for a game that is as few years old as this they are still amazing and the developers invested so much effort in detail like with animals, trees swaying in  the wind and just making the world truly feel alive. The quests are actually really fun and storyline can be confusing like knowing what exactly is going on with the main story line but, i guess that would happen if you dont really pay full attention to the quests. Its not like Skyrim where there is cinematics to tell the story at least none that ive had seen for the hours ive played so far. Enemy AI can be challenging at times and can swarm you in numbers and make you really have to evade and attack evade and attack. Combat is smooth and fast which is what I like in my RPG's (I hate slow combat systems in RPG's). Overall if you want a DIABLO style looting & fast paced combat, Dragon Age camera view and gameplay, and a huge world like Elder Scrolls then you should def buy this game. Its takes bits of each one of those games and makes it its own unique formula for a game. Also there is a really nice character skill/attribute & leveling up system that has a great ammount of skills to unlock and upgrade as well as character attributes. Anyways I just started the game today and I already been playing it for 11 hours now according to STEAM. So for a gam to have me playing for 11 hours in one day in one single giant session is proof that this game is freaking awesome!!!\n\nOnly cons I have are:\nFinding the exact final objective for some quests can be confusing to locate\nMap is so huge that it can get tiring traveling all around\nAt times it can get repetitive with how each time you are traveling from one spot to another that there is constant run in's with enemies and there can be a lot of enemies.\n\n9.5/10","July 6, 2014","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is a ton of EVERYTHING in this game, real estate, equipment, mobs, quests.  This game will keep you playing for a long time.  Ascaron has shut down the official servers, but if you download Tunngle, you can play online using LAN mode.  The music triggering kind of stinks though, it won't be long and you will slide the music volume slider to zero, it's just combat music being triggered over and over until you are sick of it by level 5.  My machine is none too stout, but I can put the settings to high, and it is smooth as silk, and I didn't have any crashes like some older games.  No compatibility mode or anything.

(One liners and the things they say will amuse you)\n=Enemies doesnt scale to your level.\n=The game doesnt take it seriously! (Heck, a skeleton screams "MEDIC!" when I kill him!)\n\nWhat I dont like about Sacred 2:\n=The camera! (Although you can change/adjust the scales but it is still limiting. Fortunately, it can be fix by using custom option)\n=Story (I know there is a story...I just cant find it...Yet)\n\nI shall end this "review" with my favourite moment in Sacred 2:\nI was travelling to Tylysium and I noticed that the minimap was filled with A LOT of red arrows (its an enemy indicator).

Why? Well the steam deal helped. But this game was vast and beautiful. The foilage moves in the wind. The animals and water flow beautifully. Its enviroment really captures you inside it. Although the gameplay can be a bit of an annoyance at times it's a game with loads and loads of hours to play.\n\nWhy should you buy it? Well if you like diablo style game with some cool characters. Now it has coop and i have no idea if it works however i believe you can use hamachi to activate a server. I haven't tried that coop yet. It also allows you to share things in a box which gives it to your other characters. You can level and gear up everyone of your characters and share the loot between them. In other words... I have a Seraphim, my sister has a Dryad and my other sister has a high elf. Whatever i get for their classes i put into the box for them so they can level their characters faster.\n\nSometimes the map and the quests can be confusting but it's truly a fun game with very cheesy lines and fun gameplay. Blindguardian plays in the game and has a music video which really sold the game to me lol. I love it so much. I really hope some of you grab this game and try it out.

I did not enjoy it.  Literally, every time I loaded it up, I fell asleep.\n\nThen, time went by, I became a PC gamer, and I got this.  I expected to have the same kind of experience.  I am happy to report that I do not.\n\nPros[/b]:\n+Loot, loot, loot, loot, loot, loot, LOOT!  I guess what I'm trying to say is- LOOT!!.  There is tons to be had in Sacred 2.  The merchants update quite frequently, and I've found useful pieces out in the world and in combat.  As far as ARPG's go, this game brings it with tha booty!\n\n+Seraphims are righteous b!tches.  It entertains me to hear them cast judgement on the enemies or calling the townspeople "simple".  It's a huge plus in my book.\n\n+Character customization.  Unfortunately here, I'm only talking in the Stat sense, not the appearance.  As far as Stats go, though- I feel completely comfortable with making the exact character I want to play.  One of the coolest, easiest, rewarding Stat mechanics I've seen in an RPG.\n\n+Gorgeous world.  Day/Night cycle, weather and PhysX that blows leaves about (if your PC can handle it).  It is a gorgeous storybook world that gets splattered with blood.  Win win!\n\n+Enemy Scaling.  This is quite the hot topic in the discussions, and it seems some people don't care for it.  I, for one, like how Sacred handles it's Enemy Scaling- there is always a fight worth fighting!\n\n+Mounts.  The gorgeous world is huge.  Portals can only help you out so much- you're gonna need a mount!\n\nCons[/b]:\n-Multiplayer is dead.  Not so bad with an outside source like Himachi and others, but for those looking to hook up easily through Steam- leave that delusion at the door.\n\n-Character customization- appearance.  It's not very in depth.  There aren't many hair colors available to the different races (but with a Save Editor, this is easily fixed).  There is a nice amount of Skin choices, but no face options.  Your Seraphims face will look like your Seraphim partners face.  No big, but really worth mentioning.\n\n-Can be overwhelming to the casual crowd.  It's massive.\n\n-CM Patch hasn't worked for me recently.  It did once.  It's not really a Con on the game, but it's worth noting because the CM Patch is the better way to play Sacred 2.\n\nOverall[/b]:\nIt truly is a great ARPG.  It might even be my favorite ARPG, as I dig into it deeper.  The freedom of Character Stats mixed with the gorgeous, well-envisioned fantasy world really makes this game stick out.  I am glad I went back and gave it another chance... it's better than some of the games that have released recently.","July 21, 2014","true","53.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It generally works but can get tedious having to fight your skimpy butt through half of the continent to loot a stone or something and then sprint your skimpy butt way all the way back for an often mediocre reward.\n\n-Character "classes" are gender locked. I didn't care about this, but I recall it being a common complaint from critics.\n\n-Too easy. Bosses basically have a lot of HP. Just slash away.\n\nCons...\n-The camera is atrocious. Good lord.\n-The AI is abysmal. Escort missions suck; for example, I had to escort a villager to his sister. He would dart clear across the map, aggro a bunch of crap, runs in another direction, aggroing MORE stuff, by the time I finally FOUND him, he was dead and I failed the quest. Don't expect other escort missions to be better.\n-No Steam Cloud support\n\nOverall, it's an enjoyable hack n' slash and worth picking up, but I would recommend doing so on a sale.","December 26, 2015","true","17.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not bad for a beginning area only.  But that is my play style.  No rock unturned.\nI am playing with the community patch.  Since that is all I know, I cannot compare.\n\nThis game hooked me.\nI think it is the dungeons and the loot.\nThere is something about optimizing your loot in this particular game that is very addictive.\nThere are many side quests to rescue someone who has been captured.  I can do rescue missions all day.\n\nNot as much of a grind as Diablo franchise.\nExcellent Graphics for a top down.\n\nI don't know how people have their brightness set on their computers or what games they are used to playing, but I never found it to be too bright.  I've spent over 600 hours in Skyrim too, which is almost colorless.  I have a really nice monitor, though, so maybe that's it.\n\nNegatives:\n1.  Crashed on me 4 times after 3+ hours of straight gaming each time.  Honestly, you should get up and do something else before that time period rolls around, but....  Rebooting the game is extremely fast, but it put me in a weird place with not much xp/ equipment lost.\n2.  You are gender-locked with your classes.  The class I really wanted to play was female only.  I don't enjoy playing a female as much, so I played a temple guardian (having a blast btw).  This is a major improvement made by Diablo 3 over Diablo 1, but not is this game.\n3.  Once you chose a skill upgrade at level up, it is permanent.  As in, oops my finger slipped...!  Too bad, that is what you picked.  No going back and no "Accept changes" type of button for confirmation.\n4.  As others have said, camera angles are really hard to deal with, but I have gotten used to swinging it around using the "a" and "d" keys.\n\nHope you all have a great time playing it.\nIt's worth every penny I paid for it (on sale) and then some.\n:)\n\nI price it at $24.99 in value and give it an  8.3 / 10.\n\nPS.  I just found one of Drizzt's old swords!  Woooohooo!

I'm 8 hours into the game, lvl 12 and I'm still running around level 2 wolfes, trying to find questpoints. Running 5 minutes in the direction of the minimap arrow points to only to run into an unclimable hill or river. OK. Backtrack, while fighting hordes of lvl3 bandits and lvl5 Kobolds (1 EXP for each). Mounts? Well, 8 hours in the game and they add maximum of 3% to my speed. Very frustrating experience of running around for hours without any target or feeling of progress. Probably will drop this one.\n\nUpdate:\nI'm 16 hours into the game. Managed to understand the quest tracking system. But the game is soooo repetitive and boring... Didn't try multiplayer, but single player is just not worth the amount of time it takes. I really wanted to like this title, but... No, thanks.

I played through the entirety of the vanilla game, over 60 hours, and let me tell you, I loved every single minute of it.\n\nThis is hands down the absolute BEST hack n slash rpg I've ever played.  The graphics are smooth, crisp and well made, the combat is tight, the skill and combat art system is engaging and rewarding, there are literally THOUSANDS of quests to complete, monsters to slay, and loot to acquire, and there's a surprising amount of good, Larian-style humor here and there.  Did I mention that the world is MASSIVE, likely TWICE the size of the original Sacred, Undeworld included?\n\nOh yeah, and the fan community is one of the best I've seen.  It is incredibly helpful and eager to help new players ease into the game.\n\nSpeaking of which, let me end on a PSA.  If you end up buying this, DOWNLOAD THE COMMUNITY PATCH.  Not only does it fix a multitude of bugs, but it also adds a TON of new content to a game already full of it, such as new items, new quests, and new enemies to fight!","July 10, 2014","true","4.1"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

I especially love the menu background: it's unique and pleasingly-grotesque.\nLovely ambience. The details are great, such as the musicians and conversations from people heard in towns.\nPlenty of side quests to do.\nA variety of different characters to choose from, with many different skills, weapons, and other loot.\nDecent controls.\nCons\nThe camera can be bad and requires a lot of fiddling to get it to your individual taste (at least in my case).\nThe font is absolutely awful. On large screens it can be nearly unreadable and tiny. It is difficult to change the font and there are no options provided to change the UI size. This makes the game way less enjoyable to play, when I have to squint to read just about anything!\nThe game is confusing at first. Aspects of the game aren't really explained very well. I'm 6 hours in and I'm still not 100% sure what runes do!\nCustomizaton of character appearance is a bit limited. All of the classes are locked at one gender, and some only offer one hair style.\nAgain, I cannot stress enough how bad the font is. My eyes still ache from all that squinting...\nOverall, a pretty fun experience with a few annoyances. I would recommend picking this game up, especially when it's on sale.","November 24, 2015","true","15.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

(yeah the comparison is a bit far, however i compare every open world rpg game to skyrim)\n\nYet if you view this game like a mmorpg with singleplayer it becomes reccomendable, as you can basically farm items, gold, buy things, sell things, questing. (basically like diablo) and combat can be funny when your character makes remarks on your enemies like "only a mother can love a face like that".\n\n\nmy suggestion is grab this game on sale to have maximum fun and less wallet gouging!","October 27, 2015","true","21.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

The easiest way to "fix" the launch sequernce is to go into your sytem files for sacred 2 (the absolute easiest way is to right click on the application in steam, go to properties then got to local files then to browse files and and then it will take you directly into the sacred data bank as it is somewhat hidden.) Once in the sacred 2 folder go to the "redist" folder and open it, it wil have three differnt folders. You must go into each of these folders and find the setup sequence for each (its really not that hard to miss) once all three of the folders programs have been downloded the game should run fine. If not, then you may have to change the compatability as the standards of your computer clarify. For me i had to change the compadibilty from Windows Vista to Windows 7. The way to do this is very similar to downloading the applications i talked about earlier. Go to Sacred 2, Properties, Local files, Browse local files, then got to the Folder file: "system' find sacred2.exe (should have the sacred logo as an icon) right click it to select it, then left click and go to properties and then compatability and then change as your computer may very. once that is done check the box "run as administrator' THEN you should be set to go.\n\n\n\n\nREVIEW-\n\n\n\n\nYeah so..... everything wants to murder you.... have fun!\n10/10","February 8, 2015","true","165.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I wasn't even trying to break the game on purpose, but...\nThe targetting system is awful, especially for melee skills, making you dance and jitter to reach an enemy\nThe bosses and combat is really uninvolved, just toss your skills at enemies and sit in their face, tanking/ pretending to avoid the AoEs and projectiles while downing health potions non stop\nThe skill system increases the cooldown of every skill with armor and levels, forcing you to spend more skill points to reduce back down the cooldowns\nThe areas are gigantic but void of anything of interest\nThe quests are mostly meaningless and unorganized back & forths that take too much time for no reason\nI've had multiple quests glitches on me and refuse to be completed\nThe game seems to allow and be okay with murder in any situation\nI've seen a random guard glitch out and punch a random citizen for no reason\nI got my mount stuck in so many areas\nThe area transitions sometimes teleport you twice back to the same place\nThe game crashes at random, happened 4 times in ~20 hours\nThe multiplayer is dead and you're forced to use a fanmade, 3rd party program to play online.I gave up when the game froze for no reason and crashed, and made me walk for 15 minutes through a dragon's cavern. Again. Literally the only fun I had was with some clever lines of text and the graves epitaphs.","May 27","false","27.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

These few hours on steam can barely compensate for my thousands of hours iwth my frineds on darkmatters.org in this game, and all the buildcrafting (justt visit the site and enjoy) I did on this game. And all those builds I used. So awesome.\n\nTwo years of trashing, togetherness, buildcrafting, sharing... All gone. Imagine a server where you log in and people ask: hi man, what do you need? And they shower you with tons of items before you even know what the game is all about. ANY MMO community LOSES to what S2 was like.\n\nPeople were giving stuff out for fun. THEY had a lot, an they were gaining a lot. Nobody whined. Everybody enojyed it, and laughed. Everyone shared, and had fun.\n\nKick the game down to an XP windows mode and have fun. I sure hope some hamachi servers can do it for you If yes, you will still love the game.\n\nPeriod. And I still play it in Lan/MP.

If you like diablo and the constant grind then you will like this game.  I hesitate to recommend it though because it is very buggy.  It started out buggy and so I installed the community patch and I am not sure that fixed it at all in any way.  It is still buggy.  It randomly stalls for no aparent reason at all.  With that said it is a good game.  There is tons of loot to get though the pool is rather small and you notice you pick up similar items constantly.  There are many quirks with the game.  It took me forever to get use to the questing system and the UI.\n\nThe game is a click click click game. Tons of clicking and killing.  I'm playing on easy because on any other difficulty there are just too many mobs.  Right now I just run through them all. I'd hate to have more that I would have to run through.  Levelling is a chore. mobs barely give you exp.  If they are 5 lvls under you, you get 1xp and you need like 10k+ to level.  There are tons of levels.  at 52 hours play on one toon, I am at level 32.  There are, I've read 200+ lvls.\n\nThe quests are all the same.  Go here, click that, turn in. Travelling is a chore even with a mount.  So many obstacles that get in the way of movement. It doesn't help the camera is finiky.\n\nWith all the negatives I am enjoying the game...it might be the completionist in me that won't put it down until I beat it or until another better game can be found.","January 20, 2015","true","60.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Essentially it has a frame rate of about 1-5 FPS. I have an i7 2.80Ghz  Processor, with 8GB of DDR3 ram, as well as an ASUS ATI Radeon R9 with 4GBs of dedicated GDDR5 VRam as well, so no issues with system specs, just an old game with no future support. I bought the game a year ago, barely played and then when I finally decided to play it I could not get it to work at all. Would like to though as I had this back on the 360 and it worked great and loved it. Shame the only support I found was a community patch that took about 3 hours to download over a very fast connection...and still did not fix my stuttering and fps issues. Good game, bad future support on hardware. Maybe it's a driver, but I recently even tried after another graphic update and still no good. I even asked for a refund and I was denied. So waste of money there. My recommendation...find this in the bargain bin at your local retailer for the 360 or the ps3, save your $15 bucks for something else.","January 21","false","0.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

You can clearly see that the developers invested a huge amount of time and love to make this game.\n\nThe world is huge, with no loading times except when entering specific dungeons. There are deserts, greenlands, mountains, swamps, jungles, pretty much a full global ecosystem. There are so many different kinds of creatures that I dare say this is the ARPG with the greatest foe variety ever made. Everything from huge, oldschool dragons to advanced robots imbued with magic will stand in your path. Talking about path, you can play either the good or evil campaing, with objectives, characters and locations varying for each one of the paths you choose. Every character class has its own huge set of habilities, starting place, mount and equipment type. There is enough customization to get you theorycrafting for quite a while when building your character. The story isn't the best around, but it gets you going. A sidequest chain in the first area of the game features the members of the band Blind Guardian, which will be a pleasant surprise if you dig the band. There's even a music video of the band playing to a bunch of monsters if you complete the chain quest, I should also add that one of the band's songs feature in the game's soundtrack.There was effort and love in this game's development, you can notice it. Everything is well though and has its own place in the world.\n\nDespite all this, there are also terrible mistakes. Getting the game to run for the first time will be a logistical nightmare. Depending on your rig, the game might run anything ranging from "okay" to "unplayable". It requires a lot more processing power than the graphics make you believe it will, using the Steam Overlay feature will be close to impossible and there will be crashes. Be prepared to redo parts of the game due to losing progress on crashes. No game should be released with these kinds of issues and I cannot recommend a game that comes out like this unless the rest of the game is flawlessly good, which Sacred 2 certainly isn't.\n\nI feel the need to say that, if you like ARPGs, you might still enjoy the game very much despite everything, as I did. Take a good look at some gameplay videos and try it out if you want, but be aware of what you'll be getting yourself into.\n\nGameplay - 8/10\nSoundtrack - 9/10\nGraphics - 4/10\nContent - 9/10\nChallenge Level - 9/10\nReplayability - 7/10","June 4, 2015","false","41.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I'm playing Seraphin, so I don't know how other characters feels.\n-Too many sub quests, and most of them are boring.\n-The control feels buggy, at least for pc, I think it might be better if you play the console version.\n\nIf you are a RPG fans, want to experence a unique system, and want to explore a massive map, this is the game for you. But if you want to experience immersive combat, and care about the feeling when you cut the enemies, I don't recommand this game to you, go for the other games.","August 30, 2015","false","40.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

A *lot* of interesting game, by the looks of it. However, it's pretty dead-set on being as difficult to actually play with as possible. It doesn't know if it wants to control like a third-person action game or like a normal action RPG, so it decides to try both as poorly as possible. The camera, lost in the previous confusion, does it's own little thing, which usually results in getting you killed.\n\nThere's a really odd feeling you get while playing Sacred 2 that comes from trying to wrestle with the controls and the camera at the same time. Is this what single mothers of twins feel like?\n\nThe actual leveling up bit is different at best and utterly obtuse at worse. This is half the reason you play these games, so if you're willing to invest the dozens of hours required to actually see most of the game, I'm sure I'll make sense. Eventually.\n\nThis is a nitpick, but my god, the character designs. Every female has to be sexy, and to Sacred, that means exposed panties. Not stylized, not suggested, just women literally running around in their underwear. It's like a 14 year old drew this and then a sweaty 29 year old with a neck beard animated it.

The writing is utter garbage, with absolutely no immersion. Usually, arpgs rely on good loot systems and interesting combat mechanics to make up for it. This game has a horrible loot system and the combat is extremely boring. Especially in the endgame, its all about chance to hit and chance to be hit. If you get unlucky you can die instantly because your enemy landed 2 20% hits in a row. Conversely, you can stand there missing 10 hits in a row without being able to do anything about it, bosses are exceptionally bad offenders here. There are so many broken things with this game that not only do I not recommend it, but I think its absolutely trash. When there are arpgs like grim dawn and path of exile out there, just don't bother with this nonsense. I liked how it did mounts, and the first silver difficulty playthrough I did was ok, but after that I just can't be bothered to play it anymore. The sidequests feel extremely unrewarding for the most part and even though there are more than you'll probably ever do, it only makes the game worse not better. I wish the developers actually tried to make interesting content rather than just gobs of it, because as it is now I just don't care about the content I haven't explored.\n\nI'm going to uninstall this game for certain, and never come back to it. At least it did the job of filling in for poe before it came out, and it reminded me how terribly executed games can get. I'm not saying that there is nothing good in this game, but everything good is just completely overshadowed by its problems.","July 10, 2015","false","43.7"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","10","23","0","2"

The character classes are interesting, the progression choices to customize your character's operation are superb, itemization is good, and the world is large.  As for the bad: it is extremely tedious to find and travel to quest objectives which is made worse by several related bugs.  It is difficult to select targets, even with a PC mouse.  The isometric view is more top-down than a looking-ahead view angle; this hampers navigation and prevents you from seeing and targeting enemies.  The game lacks a tutorial to introduce game elements, though I was able to eventually figure most things out through trial and error.

With the game recently going on an 80% sale,  despite the game already being over six years old (as of this writing), it seemed worth taking a look. Sacred 3 is set to release August 2014, and I thought it was about time to see what the interest is.\n\nI enjoy playing ARPG games such as Torchlight, Diablo, Path of Exile, etc. Sacred & Sacred 2 is compared to Diablo and Diablo II due to its play style, and genre categorization. It's also known that Sacred 2 is pretty much referred to Sacred 1.5, without a large development jump from title to title.\n\nI'm sure this game was somewhat innovative and exciting to play in 2008, but sadly I feel that the game is better left to the ages in fond memory - especially for those that played & enjoyed it. The game feels like a bad console port to PC, and the controls / camera made the game feel disjointed. There was a lot of texture popping, and combat didn't feel very engaging in the early stages.\n\nThe game also doesn't do a good job of being intuitive, and the game UI feels very foreign. Perhaps at one time there was a game manual included with this title, but the initial lack of a tutorial to explain combat - or UI functions was disappointing. Thankfully I've the aptitude to read, and learn quickly - but I can see the first-time player/new player being confused; Hopefully this sort of system doesn't make its way into Sacred 3.\n\nThe bottom line is that new players (such as myself) should steer clear of this title, even at significant discount from Steam. Unless you're one of the other type waxing nostalgic for the title... Avoid this mediocre game. There are much better ARPG choices out there to choose from. Trust me.","July 8, 2014","false","1.6"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

Despite having many more buttons you cannot have as many skills programmed (even if you plug in a controller).  The graphics don't look as good, the controls are wonky somehow.  I can only explain by saying the characters don't always move where you tell them to.  The camera is terrible (which is really hard to do in a top down game).\nPerhaps I'm just unfairly comparing the game to the console version, but that huge and enticing to explore world seemed like such a chore here.\nPros:\nSame in depth and complex leveling system.  (you have a great deal of control over how your character develops)\nSame random loot drop love.\nGraphics aren't terrible.\nExcellent music.\nCons:\nEverything I said in the first part.\nNo interesting NPCs (except maybe the band Blind Guardians).\nHuge map can be daunting.\nQuests are everywhere obscuring the story (if there is one)\nThere are things to enjoy here, but it's not enough.  Pick this up in the bargain bin for your old console and enjoy it there.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wildstoo/recommended/225640/","wildstoo","StOo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wildstoo/","923 products in account","Sacred 2 Gold is a pretty generic hack'n'slash RPG in the vein of Diablo or Titan Quest, only with a more open-world approach. I have about 50 hours played (Steam didn't record some of my game time for some reason, probably related to one of the many, many crashes.)\n\nPros:\n\n+ Lots of loot.\n+ Lots of ways to customize your character's build.\n+ Graphics can be pretty sometimes, considering the game's age.\n+ Some of the mounts are pretty cool looking.\n\nCons:\n\n- Game crashes or freezes frequently because of terrible memory management code.\n- The main story is so forgettable and pointless that after 50 hours I couldn't even tell you what it was about.\n- The world could easily be called "generic fantasy world". There is nothing outstanding about it.\n- The voice acting and writing is among the worst in any game. Ever. Seriously.\n- The "funny" quests and dialogue are... not funny. The tone of the game is all over the place.\n- No respeccing. Want to try another build? Roll a new character.\n- The camera is abysmal, even when you disable the autofollow and control it yourself.\n- The world is far too big and often feels "copied and pasted". Not nearly enough true variety.\n- Fast travel options are weirdly placed, which means you end up running around the same areas a lot.\n- All quests are of the "go here, kill these, bring these back" type.\n- Almost no interactivity in the environment.\n- Music is short and repetitive. You'll hear the same music all the time.\n- Despite the plethora of skills and abilities, combat just isn't that fun.\n\nTotal Dealbreakers:\n\n- The death penalty in this game is the resetting of a stat called "Survival Bonus[www.sacredwiki.org]" which takes hours and hours of combat to raise. If you die it goes back to zero and you have to build it up again from scratch. This stat is one of the most important stats in the game, and affects all your attributes. It's one of the most brutal death penalties in a game of this type that I've ever seen.\n\n\nBasically, this game could have been great, but the dev team made some really strange design decisions. Here's how I would have fixed it:\n\n+ Rewrite the main quest so it makes sense and they player feels included.\n+ Rewrite all dialogue. All of it.\n+ Reduce the world to about 50% of the size.\n+ Remove the most tedious sidequests (which is most of them, tbh)\n+ Add more enemy types and more interesting enemy behaviour.\n+ Allow respeccing through gold or a quest.\n+ Remove the voice acting entirely. Yes, it's that bad.\n+ Change the camera target and FoV. In fact, redo the entire visibility system.\n+ Allow the player to teleport to any resurrection station they have discovered, rather than just portals.\n+ Make survival bonus recoverable in a few hours, rather than days!\n+Place some stuff in dungeons other than monsters (secret passages, hidden buttons, etc.)\n+ Make Riding a "special" skill available to all builds, independent of other skills.\n+ Fix the damn crashing bugs!\n\nI uninstalled this game without finishing the main quest, because honestly I was simply bored and frustrated playing it. There are LOADS of far, far better hack'n'slash games out there. Play them instead.","October 21, 2015","false","30.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

The game starts assuming that you already know the backstories and controls.

It is FRUSTRATING. Every step you take the camera will move on its own, and you'll end up stopping to adjust the camera to your liking, only for it to move again, out of angle.

I guess the very beginning, huh.\n\nThe opening cinematic looked pretty alright, especially for a game from, what, 2005? Imagine Power Rangers but with scantily clad women and fireballs - only not that awesome. The narrator explained the story, but none of it was even interesting enough to remember past the end of the introduction.\n\nMoving on.\n\nSo I made my character. I had the option between 5 scantily clad women, a man in a skirt, and a skeleton. The game began with my (I'm assuming) instructor telling me to defeat a fellow student in a duel. The camera zoomed out to allow me control and a full screen window came up to tell me I had some DLC too enjoy. Great! Too bad the game didn't pause though, because the other student was already throwing fireball after fireball at my face.\n\nI closed the dialog and attacked my opponent. (Evidently, left clicking your opponent makes you swing your weapon at them - and not accurately.) I defeated my fellow student and he fell to the ground. "What are you doing?!" exclaimed my instructor. "You weren't supposed to kill him!"\n\n"Uh...."\n\nSo I killed my instructor and walked through the starting area. The only NPCs I could find would only tell me to go away and leave them alone, so I walked out of the starting gate and was immediately murdered by the very first trash mob on the road.\n\nAside from a horrible introduction, this game has the absolute worst camera that I've ever experienced in a game. You can move forward, backward, and look left and right. God help you if you look left or right, though, because your camera will do anything but cooperate.\n\nI counted no less than a dozen buttons on the UI, and precisely zero help screens. Hitting escape to go to the menu to figure out what the keybinds won't do much good either. Keys are listed as "Weapon 1, "Orb 1," "Skill 1," etc. How delightfully nondescript.\n\nSo far I've murdered 7 people and I've been ignored by 3 (perhaps the latter is explained by the former.) Maybe there is some sort of appeal to this game after I learn how to play it, but I would rather not put myself through the trouble.\n\nSave yourself some time and skip this one. Diablo and Torchlight are far better than this shoddy clone.","July 9, 2014","false","0.8"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

I guess this is an improvement over Sacred? What I remember about Sacred (I got it when it was new) is that it seemed really cool, but my PC at the time couldn't handle it. By the time I had a PC that could, the current version of Windows refused to play nice with Sacred.\n\nWhen I finally got Sacred 2, I thought it would be great. It will be like Sacred, but now even Sacred 2 is a bit old, so my PC should be able to handle it no sweat. My PC blows the recommended hardware out of the water. Sacred 2 runs like ♥♥♥♥. I get jerky animations and what can only be described as GPU lag, but can't possibly be, since my graphics card is newer than this game.\n\nIn addition, it was one of the early attempts at an isometric view with 3D graphics and a rotating camera. So the camera and map features are at the same time absolutely necessary and absolutely worthless.\n\nI can't give this game a worthwhile review because I'm playing it on hardware that's too powerful for it. That makes absolutely no sense to me, but there you have it.\n\nBottom line: should you buy Sacred 2? Off-hand, I'd have to say no. If you have anything like a current PC, you won't enjoy it. If, on the other hand, your PC is more than five years old and still running Windows XP, I would recommend you try Sacred 2. If it's anything like Sacred, it'll be amazing.\n\nIt really pains me to give this game a thumbs down, but I just have to. There's no excuse (in my mind) for this game having the kind of issues it has.","September 10, 2013","false","1.8"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

Battle music will cut in every time you're in combat, which amounts to engaging a single foe then hearing a choir as though an epic battle is about to start, then felling that single opponent almost instantly. Then the music abruptly goes away, only to restart from the beginning the next time a foe crosses your path. It's incredibly jarring and disharmonious.\n\nThe avatar picture in the top left did not look like my character. The game deviates from well accepted standards of the genre, only to fail to explain them. The default controls are all over the place, for instance 'i' doesn't even open inventory. I accidentally skipped two cinematics, one by pressing volume up on my machine, and the other by attempting to shift-tab to the steam interface.\n\nOverall if you like this kind of game, there are other games that do it much better. If you don't like this style of game then this one is not going to change your mind.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/225640/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2818 products in account","Disclaimer - I do not own Sacred 2, I have played the game via Steam family share and the hours recorded on Steam is not accurate either.\n\nSacred 2 is an action role playing game part of the Sacred series. The PC version of the game was released in 2008. This was my first experience with the sacred series, having not played the original release either. I went into the game expecting it to be a little like Dungeon Keeper or Diablo.\n\nThe gameplay is top-down style, clicking on the world where to move and the traditional left and right click attacks. This to me is one of the best control systems out there as it is easy to grasp and you are able to do everything you need to do with just your mouse.  Sadly a lot of Sacred's 2 important menus are not bound to keys so you have to click on your UI in order to bring them up, such as inventory etc.  I also did not like the fact there was hardly any tutorial to the game; you get told how to move and attack; that's it.\n\nUpon starting the game for the first time and creating your character, you are greeted with a humongous amount of information straight away. Although the game tries to explain what everything does, I found it a little overwhelming that I was being fed this amount of information on the first screen.\n\nThe graphics are dated since this game came out in 2008, you can easily see polygons and sharp edges on everything in the world.  There is a small amount of voice acting in the game too which is done very well, would of made the experience even better if all NPCs had it though.\n\nI have been playing Sacred for about seven hours now; and I am barely even scratching the surface on the amount of content in this game. I am seeing sources online telling me there are about thirty four hours worth of content on offer here which is a huge amount. There are around 100 quests to complete in the main campaign as well as plenty of caves and dungeons to explore, there are said to be about 600 side quests out there too.\n\nI am having a number of technical issues in my playthrough so far. The main one is that my UI will randomly disappear at points, which is extremely difficult to work around as I am not able to see my health or use potions etc. The only way I found to fix this was for you to either die, or reload the game. Sadly this one becomes very annoying very fast. Secondly there is quite a few areas which cause lag spikes and stuttering. I should not be playing a game that is almost seven years old and experience stuttering at all.\n\nDo I recommend Sacred 2? Personally I think I may of been spoiled by recent RPG games. Back in the day I would bet my life on Sacred 2 being game of the year material; but compared to current and recent day RPG games, it just isn't the same. People who have played the game will probably disagree, but since I didn't grow up playing this game when I was younger I can only go off my first experience playing it.  So for me I won't recommend it since I am not having as much fun on this as I do other games. Old school gamers which love having tons of information to immerse and delve themselves into will love this game, it's just not for me.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

I would of loved a "lazy" reuse of the last game's engine sequel, atleast that would be better than this.\nMost of the quest are the same old "go here, kill this" quests and it controlls like it was programed for someone with 6 fingers on each hand. Switching abilities is a pain and is hard to do in combat.\n\nThe characters are stereotypes of the ones in the first game, that were stereotypes to begin with, with a completly pointless customisation slider that just makes them all look the same. Not that it matters beacuse to be able to see more that 2m in any direction requires the screen to be fully zoomed out.\n\nThe map looks like someone lent on the brightness way too much and forgot what "open world" means. Sacred ! was this world slowly falling in (and part of) hell, so very dark. Also it might look open but it's just a series of paths boxed in by invisible walls with little to nothing worth discovering in it.\nBasically it is "Baby's first Vanilla Fantasy Land",\n"Tired of getting lost in a open 2d world?"\n"Try our quest trail and fast travel systems to totally remove all sense of exploration or acomplishment."\n"Plus we've made the whole map boring and lifeless so you can be prepaired to know what real life is like."\nand so on.\n\nCompaired to the first game it's bad, as a game on it's own, it's worse.\nSpend the $20 on a better fantasy game, there's a ton of them out there for much less.\nI'm happy to of got this on sale, even then it was still a rip-off.","October 6, 2014","false","2.9"," 7 of 38 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","7","38","0","0"

This even happens when opening dropdown lists in the settings or adjusting sliders in the character creator.\n\nWhile I'm sure this game would be great fun if it worked, as it stands, I can't recommend this version of the game to anyone.

The graphic are beautifull considering the age of the game... If you like torchlight 2, Diablo II  or skyrim, you might take a look at this one. A word of warning: choose your class wisely and level your charater regarding a preplan you made first. Leveling understanding had me confused quite a bit at the beginning and it leave me no choice but read some build and the meaning of all this buff and perk you can invest into. I strongly reccommend you do the same if you are new to the franchise as the game is not forgiving at all and messing a character is easy. That said I love every aspect of the game but the camera control and had to get use to it. The combat music was also annoying and horrible to my taste, once again I dig a bit on the net and found a way to turn it off. Now here is what is good with the game:\n- Open world - Huge map.\n- Lots of option (may be too much for certain player) to level and customize your character the way you want\n- Lots of side quest, some easy some not.\n- A good story line, if you read the book you found during exploration the world of sacred 2 start to make sense\n- Yes you can ride a horse\n- Combat mechanic is Diablo II style, even better.\n- Plenty monster to fight\n- Navigation in this game is a bliss with 3 different sorts of map and a compass... no GPS though (kidding).\n- Variety of weapon, armor, items and spells\n- The resurection system is fine tuned here... yes I died and died and died while experimenting tactics.\n- And much much more I missed... just 18Hrs in the game.\n\nConclusion: If you like open world RPG with hack and slash element this game is made for you. If you are new to RPG this one might be a high learning curve with hiccup but it stills worth it. Did I mention the game is fun to play? Yes it is indeed. My rate: 8/10 (still hate the camera system, no exit so far in dungeon but the way in (I am picky here), the combat music is horrible..., Multiplayer server down -> they do not exist at all... but I like to play RPG alone anyway.)\nThanks for reading.","December 9, 2014","true","57.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So obviously the cover catches my eye, as well as it being an open-world RPG. I was stoked at first glance, but obviously skeptical. I get home and pop Sacred 2 - Fallen Angel into the PS3. It loads up and I see the menu screen; it looks good so far but not TRULY impressed. Then the game starts...\nMy jaw touched the floor after seeing the game, and stayed there after playing it for 5+ hours my first night. Don't let my play time on STEAM fool you, I have accumulated several hundred hours on this game and let me tell you, it is all around perfect with so much replayability its unbelieveable. The graphics are spot-on, the world is truly the biggest map I've ever played in for an RPG, and the music is immersive as well as diverse. Though, the "catch-phrases" or little dialouge bits each character has can get quite repetitive, yet does not take to much away from the game it self. But sadly Ascaron is out of business but it is still WAY better and 100% worth the $20 bucks on STEAM (heck, it was even $40 when it came out, so the game has always been worth the purchase). Honestly my personal favorite underrated RPG, and the music used is from Blind Guardian so how can you complain with that? 9.5/10 only beacuse the graphics are a bit dated and the catch-phrases can get old, overall still worth it, so stop reading and get exploring!","February 10, 2015","true","40.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If this is a problem i hear someones made a camera mod to turn this into a more 3rd person style game.\n\nThe map certainly looks sizeable, theres alot of questing around to do that leads you through the areas with wow style "kill this, collect that, go there"\n\nI guess my only down side is probably my doubts about what the game "might" hold for long term playability. the skills system seems a little confused and the characters can be a little ambiguous as to their themes and flavour. Theres some areas where they couldve really excelled such as black smithing which as far as i know, is just a case of augmenting found items. I wouldve hoped for a proper craft creation system that allows you to invest and enrich your character.\n\nThey couldve had guild systems which allow for immense diversity in the characters you play. The click and loot thing can get a bit boring after a while.\n\nOn the whole, i think you could agree that at the sale prices this game goes for sometimes, its definitely worth a try i would say, i only hope that its a passion that keeps me hooked for months rather than just a "me too" of diablo 2 that dries up half way through, the open world possibilities could really make this a rare and unknown gem.\n\nSo why not give it a go?","October 20, 2015","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can still play co-op via LAN (Hamachi / Tunngle). If you buy, be sure to download the latest Community Patch!

Player customization is pfft, item generation is diablo-esque, and prepare for lots of frustrating terrain, simple combat, and a dismally low level of environmental interaction. Camera is limited, AI is buggy. I would wait for a killer sale or else not bother with this title.","September 11, 2013","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In fact you know foes are around provided to the mini map.  In caves, more time than you'd like, the foe is not aimable cause of a wall or an ally.

The classes you can choose from are all pretty interesting and the character customization is quite deep. The normal edition of Sacred 2 was incredibly unstable and buggy, but it seems to have been fixed with the gold edition. The only complaint I have is that controlling your character feels a little stiff sometimes.","January 5, 2013","true","105.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's even better with friends.\nA fun RPG experience with tons of quests, a large map with no hardly any load screens, lots of loot, and even the metal band Blind Guardian.\n\n+ Great graphics considering the scale of the world and amount of content\n+ Physics being ragdolls and debris to kick around, totally mindless, pointless fun, but I adore it all the same\n+ Kick-[butt] soundtrack feat. Blind Guardian as themselves, and for a side-quest no less.\n+ Enough classes to choose from that everyone is likely to find their class(es) of choice\n+ Hardcore RPG for hardcore role-players\n+ Challenging moments\n+ Tons of loot\n+ Doesn't take itself too seriously\n+ Carrier imp\n+ Soooooo many quests\n+ Tons of replayability\n+ Fun with friends\n+ Art style has a very Todd McFarlane feel to it\n+ Blends science fiction and medieval fantasy for an amazing world\n\n- Too much bloom, my eyes begin to hurt after a while\n- The voice acting\n- Casual role-players, or action seekers will quickly turned off by combat and massive amount of class customization\n- Character creation too limited (female characters can choose hairstyle from about 4 styles, and hair color from an RGB slider, all classes can choose skin color, except for Temple Guardian)\n- Servers were shut down long ago, LAN only (unless you run specific software)","October 29, 2013","true","49.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
