For example, there is a section with a memory-type puzzle, where you have to step on a grid of tiles in the correct sequence to pass. However, the floor is completely dark, so you can't even tell which tile you're standing on. Even if you've memorized the sequence, you still have to make leaps of faith in the darkness and hope you land on the right tile.\n\nIf it takes you 2 hours to solve a puzzle that could be solved in 10 seconds with the lights on, that's a pretty poorly designed puzzle.","November 8, 2015","false","8.0"," 129 of 146 people (88%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","88","129","146","8","3"

Sometimes you may be required to do a little platforming as well which isn’t perfect but not too terrible either. The sections with traps requiring you to use surrounding hints to find solution of avoiding traps were particular nice. Other than such moments, most of you time you will be just going on exploration and scavenger hunts in the game. Reach from start to end and find out any items or keys that you may need to unlock the next portion of the game.\n\nThroughout the game you can find hidden collectables called ‘relics’. These add some nice replayability to the game. The relics are well hidden and should prove a nice challenge to players attempting to gather them.\n\nDoorways is something to look into. I loved the atmosphere, the music, and all the creepy, subtle effects. I think everything came together to create a memorable experience, in the end, despite some of the nagging issues.","January 19, 2014","true","5.4"," 82 of 96 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","82","96","2","3"

This isn't the case now, and had I know that I wouldn't have paid this price for the game. As beautiful as it is, it's not worth the price for half a game riddled with glitchyness. Not to mention the devs removing/locking threads which are unfavourable. If you can find it super cheap, grab it up for sure, but don't hope for anything past chaptesr 1 & 2.

In the last review that I wrote, The Hat Man: Shadow Ward, I did complain that the game was dark, but little I did know that there was a game WAY worse in terms of darkness. I had to literally play with the in-game brightness at 10 (maximum), my laptop brightness at 100% and still open the Intel Graphics Center and turn it up to 50 so I could play this game. How can you even play something if you're barely seeing it? How is that even fun?\n\nNevertheless the game is pretty simple, and it ain't bad, it's just meh, but since the only way it makes itself difficult is by using darkness, it's a bad design choice and overall lazy one. It definitely needed a bit more work. Regarding bugs and such I had no technical problems.\n\nThere is one thing though, being a dual monitor user, and playing the game in one monitor, the game never locks the mouse in it's window, so this means if the mouse pointer is on the other monitor and I click it, the game's minimized. This happened about 10 times, but it's just a slight annoyance. The game also runs well at a constant 60 frames per second.\n\nAnother problem I found is the torch. You lit up the torch and it lasts for about 10 seconds. Last time I checked that's not how torches work... And once more, the game relies on this mechanic to make itself harder, which just results in frustration.\n\nWhile being short in length and having some good-looking sections (mostly in chapter 2), which are definitely ruined by the lack of lightning, I'm still intereted in Chapters 3 and 4, but it's a very "ehhhh" start for the series. #BrighterHorror 4/10","April 16","false","3.5"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","0"

The setting is creepy, dark, and beautifully done. Levels vary from being outside with walls of spikes all around you to the interior of old, dark castles.\n\nThe game tries to scare you, but doesn’t do a great job doing so, but there are some pretty scary moments, like being chased by a huge statue when you can only see 5 feet in front of you, or when you’re running through the darkness hoping your torch doesn’t die out leaving you vulnerable to the ghosts that dwell there. The fear from this game comes more from psychological things instead of physical objects or beings, like seeing a man being tortured with a device intended to rip the flesh from your bones. All that and the grainy visual effects still are not enough to make this game reach the level of horror they were probably attempting to achieve.\n\nThere are notes and small statues you can search around for, while the statues unlock achievements, the notes are basically the only story there is in this game, and it could have been done better.\n\nPros:\nBeautiful environments.\nSome fun moments.\nVoicing by Sam A.

However there are many bad things about this game. I even made you a list!\n-The tutorial level is unbelievably laggy compared to the rest of the game, maybe because the entire level loaded at once.\n-Walk in the dark, pick up a thing, rinse and repeat. We're getting GOTY with these revolutionary mechanics.\n-Jump scares are substituted for things that could actually be scary, you know, like a story.\n-When the level loads a different area, there is no loading screen, the game cuts to black and fades back. It feels jagged.\n-Some parts are just way too dark. Even with the gamma turned up, you won't be able to discern different symbols in front of you, symbols which will determine if you live or become a giant shishkabob.\n\nBut don't add this to your cart and delete it from your cart yet! This game has some redeeming factors!\n-The setting is great, really. The maps aren't the most creative, but they serve their purpose well when they aren't dark.\n-The sound is fun. It will make you feel as if there's someone around you or even BEHIND YOU RIGHT NOW! AAAHH!!\n-Because it's a standard horror game, they don't waste time introducing quirky mechanics you'll use once and then never again. It takes 5 minutes for hem to teach you what you need to know and you're off.\n-The first "monster" you come across (and the only one I've seen so far) has a pretty basic design, but still manages to be freaky after seeing it 500 times.\n\nI'd only recommend this game to people who like horror games and only if they want something a little lighter. The story won't give you existential depression, the monsters won't give you nightmares, you won't have to sleep between mommy and daddy when you finish Chapter 1, it's a very relaxed horror game.","March 6, 2015","true","3.9"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","16","17","0","0"

The story and the way it's told, is very fascinating; it's mixed by surrealism and true events/locations: you're guided through a maze-styled path and have to find your way out by recovering gears and other stuff, which are part of mini/easy puzzles.\n\nThe game is quite short, I'd say 2 hours and a half - don't look at my playtime, I farmed cards before playing and left the game open several times to do other things.\n\nI encountered some technical problems too, not a big deal though: the menu is very slow, even in-game when you have to select items from your inventory and that is quite annoying.\nI also had a very low framerate (around 20FPS) @1080p with low quality settings but also at 720p, medium quality settings - my graphic card is a Radeon HD5550, not a very good one, I know, but I think the game could be better optimized (we're not talking about a pumped-up AAA title).\nFinally, moving the camera with my mouse was a bit of a pain, because it was like "swinging" around to turn 45° and I couldn't find any setting to adjust.\n\nVerdict: Got "Doorways: Chapter 1 & 2" for FREE and I enjoyed it quite a lot, so I'm going to recommend it too.","October 18, 2015","true","7.1"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","19","25","0","2"

After 5 minutes in game during the tutorial I noticed how the sound was looping, the ambient music, the effects, the wailing in the distance. Now, I am well aware that games like Penumbra & Amnesia which have clearly inspired Doorways commit the same looping but their loops tend to be a little longer than 20 seconds so I was let down in that regard, fair enough, I'm here for the gameplay. I played on.\n\nThe level design itself is rather poor, from the very first moment you step out of the tutorial you realize that rather than expand upon the rather basic controls & level structure shown in the first few minutes, the game will simply apply the same rigid poorness to every area. Whether you are meant to be outside or inside it always feels like you're stuck in a rather poor Time Splitters 2-esque custom map from 2002. Add in the issues with the sound & atmosphere and you can already tell I was getting rather bored within 20 minutes.\n\nOutside of the structure of the levels the graphics themselves are middle of the road for an independent horror game without much financial support, so that is not a problem to me, however the issue with the graphics & levels is that when you step into a new area the screen goes black for a split second and loads things up. You want to see a ghost? You'll know when because the screen will blink. I have absolutely no idea of what goes into coding but this is not good enough, it's like refreshing a screamer website!\n\nIs Doorways as good as a screamer website though?\nNo.\n\nThe shocks did not make me jump or lose my footing, the atmosphere of the game left me with a rather sarcastic expression after every attempted tension building moment, and the ideas behind the killings & horror is so trope based I wanted to become a Yorkshireman and hang myself with t'rope I have handy in my DIY kit in order to stop the pain.\n\nDid I keep on playing? Yes, I didn't immediately turn the game off after tasting my salty disappointment because I did enjoy the implementation of basic floor tile/memory jumping within a castle. That may sound dull but within the confines of this game it was the peak of the experience for me. Still, after chapter 1, boredom once again crept in like a badly designed giant enemy in chapter 2.\n\nThe one upside is my boredom didn't last very long!\n\nNot due to any particular excitment or interest from the game but because I completed both chapters within an hour and 35  minutes. 95 minutes for two chapters of a game that I paid full price for. These two chapters amount to 50% of Doorways chapters, as you will have already done the math that means two more chapters are incoming, but there is no way I would spend money on a sequel set to Chapters 1 &2. In fact I doubt I'd even play them unless they were a free expansion to make up for the first two chapters.\n\nDoorways is lacking in longevity, ingenuity, atmosphere, and scares. It's frightening only in the sheer disappointment it offers, comparable to a once hopeful post-degree move into an empty dreary admin assistant job market.\n\nAvoid, if you're looking for new atmospheric horror right now I'd suggest having a long break after you finish Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs.","December 20, 2013","false","1.9"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","17","23","0","0"

I don't really know what to call them... jump quests? jump on the tiles quests? etc etc I'm assuming these were the "puzzles" mentioned. I found my willingness to explore evaporating as I squinted into more and more dark corners. Stuck? don't know where to go? can't find a way on? retrace your steps. Even though the game appears to be very (very) linear it still wants you to wander through many obstacles into dead ends to collect things, so you can turn around and have to make your way through those same obstacles in order to get out.\n\nIt feels like a college project. It has some nice ideas but they're not well implemented. When you compare it to the other games available out there in this genre it really doesn't hold up. The storyline might have been fun but the game was too irritating for me to be able to appreciate it. The controls are clunky (as a KB/mouse user anyway).","December 10, 2014","false","0.9"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DFChaotyx/recommended/248470/","DFChaotyx","DF.Chaotyҗ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DFChaotyx/","522 products in account","I was hesitant with Chapter 1 as I wasn't quite sure what to expect... which turned out to be a lot of fumbling in the pitch dark in  a few "Penumbra-esque" environments. Once I got the hang of what was going on I found myself entertained, but not necessarily thrilled. I was concerned that the next chapter, not to mention the following 3 and 4 were going to be just the same, but maybe with some skins swapping and cookie-cutter levels/puzzles.\n\nThen I got to chapter 2 and was blown away. This isn't "in your face" horror, this is subtle. The game isn't in it to make you jump out of your seat, but to let you plod along then suddenly make you sit rigid and let out a panicked "#$@!". Chapter 2 was magnificent at its pacing, letting me get just confident enough to be speeding around right before slapping me in the face with a big horrible surprise.\n\nAfter completing the first two chapters I'm super happy with the game. These chapters are not just copy/paste jobs, but offer full changes in environment, puzzles, interactions, and 'enemies'. From what I can see the last two chapters will also differ greatly from the first two, making each chapter a unique play experience, and horribly eerie in its own way.\n\nHowever, as for the bad (or atleast the not-so-good) the game offers the ability to change keyboard controls, but not for all functions; so when I bind the horrid WASD to the more preferred ESDF I couldn't understand why my torch kept going out so fast - Oh... F is bound to pull-out/put-away torch, but there's no option of that in controls, and is a forced keybind... gotcha.\n\nOn top of that, the story is a little too vague. I do appreciate the fact that the story is just subtle and vague enough to not be  an "insult to the gamer's intellegence" by being spelled out and shoved down your throat (and actually works very well to let you figure it out in your own interpretation), but it's so vague that I found the continuity confusing, and most specifically for Chapter 1, that there was no successful completion to my mission (that made any sense to me at least).\n\nThe last negative is the price point. While the game was a worthy purchase for me, I bought it on a sale for pretty cheap. Had I of spent $10 on this I might've felt a little ripped off - why? I don't know... $10 isn't much and I certaintly got a few hours of fun out of this, but the game feels 'simple' compared to the other games available in the same vein (that are also available for quite cheap).\n\nStill, despite some minor flaws, the game is short enough to not get repetative and interesting enough to hold your attention. While it may not be for everyone, fans of the horror-puzzle games (and most specifically, the third Penumbra game) will have a grand time with it... but maybe just wait for a sale.","August 4, 2014","true","3.3"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

Well, I've now owned that better computer for well over a year, so I guess the time taken to get BACK to this game doesn't quite suggest that I found it all that "compelling" the first time around.\n\nComing back to it though, I gotta say, it actually stacks up EXTREMELY well next to a lot of the cheap, "indie" horror games which have come out since.  It's maybe never quite "inspired", but Doorways: Prelude is consistently solid.  Very solid.  BRICK solid.  Almost the textbook definition of "solid".\n\nSo what exactly does the gameplay comprise of, you ask?  Is it a traditional "survival horror", in the vein of the early Resident Evil and Silent Hill games?  No.  Definitely not.  Is it more like a post-Amnesia: The Dark Descent "stealth horror" game, a la Outlast and Alien: Isolation?  Again...no, not really, but definitely getting warmer.  Is it a...gulp..."walking simulator", then?  Well...hmmm...again, no.  Not really.  But kinda.  But really kinda not, considering how many opportunities the game gives you to DIE.\n\n"SO WHAT THE HELL KINDA HORROR GAME IS IT, THEN?!" I hear you scream, in mounting frustration.  Well, hmmm...lemme think a sec...I guess it's really a bunch of quite different and varied "mini-games", and therein lies the difficulty in trying to nail it all down.  This isn't a BAD thing, though, when the vast majority of said "mini-games" are actually rather GOOD "mini-games" - don't spend too long in the dark or die, find the correct path across the trap-laden floor, that kinda thing - and the overall game ultimately serves up oodles of what horror gamers generally seek the most:  Spooky and interesting locations, puzzles which are challenging but not TOO tricky, and spooky atmosphere and (fairly minor) scares aplenty.\n\n"BUT ARE THERE ENEMIES?" I hear you ask next, still not quite convinced what it is that you'll be buying if you throw down your hard-earned dosh for this game.  Um...again, no easy, regular answer to this question, but my best attempt would be:  Yes.  Sometimes.  Sort of.  Though not generally in the "traditional" sense.  But as I mentioned above, there's no end of ways to meet your demise, so don't fret if you're a member of the "not another ♥♥♥♥ing walking simulator" crowd.  Rest assured, unless you're a much more competent gamer than myself - not hard, admittedly - you're not liable to complain that you didn't cark it enough times in the course of your play-through (which, for the record, is probably somewhere in the three to five hour range, making it kinda short but sufficiently sweet).  There's certainly a fair element of trial-and-error style gameplay, though it's certainly no Limbo in that regard, and the save/check-points are frequent enough to never render it TOO frustrating in that department.\n\nSure, there's a few things wrong with it:  It's insanely dark (I mean visually, not just tonally!), but once you crank your brightness up a little it's fine (and don't feel guilty for doing so...I certainly didn't, 'cause it really is borderline unplayable in parts if you DON'T).  And sure, the whole "here's a static, cut-screen image of a spooky little girl to signify your death" thing is usually a sure-fire sign of cheap AND nasty, but somehow it seems justifiable enough in the way it's used in this game, and if you stick around long enough, you WILL encounter "enemies" which actually MOVE (but I won't spoil that for you).\n\nSo what about the price?  Well, it's possibly a tad steep at ten bucks, so unless you're frankly unconcerned by such things, I'd probably wait for a sale.  In any case, I'm taking it as a good sign of what's to come in the two episodes released since, and if it's any kind of incentive, I just purchased said remaining episodes on the strength of re-playing this one (granted, in a sale)!  I can only assume that the games get BETTER as they progress, and if so, this is a pretty bloody good start.\n\nVerdict: 9/10.","January 12","true","8.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

The graphics are uninteresting, and largely monochromatic.  In a cavern?  Right, lets make everything a blue-gray color.  Much of the game world is copy and pasted, or otherwise pitch dark to conceal that there is nothing in it.  Traversing the game world seems more akin to a carnival "house of horrors" where you trudge from point A to point B and if you go off the path the wrong way there's either a dead end or a "boo!" scare to put you back on track.\n\nThere are a few puzzles, but they won't tax you, and you're likely to find most of the challenge in the platforming bits.  That's right...  platform jumping.  The bridge section, for instance.  Oh, the bridge section...  if anything underlines how one-dimensional and linear this game is, it's the bridge section.  You're on a big broken up bridge...  you have to find the right path to get to the other side...  a creepy girl keeps popping up who stands in your way... basically, go the path that doesn't have her and you have the correct path.  The jumping was the toughest part, as your path is rather obvious.\n\nThe game is an incoherent mess and the poor designers of this game are so out of their ken.  Even with the readables the story is almost non-existent and there are no NPCs.  In fact, there are no enemies, so there is little to actually be afraid of.  In Chapter 1 I'm looking for one person, but in Chapter 2 I'm looking for someone else, without ever having found the first target.  This game makes no sense.  And it's boring.  And it's slow!  Why is this piece of ♥♥♥♥ game so laggy when nothing is happening!?  I've played far more graphically intense games on this rig and none have suffered the sort of hemmorrhaging this game limps along on.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the developer of the game originally marketed this as a multi-chapter game with the implication being that after you purchased the game you'd get the other chapters.  However, after chapter 2 was released, and just prior to chapter 3 being released, they changed the name of the game from simply 'Doorways' to 'Doorways: Chapter 1 & 2' and announced that chapter 3 was going to be a separate product.  It's their game(s?), so they can do as they wish, but the first two chapters can be breezed through in an hour or two, it's hardly scary or interesting or stimulating.  Don't bother.","September 2, 2014","false","3.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

There is some potential even if the first two chapters are not going to come across very strong. The first chapter isn't very good, relying on the fact that you can barely see in the dark for its 'challenge' factor, which is really more exasperating than anything, but it still didn't take long to get through.\n\nThe second chapter is more of a traditional puzzle environment with some audio/visual creepiness to it, but is by no means very scary. I did want to play through these games to see where the Doorways series is going though, and overall, each one improves in art quality and game design.\n\nThis specific purchase is Chapters 1 and 2, with 'Doorways Underworld' being Chapter 3. Having played through all 3, there isn't any real reason to play 1 and 2 in terms of narrative or world building that I could see and 3 is probably the most fleshed out in terms of having interesting mechanics, so it wouldn't be wrong to skip straight to it unless you just want to make sure to see all the series has to offer.\n\nUltimately, you are going to be playing a low budget, small dev team game, so keep that in mind when you judge it if you decide to pick it up.","March 20","true","2.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Only the first two chapters have been released so far.\nThe story is about a private investigator tasked with seeking out a group of suspected murderers. These killers have names like “The Professor” and “The Sculptor”,  but the attempt to tie the world thematically to their respective case files feels dissatisfying. Unlike most episodic games, the "chapters" here are woven together without obvious narrative breaks and at this point it is just not clear what exactly you are supposed to achieve besides uncovering the truth about these murderers.\nThe gameplay is simple, you move through dark forest and the dark castle corridors, avoiding a few traps and collecting various objects so that you might in turn pull levers and activate switches.\nThis game is not scary at all. The puzzles are too easy and the story is not interesting.\nThe graphics are not worth to mention.\nThe voice acting and sound is good but not more.\nThe game does not deserve the title "Horror game" it is boring and can not deliver a good horror atmosphere. It is more a jump & run in the dark. Mostly you have to jump from one platform to another or you have to jump over traps.\nThe biggest scare of Doorways is that there will be more episodes like this one and you will have to pay for it. You should better take a look at the Amnesia series or Outlast. Also you can check out the free game Cry of Fear.

I'm really finicky about what Early Access stuff I do go in on and while the trailer with all of the static, agonized human statues piqued my interest, I opted to let the game sit on my wishlist until it was out of EA and on sale.  I finally got around to this bundle this past October, since like most Steam indies, it ended up in a never ending back log of shame and excitement (shamecitement?).\n\nThe first chapter featured some basic puzzles and fleeting jump scares, though the style of the models bordered somewhere between an amateur aesthetic and illustrator intent aiming for a "not quite real" art style.  It wasn't distracting, though it did harken back to the late 90's/early 00's, and I'd be lieing if I didn't feel a little nostalgic going back to a world with that level of fidelity.\n\nThe second chapter was a marked improvement, and I ended up appreciating its Amnesia-esque, crumbling castle setting much more.  I felt like I could feel the developers improving in their ability to build a functional, good looking product as I progressed through the plot.  The game never really felt horrifying, but there was something about the enemies in Chapter 2 that was really unsettling.  I'm not sure if it was uncanny valley rearing its not-quite-ugly-enough head, but it added the hint of creepiness the game needed to establish the atmosphere the developers seemed to be aiming for.  The puzzles were also a little more involved, reminding me of Penumbra and older point-and-click adventures from way back.  Though the game ended abruptly, I have Chapter 3 waiting in my backlog and as of this writing I hear Chapter 4 is in Early Access, so I'm curious to see where the series goes from here.\n\nOther stand out features from this game include the narrations provided by Amnesia alumni, Sam A. Mowry.  Before looking up the voice actor, I was convinced the voice was somehow modified or synthesized.  The delivery is ominous and is almost too powerful, making the main character feel like something more paranormal than a regular dude.  The plot was also a tad confusing, as the opening exposition makes it seem like you're some sort of detective, though as the story progresses it seems like something more is going on the player hasn't been made fully aware of.\n\nI wouldn't drop dough on this if you're expecting a solid horror game, but for the right price it's a nice novelty that excels at showing a development team grow and improve at their craft.","November 26, 2015","true","3.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Seems like there is some kind of fog or something over the screen as a filter making it more difficult to see.  Makes me want to clean my screen  which doesnt help  make the game playable.  This game may be good but designers like this lose sight of the gfact that to play a game we kinda need to see the game.  This game uses Oculus Rift, giving the whole game a fisheye look, I guess that is what Oculus people like to play games as a fish in the dark?\n\nBeing innovative in design doesnt mean they should make games so dark their unplayable, maybe they made it so dark to hide how bad it is so people would just turn it off and uninstall it like I did.  For those who would like to see how NOT to make a game, be sure to play this game, also the controls using a controller make no sense really, they seem made up by a madman choosing random features to put on random buttons.  For some reason the bumpers move things back and forth like penumbra which is odd as if the character is so weak they cant lift anything, so like Penumbra you go around nudging everything, maybe the main character should be called the Nudger, a new type of super hero who goes around nudging things.\n\nRating:  0/10  Value:  $0.00","November 9, 2013","false","0.3"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","8","15","2","0"

The actual scares are either laughably easily avoided or are merely a "don't go in the darkness." First person perspective, but plenty of platforming. Darkness abounds but you're meant to find clues.

It has an excellent atmosphere, soundtrack, and the voice acting (for the most part) is well done and fits the mood of the game. The graphics themselves are not terrible, the textures leave something to be desired but it all goes into the atmosphere and really blends.\n\nThe Bad - Firstly, this game is too dark; Its not uncommon to get turned around and completely lose sense of direction because you can't see further than 8ft in front of you. Secondly, the story (as such far) doesn't make a lick of sense. I won't into spoilers but, the first chapter ends abruptly with little to no closure and story continous onto the next psychopath. The narrative constantly flip-flops on whether or not these events are all psychological or physically present. Thridly, the puzzles in the game are far too easy, they can be compared with puzzles from the Uncharted series as they practically show you the solution, you just have to do it. And lastly, its too short; It only takes about an hour to go through the whole thing on a first playthrough, subsequent playthroughs are almost twice as fast.\n\nOVERALL - As of this moment, I do not recommend it. For the amount of time it takes to beat it, coupled with the ridiculously bad storytelling; Doorways is an extremely forgettable title.\n\n**This review is likely to change once the final two chapters are released. However, it's been nearly six months since Chapters 1 & 2 released, and Saibot Studios hasn't even hinted at giving a release date. Doorways looks to be dead in the water.","February 9, 2014","false","4.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The controls, as per usual with this kind of games using Unity Engine, feel a bit clunky and extra problems come from the engine itself, which can be a resource hog when using dynamic lights and other effects.\n\nI have no complaints, the game is around 3 hours long, you can 100% easily (something I love given how little time I have to play) but it suffered from Steam opening the floodgates and, of course, the really poor decision of separating the chapters into further releases instead of integrating them to the base game. However, still hope they can eventually finish the last chapter!\n\nGive it a try if you got it during discount season, which was my case and I'm sure many others.

Its nothing ground breaking but there's some good spine tingler moments and the overall atmosphere of the game is well constructed. The music and SFX lend themselves well and the graphics are quite reasonable. On the bad side there doesn't appear to be a great deal of plot and what there is doesn't seem to make that much sense (maybe I missed some clues?) and for a good portion of the game (especially the first Chapter) the landscape is so dark you literally cannot see where you're going. The puzzles aren't particularly challengingm and the game itself is quite short. (I cleared Chapter 2 in about an hour) Will hold off completely on the final verdict until I've seen a few more chapters but at the moment we're going with an acceptable 7/10","March 1, 2014","true","4.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I found myself replaying several sections in both chapter 1 and 2 simply because I had no idea what I was doing.\n\nDue to the nature of the game having little to no hints as to what the player is supposed to do next is something that I respect because if I knew were all the items were or knew exactly what I was doing then that would have taken the fun away drastically.\n\nChapter 1 didn’t have any boss fights but chapter 2 had several, well there was one sequence were you have to dodge the statues with spears. That was an amazing section in my eyes.\n\nI can respect Saibot for choosing not to overdo it with the jump scares but when they did do the jump scares were somewhat lacking.\n\n\nSound Design\nWere Doorways might lack in horror elements I think Saibot really stepped up with their sound design which led to an amazing atmosphere to the game. Some sections the sound would constantly loop the same song which would get quite annoying.\n\nThe Verdict\nAlthough Doorways is listed as a Survival horror game by the developer, yet there are no survival elements to the game whatsoever. It is unclear as to where this idea came from or the genre choice might be a misinterpretation of what the survival horror genre actually is.\n\nDoorways certainly surprised me with great environments, environment progression, and puzzle complexity. With chapter 2 completely changing the gameplay was a very impressive thing to do.\n\nDuring the ending section of chapter 1 the jumpscare/screamer thing was sort of pointless as I thought it would jump out and chase me or at least fly towards my screen then disappear which it didn’t.\n\nThe second time around with the same scare looked rise and repeated which took away what little horror elements the game had. In terms of horror this game would be quite poor however the game provided a scare when there needed to be or made the playing feel powerless during chapter 2 which lifted my hopes for chapter 3 and 4.\n\nSo hopefully Saibot Studios can out do themselves with the final chapters and answer some of the questions I have with the game.\n\nDoorways chapter 1 and 2 gets a 6/10\n","November 22, 2014","true","8.6"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

You do this by walking, jumping, pushing&pulling (which I only saw in the tutorial, I think) activating switches/buttons and simple "find Item A and put it somewhere else"\n\nThe graphics are sub par. The light/darkness-ratio is okay on my machine. You can balance the gamma with two bars in the option screen, but everything looks still grayish-dark or muddy-dark after that. Nothing really stands out and catches your eye, so I just waltzed through everything being bored. The blandness of the textures would maybe go unnoticed, if the environment had more details (empty shelfes, empty walls, empty floores, empty.. well, pretty much everything looks lifeless/without detail). The best example would be the basement with torture rooms you visit at the end of chapter 1. There is not a single sign of them ever being used. No blood, no body parts, no decaying corpses. It's just sterile (in a run down kinda way) with to much wasted floor space.\n\nThe ambient sound loops pretty soon, maybe after 30 seconds, I didn't really time it. It certainly doesnt add the atmosphere, as it doesn't build any tension. The narrator helps in getting you interested, as at least here you may feel a little more tension here, though the texts are very generic and bland.\n\nHorror/Gore/jump scares and scary story wise this game is a 1 out of 10. Same goes for the story. I just noticed now, that although your character says, that he is a cop, you never really feel that way. He could be a plumber or scientist and it would still just be a label to him, seeing that you never really have any kind of character growth or further characterization with him.\n\nOn the plus side: You get cards, achievments and maybe better content in the later chapters. 3&4 are still in development and hopefully the team learned from past mistakes.","May 20, 2014","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its not easy to satisfy me and after playing games like penumbra or amnesia, something like DORRWAYS cant even match with em right? Well not really. Dont get me wrong the game isnt as awsome, yet it has some features that penumbra or other classics are missing.\n\npros:\n-The atmophere is great, aswell as the soundtrack is quite fitting\n- Confuses the player about whats going on, yet its a "good" kind of confusion, one that fits the genre\n- Enjoyable story, that makes you feel like a jackass hunting down psychopaths and stuff, yet at the same time makes you feel unsafe. This feature exposes your trueself and makes you see the diffrence between "who you are" and "who you claim to be" in REAL LIFE\n- Awsome and detailed graphic for most\n\ncons:\n- Some graphics are dull and repetitive. It reminds me of SCP: containment breach\n- Mechanics are not as elaborate as amnesia or penumbra. I know this isnt really a con, but if you happened to play any other game that allows more interaction with objects than DOORWAYS does, you will notice a major downfall and you may feel like the controls are stiff.\n- You may also consider that all psychopath stuff is ripped of from OUTLAST. Even thou I havent played that game yet I have to agree yet I think DOORWAYS takes another perspective in this thread. Call this a pro or con depends on an individual ;)\n\nSumming up I recommend this game. I find it enjoyable and worth its price :)","March 16, 2014","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To be honest this game is less horror and more mystery/walking simulator/puzzle esc. There are no Monsters except for enviromental traps, although one type of monster(if you can call it that) did show up and it did manage to give me the chills.\n\nThe Pros:\n\n- Writing: This game is very well written with the notes you find, along with the narration, which the voice actor does a damn good job.\n- Gameplay: The game plays fine, its not spectacular, but compared to most horror games I've played through steam, just to have a horror game that functions as intented is a plus.\n- Torture chamber devices, - some of the torture devices you encounter were pretty original which i found entertaining. +\n-\n\nThe Cons:\n\n- Boring : This game is boring, there are no enemies, the ones you encounter are part of the enviroment, except for one, and that part only lasts 30 seconds.\n- The Lighting: This game is stupidly dark most of the time. I know dark enviroments are a plus, and in this game there are parts where you need to constantly light a torch to get through areas or you'll die. But some areas in general were just WAAAYYY to dark to even see what i was doing, which were during certain platform-esc sections , i basically had to have all ights off in the room and squinting at my TV just to see what the heck i was doing\n- Music: It seems to loop alot, gets kinda annoying and repetitive.\n\nOverall I found this game ok as a Horror experience, i see many people feel differently about the Horror aspect, and they are entitled to their opinions. I found the game creepy throughout and had a cupple scary parts, but dont espect quality like Outlast or Alien Isolation. I know this game is on sale now for a cupple bucks and if you were thinking of picking this up at any time now would be perfect.","February 13, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I stopped early in chapter 1 and uninstalled.\n\nThe first hour or two of the game consist of trudging through an unexplained strange terrain, with "spooky" music and sound effects, while occasionally picking up extremely vague and disjointed notes that appear to have no connection at all. Deadly ghosts may appear, apparently only to serve as a very startling "try again". The only "challenges" consisted of dragging something in order to jump from it, a "move between checkpoints before your torch is extinguished" puzzle (otherwise something goes "boo" and kills you), and very simple "jumping over a chasm" puzzles.\n\nThere is no explanation of who you are, why you are there, why you are seeing ghosts and hearing spooky noises. Basically, the first hour is walking in a straight line while things go "boo" at you, which after the initial heart-pounding is just plain annoying. The only challenge is to endure this linearity while things try to startle you.\n\nNow, compare this to other games.\n\nIn Amnesia: The Dark Descent, you don't know who you are or where you are *as part of the plot* and that is made *immediately* known to you. Which is an awesome hook. Also the puzzles are rather clever, progress is often not linear, and you actually have some action - albeit you can only run & hide rather than any fighting. But, hiding someplace dark with your head down while *something* seems to be shuffling its (feet? tentacles? body?) outside provides a true atmosphere of genuine horror. Being startled is a less-used aspect of the game, whereas finding tinder for your lamp so your character doesn't go insane from the horror of being in the dark too long is much more satisfying and works a whole lot better. If you want a real "horror" experience, that's the one for you.\n\nIn Deadspace, they rely on startling you quite a bit, so if that's what you like, head on there. But, over there you know who you are and why you're there, and while some aspects of what occurred where you are remain unknown for a good while, hints are everywhere and it's very clear the place had a clear function that has turned into a horror scene. While the ultimate causes remain mysterious, the actual occurrences are not and are merely a sign of how screwed up an otherwise ordinary place has become. So again that works much better. Also, you get to actually fight whatever jumps at you rather than a bland "try again", and other action (e.g. zero gravity, zero pressure environments) is very fun and very satisfying.\n\nNow, you may think I just have a short attention span, and maybe I do and this game deserves a more thorough examination - but I don't think so. Both of the games I mentioned gave me much more entertainment in the first 5 minutes than this was able to deliver in an hour. There I cared about the characters, here I suddenly realized that I don't give a damn what happens to this nameless character with no motivation in a place we don't know how or why the character got to and no attempt is made to explore this or even acknowledge it.\n\nBottom line: Not worth your time.","April 12, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The fun has gone out of the game...actually it's been gone for some time now, but I persisted.\n\nCons:\nBoring lame and predicatble story which has zero original content. OMG the overly dark wasteland/woods section which left you lost and even trial and error didn't help. And the endless beam balancing fiasco could have been 3 times shorter then it was, I only fell off because i got bored.\nSluggish controls and overly fidderly button combinations that ruin game play and get you killed.\nI tried a mouse and keyboard after having less luck with a controller....no dice both where flawed.\nIt kind of feels like some ones first attempt ...like a school project. The stories circulating the net of the game makers giving up on it's development moving on to other projects feel justified.\n\nPros: None zip zilch....god I hope the other chapters are better than one and two....alot bettter....","December 19, 2015","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
