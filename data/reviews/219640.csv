It was one of the reasons I got Steam in the first place.\n\nIn the beggining, it was awesome. There were a few bugs and crashes and what-not but nothing overwhelming that caused me not want to play it. Every now and again there would be an update that would add this map or fix this bug, etc.\n\nAs you can tell, I have alot of time put into this game. I know every map, every bug, every exploit, everything about this game.\n\nSo why am I not reccommending this game, despite all the fun I had with it?\nThe same pesky little bugs are still not fixed. Some of these have been with the game since launch.\nDevelopers apparently do not care about these bugs.\nEvery week or two there's a new "update" which in reality is another wave of skins and paid cosmetic items. In these "updates" there are no bug fixes or gameplay improvements. AT ALL. (OK, maybe there are some, BUT!) Whenever there IS a bugfix it's something they ♥♥♥♥ed up with the previous update, or they just fix 100 things you would never think about, thus things that don't really affect your experience. Always ignoring the big old bugs.\nOptimization is still a load of bull. Especially new maps.\nThis game can't handle alot of players at the same time, so if you go into those massive 40+ player servers with epic battles, you will see how everyone has at least 150-200 ping, even though the ping-o-meter says they're fine.\nNowadays most players have very high rank, so new people have absolutely no way to evolve and be able to enjoy the game unless they become highly dedicated to this game.\nAll high rank players know the animation exploits a.k.a. "Dragging", which makes it almost impossible and incredibly difficult for a newbie to stand any chance. (Many believe that dragging is intentionally put in by the developers, and it might just be so, but the mechanic still unbalances the game for new people. Drag in competitive all you want, but it destroys the game when constantly used in regular play.)\nGame often crashes.\nDue to the high amount of ranked players, Free for Alls have become a joke, where high-ranks simply ignore eachother and pursue anyone who's not as good as them. Literally teaming against the noobs, because dragging amongst themselves is simply too much work. And when there are no noobs in the match, everyone just looks at eachother doing nothing and spamming "COME HITHER" or just chatting with the in-game voices, and if anyone dares to try to kill someone, that someone is utterly ♥♥♥♥♥ to death until they leave the game.\nThey removed the first-person death mechanic. Before when someone chopped your head off you would still view the world from your head, now it just goes to third person. Which is utterly boring.\nDeadliest Warrior. Yes that DLC is a con itself. Why? Because that game has better training than Medieval Warfare ever did. Goes to show you how, if presented with money and a brand, these devs will go out to make things actually good, but ignore their own game's flaws in the process.\nThe game's community is very toxic, speak the wrong thing or attack the server's favourite and get kicked, admins have no problem in kicking you if your lag spikes for one second or if you best them in combat. And complaining about exploits or bugs is seen as weak and noobish.\nThere have been several cases of censorship in the forums. People end up getting banned from posting because they criticized the game. Shows you what kind of people you're dealing with.\nIf you're trying to adress a problem with the game, this community will ridicule you and belittle you in any way they can.\n\nBut you must be thinking, it can't be ALL bad, right?\n\nCorrect, the game isn't just bad game development and milking players for cosmetic items the devs would never have the talent to make. (At least the artists who created them get a small share of it all) There are good things in it aswell.\n\nIf you're extremely lucky you will actually find a balanced match that is fun to play and has good teamwork.\nThe in-game voice mechanics are still fun to use.\nRarely you will find a player that doesn't know how to drag, and that way you can have a nice, competitive duel that flows well since no exploits are being used.\nPlaying with friends is fun. - Let me emphasize that a bit more. If you are planning on getting this game to play with friends, then you should get it. If you're going solo, think twice.\nYou CAN meet nice people, not 100% of the community are hateful mongrels, and I have met good people through this game which I still talk to to this day. But don't expect a great much from the community in general.\nSadly, when you scale the good and the bad, the bad wins. By a longshot.\nThis game used to be alot more fun, back when it was young, now it's a husk. A joke... a joke only surpassed by the dev's obvious ignorance to the game itself.\n\nBuy it if you want but right now you'll have more fun playing with bots than online. And that's just depressing.\n\nAs soon as you reach level 15 and you get banned from the low-rank servers uninstall the game.","August 29, 2015","false","650.4"," 2,253 of 2,571 people (88%) found this review helpful 136 people found this review funny","88","253","2","136","168"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thebigblah/recommended/219640/","thebigblah","The Ultimate Potato","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thebigblah/","120 products in account","Reviewing Chivalry will not be an easy task, so make yourself comfortable while I attempt to give as legible a testimony as possible. I warn you that this is going to be a long read.\n\nChivalry as a standalone product was released in September 2012, five years after its' initial debut. It had been known beforehand as "Age of Chivalry" - one of many Half Life 2 mods. Being officially accepted into the Steam market must have been an incredible experience for the developers, which really shows in the early builds of the game. The tutorial is one of the only things that remain untouched since the release, and I could really feel the enthusiasm. It's easily one of the best tutorials I've ever seen. The voice acting is phenomenal and the early maps look & play perfectly. The level of immersion was unreal, and I've yet to see anyone come close. I'd go as far as saying that the first few weeks one of the best experiences in my entire gaming career. Everyone was amazed at the fact that the combat system played so well, and that it actually worked in an online environment with up to 32 players. The developers' enthusiasm carried on to make a few important patches, as well as new weapons. Unfortunately, however, all good things must come to an end.\n\nAt some point, Torn Banner decided to completely redo the hitbox system, into what is now known as the "bubble". They decided to fix something that wasn't broken - the hit detection. A crucial selling point of the game. Everyone opposed the change, everyone still hates it to this day, but the new system remains. You wouldn't think that changing cubic to spherical would make that much of a difference, but it did. Things were so bad that the developers decided to implement FAKE DISTANCE between the players, in a game that's very much about spacing. I can't help but compare this move governments subsidizing things that don't work. Fake distance, multiplied by your ping, means that if an enemy is moving away from you, you cannot hit them with fists or daggers, and short weapons are worse in general. Longer weapons are completely unaffected.\n\nThe next decision was to make the claymore (the sword in the game's logo) stronger. Everyone preferred the slower, more damaging weapons to the faster but weaker claymore. Despite being one of the longest weapons in the game, they also made it one of the fastest, while still being able to kill anyone in 4 hits. This instantly promoted it from slightly below average to a game-breaking absurdity, and votekicked on sight. I'm sure Torn Banner will patch this.\n\nNext up: customization. A very neat idea and executed quite well. One tiny little problem - both red and blue teams can wear a black uniform, they look almost identical. Are they going to patch it?\n\nSomewhere around this time, Vanguards (the class with the longest weapons) became glitched, because their charge attack catapulted them forwards at least three times the distance, as if they had a jetpack. These rocket Vanguards were funny at first, though they did lose their charm after a month or two. When they finally fixed the issue, it turned out that the patch broke the audio, the graphics and toggle sprint. This took another few weeks to revert back to normal.\n\nIntroduction of microtransaction hats. Great! More revenue means more patches, right?\n\nIntroduction of microtransaction weapon reskins. Guys, can you fix the claymore?\n\nIntroduction of microtransatction character reskins. Guys?\n\nIntroduction of even more hats... I think I've seen this happen before.\n\n\nIn the meantime, people had discovered a bunch of exploits. Instantly striking with gigantic, slow weapons, feinting without any stamina cost, shrinking their hitbox to the size of a football or just about anything you can think of that defies both physics and proper game design. Most of the community have enough decency not to use the claymore (they don't want to be votekicked), but by now they've figured out what works best. As a result, you see very few of the 40+ weapons ingame.\nThis was the rise of incredibly arrogant "pro" players, who are on a mission to have the highest K/D ratio possible, and throwing tantrums if they take any team damage. It is enough to google "what's the best sword" or "how to glitch through blocks", and turn Chivalry into a game of lucky hit, because no honest man can defend against that in an online environment. These players can be overwhelmed due to their lack of fundamentals, but it just isn't worth it. At this point, the fun has been completely sucked out of the game.\n\nYou may have also heard about a game called Chivalry: Deadliest Warrior. A flawless concept, and the beta was tons of fun... only it remained a beta forever. It was released as DLC for 20$ and abandoned by the devs, because they couldn't get the netcode to work.\n\n\nI find myself wondering what happened to this once fantastic, once indie game studio, and how they drove a perfectly good game into the ground, as well as failing to deliver such a promising sequel.\nHopefully, Torn Banner will attempt to improve the situation, but we all know that's not going to happen. Maybe a competent modder will do all the heavy lifting for them (for free).\n\nYou may see me ingame every now and then, but it's more for sentimental value than anything else. The new maps and other content is nice, but I'd much rather have 2012 Chivalry again.","December 21, 2014","false","457.0"," 2,089 of 2,412 people (87%) found this review helpful 131 people found this review funny","87","089","2","131","86"

But not anymore.\n\nAs time has passed more people got good at the game resulting in a lot of higher ranked players.\nNow you might think that that's a good thing. Well no, in this community it isn't.\n\nInstead of good players playing against each other you have 90% of highranks (45+) playing in team objective servers and rank stacking on the same team (usually attack side). So basically instead of having balanced fun matches most high ranked players purposefully join the team with more highranks which ends up in very unbalanced teams and an almost guaranteed win for the stacked team.\nYou really only need to look at the rank distribution at the start of a match and you can predict which team wins with 99% certainty.\n\nNot only is it unfair for the players on the other team but it makes matches just overall very boring. As someone who reached rank 50 I either join the stack and will not be challenged at all (imagine a pro soccer player playing against a 5 year old) or I join the other team and stand no chance at all.\n\nIt has been like this for quite a while but it's reached it's peak lately where you really have to search hard for a server where this doesn't happen every match. Sometimes I don't find such a server and end up not playing at all because of it.\n\nThe game has a lot of little flaws but in my opinion it's the community who in the end really ruins it. They call it a skill-based game but there is no skill involved in unbalancing teams as much as possible and winning without effort. In fact a lot of people who think that they are particularly good only think so because they simply stack all the time.\n\nThe only way to enjoy this game nowadays is if you like to play in a clan. If you are into that I can recommend it even though I'm not a huge fan of clans. Otherwise you can only join the stacking or lose nearly every match if you don't. I dont enjoy either of it and therefor this review.","May 23, 2015","false","621.3"," 2,588 of 3,054 people (85%) found this review helpful 120 people found this review funny","85","588","3","120","121"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jorisceoen/recommended/219640/","jorisceoen","JorisCeoen (GamingReviews)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jorisceoen/","299 products in account","After all these years, reaching level 54, I cannot recommend the game. I have 500+ hours on this, and all I can think of is remembering the good times. I hate this game so much because I used to love it to the point it became my most played game for almost one year. I'm gonna tell you why you should avoid this game that has become deteriorated over time (and has become less valuable than it was at release):\n\nThe good times, that was when this game didn't have regular crashes (it had none in fact). Now it crashes EVERY FIRST TIME you join the game, you Alt+F4 and then you have to again load the game. THEN it's very likely the server you wanted to join is full. You have to wait. Then it's possible that it crashes at the character screen etc... It's also possible to simply crash mid-game. I once had over 16 crashes while waiting for the server list to load. This never happened at the start.\n\nSecondly, the networking is riddled with problems. It's laggy, choppy and after a certain amount of players it's going to skip registrations of animations, hits and more. Even on 32 player server this happens from time to time. I can live with it occasionally but now it happens so frequently, most servers crash like every 30mins.\n\nThirdly, bugs, bugs and bugs. In the level design, in the combat, in the animations and the graphics. It's unbelievable how many collision problems there are in the game. The parrying is completely inconsistent, you can even block attacks coming from the back where there is no shielding whatsoever. Catapults disappear, send you to other realms, dragging is imprecise and in general the abuse of the animation movement that can happen at any time is just ridiculous.\n\nI don't want to spend much effort into the XP as it's just a gimmick, but it's funny to see how they fixed THAT particular thing that offers nothing new in the gameplay experience at all.\n\nI haven't talked about the spawnbug, but it happens... ALL the time. Players don't spawn anymore from one team and the Pings start to skyrocket. The only way is for an admin to force win or mapvote. This has been happening so many times and it's still, not, fixed, after ALL the updates in the mean time.\n\nOne of the most terrible things in Chiv is the chase system where you gain over 4 times as much speed as your opponent you're chasing to prevent endless cat and mouse. However, it's SO fast it's literally baffling. I have literally seen admins KICK players because they thought they were speedhacking, while they were simply being speed up by the game... Unbelievable. You sometimes see an enemy well out of range that faces you from the FRONT, and OFTEN (not sometimes, not occasionally, but very OFTEN) the game just dupes like always and SPEEDS HIM UP. IN FRONT OF YOU. WTF. This problem has been known forever, never fixed so far.\n\nLastly, the performance. The performance is (except for LODS) inexistant. The larger the new community maps become, the worse the performance. One big bubble of rendering all mashed together and hoping for the best.... It's what makes battle sometimes impossible. I'm running a rig that should run Chiv with ease. Crysis 1 runs almost twice as good as chiv. On top of that, the game has become a product for DLC. I appreciate the community made content and the extra stuff, and I WAS glad to support chivalry, but these updates from the last months are nothing but updates to milk out of the game. Literally, I saw update reasons listed that represented fixes for most of the maps, and NOTHING was changed. It was coördinated with the release of new DLC coupled with free weekend to make sure they could get as much as possible, without fixing any of the massively gamebreaking bugs.\n\nThe way I see it, the image of TornBanner I had when I watched their videos at the start of release and when I followed before release, it was amazing. I felt as if TornBanner was one of the rarer companies who really cared about the player base and what we wanted. I was so happy at one point that community made content would arise and would reward everyone, but I would never have though the game would still be slumbering in day-1 problems in addition to the extra problems added with each and every update. It's breaking, it's collapsing under the chaos in their code, and each new adaption just kills the game more. I thought I could go through it, but essentially, this is the line. THIS version of Chiv, I cannot recommend.\n\nRewind time 1 year and a half back, and we will meet again. As it stands now, move onto more optimised games that offer you a reliable experience without crashes, go to games that when you enter the game, at least you know what's going to happen. Not like in Chiv now.","May 31, 2015","false","780.7"," 610 of 772 people (79%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","79","610","772","28","18"

It has its upsides, but the downsides are many, and considerable.\n\nFirst, the positive.  The Team Objective maps (the original ones at least, especially Stones Hill and Dark Forest) are nice.  The fact that it's not about your K/D score makes these maps fun.  In fact, the original TO maps are the only reason I played for so long, there were just that good.  The character customization is good and there's a fair bit of variety to be had (for a price...).  Finally, the ability to hack limbs and heads off of people and to slaughter peasants is always rather cathartic.\n\nUnfortunately, none of that can hide the fact that this game has some serious, serious flaws.  The maps have places were people can get stuck, sometimes permanently and only the F10 "Suicide" key can get you out.  You always dont just bounce off of objects either, you are completely stopped.  This is fine for things like walls and trees and the like, but things like small boulders that you'd think you'd just run over do this as well.  It is very annoying to be charging at an enemy and all of a sudden get stopped by a knee-high log or something.\n\nThe mechanics are what absolutely destroys this game.   You raise your weapon or shield to properly block (looking at the point of the weapon, just like they say in the tutorial) and, somehow, you get hit anyways.  Nothing is more frustrating than to raise your tower shield and somehow get hit.  Mostly this is because the hit boxes are not very accurate, with some being disproportionately large and others smaller.  Many times I've seen or had weapons go through a person's model and no damage be recorded.  Worse are those that exploit the swing mechanics, that spin and bend and look for all the world they are going through a seizure.\n\nScenario balancing is also something that is very wonky.  Some, like Battlefield or Stones Hill, are very well balanced or at most slightly weighted to attacker or defender and doesn't impact the experience.  Others though, like Coldfront, are so dramatically skewed that it's almost unwinnable on one side.  On Coldfront, for instance, I have only seen the defenders win a total of three times in all the hours I've played.\n\nSupport is almost totally non-existant.  For every patch that Torn Banner puts out, virtually none of them have addressed the major flaws.  They have also stopped development on the game and focused on purely tweaking minor details.  I liken it to putting a band aid on a cut finger while ignoring the sucking chest wound.\n\nPricing is another matter.  This game is just not worth the $25 they ask for.  Now that being said, Chiv features prominently on Midweek Madness sales and the big Mid-Summer and -Winter sales for as low as $5, which is a perfect price for this game (and at which price I bought it during 2014's Mid-Summer sale). That being said, if you want to have access to some of the helmet variants as well as new weapon models, you have to pay for all of that.  Sometimes those models are as expensive or even more than the game itself when it's on sale.\n\nFinally, the community is one of the worst I have ever encountered.  Trolls, hackers, and scrubs inhabit every single server of Chiv, and it's nearly enough to make you try and track down the offenders in order to give them the throat punch they so justly deserve.  It's enough that it makes the worst offenders on Team Fortress 2 look like little angels.  Yes, that's how bad it is.\n\nAt one time I did enjoy this game.  At one time, I could have recommended this game.  I now find I can't do either.","August 20, 2015","false","781.5"," 305 of 371 people (82%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","82","305","371","16","3"

This review will track my progress as I log more and more hours into the game as it stands (as per this edit) I'm at 23 hours, that's just under one full day of gaming. At the end of this review, I'll try to break down pro's and con's of the game and look a little more in-depth at what the game has to offer.\n\nLevel 1\nStarting the game, you'll notice the lack of single-player options - and right you are. This game is based around purely multiplayer midieval combat. So lets start our first game. Picking a server is easy at a lower level, those highlighted in green are low-rank servers, that means players level 0 to 15. These servers generally have a high population, and cycle through the game modes.\nWhen you (or I, in this case) pick a server, you'll be able to see the current gamemode as well as current/limit players. I started with a low-pop Team Deathmatch game with 16 total players. When I hopped into the game, it was about halfway through, and as the teams were even, I got to pick a side (Agatha Knights or Mason Order). Now, these teams don't really matter all that much later on, no one will shun you for picking one over the other, but in my case I chose the Mason Order (Favorite color is Red). From there, there are four different classes.\nClasses\nArcher - Light, ranged troops. Beginner weapons are Longbow, Dagger, Crossbow, and Javelin (with optional sheild)\nMan at Arms - Light, fast troops with low armor. Beginner weapons are Sword, Axe, Mace, and Quarter Staff. (Can also dodge)\nVanguard - Heavy armored troops with increadable damage and reach, beginner weapons are Greatsword, Poleaxe, Spear, and Hammer. (Can perform a charge attack)\nKnight - Tank character with increadable armor, but slow moving. Beginner weapons are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sword, Greataxe, Hammer, and Flail.\nSo I hopped in as an archer, and immediately regretted my decision. Team deathmatch is almost squadbased, with groups of 3 or 4 charging at once, and everyone seems to have a general hatred towards archers. So, I died. A lot. Eventually I switched to a Man at Arms with the beginner shortsword. The speed was amazing, and I managed my first kill before dying. The game appeared ruthless to me, with wave after wave of enemies ready to stab me in the back - or throw something into my lower-♥♥♥♥ area. But it was fun, decapitating the few I could. By the end game, I had 5 kills and 13 deaths - but the five I killed were well worth it.\n\nLevels 1-15\n\nGame after game, I was killed. Repetitavely. But, I got better. Learned how to be more aware of my situation. Learned the different swings, and when to block/kick. By the time I was level ten, I could hold my own - and had even won a few 1v4 fights. My friends then got the game on sale - and let me tell you, when your friends are playing, the fun increases exponentially. Between level ten and fifteen I had my best games, including my very best being 43 kills and 3 deaths (Holy ♥♥♥♥). And the best part, I was progressing. I unlocked equipment, weapons. I learned when to use specific classes. I memorized the maps and knew my strategy. I went from absolutely terrible to a force to be reckoned with.\n\nLevels 15 and on\nI just reached level 16. But it's far from over. I have many more weapons I want to unlock, and many more kills I wish to obtain. I do like this game, a lot. Even the deadliest warrior portion - though it is significantly more buggy.\n\nPros and ConsCons\nPrice - At $21.99 CAD, the price is a little steep. I'm glad my buddies got it on sale for $8.00\nHit boxes - They are getting better, but they're not great. Sometimes you get clipped for seemingly no reason at all.\nGame stuttering - even surpassing the recommended requirements by a mile, I still get stuttering.Pros\nHours of Fun - The game is awesome. A great community and many different playstyles\nVisuals - It's very pretty to look at, and ALMOST feels like real battle\nGamemodes - Versitile game modes, including TDM, FFA, Team objective, and Duel\nGeneral Ratings\nVisuals - 8/10\nCombat - 6/10\nControl Response - 8/10\nCommunity - 8/10\nGameplay - 9/10","October 30, 2014","true","80.0"," 253 of 306 people (83%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","83","253","306","6","2"

So, let's go.\n\nI love the game. It really is fantastic. I love the weapons, the classes, the objectives, the tension, the duels, etc. Ok, if I love all these aspects, why do I not recommend this game? Let me tell you why.\n\nReason 1 :\n\nNo such thing as fair-play in this game. Yes, I get it. It's a teams game. But there's a significant difference between team playing and ganging up on someone. (Really, 5 VS 1 isn't fun at all. And it happens constantly).\n\nReason 2 :\n\nAnimation exploits. I've read about it in other negative reviews and thought to myself "Hey, it can't be that bad."  Well, sadly. It is that bad. High-ranked and experienced players have mastered this exploit, which makes it impossible for a new player to even stand a chance against them in a fight. This leads new players to quickly abandon the game an uninstall it. Which in the end, destroys the game as a whole, since no new players arrive. I myself, have encountered such exploiters and couldn't even land a hit on them, which resulted in me dying in a single hit. Apparently this has been an issue for a long while, and yet the developers have done nothing about it. How to recognize an exploiter? If you see a character flying and spinning around like a balerrina with a giant sword or a giant hammer and then you die for no apparent reason, then you know you've encountered an exploiter.\n\nReason 3 :\n\nThe game's community. Oh dear lord. I've played many multiplayer games and never before have I encountered such a toxic community. You literally can't say a word during a match. Say the wrong thing or attack the server's favorite player and you get kicked. Defeat the best player in a fight, and immediately a vote for kicking you appears on your screen. Furthermore, try pointing out or adressing a problem with the game's mechanics, you will be either ignored or laughed at. Complaining about / pointing out obvious exploits of the game's flawed animations will result in calling you a noob, a whiny ♥♥♥♥♥ or a crying little ♥♥♥.\n\nThat's it. That's the three major issues with the game. Don't get me wrong. Sometims you get lucky and find a decent match and then you can have plenty of fun. But most of the time, like really, most of the time, you encounter people which I have described above.","October 18, 2015","false","46.4"," 308 of 382 people (81%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","81","308","382","26","39"

Instantaneous overheads, feinting at no stamina cost, the ridiculous range of mouse dragging, all of this contributed to the game in its current (read: current as of half a year ago when I last gave it a chance) state. If running around in circles making noncommittal dives at someone until finally making a timid landing while moving erratically with your mouse is an experience you feel is worth five dollars, go for it.

There aren't many successful games now days that have such a high skill ceiling. I think it is actually doing fairly well considering that, but it very much seems like it would have been a huge success back in the late 90's/early 2000's along with the Quakes, Unreal Tournaments, Counter-Strike and Halo 1.\n\nThe fighting system is extremely complex and when you come into a game playing against experienced players it is like playing a fighting game for the first time against someone who's put in a 100 hours. You're just trying to learn the moves and they've mastered complex combos and know the counters to everything.\n\nChivalry is unique because it is mostly melee combat. It still has all of the elements of team based First Person Shooters, but it is actually very similar to a fighting game, especially in 1 on 1 situations.\n\nComplete beginners will just mash swings (just like in fighting games how complete beginners mash buttons)\n\nEventually you learn all the buttons and use them somewhat effectively. Different swing types, parrying, and feinting. (just like learning all the buttons in fighting games)\n\nThen you figure out how to do effective combos and ripostes (combos and reverses in fighting games).\n\nThen you learn what the best moves to do are in certain situations and the timings of moves and combos (same as fighting games again) Most people don't even get this far in their game skill and knowledge.\n\nThen you eventually play against extremely good people and realize the combat is even deeper than you thought it was and is always evolving. There is a meta game within the game.\n\nPair all of the fighting game aspects along with all of the things you need to learn in FPS games.\n\nChivalry is a deep, complex game with an insane skill ceiling."\n","February 24, 2014","true","363.0"," 237 of 295 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","237","295","0","5"

The feel of melee combat is awesome, with great sounds and fantastic animations. It looks great and plays great.\n\nThe reason I don't recommend this is that when you get to a high enough skill level, the gameplay drops to a level of absurdity that involves confusing the game engine by contorting your character's body in all sorts of ways that are impossible in real life, to cause the side of your weapon's hitbox to collide with back of the enemy's exposed hitbox. I.e. turning your character 180 degrees while cutting straight down (or stabbing forward) with a very long two handed weapon, trying to make the flat of the blade (not the edge or tip) touch your opponent's back at the last second of the swing. Your character being off-balance and stumbling forward gives you a great range advantage when you can spin on your heels with the mouse to guide the already finished strike (but still active hitbox) into your enemy. This is just one of the styles to guide a vertical strike of any kind for a hit, and there are many other awkward and unnatural ways to make contact and kite with different weapons at top level play.\n\nI'd recommend this game for casuals since its fun when its casual vs casual, but then those casuals end up having to face the pros on the same server and don't have a prayer because of the abnormal weapon styles.\n\nThe devs missed the mark with this one by a small margin, and hopefully a sequel to this game might be able to improve on some of the failures from the ground up with new code.","October 21, 2015","false","107.1"," 134 of 160 people (84%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","84","134","160","6","11"

But what exactly is it and what can you expect from it? I'll tell you all about it while I split up every element in its own section so its easier to read.\n\nGameplay:\nChivalry is a Multiplayer First Person Melee game. When I say Melee then I actually mean that you'll get to fight with swords, axes, polearms, clubs and much much more. This game is pretty fast paced once it comes to close combat. There is also the ability to use distance weapons such as bows, spears, crossbows and throwing weapons. The main objective of every game is kill, kill, kill some more, and kill everyone else. Objective game modes are also availible but ofcourse you'd need to kill a lot there too. You have a HP bar and a Stamina bar, HP ofcourse lowers if someone hits you. There are some rare occasions that you'll get one-hit but that takes lots of skill and luck. The stamina bar lowers with every swing or block that you do, once your stamina hits 0 then you'll be stunned for about 2 seconds and open to every attack. Stamina regenerates if you dont move at all, so does HP very slowly but that isnt really worth it. Other than that its just hit and block. There are 4 classes you can play with. Man-at-Arms who is a light fighter with low defense but generally faster and lighter hits and has the ability to dodge an attack if timed right. An Archer who mainly uses distance weapons who also deals double damage if he hits someone in the back. The Knight has the most armor and strength but is also the slowest in game thus fairly easy to hit. Vanguards have the most reach ingame with a decent amount of defense. They can build up a charging attack while running. The game is pretty easy to understand, but also quite frustrating, I'll get to that later.\nGameplay rating: 4/5\n\nStory:\nThere is a very small story, maybe 5 lines in total that you'll only get to see if you play the Tutorial, and it doesnt even covers everything. There is no Singleplayer mode whatsoever, only Multiplayer.\nStory rating: 1/5\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics of this game are based on the Unreal Engine 3. It also supports nVIDIA's PhysX feature and seems quite realistic. Pretty much every system of today will be able to run this game in atleast 50-60 fps. I've seen minor graphical glitches where the ragdoll body was all acting up, and shortly after the beta release there was also a cloud bug in the game but that got fixed very quickly. Other than that the graphics are still decent on this game, but nothing to bloat about.\nGraphics rating: 3/5\n\nSound:\nThe sounds are crystal clear and the voice messages are randomized in 5-8 messages for every option you choose or repeat. The music on the other hand is pretty repetative, I could only distinguish 3 different tracks that just loop over and over again. As far as I know there is no sound customization at all but seeing that they added the Steam Workshop a while back, it might change soon.\nSound rating: 3/5\n\nCommunity:\nThere is an ingame chat function where people can communicate. Usually not much will be said there except for some few insults and some rare compliments on occasions. Most of the time when you ask people something they might react positively depending on what server you'll be in. Next to that there is also a kick function, which is actually abused a lot by losing players who cant stand to be killed over and over. Like I said earier this game is pretty frustrating because you can die pretty quickly if you dont watch out, and usually end up raging or insulting people if you keep losing over and over.\nCommunity rating: 2/5\n\nReplay value:\nSince this is a multiplayer only game, you'll get the same gameplay over and over but just with different situations and/or maps. Generally it can be very fun to replay this game everytime you connect to a server and i've seen entire clans doing clan wars with eachother which can be great fun too. Replaying a lot of maps can be more positive than negative because you'll know the best spots and where to expect enemies.\nReplay rating: 4/5\n\nOverall:\nThis game is loads of fun, but also quite frustrating. Especially if you have a short fuse. I find myself getting pretty angry at most times because of the players im up against but I always tend to come back and play this again after a few days. It's really been worth my money so far and there is an interesting DLC for this as well. I love replaying this game from time to time.\nOverall rating: 85/100\n\nSupported by Mowse talks games","November 28, 2013","true","276.6"," 347 of 477 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","347","477","0","5"

I've played many games where its countries or nations that are at war with each other. Never have I heard of a medieval themed game, with a civil war, the difference really stuck out for me.\n\nYou have the Agathians who are still loyal to their king and his heirs. Then you have their enemy the Mason Order, lead by a former general of the kingdom who rallied his own troops for his cause.\n\nI only played Objective mode but I found it very interesting, especially with it fleshing out both of the factions. The Agathians are the hero faction, they protect the innocent, attempt to thwart the Mason Order, by targeting their barbarian allies, and freeing their slave labor. While the Mason Order are the villains, pillaging, setting fire to villages, slaughtering peasants, and aswell taking prisoners/slaves are their forte.\n\nI felt combat along with the weapons were very realistic and fitting for the game. There is no complex progression system, you merely only need to earn kills with a weapon to unlock the next one.\n\nThe character customization, allowing you to color your characters and add your own flair was very nice. I'm a huge fan of any character customization in games.\n\nThis was the only game I played that had such an extensive voice command system. You can help direct your team mates to the objective, ask them to follow you, warn of approaching enemies. Sprinting at my opponents and battlecrying was very unique, as well with taunting and cheering.\n\n\nNow here are the issues I have with this game:\n\n-The game isn't too well optimized,\n\n-The community, expect to have people attempting to kick you from the game if your ping is above 100 but below 150. 100 ping is the optimal amount that you'll want to play at or below. You'll also have extremely hostile people insulting others or yourself for no reason and the vote system is abused constantly. Very toxic. (The last time I played, I had a player attempt to votekick me, upon asking him he merely responded back with "Your ♥♥♥♥ing ping" I looked at my ping and I was at 115. When I accused of him actually vote kicking me because I must have killed him in a way he felt was unfair (usually is the case) he denied it)\n\n-Combat, now while I found the combat (when it worked) to be very intense and fufilling, leaving me always wanting to play again to experience more. As I played and played, I began encountering that combat felt that it was less on the skill of players and how skilled they are with their current weapon. But balanced by a dice roll. I have gotten killed by enemies I didn't think could possibly have a chance against me, and I killed enemies I didn't think I had a chance to win against them. This could be many reasons. There could be an explanation in that somewhere regarding hit boxes. From my understanding Torn banner changed their hit boxes, this forever changed the game. I have many first hand experience on this. The tip of my weapon (usually spear) would actually physically clip through the enemy's chest I was fighting, it would do no damage to him and I was shocked/annoyed each time it happened. Then there's the exploits that follow them. If you see someone crouching down at the ground, with their head bent over their knees, or should you encounter someone who's currently looking up and back down at the ground rapidily over and over while swinging their weapon. Chances are you're fighting people attempting to cheat the hit boxes.( I have my own unique situation of a time I was playing and had an enemy classed as a knight turn around with the two-handed mace he was using and kill me with it,this happened when his back was facing to me.) This. Unfortunately. All of the above will be what you experience should you get this game.\n\n-Bugs everywhere. (One level The Mason Order is tasked with killing and burning down a village, then moving onto pushing a battering ram up to the gates of the castle. We had the ram reach the gates and the section of the map when you're to kill the agathian king was announced, the door remained up because we were never given the chance to break it down and we were forced to vote a new map since we were unable to smash the gate down.)\n\n-You'll also experience random crashes and other major technical issues. (I often have it when I load into a map server but it isn't finished. I hear the sounds of people fighting. But nothing is rendered for me except a long and lifeless flat landscape and a crude looking box that I believe is supposed to be a building. There is no way to leave the game or to pick a team to spawn. And I am always forced to alt tab and close the game down). (I also had too many times I could count, that part of the loading screen, small fragments of it would remain up on my screen as I began playing. Luckily they were transparent so I could still see and move around. I've never seen a glitch like this in any game I have ever played.\n\nI really wanted to love this game. Unfortunately, it lacks a lot of polish and the issues will always remain. When I decided to purchase Mount and Blade Warband, I have not had any want to continue playing Chivalry.\n\nI sincerely hope my review helped you make a decision of this game. If you want to really get chivalry be patient and wait for it to go on sale. I am thankful I got it from a free weekend and for only 6.24 $. This is a tough sale in this condition to be a 25$ purchase.\n\nWhile Torn Banner has seemingly abandoned their games. I have noticed they continue to implement new skins, but I am convinced that they do not have the ability to fix their game's many issues.

Or if you're in a guild and like to join games en masse, you can do it in this one and it works out nicely.\n\nThe things about Chivalry: Medieval Warfare that drive me simply bat-♥♥♥♥ crazy, and the reasons why I won't recommend it even though I had lots of fun with the game, are four-fold.\n\nChivalry: Medieval Warfare was the ONLY game to ever give me the dreaded blue screen of death. My graphics card, the card that had run the game well over 300+ hours, decided it had had enough and just refused to work... er, rather, refused to run Chivalry without crashing itself. That made me PERMANENTLY uninstall the game altogether and has put a really bad taste in my mouth about it. Call me biased, but whatever.\n\nBeing a small-time game developer, Chivalry Medieval Warfare appears to me to be a poorly-coded game in general. The menus, at one point, were BARELY functional. Most of the buttons didn't work, and it took the developer MONTHS to make them halfway functional again. Animations bugs are still everywhere. Players can exploit the game in obvious ways that the developer has to know about but don't actively fix. Hell, it took them close to 5 months to release the game's first patch that ultimately broke combat forever. (If you have been playing since a few months after it released, you know exactly what I mean)\n\nThe devs seem to have a very difficult grasp on what the word balance means. I don't mean to directly bash them here, but for a time, spears were the end-all. Vanguards literally ruled the entire game room (even today they do) because of their strengths against ALL other classes. Then the devs saw that this was happening and completely destroyed spears, to the point where they were no longer useful. One extreme to another. Hit boxes weren't fixed, merely modified to make them almost worse than they were before. Man At Arms, at one point, could reach around a tower shield staring them straight in the face, and if you get caught in that, it's game over.\n\nSince the game has been out a long time, and many people still play it, it is really, really difficult for newer players to have any fun. I remember joining every single lobby and going 34/6 or 28/4 every free-for-all round (check my screenshots, it's legit). Fun for me, but discouraging for the new players. There is no incentive to play other than getting ultimately trashed by a rank 50 person who camps on the game all day. And don't even get me started on how freaking awful the community is with the little thing called "swing manipulation". You can literally feint using your mouse speed. You can literally slice someone in half by twirling around like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ballerina and slice them through yourself (I guess). I never, ever feinted and still won most FFA matches. I never, ever manipulated my swing unless my opponent did so. And none of those walking jokes could EVER beat me in a 1v1 without using the manipulation tricks; not even feinting worked. They always had to resort to underhanded, idiotic flippy-doos and curtsy-flips to get a cheap shot.\n\nAll of this said, you can buy the game if you want to just have low-stress fun. But if you hate losing to game camps that live on this thing to train their mouse-speed button skills, don't even bother.","May 28, 2015","false","334.8"," 63 of 82 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","63","82","3","1"

Somehow.\n\nThere are certain attacks that are, as far as I can tell, almost impossible to block/evade. The only difference between a feint and an actual attack is a grunt, and people can attack instantly by turning around, crouching, and using an overhead swing.\n\nWhile I know the game isn't meant to be realistic, it's still stupid that you can attack the enemy more efficiently by facing the other direction and swinging a greatsword.\n\nYou'll often find yourself fighting a knight who just crouches and spins like a chimp having a seizure.

It was fun, something new and a very interesting idea. 16v16 soldiers, running into the heat of battle screaming random things and then exchanging frantic hits with the enemy only to be smacked and killed by one of your own team is hilarious sometimes. On the other hand the imbalanced gameplay and glitch exploitation make it very easy to vote down. When you start out there are level 0-15 servers which only those levels are alowed to join. It makes a somewhat even playing field because all the new and newish players are all trying to figure out which end of the stick goes in the other guy and are all swinging like crazy just to land a hit and steal a kill. I had many a laugh at how funny the game can be, however after level 15 your only choice is to join the other severs where the new aim of the game is who can exploit the most glitchiest gliches and who can do it faster than the other person exploiting their glitchiest glitch. This exploitation of some stupid game mechanics where your character almost bends backwards while swinging, hitting everything around them while being virtually unhittable became very annoying very fast. This part of the gameplay quickly sucked all the fun out of it. There is also some problems with terrible hit markers which I overlooked at the start because the game was quite fun. You thrust into someone chest but completely miss them and then someone miles away somehow headshots you with a tiny sword. The game is supposed to be unrealistic (its a game, duh) but its also supposed to be fun and after being killed reapeatably by people exploiting these glitches in the game it became a not so fun experience. So if you are buying it with some friends and just want to have a bit of a laugh with them its a good game. If you are buying it to play on the servers i definitely would not recommend this glitch... i mean game :P","November 12, 2014","false","34.5"," 302 of 475 people (64%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","64","302","475","16","17"

Now that I am at almost 600 hours, I think I have a better feeling of the game.\n\nIt is undoubtedly the best melee-oriented game I have played. So much so, that to me, all other games with melee now feel very shallow and weak by comparison, and I think that anyone who has put a lot of time into this game can also attest to this feeling. It sets a new standard of melee combat.\n\nChivalry will not appeal to everyone. It has an extremely high skill ceiling that very few players will even remotely approach (seriously like less than 1% of people who own it probably). But for those who do enjoy it, they will spend an ungodly amount of hours on getting gud.\n\nThere are four distinct classes with relatively diverse play-styles, and even though this is the case, I have mostly trudged through the last ~600 hours as a knight, and it never really got boring. You will probably find a class you like best early on, and habitually stick to it primarily. Maybe not, but most players seem to be this way.\n\nThis game has the best voice-acting ever. All of the classes on either team have a lot of character in the amusing taunts and compliments, even though they are rather generic in all other ways.\n\nEven though the game was released over two years ago, the developers continue to update it and add content. The community is still active, even in the Australian/NZ servers, which is excellent. As you play more, you will see a lot of familiar faces. People just like you, who have sold their soul to this game. Then you will kill them.\n\n\nThere are some ongoing balancing issues with weapons, some bugs appear and disappear... but it's relatively minor at this point.\n\nWe don't talk about the Deadliest Warrior expansion (IT DOESN'T EXIST LALALA). Otherwise, buy this (and play it)!","February 4, 2015","true","058.0"," 70 of 100 people (70%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","70","70","100","13","4"

It started out as something great, but it really just appears that this game was developed with just intentions to earn money, and not to really create this awesome melee game that could have been unique and so much better, for this game is pretty fun due to its unique melee combat mechanics, but the reason why I linger at this game is pretty much for the fact because there is none other game that has simular style than this, otherwise I would have left swiftly. Because I don't think Torn Banner Studios are taking things serious, the game company is lead by a kid who would believe that he knows whats wrong and right in every turn and refuse to accept aid that so many of us players around the community has offered, it has been a pretty shity year. They have this forum where they try to communicate to other players, but it has been a complete failure all along due to lack of communication to the player base, and most of the times they seek to avoid questions because they ♥♥♥♥ed up with one patch, and repeated the mistake in the second patch.\nAlso, there was this one occasion where they had a 'Balance council' going on, where experienced players of the game were handpicked by members of Torn Banner Studios to share their experience with the game and possibly balance out the game once for all, but instead. Steve Piggott who'se the owner of the Game Developing Studio decided to take some changes into his own hands, him and his glorious 300 hours in the game. So for example, there was this weapon, Bearded Axe that has been broken for nearly over a year, since they buffed the 'windup' for the weapon in the first patch after release, and so we all complained about Bearded Axe being too fast for its own good, that the attack animation would just become desyncronizhed, and so later after the Balance patch, Steve Piggott concluded that he would increase the base damage on Bearded Axe since the whole competitive scene of chivalry cried out that the weapon was broken but needed fixing, but no one used the weapon anyways. This gives me as a player the impression that most changes in the game are done on the fly, and that Steve Piggott has NO absolute any idea what the ♥♥♥♥ he is doing most of the times, and since he won't accept any help from others, he is the one making the decisions, so you have to consider that changes will be made depending on his opinion, and his opinion ALONE. This game might seem alright to play if you are just a 'casual' player who just want to play it every now and then, but if you wish to go deep into the game, you will have a pretty much harsh time.\n\nI would not recommand to buy this game due to lack of compitance in the development team, lets just say they had a gold mine that they blew up, and I am eager to see a new game come out that would be simular to Chivalry: Medieval Warfare, but just better and with a much more serious developing team than what Torn Banner Studios can offer.\n\nDon't buy this game!!!","January 24, 2014","false","721.0"," 952 of 1,572 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","952","1","0","184"

Apart from that I can say that this game has one of the worst community's I have ever seen, don't get me wrong, there are some nice people on here, but the general atmosphere on servers is terrible, plenty of racism, insults, and of course team killing. The latest maps that the developers have brought out are rubbish, full of bugs and glitches, and they seem more interested now in trying to peddle microtransactions than fixing any of the bugs that seem to multiply with every patch thy release.

I absolutely love the combat system, but boy oh boy can you be a buggy mess at times. I personally love the setting and the brutality of it, so I can get over it, but the bugs can get in the way at times, especially with the server. Couple that with most of the servers being completely empy, and about 10-12 that actually get filled up. The combat system is really great though. However, it can be frustraiting to get used to. I'm not even fully used to it yet, and I've played 11 hours so far. So the gameplay is great, what else is there to chivalry, you might ask? Nothing. Thats really the only other issue. Thats all it has to offer, and they want 25 bucks for it. I'd say they're asking a bit too much. This game almost always goes on sale during big sales, so if you're considering this one, wait until then. Its well worth the 6 bucks I put into it.\n\nI can't really make this long, because there isn't much to say about chivalry other than it can be a lot of fun, but it can also annoy the living hell out of you. Especially if you just can't catch a break. The community is pretty good from what I've seen, although you're going to run into rude people in a multiplayer game, everyone should expect that. But the game is plenty of fun and well worth the 6 dollar sale price.\n\nPick this up if you enjoy multiplayer games, and are looking for something different than a modern military FPS or an MMO.

Those are mostly kill the enemy team's king, push the battering ram towards the gate, kill peasants or burn houses. They are pretty fun for both teams.\n\nSadly, for people expecting anything realistic, it is a dissapointment. The actual skill of this game focuses on exploiting bad physics. The combat against "experienced" players is immersion breaking as they are using all  the exploits possible to gain an advantage, all while looking downright silly at the same time (knights doing moves no human being could do). It might take skill to do it but it simply isnt proper swordfighting.\n\nYou could probably find some fun in it if you're not looking for a interesting spin on melee combat, while not focusing on the realism whatsoever, or you plan on doing some fights with friends.\n\nPersonally I cannot recommend the game.

I have enough hours into the game to tell you that hardly anyone in this game is fun to play with because you are either up against the super elitist players (jerks that will refuse to teach you how to play or help you get better) that will crush you with ease, the cheaters (there are quite a few players that use speedhacks in this game), or the noobs that will team kill you constantly.\n\nOther than the trashy community that will leave you questioning hummanity, you will find very quickly that this game REQUIRES you to have absolutely no life in order to get good at it. I don't recommend wasting a ton of hours into a game that isn't even good.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Apples2/recommended/219640/","Apples2","Hyankinthos ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Apples2/","100 products in account","After 270 hours of casual play on this game and earning my rank of 39 I have decided to give my honest opinon about this game.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~This is all my opinon and my personally experiences of this game~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nNow I had this game about a month or two after the offical release and not much has changed since its original launch from my perspective. If anything I would go to say the game got worse throughout its time by nerfing weapons that werent OP and then buffing the OP weapons (Those dagger mofos). Even the classes seem a bit unbalanced as well once you go up against competitive players who treat this game as life. Which leads me into another thing to talk about which is how this game can be played, and there are only 2 ways it can be played or at the very least 2 types of players.\n\n1. The first way to play is competitevly, in the basic sense, taking this game seriously and committing yourself to this game only. Now if you are a competitive player and love a challenge even though around 70% are gonna be better than you right off the bat and always be better than you then play it if you want to get your ♥♥♥ kicked. Since this game has been out for around 2 years I believe all the veterans (excluding myself) are experts of breaking animations and full out ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. If you do try to play competitvely atleast find a weapon that you enjoy playing and that works for you and get good at that, if you try other weapons constantly trying to be the "Jack of all Weapons" you will find yourself breaking your own sanity (In my case 3 keyboards). Other than that statement that concludes the competitive playstyle and onto the next.\n\n2. The second (and only way that I found) way to play is casually. What casually means in this sense that I infer it to be is playing with only your friends and ♥♥♥♥ing around and not taking this game seriously. Like honestly never take this game seriously you will have a bad time. This game can be extremely fun but only with friends. Being able to ♥♥♥♥ around in a broken game is always fun even I enjoyed it but out of my whole group of friends I pretty much stayed with this game and kept playing it which lead me to try competitevly (worse decision of my life).\n\nNow let me go towards the community of the game, which I would like to imagine its a cross-breed of ♥♥♥♥♥ and reddit. The arrogant slobs who think they know everything since they look it up not later than 5 minutes ago attribute that reddit has and then having the vulgar and lack of filter that a ♥♥♥♥♥ user has. These guys will constantly talk ♥♥♥♥ about other players for their lack of skill when the person is rank 5 and they're rank 50, appaerently the internet tough guy is common in this game. Anyways these guys will constantly break animations and mechanics of the game just to win and feel good and ♥♥♥♥♥ at you if you kill them. They will then claim nonsense and lag that they died and try to harrass you with their childish insults. So in short a good bit of the high levels (40s-50s) are disrepsectful brats who seem to be autistic (not trying to offend anybody by saying this but play the game and see for yourself). Now just a little disclaimer of cours not every high level person is like this around maybe 15-25% at most is not like this from what I have seen.\n\nThe Archers take the most skill needed for having the need to aim in the game and being the squishiest of all the classes.\n\nMan-At-Arms takes the least amount of skill for having the fastest weapons avaliable to him along with its backstep function that can easily put you out of range of others attacks making you seem invincible from barely getting a scratch in combat.\n\nVanguards take the second least amount of skill and is the class mostly played from what I have seen. Have weapons that have high reach and autistic speed makes an easy class to use since it commonly breals animations\n\nKnight is a hit or miss with skills depending on the weapon you are using. If you use the maul you pretty much need the skill level of an archer or just slightly below it, however some weapons can be easy like the man at arms aresenal but not as cheap from that little ♥♥♥♥'s backstep.\n\nOverall this game is boken and people abuse these mechanics that are quite annoying to deal with and people defend this mechanics saying that it was put into the game for a reason. Im 50/50 on that from Torn Banner's progress on the game breaking it after every update and making it worse. Thanks a lot S-h-i-t Banner\n\nAge of Chivalry was pretty much the BETA of this game and had very choppy animations but the mechanics of that game were in a sense fair and you could do a lot more in that game such as ride horses. I have been tempted to play Age of Chivalry so many times because of this game but I always lack the motivation to download it again.\n\nSo should you play this game? No you shouldnt, a better game is coming out with better combat mechanics that bring this game to shame. Coming out next year while the beta is coming out soon if not already the game will be called Kingdom Come: Deliverence.","October 25, 2014","false","321.0"," 114 of 180 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","114","180","3","26"

EDIT: They have made this game better in the past couple of months, but due to certain things I still don't reccomend it full price.\n\nPros:\n- A decent skill curve, does take skill to play the game. ( With a couple of exceptions)\n- It's cool how you can kill your enemies with map interaction in a couple of maps.\n- Fun trolling players who take this game too seriously, and are total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n- Mutaliting your friends limbs and toying with dead bodies is alway a plus\n- Modded maps are incredible and are way better than the normal maps that this game has to offer.\n- This game's ridiculousness makes it very humorous to play\n- Horde mode is pretty fun to play.\n- Weapon kills now work fine.\n- Mods are what makes me still play this game time from time\n\nCons:\n- Vanguard + Zweihander + LMB LMB LMB LMB LMB LMB LMB LMB  = Guaranteed K/D of like 20-5 [Some people are using this to dismiss my review and say that I suck so I'll get this clear, It's what I see in lobby's. Obviously a good player will cream these guys, but most of the time these players have decent K/Ds]\n- Hitboxes are god awful, I have killed people to the sides of me with a stab.\n- Some bugs, alot have been fixed.\n- Blocking is a bit weird, granted i'm not very good with it, but I know i've blocked sometimes and people still hit me. Likewise, I do not block and it still does anyway. (Without a shield ofc)\n- Obnoxiously tryhard community\n- Archers must be the most annoying people on the planet, according to the community.\n- Dragging is a mechanic that is important to learn and use in the game, why isn't in the tutorial?\n- Feinting is a fair mechanic, although I don't use it, I still hate it when people complain about it.\n- Animations are some of the worst i've ever seen, not medieval at all, looks like a couple of fat nerds playing LARP.\n- A spear stabs through a knight in full armor, and manages to hit someone behind him, Total sense.\n- The official servers lag ALL of the time, I get dropped from them very often. No my internet does not suck. (54 mbps)\n- Hit a teammate once, you are offically the worst player on the planet.\n- Dev's won't do ♥♥♥♥ about balance and the bugs in this game, all they do is release new helmets and that stupid Warrior DLC, FOR MORE MONEY. They might as well as call themselves Microsoft.\n\nNOTE: For all those level 50's who will say I'm just a bad lvl 5. I am level 23 at the time of this review and I usually go positive when I play, as long as i'm not trolling or screwing around.\n\nScore: 5.5/10\n\nFinal analysis:\nGame can be fun, and i've sure had some great moments when playing with friends, but overall if you want a more balanced and fun game that doesnt have a bunch developers that dont do anything, and a community that doesn't have metal poles up their ♥♥♥, and just a good medieval game look elsewhere, Chivalry will offer you nothing. Do not buy this game, with all of it's problems it should be free. I've played free games that should be worth more than this piece of crap.","December 14, 2013","false","78.9"," 106 of 167 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","106","167","0","11"

In its golden age, there were always players looking to improve, clans to scrim against and tournaments which were rare but kept the competitiveness growing.\n\nThose days are long over. If you're looking to play casually with some friends or by yourself the game is a good pickup, but taking it any further than that is a mistake.\n\nThe servers, for instance, are horrible. Chivalry truly shines in 1v1 up to 5v5, but the servers you will find popular these days have over 40 slots, causing massive instability. There are some duel servers around, but even they have flaws, such as poor hosting, manipulative admins and low tick rates.\n\nWhile the experience you will have while playing chivalry will be massively influenced by your connection, many players are ignorant in this regard and will play with packet loss, which causes a lot of issues within chivalry. This is surprisingly common among players who consider themselves "high level" and is extremely frustrating to play against.\n\nThe community is extremely against feinting, likely due to the huge amount of third person players who believe playing without feints is more skillful, which is absolutely not the case. There are no Mercs (Mercenaries) servers in Australia because of this, which is a mod created to balance and change the game around the feint mechanic, increasing the quality of high level play.\n\nIf you like the sound of Chivalry and wish as i do that there was a decent melee fighting game, check out Mordhau. The game is being developed by experienced players from the chivalry community to create the game we've all been longing for.","January 22","false","864.4"," 32 of 41 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","32","41","0","3"

This game is fun to play when it works.\n\nTorn Banner oh how you have ruined such a fun game with a lot of potential. I'm not going to lie about the old UI being good as it truly was not but, this new UI just feels so clunky and immersion breaking not to mention the fact that it doesn't even look good. I've also been having issues with random fps drops since the patch adding the new UI and I've noticed others complaining about it in the chat in done servers.\n\nThere is also still an issue with the ranking system after so long. I hit rank 31 a few days ago but for some reason that is still beyond me, I went on the next day only to find that I was a 30 with very little progression towards rank 31. There is also still an issue with unlocking weapons too. I had almost unlocked the grand mace with only 12 more kills necessary for me to unlock it only to find a few days later that I needed to get 43 more kills for whatever reason.\n\nKicking is also broken. I will quite often find that when I press F to kick an enemy, my foot just goes straight through them. This happens when I'm messing around with friends of in the hear of combat, kicking just doesn't work.  The most annoying thing is that I still lose stamina over it too.\n\nThe lack of advanced moves in the tutorial is laughable. The most advanced move that you get is feinting. No ducking, no dodging, no dragging. They never really go into that much detail about the classes either and the AI is so useless that a new player can play through the training and stand in chance online what-so-ever.\n\nPeople always complain about feinting. Why do so many people complain about feinting? Especially at high ranks where they should be so good at the game that they can defend against anything that is thrown at them. I've seen rank 50s complain about feinting; saying that it is a noob tactic. It's effective, it's part of the game's mechanics and it's a way for less experienced players to have a chance. People either take the game too seriously or are just try-hards. It doesn't have the best of communities that I've seen in a game.\n\nHit boxes are an issue. Players can duck under attacks, have it look like a missed attack to both players and the one who ducks still gets hit... Yes, you can be as fast on your feet as you lie but, if that sword comes two inches off of your at the end of the attack then you'll be decapitated.\n\nParrying is also slightly broken. Sometimes somebody will throw a swing at you and you can parry it without even seeing your opponents weapon. Other times, their attack will go straight through your parry no matter how well you time it.\n\nSome weapons are just OP. The claymore is the prime example. If struck properly, it can one hut an archer, it's almost as fast as the MAA's broad sword and has the almost 1 + 1/3 the reach of the broadsword. If used with some advanced moves, it is as fast as a dagger. The Thrusting Dagger is another OP weapon. It's git the greatest reach, speed, and damage of all the knives. An MAA spamming attacks with it and dodging can be a tough opponent to beat. Also, how the hell can a hunting knife parry a massive, heavy maul?\n\nNo, I don't recommend this game. It's a unique one, I can't deny that but, it has so many flaws and a bad development team that just make it not worth the money. The community can either be great or the worst and there are many empty servers. There are low level servers for rank 0s to 15s which is good to get people into the game but, also creates the issue of once new players progress past that point, they are straight in with the highly advanced players who use different fighting styles and it's like starting the game all over again but with more deaths. I also always find myself playing with the same people time and time again one many servers because all of the new players are on the low ranking servers. It feels a bit segregated to be honest.  For £18.99 I cannot recommend this game as it just hasn't been given the attention that it needs from the developers.\n\nTorn Banner, you upset me.","July 31, 2014","false","197.6"," 52 of 77 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","52","77","3","3"

I really thought this was going to be an easy thumbs up, even though it is a PVP game, and strictly PVP, is usually not a type of game I find interesting. Unfortunately when it came to matching up with other players, I quickly realized where the problem with this game truly lies; It is completely unbalanced. Groups of veteran players can pit themselves against fresh new players in complete one-sided slaughter fests. Some high level players use moves which are completely unblockable, making the game even further unbalanced. Sadly, this game could have been better and even though it has a lot going for it, there are to many bugs and issues with the current PVP grouping system to make this a game recommendable to new players.","May 29, 2015","false","0.3"," 79 of 124 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","79","124","3","4"

The premise of this game is great, two factions fighting eachother with numerous different game modes, different classes with their specific jobs, and even a new co-op mode for those who don't like playing player vs player. However, I don't recommend this game to anyone currently and to look for another one. The reasons are the game mechanics. It's not realistic at all and it breaks the immersion. For example, a vanguard would be fighting three different people, instead of taking a defensive position they'd just walk backwards and forwards swinging their Zweihander like they are blind infinitely. There's also the weird mechanic of looking directly at the ground while overheading to get a super fast overhead that is most of the time impossible to block. And there's the mechanic known as "matrixing" where you would crouch down and look at the sky, manipulating your player model so that the other person can't hit you even though they are right in front of you. I really wanted to like this game but it isn't for me, maybe I'd come back to it just to finish the achievements or when they bring updates to the mechanics.","February 25, 2015","false","109.8"," 34 of 46 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","34","46","0","0"

Lot of fun and it's possible to contribute even if you are completely new.\n- The combat mechanics are pretty good.\n- Overall not a bad game IF you manage to overlook the BS.\n\nThe Bad:\n- The aforementioned good combat mechanics also introduces some problems. Firstly, it is just too heavily dependent on ping. Normally it is not such a big deal but you'll know when the servers start drying up. And then there is something which is known as "exploiting" to some, while the others call it "taking advantage of the mechanics". Eitherway, it is rather irritating to see someone move in the most unnatural way possible and hit you before you even see the weapon move.\n- The archery is the the weakest part of the combat, if we exclude the javelins.\n- The community is not all that great. Now it's in no way the worst out there, but it's still pretty bad. I am not talking about the team kills and such but when you hear "You are being kicked because you are a n*gg*r", you know you have a problem (DISCLAIMER: This was not directed at me and this is not the only basis of my opinion, just an example). I have never seen a veteran player give any constructive advice to newer players except the occasional "stop hitting me noob". Some may argue that i was just unlucky with my choice of servers but hey, random sampling is a legit method of statistics.\n\nThe Ugly:\n- OMG THE BUGS.....This game is broken to the point that the two methods of character progression DONT WORK. The two being unlocking weapons and leveling up. When i say they dont work, i mean they literally dont work. If you gain a level or two in a match, you'll see that number reset back to where it was in the next one. You may be lucky enough to unlock a weapon or two but the counters just give up after that. I know there are way to edit some files and stuff but that should never be the case for a game that is over a year old. There a hundred other bugs from the mildly annoying to game breaking, but i would rather not go on a rant.\n- Identification of Friend or Foe (IFF). In a game where your allies take the same damage as your enemies, this feature is rather important. You have a small dot at the centre of the screen which if exactly place on another player will turn BLUE (friend) or RED (foe). Also at the bottom of the screen you will see the name of the player in BLUE (Agatha) or in RED (Mason). Keep in mind that the two colours are unrelated. Given that you may get autobalanced to the other team more than once in a match, all this is a recipe for some nerd rage. And dont come at me with "you're just a noob", I have seen veteran players making the same mistake.\n- FInally the worst thing that can be said about an online competitive multiplayer, THE DEVS DONT SEEM TO CARE. In spite off all the problems, the devs blessed us with new helmets which cost about  $4 or something. THe amount may or may not be accurate but there is certainly a real money value to them. I personally couldn't care less. These kind of things make some sense in a game that looks good.\n\nYou can hear more about the good thing and the not so good things on the steam forums, which you should definitely check out if you want to buy.\n\nTL;DR: Buggy as hell. Buy if you own a couple oil wells or something (or wait for heavy discounts XD)","January 29, 2014","false","50.4"," 63 of 99 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","63","99","0","5"

When your sword connects with an enemy or your mace smashes through someone's head, you almost 'feel' the impact and it's very satisfying. Headshotting results in a smashed skull, or completely decapitated head. Very fun. You'll also find out that centermass hits are super damaging, and everything else is pretty much useless. If you find your attacks aren't doing damage, aim for the middle, not the arms or legs.\n\nUnfortunately it's the bottom of the bucket in every other respect.\n\nThe community (OUTSIDE OF THE 1-15 NOOB SERVERS MOSTLY) is one of the worst and most toxic out there. And it's getting worse. Kind of ironic how it's named chivalry and everyone is a total ♥♥♥-hole.\n\nNetwork desynch/lag will cause you to die hundreds of times more than you would have if your parry actually worked, or someone's lag swing registers outside of your parry, even though on your screen, the sword was in your face.\n\nOr how about the classic. The enemy is way out of range, and slashes you dead, because the network decided to give you information on the swings a little later.\n\nIMO the developers have made their $$$ on this game, and they're about to llama drop it. Why? because they're all in bora bora hiring hookers and getting madly drunk celebrating the millions they're raking in every other month on this thing. They don't really give a ♥♥♥♥ since updates are few and far between - as well as poorly executed. (they have a beta branch where they 'test' patches before releasing them.. yet when they release them, they're full of problems still? are you kidding me?)\n\nThe effort is not there. These guys are a group of developers - and that's fine. but they suck. many other games with only 1 or 5 man dev teams release weekly updates and masterfully execute them. They aren't full of glitches needing constant hotfixing, or strange graphic breaking bugs.\n\nThis is but a few of the mass of shortcomings you're going to see in this game.\n\nI don't even need to go into the fact that you are STILL crashing to desktop in vanilla chivalry despite the game being out for ages and having undergone countless updates. The 'official' servers are worthless, slow, laggy and prone to crash or cause massive lagspikes. I'd be embarrassed to own them, much less consider them official.\n\nI picked this game up on a sale - cheaply so. I'd suggest you do the same. The learning curve is steep and once you learn this game - this is pretty much as good as it gets.\n\nBecause there are other people with their eyes on a satisfying melee combat experience, and once they have put some time into it - chivalry will be dethroned, because it's just a mindless hack and slash, poorly updated and weakly executed. There are others who could and can do this much, much better.\n\nI rate it about 4/10, and I don't recommend you purchase it unless it's less than five bucks. The 'deadliest warrior' expansion is merely a gimmick to suck in spike tv mouthbreathers, I wouldn't bother with it.\n\nHowever, in terms of the innovative content, it truly is one of a kind.

What seperates this game from other fighting games is the in-depth, real-time melee mechanics that create both an infinite skill ceiling and the ability to read and predict your opponent(s) in order to overcome. Just like any other game worth playing, once you master the basics (combining footwork and attack momentum, feinting/dragging, identifying weapons for strengths and weaknesses, exploiting an opponents attack pattern, ducking horizontals and sidestepping stabs and overheads, etc.), you'll be a lvl 10-20 making us lvl 50s look stupid. This game is more phychological and intense than any other game I've ever played and theres no limitations other than your "creativity cap". Every type of class, weapon, and personal style has an equal and an opposite that can counter or be countered. The hard truth about this game is simple...no matter what you use, nothing is more powerful than how you use it. A smart archer with a dagger can dress-down a dumb knight with a sword of war in seconds.\n\nMost of the negative feedback comes from individuals who get exploited for their impatience, predictability, and lack of attention to detail. As I previously stated, this game is psychological and most players simply can't hang due to their...mental malfunctions. If you can clear your head, feel out your foes, and master the speed and distance of your weapon and theirs...they'll be playing counter strike for the rest of the week.\n\nThis game, in my opinion, seperates the calm and collected from the angry and absurd. Those of us who have been dueling one another for over a year can tell you one thing...chivalry is a game of minds. Once you lose your head behind the keyboard, you'll get to see yours, in-game, gently rolling down a hill. If you're intelligent and assertive, losing become learning and it's smooth sailing from then on. If you want the feeling of having full control of your opponents by reading and bleeding them, this game is for you.\n\nNote: This game's only flaw from my chair are the custom maps. They're big, beautiful, and have fun objectives, but most servers seem to have problems running them smoothly regardless of system specs and ping (it might be memory issues related to some custom map servers). If you're just starting out, stick to default maps and duels/duelyards. Do not waste your time in begginers channels. Very few of them utilize feints, drags, footwork, etc. It's like watching monkeys in a slap-fight and you will get worse playing bad players. No one gets good at this game by running over whiny pre-teens so I recommend you hop in a game with patient, high ranking players. Most of us would be more than happy to help train you to bend the learning curve and cut through the crap. I would not have put in a fraction of the hours in this game if it wasnt for good people/players lending me a hand and helping me understand the game from their perspective.

My first experience on one of these so called 'balanced' and 'limited archers' was interesting. Limited archer servers are usually  beautiful oasises in the middle of a desert full of archers, however SM servers arent. When you first join you may hear the familiar mating call of the black helm n***a knight, returning from their weekly ballerina lessons. You see them slowly run over the hill, you attempt to make a hastey escape as a Man At Arms, but with their steroid driven chase mechanic they make chase, with their mauls in their hands. As you run you hear them getting closer and closer, so you turn to fight. You block as they do their familiar ballerina twirl and their maul (♥♥♥♥♥) crashes down upon your head as they try to anally penetrate you. With each crushing blow to your head, your brain becomes more and more condensed until it is a black hole, as the screen goes red you know what the knights are doing. they press X and then press 9, and you hear their oh too familiar laugh. You immediately take to the chat and say "♥♥♥♥ING STUPID MAUL SCRUBS", you immediately feel all eyes bare down upon you, and see your name in the kick box, however 10 seconds into the vote kick process you are insta-banned. You feel confused, until your friend in the skype call tells you that you have been kicked with -27166841645% voting yes, from this point forward you will always know how nobby the Sneaky Monkey admins are.\n\nThe moral of this story?\nNever\nEver\nGo\nOn\nA\nSneaky\nMonkey\nServer","November 20, 2014","false","279.8"," 176 of 304 people (58%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","58","176","304","18","10"

A lot of the negative reviews about this game are people who have played this game for a long time and are mad at the devs.\n\nHowever competent devs or not, this game nails what is most important. It's FUN.\n\nI put in some crazy hours into this game, and while I do get a bit disgruntled every other match I play, the feels it gives are too good to ignore. Nothing will ever match the feeling of going up against 3 to 5 players at once and coming up on top by the slimmest of margins. Nothing will ever top the experience of sprinting full force into a moshpit of soldiers and swinging a giant hammer smashing heads like a ♥♥♥♥ing boss.\n\nThis game's combat style takes a certain type of player to enjoy it, and as such it's very hit or miss.\n\nMy advice, pick it up on sale. Either you screw around for like 10 or 20 hours and it will still have been worth it, or you will become totally consumed by the game and play it untill a better one with similar mechanics comes out. However, on sales where prcies are $10 to $5 it is most definately a must buy.","February 7","true","164.3"," 40 of 61 people (66%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","66","40","61","4","0"

If you are looking for a fun multiplayer hack'n'slash you'll get that, but the packaging around it is still as rough as ever. Though the combat is fast paced amd genuinly fun, frustration arises from all angles.\nThe server browser is just bad. Attempting to join a full server will have you load the game and getting kicked afterwards for being full. No chance to qeue a server. Furthermore the settings are frequently resetting to default.\nFurther problems arise with the combat system. Sometimes mousewheel up and down gets mixed up. The blocking is often really buggy and results in anger as to why a perfectly seeming block resulted in a hit.\n\nAll in all I cannot recommend the game because it seems Torn Banner is rather focused on implementing unnecessary features and DLC than polishing the nice combat system to pure beauty. Customization of characters was only implemented to sell DLC hats and breaks the immersion. (Yeah look that Knight with the shiny pink helmet). Furthermore the DLC Deadliest Warrior is just a cash steal based on the prejudices of "cool Ninja combat" etc.\n\nAnyways I've had fun with the game before it became a cash cow and I am looking forward to Kingdom Come: Deliverance for my historical medieval combat fix.","March 31, 2014","false","146.5"," 208 of 363 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","208","363","0","5"

To me, the whole point of the game was supposed to be a first-person melee knight game. But now people can go third person and have greater situational awareness in the midst of multiplayer. That's just dumb. Ya, sure anyone else can do it to, but it kind of ruins what the game was to me just so that I can (try to) play better.\n\nfor a game that focuses on melee, the game feels sluggish and slow. The classes seem unbalanced and i found myself playing knight the most even though he's probably the worst. There's something about this game just makes me feel like the whole thing has been dipped in really stale honey. it's kind of sweet and all that, but it's sticky and doesn't leave a good taste in your mouth.\n\nAdmittedly, I kind of suck at this game. so that's cause for further frustration. But pretty much the only people who are left playing this and the ones who are going to dominate the scoreboard, are the people who play in 3rd and know how to angle their attacks and aim their camera so they dodge things. It doesn't seem like skillfull playing, it seems like taking the baby way out to be good at a game. I feel like if they were to disallow 3rd person on certain servers (or altogether for all i care) they would lose the tiny player base that still dwells in this game. The Chiv devs are pretty muched cucked into keeping it in in an attempt to maintain these unfun players.\n\nall-in-all it's a really fun idea held back by abused mechanics and a dying community, as well as some bad honey.","May 16","false","20.3"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","19","24","2","2"

Combat is clunky - which could be by design but when i change to throwing knives and urgently need a sword etc I want to be able to swap back before the overlong animation of taking out the knife completes. (I dnt care what he does with the knife - drop it whatever, fact is u die waiting for the animation). In general animations cannot be cancelled. If you can't go online don't think u can play vs bots - bots are available but never go for objectives (some of which need two ppl to complete). They are usually just clipping into walls or back at spawn doing derpy ♥♥♥♥. The game has weapon progression where more weapons are unlocked by getting kills with weapons of the same tier - it broke.

It's a scam, if you wanna know why, read on.\n\nThe first time I played this game, I had a blast. The second time, I had a nuclear explosion.\n\nAt first I thought Chivalry was a fun game. You could explode people's head's with a punch, or Black Knight them removing limb by limb, roadhouse people to death and even beat them with a stick.\n\nThen the patches came. Patch after patch after patch, this game became unplayable. Most games reward skill, this one doesnt; it punishes it. Don't bother to spend some time learning a class, a weapon or a game style, or don't even bother learning the game or trying to be good at it, sooner or later there will be a patch that will literally screw things over for everyone, then you are back at noob camp. Like to use maces ? Well, soon there will be a patch that will make maces the ♥♥♥♥♥iest weapons in the game, now swords are the hype. Learned to use swords ? Well suck it up, patch has come and now swords are ♥♥♥♥, maces are back, but now they cost more stamina.\n\nThe developers of this game forsook gameplay and entertainment for an endless quest about "balance". It's not about fixing the bugs in the game, it's about nerfing the ♥♥♥♥ out of everything that's though as unbalanced. "Sure, let's keep the glitches and bugs, as long as knights can no longer outfight vanguards". The catch is, at no point has it hit the devs that there will never be players will the same amount of skill; there will always be someone better, there will always be a weapon that's better than the other, unless you make them all the same.\n\nNerfs in this game are inconsistent, random and uncalled. They range from simply altering the stats for a class, to completely overhauling the game out of the blue.\n\nWhat I learned with this game is, if you suck at it, cry about it on the devs forums and they'll release a patch that will nerf everything and make it easier for you, and harder for old players.\n\nSo, bottom line: This game is a money trap. My recommendation is not to buy it. You'll have fun for a couple of months, you'll develop some skills. Then there will be a nerf, and everything goes down the drain. This game is a marketing pitch, a sales scam. The nerfs and patches have only one goal in mind: To always make the game easier for new players, recent buyers or potential customers, while always triving to bring down veteran players by forcing them to constantly change their gameplay stile.\n\n\n","April 30, 2014","false","507.6"," 223 of 397 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","223","397","0","7"

Because, sorry to break it to you guys, you can't just start swinging a 5kg flamberge and just straight up stop in mid-air to swing again in the next second. That's not how physics work.\nSpeaking of physics, dragging. If you thought feinting wasn't realistic, wait to see a fully-armored knight just ballet-dancing with a 10kg maul. That's to give you and idea how bad this is.\nThe idea of dragging is to delay the strike's landing through ballet-dancing. I'm not kidding, that's all it really looks like. And so, back to physics : That could indeed work if you still had some attack-speed in the actual landing of the weapon. Because, yet again, sorry to break it to you, but just touching someone with the tip of the sharpest blade wont hurt him at all. It might actually tickle in a very pleasant way, but that's all you're gonna get.\n\nAnd so I thank you, makers of this fine game, for turning the dream of medieval warfare and my formerly favorite game into this nonsensical piece of garbage. I'm sure you've pleased a lot of call of duty fanboys out there.\n\nYou may take the obvious frustration with which I wrote this review as my final opinion on it. Chivalry : Medieval Warfare is litteraly painfully frustrating to play, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It's addictive and will turn you into an angry beast.

Because it's a totally unique game. How often do you see multiplayer medieval FPP/TPP game? It brings very refreshing feeling after all those modern shooters. And it's a really worthy representative of this rare kind of games.\n\nCombat might seem very simple (only 3 kinds of blows: swing, overhead and thrust attacks), but unexperienced people who teamkill and whine about randomness of fighting prove it wrong :). Also, mastering your movement (ducking blows, parry timing, jumping over people's shields to attack them from above, drags, etc.) will take a long time. By the way: what other attacks would you use in real fight? There's nothing to complain about, it's not some kind of Japanese hack'n'slash, for Argon's sake!\n\nThere are no killstreaks or perks in this game. Is it a flaw? Not at all. It's an actual advantage! Congratulations to developers for that decision, because efectiveness should be an effect of player's skill, not some buffs which give you supernatural health or damage rate.\n\nCommunity is generally great, far from typical "CoD kids", people can discuss about many clever topics, you know, like a sir.\n\nI also like high level of immersion: arrows wheezing next to your head, clanging of swords, rustling of hauberk... Imagine this with virtual reality headset...\n\nJust think about one thing: why wouldn't you buy the game that is so immersive and exceeds the boundaries of run-of-the-mill, overhyped productions developed by companies focused on milking money from customers? Many people complain about Battlefield, Titanfall, Call of Duty games. Why aren't you encouraged yet to join the world which maybe doesn't feature tanks, planes or guns, but contains epic, close, often honorable combat and no ♥♥♥♥♥♥s camping in debris, killing you from 1000 m?\n\n10/10, would join the Mason Order.","July 2, 2014","true","323.9"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","1"

The gameplay first seems pretty simple: While you parry with the right mouse, you can combo three different strike types:\nSide-swing\nOverhead-Swing\nStab\n\nThe core element of the gameplay is that these strikes can be accelerated, slowed down, comboed and shifted into various directions by moving/dragging the mouse. It could be described as "drawing your strike lines". Chivalry: Medieval Warfare calls this real-time control.\nThis system makes it challenging (but also rewarding) for the players to actually parry incoming strikes, because they have to move their mouse accordingly, for you are only able to parry an incoming strike by aiming your crosshair at the tip of the enemy weapon. What might sound easy or even repetitive and boring, is, for me, in reality the most thrilling sword-gameplay out there.\n\nUpdate: Chivalry, in fact became my all-time favourite game, due to its accessibility, steep and rewarding learning curve\n\n11/10 Would die for the glory of Agatha again","December 22, 2014","true","422.2"," 62 of 105 people (59%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","59","62","105","10","0"

Why did I buy this game? It looks like never-finished-alpha-version. The tutorial is so buggy that I had to quit the game and start over because the message "Press CTRL to crouch" just wouldn't disappear. And believe me I crouched like 100 times!!! Overlapping text on the screen where you are supposed to choose the faction? Seriously? Nobody noticed before? Shame... The weapon masters usually say 2 sentences at the same time, so you can practice multitasking. How do they do it? It's a mystery. The gameplay doesn't have anything in common with Chivalry. It is about: Kill that guy in armor from behind while he is busy fighting the other guy. Chivalric it is!!! If there is a skirmish of more than 2 players, you can be pretty sure that you will get killed by the bad guy or by a friend. Because it is just unpredictable. Kids slashing their own team members and nothing happens? Facepalm... Another thing: So, I am with the red team. Great. But that guy with the red shield just killed me. Ahaaa! So it was just a freaking red shield but he belongs to the blue ones. Tricky one! So basically the point is to eliminate other players like in Counter Strike but only with slow and "shtako" weapons. No quests, no story. Just kill them and count the kills! The Deadliest Warrior DLC added at least some cool looking characters and obviously time travelling feature. I am pretty sure that Ninjas, Pirates with pistols and Spartans wouldn't like to cooperate, so lets kill each other.

In my eight hours playing this game, I've had good times, and I've had bad.\n\nBut overall, I'm going to have to give this game a no.\n\nAllow me to explain.\n\nThe combat is heavily skill based, relying on you learning how to ' Get Gud '. While this is usually perfectly fine, and I enjoy a challenge, it does not work well when most of the rest of the community has two bodies, and a spare leg and a head above you in experience.\n\nYou will rarely find other players that are at the start of the leveling tier. Why? Because most are turned away by the sheer cliff of difficulty when it comes to learning the moves of the game, and actually being able to combat people who have done it for far longer than you, of which is little to impossible.\n\nIt gets worse when most of these high level players stack on their own team, making it impossible to make a dent, and ending with the match being steamrolled.\n\nI had fun at times, but overall, there's more rage than fun to be found here.\n\nI cannot reccommend this game, at this time.\n\nI'd more than happy give this another shot, if some sort of rank matchmaking system were implemented, placing you in games with people of your own level of skill. But unfortunately, even servers ment for someone of my skill level, are filled with players levels 20+, who mow down people like me in a moment.\n\nThis needs to be fixed. Hopefully, someday it will.\n\nTL;DR: I want to badly love this game, but I simply can't.","October 5, 2015","false","7.0"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","17","23","2","1"

That is, if you're good at keeping your rage in. If you're not good at that then this is not the game for you. Chivalry is a very competitive, but gory, game that takes time to perfect your skill at playing it.\n\nNOTE:\nThis game doesn't really have a story or characters, so I shall be missing those catergories off for this review.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay for Chivalry is like any FPS game (But with swords, axes etc.). There are many gamemodes available to players the moment they launch the game. These gamemodes consist of things like: Team Deathmatch, Free-For-All, Team Objective and many more. As I mentioned earlier, this game has a huge learning curve. Unless you are a pro when it comes to competitive games, you will not be good at this game straight away. You will also very likely be in a game with people a lot better than you, and know more skills and tactics than you do, but that doesn't mean you stop trying, eventually you'll adapt. Depending on the kind of audience, the gameplay in this game is a hard one to judge. If you're used to competitive games, this will most likely be fine for you, if you're not you might struggle at first.\n\nDesign/Graphics\nThere are plenty of different maps in Chivalry, all of which, have a unique feel to them. Whether you're fighting in a forest or sieging a castle, this game has perfectly designed maps fitted for the kind of game it is. Character models can be a bit clunky when it comes to them moving and turning around. As for the graphics, I never had a problem with them. There are plenty of different graphics settings and it doesn't take a super computer to run them high. :)\n\nUI [User Interface]\nAgain, I never had a problem with the UI of this game. The settings are easy to navigate, and if you want to votekick someone, it isn't that hard to find out how. The customization screen can be complicated for some people but other than that, for what it is, it's fine.\n\nPros - Plenty of hours of enjoyment\n- Very competitive\n- Plenty of weapons\n- Interesting maps\n- Great combat\n- Multiple gamemodes\n\nCons - Steep learning curve\n- Team-killers\n- Put against higher levels\n- Cheaters\n\nFinal Recommendation\nEven though Chivalry can be annoying at times, I enjoy raging at other players, and the amount of people calling each other hackers, it's quite entertaining. I would certaintly recommend playing this game if you like competitive games, or just want to improve on them. Plus if you like gory games you'll want to play this, trust me!\n\nFinal Verdict - 8/10.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEzfzis725k\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/219640/\n\nWhat did you think of my review?\nIf you liked it, please make sure to give it a thumbs up, and if you want to see more of my reviews, stay tuned on my curator page by clicking  here.\n\nThanks for Reading!","January 4","true","19.9"," 36 of 58 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","36","58","3","5"

It's going to take you more than a couple hundred hours before you start getting a hang of the game's mechanics.\n\nAnd if you're expecting a helpful and friendly community, temper your expectations... just a little bit. It's very rare to find high rank players that aren't complete dickbats. You will come across players who will intentionally try to get a reaction out of you for the sole purpose of being dickbats.\n\nYou'll also very likely get to hear a lot of "rekt", "ez" and "git gud" when someone kills you.

Hence, it should not be played on highest settings even if you may think your computer can handle it. You won't be able to control your character properly if you have low frames.

This makes it alot easier to get into the game, and really understand/ learn it.\n\nMods?\nChivalry do have modded servers. For example one mod gives you a lasersword insead of the normal weapons, it's basicly called Lasor Sword Mod.\nAnother one makes you bigger the more kills you get without dying, but when you die you go back to normal, it's called  Giant Slayers.\nThe last one im going to tell you about is the Black Knight mod. In Black Knight you can lose a arm, a leg, both arms even your head without dying (I think you die after 10 or 15 seconds if you lose your head....), and it's really fun.\nThere are maps you can download too.\n\nSummery\nIt's a great game, I would say pick it up when it's on sale, I bought it on summer sale 2015, my friend recomended it.\nJust so you know there i ingame purchases, but it's only skins and nothing you really need.\nI don't like that they have ingame purchases, they are already charging pretty much when it's not on sale.\nBut I love that they have modded servers.\n\nI hope you found this helpful, if you did could you please give it a thumbs up so I can that what Im doing is correct, if you would like me to change something in my review please write a comment, :D","November 26, 2015","true","13.4"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

At this point I feel that the bugs and the developers' ignoring of said bugs (especially after the release of the DLC) have too much of a negative impact on the game to enjoy anymore.\n\nThe game from a design standpoint is fantastic.  They made the best melee combat system I've seen in a game and there's a good variety of maps and game modes to play around with.  The style of the game with lots of gratuitous severing of limbs and decapitations and the ridiculous warcries gives it a nice over-the-top feel that make it a lot of fun.\n\nUnfortunately there are many bugs, some of which completely destroy any concept of class and weapon balance, that have existed since release.  The developers flat out refuse to acknowledge that these bugs even exist, much less fix them.  They have shown themselves to be completely clueless about weapon balance as well, often buffing the stronger weapons in patches and nerfing the weaker ones.  From what I understand the situation has only gotten worse since the release of the DLC.  Every server is pretty much guaranteed to have several people exploiting these bugs and ruining it for everybody else.\n\nSo while I did have a lot of fun with the game when it was new, mostly before the bugs were widely exploited, there's no way I can recommend it now.","July 5, 2014","false","96.7"," 22 of 34 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","22","34","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kony4/recommended/219640/","kony4","kony","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kony4/","707 products in account","A decent multiplayer action game (no singleplayer!)\n\nChivalry is similar to Mount & Blade and War of the Roses games. Like WotR, Chivalry is much more fast-paced than M&B. Unlike both M&B and WotR, Chivalry has no mounted combat at all, although it's not a huge drawback, it's still something relevant. Maps in Chivalry are small and the game offers a lot of game modes: deathmatches, capture the flag, king of the hill and many more. During the game the player chooses one of four classes - an archer or light/medium/heavy infrantry. They play quite differently - their speed is different and weaponry differs as well. However, the game suffers from terrible hitboxes - some weapons hit the enemy while they seem to be still far away from him, while other seemingly go through enemies harmlessly. In addition, there seems to be some kind of autoaim when playing archers, it seems very easy to just headshot a lot (or I am very good at it, which I doubt a lot as I'm not a good FPS player). There is a huge amount of graphical bugs or half-baked meshes and textures. Overall, the game is fun and I recommend getting it, albeit after some time it gets a bit stale. I definitely enjoy it more than War of the Roses and vanilla M&B, but cRPG servers in M&B Warband still remain my favourite swordplay action game.\n\n+ fun!\n+ interesting game modes\n+ decent combat\n\n- terrible hitboxes\n- no horsies\n- a lot of bugs\n\n+- tiny maps\n+- very arcade and quick","April 17","true","99.7"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","1"

However I'm sad to say that this game did not deliver on my expectations at all.\n\nFirst thing here is the issue with teamkilling. Teamkilling in this game is barely punished, all you get after hurting your team is more seconds on the respawn counter. That's not a good punishment at all, and that's only because team killing happens every 15 seconds of the game. You would think that your teammates would know what teams they're on but no. There's so many things in the game that gives you no excuse on being hostile to friendies, and the two big ones are your team colors and uniforms. Now if this game took the Red Orchestra 2 approach and made it so there was a system that automatically votekicked you unless you were forgiven by teammates I wouldn't mind this at all. However instead the only votekicking there is seems to be ignored by everyone.\n\nAnother issue with this game is how ♥♥♥♥ing horrible combat is. Animations don't even have to be done and I'm already beheaded. Why would you let your game have something like that. There's also a mechanic in the game where if you swing your body in the same direction as the attack it'll go faster and slower if you swing a different way. Now something  like this would be very cool, too bad that this mechanic is ruined by the fact this actually breaks the game since you could make your mouse have a seizure while mashing buttons and just recieve free kills. And oh, if you don't have ping under 80-90 good luck even landing a hit. It's worse than the Morrowind combat if you were to swing a sword while being trained to use axes.\n\nAnd finally there's the fact this game takes a stupid practice of DLC that I never condone, the cosmetic DLC. Street Fighter IV, Dead or Alive, and that Evolve game that recently came out. Customization is actually pretty nice in this game since you're allowed to have your personal units look like what you want but man I hope you want to shell out $2 if you really like a specific helmet.\n\nOverall I can't say you should ever waste your money on this game. I wasted $8 since there was a sale going on, but please just avoid this game. From what I heard even if you "git gud" at it you only are gonna get into a community that's L4D2 terrible.\n\nJust pick up Mount and Blade Warband instead.","February 27, 2015","false","10.7"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","16","23","2","5"

It goes on a cheap sale price so be sure to keep an eye out for it!\n\nThis game literally throws you into action and provides you with more than a simple swing the mouse and chop someone. The game has an awesome fighting engine. It's accurate and very rewarding while playing. What sets this one apart from other hack and slash's is the way you have to be facing the enemy to block or attack (and even dodge). On top of that, there are variances in the swings you can engage in. Rolling the mouse wheel backwards allows for a heavy overhead swing, while rolling it forwards provides a front poking motion extending your reach. Left button allows for a swing left to right while right mouse button is to block attacks. There are other swing variances that you should look into as I've set one of my extra mouse buttons as a side swing from right to left. Swing types matter as it could be the difference between hitting an opponent and accidentally hitting your own team-mate (which can be a regular occurrence given the right ignorance). Alternative attacks and different classes mix the game up and can really halt your strategy after receiving an arrow or axe to the head. The best game mode would be Team Objective (raid the castle) as being able to use some of the in game props like throwing torches or using a giant mounted crossbow can be just as fun as the modern day shooters.\n\nObjectives also change as you may be trying to free prisoners one game, another game you may be trying to slay the King's family. Just make sure you don't get a dimwit using the catapult or you and the enemy will go flying. Other modes include team death match, which is two teams going straight for one another, free for all, dual mode (where people go one on one), king of the hill, last team standing and capture the flag. Different classes are also available. There is man at arms, who is the fastest but least armor. Vanguard, who when he sprints, raises his sword over his head and can do a lunge jump attack unlike any other class. Knight, who is the slowest but has the most armor and does the most damage. Last but not least, the archer, who can still fight with a dagger but is better off shooting arrows. Swords can also be swapped in for maces and axes. There are other variances available as well for your other weapons such as throwing axes or mini-explosive fire bombs that burn enemies.\n\nGraphics and sounds are phenomenal. Everything seems to be given a realistic touch and levels take places from beautiful rolling hills to being on top of a volcano. If you get hit, you will see blood. Sounds of metal clanging together or being blocked can be heard throughout the game. When running, players are given the option of pressing "C" to make their character yell. It can get intimidating when 15 players are running after a few guys all yelling at the top of their lungs.\n\nReally fun to play for a while or simply drop in for a quick game. It's learning curve at first is a little difficult but after realizing how the game works get ready for flying vanguard sword attacks.\n\n8.3/10\n\n\nFor future Chiv games : adding horses or some sort of vehicle system may be appreciated for a Chiv 2 or some sort of update. There is a nice big open map available, why not make it complete chaos with more disposal or fixed mounted weapons.\n\n\nScreenShots :\nI hope I didn't block too early\n\nDifferent classes available in-game\n\nCausing chaos with a catapult from afar\n\nI chose throwing axes as my third weapon of choice to give my character some range\n\nJust a bit of gore","June 22, 2014","true","29.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","1"

The controls are very clunky and broken, very often the attacks/blocks don't work as advertised. I should point out that I actually am decent at this game, I usually get more kills than deaths and am usually at the top of my team or free for all lobby, so it's "not because I'm bad" despite how often the overly-defensive fans of this horrendous game will point out. Overall if you don't mind the game ♥♥♥♥ing you in the ♥♥♥ despite how used to the controls you are, and can get past how broken blocking attacks is, then give it a try I guess, though at it's best it's still not great.","October 23, 2014","false","15.6"," 33 of 56 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","33","56","0","1"

It would be worth paying money for if they fix the problems.\n\nCons:\nThere are a lot of bugs that indicate a lack of polish\n* I can't set my screen resolution for fullscreen to anything but my native desktop resolution.  Workaround is to set game to windowed mode with a set resolution via steam launch options then set to fullscreen after login.  There is a change resolution option in the game, but it doesn't have any options but my desktop res.\n* When attpempting to join a game that is full, a chunk of code error shows up rather than a message saying the game is full.  Not a problem, but seems like something that would be trivial to fix.\n* Game objectives that show up on the map sometimes have game error text rather than actual names\n* There is apparently a known bug on arena team matches where you sometimes don't spawn.  Based on other posts it has been around a long time and is quite common.\n* Players in team matches can apparently have skins/colors that override the team color, so the only way to tell what team they are on is to mouse over them and see if the dot is red.  This is rediculous.\n* Performance on a lot of maps is terrible, mainly because they make them large with tons of detail.  We don't really care how pretty the game looks, we'd rather it not chop.\n* Archer is quite frustrating to play.  Quite often shots go right through people without hitting them.\n* Block seems to be able to block attacks even from behind if attacking with a slash, and from multiple opponents.\n* There is no cost to being blocked.  If two people keep blocking/attacking each other, it will continue endlessly, pretty much regardless of weapon speed (dagger might be the only exception.)  I've heard it's supposed to attack faster after you block (riposte) but if it's there it's too miniscule to matter.  Think Assassin's Creed swordfighting without having a counter attack. This also applies to blocking multiple enemies simultainously.","September 7, 2015","false","15.1"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

You can not customize swings as you can barely turn at all when attacking .\nThis leads to linear boring uncreative combat.\n\nIf you think lighting fast reactions times will help you think again. Combat is slower than watching grass grow. You can comfortably go and make yourself a cup of tea  come back and still have time to parry.\n\nI've heard of simplyfying games for the masses but this is rediculous.\n\nThe controls are also needlessly silly needing a dedicated button to switch for a particular weapon , fast weapon scrolling is not an option. There are also dedicated buttons for each single opposite direction attack instead of 1 key that would revert the attack angle.\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning is its disregard for it's historic roots. The iconic Mason dragon is replaced by yes.. a bird..  and mason knights now look like muslim warriors .\n\nIf your into skilled gameplay and lightning fast reactions stay clear of this game and check out Age Of Chivalry the best FPM of all time.","October 10, 2014","false","33.6"," 20 of 32 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","20","32","0","3"

This competitive game centers around a team or an individual who must complete a certain goal. These certain goals range from clustering up 32 players in a tiny arena match and forcing them to kill each other, pillaging villages, killing the kings relatives and many more, all so players can rank up and get better weapons.\n\nNow to get on to what really happens when you play Chivalry. While playing this game, you will encounter many spaztic youths that are fully capable of decapitating your head in a single blow with a knife - apparently crouching down and staring up at the sky while preforming an overhand attack is powerful enough to chop a fully armoured mans head off. There are many other realistic ways you can be killed, such as recieving a punch that causes your head to explode, getting slammed into the ground by a ballista bolt or getting killed by that third arrow hitting your head after the first two lodged in your skull didn't kill you before. Higher leveled players may sheath their mauls or sledgehammers and beckon you to fight with the ol' fisty cuffs. Of they'll make sure you don't land a punch on them by ducking and weaving like a crazy Mike Tyson and you'll probably recieve a punch that causes your head to detatch and fly miles off the map. Obviously these tides can be turned around, and you may be the Captain of the ship - a winner.\n\nAnyway, great game and it can get competitive with friends and randoms alike. Easy to learn although difficult to actually master, this game will keep you entertained for a while especially when you learn all of the combat exploits/tricks etc.","August 31, 2014","true","181.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

These mechanics would make for a great single player game. Instead, you're forced to PvP and "newbie" servers are lvls 1 to 15..... so everyone is about 10 levels higher and newbies get thrown into a sharp, unenjoyable learning curve.\n\nI'd rather see the option to earn XP from bot games even if it's less XP than a pvp game. Simple reason being that I'd rather be having fun earning less XP than not having fun earning more XP. As it is, this game is no fun, which is a shame because it has the potential to be. Instead is a fun-less grind where you are cannon fodder for other people's amusement. Perhaps if it HAD a better matchmaking system where the ranks are better bracketed (say in brackets of 5s instead of 15 for the newbie matches and 16 to 50+ after) it would be far more enjoyable even in PvP. As other reviewers have pointed out, the problem isn't limited to just the newbie backets: get past lvl 15 and you're even worse off....\n\n\nSo, if you are a masochist, and you are picking only one game to soulessly grind till you get good, this is it. Or maybe if you're one of those gamers whose sole kicks come from "pwning" others.... For the rest of us normal gamers, this is sadly not it.\n\nedit: hilariously the elitist "muhhhh i get my kicks from putting others down" crowd is already rearing their ugly head. good games encourage you to pick up a game and improve in it with a broader learning curve. bad games expect you to be an expert with reflexes that only the top 1% of players actually have(and whom those putting others down to feel better about themselves actually don't have) right from the start.\n\nedit: who can forget? the stupid bugs on a game that's been around for 3 years... look at my screenshots. lol\n\nthank goodness i picked it up on 80% off....","September 9, 2015","false","5.4"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Smiledozer/recommended/219640/","Smiledozer","*IC* Smiledozer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Smiledozer/","484 products in account","Chivalry: Medieval Warfare is a nicely made Hack N' Slash, deathmatch styled game which places you in the shoes of one of four classes of Medieval warriors. Archers, Men-At-Arms, Vanguards, and Knights. The game is a simple "Red Vs. Blue" concept, and is comparable to every good online FPS game that's out there.\n\nAs such, Chivalry can be compared to Counter-Strike, except that in this case, it's in a medieval melee format for the most part. The exception to this is archers, ballistas, etc. The fun comes in when you play one of the several Team Objective matches, where you and your team must accomplish certain objectives in order to claim victory for your side There are several different game types, and variation in terms of maps and upgradable weaponry and armor, as in all of these styled games.\n\nThis is where the game gets a bit annoying because of the expensive DLC content. It doesn't make much sense to pay $5 dollars for a piece of armor or a sword. However, you can keep playing and upgrading your character, eventually getting better weaponry and armor. You can skip the DLC. But definately buy this game.\n\nPros:\n- Very fun Medieval concept, melee combat system (with some projectiles).\n- Hilarious voice overs and sound FX.\n- Chuckle at the ragdoll physics and the semi-gore\n- Addicting play\n- Very simple setup, no tutorial required (Can learn controls while games load)...but...\n- "Training" Tutorial for those who want practice in Medieval combat is available.\n- Also, leveled lobbies for beginners or advanced players.\n- Dozens of different weapons, with 4 different classes on either side. Will you choose the Mason Rebellion, or fight for the true King of Agatha?\n\nCons:\n- Game can get a bit glitchy/lag at some points. Not so much that it's a bother.\n- While the ragdoll deaths are funny, sometimes there tends to be a bit of texture popping going on. You can see right through the character at its' pivot points (Those of you who play know what I mean)\n- Some beginners may experience a little difficulty with fighting (in which case there are some great YouTube videos to watch to give you Tips on playing and training also)\n- Still seems like it has some work to be done, even though it was released in 2012.\n- Ridiculously expensive DLC featuring $2 - $5 weapons and Armor. While completely optional, it is still offensive that these arent simply at most $0.50.\n\nVerdict?\n\nChivalry: Medieval Warfare is an extremely fun and addicting online melee deathmatch game. Just the idea of it being melee/projectile (Throwing axes, arrows, etc.) oriented is very original to me. The play varies with who and what map you're playing with. There is also a full workshop with which to play with. All in all, my experience with this game is highly positive. I would buy this game again and again.\n\n7.5/10 - A great play with much potential, but still has a lot of room for work.","February 20, 2015","true","21.6"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","21","35","0","6"

I have gotten into quite a few message wars with several people...usually saying i'm stupid/poor for having bad internet and wether they win or lose the argument it usually ends up with me and all the other people in the match with a high ping getting kicked/banned.

I've played this for months, got about 400 hours in, and it's not getting any better.\nI promise you this game will never be balanced or fixed, because the developers are pretty obviously incompetent, and the game's mechanics fundamentally flawed. It's fun at first with the carnage and all, but you'll smell the BS pretty soon, and eventually see how incredibly unbalanced and bug-ridden this game is.\n\nI can just hope that another company is going to make a professional, balanced and working game like this.\nYou know, a developer that doesn't declare a game-breaking exploit (dragging) a feature instead of fixing it, or makes DLC while in BETA. DLC that of course is similarily unbalanced and bug-ridden, of course.\nI know I'm never going to touch any Torn Banner games ever again, that's for sure, and I advise you to not encourage this kind of bullsh*t and spare you the rage.\nThis game could have been awesome, but it never will be.

It doesnt necessarily look the best (Unreal 3 engine I believe), but it more than makes up for it with solid gameplay, ballsy attitude, and well populated servers (32 player matches). It's multi player only, although you can set up private servers and populate with bots if you prefer. Matches are your typical Deathmatch, Objectives (which are basically one team defending and the other attacking with objectives as you go along such as burning down or crashing gates, smashing towers, and so on on route to eventually trying to kill the King), Free For All (everybody vs everybody), etc..., but they are all quite fun. I've played through four different maps so far. I'm not sure how many more there are, but it's a little consequence. The gameplay is more important than the locations with this game.\n\nThe learning curve can be steep depending on the type of warrior you select as well as their loadout, (which is initially limited, but unlocks more stuff as you keep getting experience), but it is also pretty easy to get into the flow of the game. You WILL die a lot, and often in hilarious ways, such as getting set on fire just before having your head and an arm hacked off. You can also shout battlecries to your hearts content, lol.\n\nYou do get penalized for hitting your own teammates, which takes the form of longer respawn times, and if you are a repeat offender, everybody on your team gets to vote on whether or not to kick you. You can also switch sides if you like, mid game, and in fact, the game will sometimes rebalance and shift you automatically to even out the teams.  Speaking of respawns, while you are waiting, you basically are the ghost of your now dead warrior and can float around and/or above the battlefields checking out the battles while you wait.\n\nAll told, the game is a ton of fun to play, and I think it is pretty hilarious as well, with the graphic deaths, copious battle cries, and people running around like madmen.\n\nInitially, I thought this was about 8/10, but the more I play, the more I lean closer to a full 10/10.","December 3, 2014","true","39.4"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","1"

First of all, this game is super fun once you get used to getting smacked around by a bunch of 360 spinning vanguards with bodies of jelly. But besides that this game is amazing. It is quite amusing chopping off peoples limbs and yelling "Help". This game definitely takes some getting used to. Hell 500 hours in and I'm still level 29 (probably because I'm just bad).\n\nPros:\n- Graphics are pretty well done\n- The game mechanics are well balanced\n- Very fun community\n- Good selection of weapons (psst thrusting dagger/shield combo OP)\n- Constant updates patching bugs\n\nCons:\n- All the level 50+ that are just amazing at this game.\n- After a good while the maps get a bit repetative (thank you map mods)\n- Hit boxes sometimes get a bit janky\n\nOverall this game is well made and fun. I have made multiple friends playing this game and it continues. +1 to you Torn Banner.\n\nDeadliest WarriorThe expansion is (in my opinion) a better version of MW. There are many different classes with diversity. Each class has a wide variety of weapons and items to use. I feel that this expansion was saddly abondoned though. I haven't seen any updates fixing the many bugs. Also some weapons are very overpowered (Spartan Dory I'm looking at you).\n\nPros:\n- Graphics and mechanics are good.\n- A big leap from MW\n- Much bigger variety of classes\n- Most of the classes have their own little special ability.\n\nCons:\n- Very buggy\n- No balance in a few of the weapons.\n- Once again the level 50+ that spin around with their swords like they're trying to perform some sacred dance of the earth god (wait what? exactly)\n\nAnd here shall end my review of Chivalry. I would recommend this game for a friend. It is definitely worth its price. I can already tell that this game will consume another good portion of my life.\n\nOverall score 87/100","February 24, 2015","true","709.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","7","9","3","0"

It's a great game, but with how many countless bugs there are, I'm not sure this is worth full price. Some of the bugs that come to mind are the HUD shrinking whenever you change any option, vignette always re-enabling itself, weapons displaying the wrong stats, viewmodels and your camera breaking during many actions including reloading and interacting with the environment,  the crossbow randomly re-sighting after loading bolts, and the team balance. Dear God, the teambalance.\nIt can be 8 v 10, and it balances you to 7 v 11. If you try to change back to make it 8 v 10, it won't let you, and will instead do nothing, or make you a Vanguard. It can be 1 v 3, and if you keep winning, seemingly to spite you, another person joins and makes it 1 v 4. The team balance in this game does not exist, because it is just a malevolent spirit who wishes players from one team to another off of no basis.\nThis isn't a new game, either. It's been out a long time, and has many, many microtransaction cosmetics in it, so there is no reason for so many glitches.\n\nThere's also "New Player" servers which have most of the players and only allow 'low' ranks in, but the rank limit is high enough that the top skill level players are already in it, but if you happen to pass the rank you have to scrounge for a server with decent connection, the right gametype, and players.","June 17, 2015","false","56.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

I was following this game closely since start at 2012.\nHave bought 4pack just to support devs.\n\nLets summarize why this title did not succeed. For those interested in gamedev.\nKey to success is movement towards main goal.\nTwo ways to fail: (1) you do not do what needs to be done, but (2) wasting on useless things.\nInstead of digging into their main features - close range combat with all possible details, like (ask your nearest game dev about these):\n\n* Damage models\n* Range accounting\n\nIn case of melee fight, there should be more improvements about\n* Accurate simulation of dynamics - speed and angular moments of contacting bodies.\n\nFinally if everything is cool, something should be done about\n* Advanced melee fighting controls.\n\nInstead of this developers screwed with laser-guided archers and other useless unnesessary bs that finally ended this title.\n\nI think Dishonored2 could possibly take close range combat into their "forge" to cast something out.","March 28, 2014","false","4.4"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

Im not an expert >.>\n+Game is fun, seriously you guys.\n+Takes skill.\n+Graphics are good, but still tolerable at lowest settings (IMO)\n+There is a learning curve, and a "meta-game" (learning more "advanced" techniques), can clearly see the difference between Pros and Mediocre players (experience really shows)\n+Variety of weapons and 4 classes to tweak gameplay\n+DLC (that you sort of want but dont need.....no it's not free -_-)\n+Community is good (the occassional idiots comes along & stands out, but they're few & far inbetween)\n+Friendly Fire on (makes for more dynamic gameplay)\n+Id imagine that, even after unlocking all weapons, you'll still play (at least casually) for fun or to better youself as a player\n+Rank provides a sense of progression, abliet a weak sense of progression....\n+User generated content...I think\n+Music isn't annoying, repetitive maybe, but it's appropriate to the point where you don't notice it (which is a good thing) so it wont hamper gameplay, and you also wont be playing in dead silence.\n+Can chop or smash certain body parts of enemies and comrades alike (even if they're dead and it's just a ragdoll). Note:If you wanna disrespect a fallen foe, bash his ragdoll's head in\n+Hey look a beta\n+(Moderately detailed) votekick to punish unruly players\n+Well optimized\n+ Ideal matches determined by collective skill & teamwork of the team\n+Acceptable variety of game modes\n+Not pay to win (microtransactions seem to be limited to cosmetics)\n+Really easy to find a (near-full) match\n+Can freely switch between 1st-person and 3rd-person view (So it isn't strictly first person)\n+Classes & Weapons are balanced.\n\n-Occassional abuse of Friendly Fire\n-As with many games, players with higher FPS have a huge advantage (this is worth noting)\n-Story only exists as an excuse for fighting (IMO)\n-Bugs & Glitches, that you figure the developers are working on to fix (and trying their best, as far as circumstance allows) but will ♥♥♥♥ you off anyway.\n-Small playerbase (IMO......at least at the time of my typing this)\n- Maps & Game Modes can be repetitive (you'll probably still play, but just less, or in short bursts)\n-Practice makes perfect, but ♥♥♥♥  "practice" is hard\n-There is a chat function, but it's not the best, texts can obscure gameplay at times (though I suppose this is subject to change)\n-Votekick prompt "can" obscure gameplay for 30 long seconds (also probably subject to change if Tornbanner wanted to)\n-Matches sometimes determined by "who has the most players" (although this is expected, yet still annoying)\n-Lot's of emtpy servers, combined with small playerbase (as I mentioned) can decrease your morale if you think too hard into it for too long.\n-Community not very organized (likely due to size) so finding information, active clans, detailed guides, decent gameplay, or just socializing with community can prove to be difficult (relative to other MMO's)\n-The "Chivalry:Deadliest Warrrior" DLC is ambiguos (again probably due to small player base).What little information you will find on it is either discouraging, or encouraging. Such contrast makes it tough to decide if you should buy it or not.\n-Although there is technically what can be called a "meta-game", not much depth to gameplay, I think this is why most players don't seem to have a lot of hours on the game. Even dedicated players seem to end up playing casually. IMO\n\nWell that's my simple review, this is all I can think of, will edit if neccessary (If I'm still alive when neccessary that is)\n\nFinal Veridct: Look, just get it ok. It's likely  you'll only regret it if it turns out your rig cant handle it.","February 5, 2014","true","46.9"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","12","19","0","0"

I played on the oldschool duel servers and then used gained skills to help my team in TO.\n\nBut recent changes are making the game worse. I used to click on the icon on my desktop, wait through a bit of the logo and get to the game.\n\nNow, I have to wait for the launcher to pop-up, click play, wait for the game to start, wait for at least 3 fixed-lenght animations to finish and then I get dumped into this mess the main menu has become.\n\nNot to mention that if you want to be good, you have to learn how far you have to get from a sword for it to not hit you. I learned that and I became pretty good. But I just played this abizmal new updated version after a few weeks and the hate that's been rising since I picked this game up again after a few months just reached a point, when I can't play this clusterf**k anymore.\n\nThe crouch and sprint has a noticeable delay after pressing the key. Hitting a shield midswing doesn't stop enemies to get you with a backswing. You no longer time blocks, you just press the button and hope. Reach on the weapons is stupid and in no way represents their lenght in any logical way. And even if you finally get to someone with a long range weapon, they are less that a foot far from you, you hit them in the middle of their chest, they don't block and that hit just doesn't count...\n\nI adored this game. I was near addicted. It sucked me into those old times better than any game ever. And that's why it's so sad to see it turn this bad.\n\nI will come back to it a few months. Maybe it will become what it used to be. Maybe it will be better. Or maybe it will be the same, because frankly, I can't see it getting any worse.

It was fun, truely, but then I started seeing the flaws in it. Big holes that couldnt be patched out.\n\nOne: Aim Botters. They have them for this game, believe me. "But Draconis, arent you being biased and just QQing about being killed?" No. Go look in my library and youll see I have over 300+ FPS games, most of which have hundreds if not thousands of hours in them. I know what aim bots look like, and how to test them to see if Im right or not. This isnt the kind of game you pre-fire on either, so there arent any legit excuses for "blind shotting" people across a map in the head consistantly.\n\nTwo: Block/Parry/Dodge. You have a stamina meter for really no reason other than to say that you get two attacks and maybe three blocks before you cant do anything more. This is up there with Battlefield sprint. A few seconds and its good night for you. Its not a fast combat game any longer. Thisisnt so much the problem as the game's tutorial tells you that you can get a counterblow after a block. That is an outright LIE. You block, then they can block directly afterward.\n\nThree: Speed Hacks. Yes they have them, along with, as far as I can tell, Stamina Hacks so that people can consistantly and progressively attack without stopping. If you ahve played more than five minutes, you will understand there is a visible differance between a constant, instant attack seven times with a pike stab vs you playing with a pike and getting three stabs before your stamina is gone between attacks and blocks.\n\nFour: No VAC or any risk of cheaters even being repremanded. I think they siad they had a cheat protection, but people were very quick to see others behind walls and stop at doorways before they came around to get a free hit.\n\nFive: A whiny ♥♥♥♥♥ass community that made reading chat a huge head ache for me. There is a way to turn off chat I think but I really didnt want to bother. I just stopped playing after hearing some debate about racist words that no one gave a ♥♥♥♥ about.\n\nSix: Everyone is experienced but you. This means access to better, faster weapons and more effective equipment. This can be comparable to COD where you are rank 1 and they are rank 40. Sure you have weapons that can kill, just not as well as theirs. And I do mean EVERYONE has this sort of rank. Out of ten servers, I was the only person who apprently bought this game in the last two years, as I was 30 ranks lower than the lowest rank in every server.\n\nSeven: The DLC isnt even being played by anyone. What a huge waste of money. Good thing I got this from Green Man Gameing for like 5$.\n\nEight: I got kiled by my own team more than I did the opposing team. And I mean about 10:1 ratio. Im not even kidding. Team damage in a game like this shouldnt even be a thing.\n\nNine: Elitist ♥♥♥♥ all over. If you dont know what you are doing, they will make sure to tell you in the worst possible way. If you ask a question, they like making you feel stupid about wanting to learn.\n\nTen: Dead game that hardly anyone plays except for all of the people mentioned above. Imagine LoL community narrowed down to the biggest ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bags and turned into about 100 people. Thats Chivalry.\n\nAnd there you have it. Oh, also, I forgot to mention. Most skins in this game are "Pay IRL Money" and cost like 8$....Yeah 8$ for a weapon skin....one weapon....Not "Play to Unlock" because those require you to have a HUGE rank which will take forever. Those are limited to only on or two skins. I mean the good looking ones.

This isnt the kind of game you pre-fire on either, so there arent any legit excuses for "blind shotting" people across a map in the head consistantly.\n\nTwo: Block/Parry/Dodge. You have a stamina meter for really no reason other than to say that you get two attacks and maybe three blocks before you cant do anything more. This is up there with Battlefield sprint. A few seconds and its good night for you. Its not a fast combat game any longer. Thisisnt so much the problem as the game's tutorial tells you that you can get a counterblow after a block. That is an outright LIE. You block, then they can block directly afterward.\n\nThree: Speed Hacks. Yes they have them, along with, as far as I can tell, Stamina Hacks so that people can consistantly and progressively attack without stopping. If you ahve played more than five minutes, you will understand there is a visible differance between a constant, instant attack seven times with a pike stab vs you playing with a pike and getting three stabs before your stamina is gone between attacks and blocks.\n\nFour: No VAC or any risk of cheaters even being repremanded. I think they siad they had a cheat protection, but people were very quick to see others behind walls and stop at doorways before they came around to get a free hit.\n\nFive: A whiny ♥♥♥♥♥ass community that made reading chat a huge head ache for me. There is a way to turn off chat I think but I really didnt want to bother. I just stopped playing after hearing some debate about racist words that no one gave a ♥♥♥♥ about.\n\nSix: Everyone is experienced but you. This means access to better, faster weapons and more effective equipment. This can be comparable to COD where you are rank 1 and they are rank 40. Sure you have weapons that can kill, just not as well as theirs. And I do mean EVERYONE has this sort of rank. Out of ten servers, I was the only person who apprently bought this game in the last two years, as I was 30 ranks lower than the lowest rank in every server.\n\nSeven: The DLC isnt even being played by anyone. What a huge waste of money. Good thing I got this from Green Man Gameing for like 5$.\n\nEight: I got kiled by my own team more than I did the opposing team. And I mean about 10:1 ratio. Im not even kidding. Team damage in a game like this shouldnt even be a thing.\n\nNine: Elitist ♥♥♥♥ all over. If you dont know what you are doing, they will make sure to tell you in the worst possible way. If you ask a question, they like making you feel stupid about wanting to learn.\n\nTen: Dead game that hardly anyone plays except for all of the people mentioned above. Imagine LoL community narrowed down to the biggest ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bags and turned into about 100 people. Thats Chivalry.\n\nAnd there you have it. Oh, also, I forgot to mention. Most skins in this game are "Pay IRL Money" and cost like 8$....Yeah 8$ for a weapon skin....one weapon....Not "Play to Unlock" because those require you to have a HUGE rank which will take forever. Those are limited to only on or two skins. I mean the good looking ones. Everyones excuse is that it supports the Devs. So WTF did buying the game do exactly?\n\nAnyhow, thats the honest review.","August 26, 2015","false","4.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I wish there was a way people could play with others that don't do this. I also don't like how the developers charge you for character skins that players create. There are so many workshop mods but the developers hardly ever add any into the game. This is extremely dissapointing thinking about how many fun game modes and new weapons and armors could be added into the game.

Do some objectives, come hither, oooo look: a rainbow!, run some more, duel, duel on TO servers, get scolded for duelling on TO servers, go on a duel server, get rekt, go back to TO and behave! Rinse and repeat. Fun, fun, fun!\n\nIt's like being inside The Kingdom of Heaven (the film, not the actual place) with all its visceral beauty and gore. It will get your heart racing and you'll feel every slash, every bash and every stab. Decent headphones are a must - there is no sound more awe-inspiring than that of someone's helmet, skull and brains being mushed into a sticky pulp with one drop of a maul. It's just beautiful!\n\nStick around and you'll meet some of the nicest people around (at least EU-side, but I do have friends in the States too). Community-driven events and antics happen all the time and you can count on veteran players helpin you out with tactics, optimisation and anything really. Sure, there are a few bell-ends too, but every game has a few, nothing to be concerned about. Talk to me if you need anything and I'm sure 99% of players over 50 lvl will say the same.\n\nIn terms of graphics - little bit outdated, but it's UE3 so there's no surprise. Sound design is superb, rivalled only by that of Alien: Isolation and I'm not saying it lightly. Playability?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sFRAVYlB/recommended/219640/","sFRAVYlB","Marmiteinajar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sFRAVYlB/","69 products in account","This game is currently where most of my hours are invested in.\nUnless you have friends that play this game, I wouldn't highly recommend it but it is still fun nonetheless.\n\nI bought this game close to its release date, back then the community was casual, players were still adjusting to the combat system, class system and the plethora of weapons they had at their disposal. It was all fun and games, either dying to a dagger or having your face caved in by a maul. All players were deciding their play style. It was and still is fun, however one the main issues is the constant lack of good fixes from the developers, I'm not talking about the animation glitches such as reversal overheads but the hud, miscellaneous game changes as well as the map exploits. I've only came back a few months ago.\n\nThere are numerous times that the hud has become glitchy, when you're playing with friends and you see that green marker, you know exactly what I'm talking about. This has been a bug for quite sometime and these 'fixes' are not really doing anything. The gritty melee death camera is a notable example, having your character in first person and stay in first person when you die is gruesome especially when you see your head getting sliced apart from you body, it was all for immersion or when the in game voice chat has been removed because people were abusing it? Simply add the mute option to everyone and they themselves can pick who they want to personally mute,I remember when the King character would rally his men and lead the charge in the final minute of the match, it was exhilarating. Map exploits are still present, i.e spawn camping, spawn glitching as well as unorthodox map areas which were meant to be inaccessible such as the Arena.\n\nNow how does the game currently fare? Excluding all the bugs or lack of proper fixes?\n- The community\nIf you're playing for the first time, you need to know that the majority of the current chivalry community consists of very high level players most of which have over hundreds or thousands of hours of game time, you will get crushed by them, over and over, it is inevitable. Some even exploit the newcomers for the gain to finally reach level 50 for that golden helmet. Many will kick you for friendly fire, abuse your lack of knowledge about the game and overall they can be infuriating at times.Now you must understand that not all veteran players are like this. Many see that it's great that the game gets revitalised by newcomers, even with the occasional annoyance of friendly fire. This is where you see the duelyard servers, these servers contain a community that is more than willing to help you with the game, as well as giving you opportunities to have sessions with veteran players and useful tips they can provide, just ask. It will take time, that is for sure to be able to withstand pro players or even hold off 20 seconds of their slaughter but the more you do hold them off, that is an achievement you can be proud of as you invest more time into the game.\n\n-The combat system\nWe now come to the combat system, we all had our taste of metal, enjoyable is it not? To visibly see the impact your weapon made to the enemy. This is what splits Chivalry from the rest of medieval games, the immersion. This has since been broken by the introduction of fighting techniques such as the reversals,drags and accelerations. But you must think, if the game resorted to just feints and left clicks it wouldn't be fun would it. To be able to pull those moves off is a testament to how skills players have become, whiffing such moves or having people block said moves is a death sentence. This is the skillcap of the game, despite the animation glitches when pulling such moves. As a new player, of course you aren't able to pull these off right away and you'll be dying to them a lot, but when you do pull at least one of them off, it is satisfying. Plain. Satisfaction.\n\n-Tips when starting out\nUse the tutorial system, I cannot stress this enough, even if you can't stand to hear the instructor's voice over and over. It will teach you that there is more to combat than simply LMB, learn to block at the right moments, use different attacks, find a class that is worthy of your play style and see what weapons you want to specialise in.\nIf you do team kill, please apologise in chat, it may mean the difference between you staying on the server with a positive outlook or serve as a major thorn in the side. Team kills happen a lot, it's not uncommon but not saying anything afterwards will really tick the recipient off as though it was intentional.\nDon't give your hopes up, we were all new players once,it's hard trying to combat someone that you have no chance of winning in a 1v1 but coordinate, such as in TO, no one lives long enough to contribute if they attack on their own, learn to use stabs in group fights, act as support and if all else fails let the veterans take the brunt of the fighting and see if you exploit other areas.The optimisation is still poor, the developers need to get up and start dealing with these issues now rather than release more and more cosmetics.\n\nIn the end, you will find people who will destroy you, you will find people who will help you, you will need to take time in order to even 3v1 the absolute veterans. This is the process of any combat game. Is it a bit of a mess? Sure, but for only $5, it's a great mess.","October 18, 2015","true","232.5"," 19 of 33 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","19","33","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deytal/recommended/219640/","Deytal","ֆℱ | Deytal the Fluffy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deytal/","318 products in account","Okay, after coming around 1000 hours of gameplay time, I'll write this. So!\n\nI love this game, man.\nSeriously.\n9999/10\n\nBut I'll keep this as relatively unbiased as possible.\n\nThis is a hard game. A really hard game. You will die over and over and over, because starting out, you don't know the mechanics very well. "But I played the tut-!" No. You have to practice a looooooot, which is what turns away many potential players. The learning curve isn't a curve. It's just a giant tower you have to climb by piling up the bodies of you and your enemies, and it -will- take time. But then the game starts to shine.\n\nThis is a game of skill.\n\n"But Deytal, doesn't ever-" Noooo. I hate to bring the age-old comparison of Call of Duty, but whatever. You get shot in the back in CoD, you're done 95% of the time. In Chivalry, if someone gets the drop on you, you've got a very decent chance of coming around and smashing them. Sure, you'll be at a disadvantage, but you aren't just going to outright -die-. Unless you're an archer. Then, RIP you scumbag.\n\nWith plenty of variety in the classes, you can really choose how you want to play by what you enjoy most. Like incredibly fast, twitchy swordplay? Man-at-Arms.\nWant a really big stick or sword and just cleave everything in sight? Vanguard!\nFeel like tanking hits and relying almost exclusively on your weapon skill rather than mobility? Knight!\nFeel like dying a lot? Archer.\n\nBut onto my opinion of actual game mechanics. You've likely read other reviews, explaining the use of the main three attacks: Slash, Stab, and Overhead. They do exactly as they say. However, you are able to speed up or slow down your attacks by moving your mouse, even letting you go around the side of a person if they aren't wary. There is the feint (faking an attack), which is insanely controversial, but it has uses in attacking and defense. (I personally don't use it offensively, due to the nature of blocking in this game). Damage is determined by where you hit them, with what attack, and with what weapon. -When- you hit them has no effect. In the DLC, Deadliest Warrior, timing matters. In the base game, it does not. This makes for some odd scenes, with a person swinging a sword as fast as a snail, then slicing off someone's head. This is a negative in terms of realism, but in terms of game mechanics, it adds HUGE depth to your timed blocking and attacking.\n\nOkay, so I'll give a quick rundown of Pros and Cons.\n\nPros\nVariety in Classes\nMany weapons\nSeveral Gamemodes\nWorkshop Support\nDismemberment\nThird or First Person\nHuge depth in game mechanics\nVoices for voice commands are amazing\nAbsolute joy to play with friends\nUnderstandable Combat Mechanics (Ducking, riposte, parrying, blocking with a shield)\nCons\nBad Community\nNot easy on newbies (There are beginner only servers, though)\nMinimal Singleplayer (bot matches and the tutorial)\nBuggy Tutorial\nGood ping required. (anything over 100 really starts giving problems)\nUnusual combat mechanics (Reverse overheads, dragging. This isn't really an issue until you fight higher level players, such as rank 30's)\nMinimal Unlocks (Once you've gotten some kills with your weapons, you get more. Oh, and a hat. That's pretty much the extent of unlocks, and then the game starts to lose some drive, but it holds its charm)\nIf I had to give it a grade, I'd go with 80/100. Worth getting if you're into swordplay and the like, but it doesn't take long for you to have done everything there is to do. However, the skill ceiling pretty much never ends. There is always someone better than you, and someone worse. Besides, making a guy's head explode with your fist is always satisfying.\n","December 6, 2014","true","035.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amobilia/recommended/219640/","amobilia","|ĶiĻă|R| Maul Cop","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amobilia/","42 products in account","I recommend this game, there are some draw backs. I'll go over these pros and cons and you decide for yourself.\nPros:\nThis game is very addictive with a skill cap which only yourself limits you. This game through reviews may seem like "Spinning Stimulator" but I'll tell you it's not, though spins are involved it's because the game mechanics though sometimes buggy and slightly exploitable rely on fluidity to combo attacks successfully and gracefully. There are things where you drag your swing to slow it down, or accel your swing (accelerated attack) to speed it up. There are ways to hit around blocks, because blocking covers a limited area and not your sides you have to look at the weapon to block it. This game takes a while to master, I am no where close, around 200 hours is where I personally increased in skill rapidly, then at around 460 which is recent, the peak and valleys of learning are evident in this game. Word of warning, everyone thinks they're bad at this game, well most do, it's because there are a lot of people who may be better than you even though it's a small, albeit slightly toxic community.\nNow, about to community, as previously stated it is slightly toxic but that's the normal trolls who are in any game, there are very skilled genuinely nice players who are willing to help new players, I'll tell you my story in this game after the reveiw if you're still around. Now, it is a small community, at least in comparison to most games. Everyone seems to know one another, I personally know many people and I know who a lot of the trolls are. Hacking really isn't much of an issue in this game, server admins of private servers can make themselves do hacking like things through console commands. But there are a decent bit of active admins especially in the EU servers whom TornBanner has put into commission for their official servers. The community can be very entertaining.\nThere are more pros but they are more on the minor side so I'll go to the cons.\nCons:\nSmall community that seems to be dying, though, I have seen an influx of new players as of late.\nSometimes the skill cap or lack there of is discouraging, there are definitely extremely good players out there. It's a higher skill difference than Silver 1 to Global Elite. But there are tutorials on YouTube to learn about this game, I suggest "Teripper".\nThis game can become an addiction, I have wasted quite a long time on this game that I bought on sale for $5, for $5 I'd strongly suggest you pick this game up (on sale for $5).\nNow, I'll tell you about my story which is interesting and unnsual in the Chivalry world of players.\nI bought this game for $5 as did my friend, we played a while he played about 6 hours (even to this day) I had about 24 because I liked this game a log. That's when I unknowingly met a legend in a duel server. This man's name is, Mud, Mud is widely know for being the best fister (fist fighter) there is. He kicked my ♥♥♥ with his fists while I used a weapon. I asked him to teach me. He did, though he later told me he thought I'd just give up, I was his first student in a long time. I literally couldn't hit him strafing side to side my aim was so bad. But I didn't give up. The training was long and brutal. 60 hours of only using fists I sucked still. To keep it shorter I spent a total of 300 consecutive hours only using my fists. He taught me and I learned. Now at that point I met a man at the time named simply "Bada' he was level 48 which is hard to get to because of the XP increase level to level. And he liked me, my fisting taught me footwork, which is important to learn, so I was ahead of the learning curve, he taught me to swordfight, as did Sheep, only a little but a very good fighter. I'm now in a clan which used to be #4 NA until it broke apart an was recently reformed by stellar players. I've been very lucky. Made a lot of friends and met some awesome players. Some of the best in the world some of whom are great friends now. And I am now though slightly self proclaimed top 5 best fisters NA. Mud aggrees and he is probably Numer 1\n\nEveryone's experience is different. This community is a fire slowly dying, but, as people keep joining some don't realise but you're the future of this game. Many may move on to Mordhau but a few will remain, coming back to see every once in a while. You see, there is a joke in Chivalry, commonly exchanged by players of higher levels and skill. " we don't play this game because we like it, we play it because we must" though there is a hidden truth and does have a deeper meaning, all of us hate to see this game die, and the cheesey spins are performed by people at first who aren't that great, mostly the first thing people learn.\nI leave you with that. You must decide. I personally, recommend it.","April 18","true","667.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I've play 2 matches: a duel with a friend (had fun), and a match in a server. And i must say, the server finder is really bad, servers are always full or fully empty, and the community... oh my god, the community... its one of the worst communities i've ever seen. Joined a server and in 5 minutes like 3 or 4 people got kicked. The chat was being spammed by a bunch of new player hater ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who were pretty much insulting everyone just for starting the game. It was even worse than in tf2 (and that's quite an accomplishment). Few minutes later, i was kicked too. Yeah, i had a lot of team damage, but the teams aren't clear at all. Blood turns every blue player into red, there are no names or labels like "red knight playername", customizing can cause the team colour to almost dissapear, and every teammate acts exactly like an enemy (blocking your path, damaging you...). Might be supposed to be realistic, but overall is just really, really annoying, specially knowing that after you kill a pair of teammates in accident you get insulted and kicked.\nThe game itself is good, but is not done for playing in pubs. If you got friends (but MANY friends, if you got only 2 or 3 friends with the game you can only do duels) i somewhat recommend it, in private matches. If you don't, i totally don't recommend it.\nThe game itself is an 8/10. Playing it is a 3/10.

Have you ever wanted to taste the glory of the battlefield? If you salivate at the prospect of a competitive, online, medieval-style war game with siege warfare and bloodcurdling screams,  then BUY THIS GAME!!!  I'd give it a 8.5/10, but incredibly addicting!  Most players you will notice have 1k+ hours.\n\nI will give you some deets if you are on the fence/generally interested but not convinced. Slightly lengthy but compiled well.\n\n--------\n<PRO'S>\n--------\n\nCOMBAT:\n-The combat system is more robust than anything else out there.\n-Ability to drag (slow down) and accelerate (speed up) attacks by moving your mouse certain ways.\n-Overheads, stabs, and horizontal attacks are all in melee possibility along with kicks and shield bashes.\n-Spacing, positioning, situational awareness, teamwork, dodging projectiles, siege warfare, timing, and skill are pivotal.\n-Ability to parry attacks, block with a shield, riposte attacks, and dodge (if Men At Arms)\n-Your attacks seem to have real weight and consequences to missing as opposed to something like mount & blade or war of the roses.\n\nGAME MODES:\nEach game mode benefits a growing player's skills as each will get you good at certain aspects of the game.  There are also a few different mods out there. Some for competitive play (mercs), and some for fun (black knight, giantslayer, laserswords, horde)\n-Team Deathmatch-----(Good at building teamwork and straight-to-the-point kill tactics)\n-Free For All------------(Better for learning situational awareness and being "in the ♥♥♥♥")\n-Capture the Flag-------(Also good at building teamwork and battle tactics)\n-King of the Hill---------(Helps build team engagement prowess and situational awareness)\n-Duel Yards-------------(Good at learning 1vs1 tactics and the nicities of fighting an opponent/parrying)\n-Team Objective-------(the longest and most fun/immersive IMHO. Promotes teamwork towards a common goal.)\n\nVOICE ACTING:\nNow this is something you wouldn't think would be a huge part of the game, but it adds a lot of depth. Especially when used in the right context by players. each class for both Agatha and Mason have about 20 different voice commands, each with 5 varieties of what is said for that "command", along with a battlecry.  This brings a new level of immersion to the battlefield\n\nCLASS SELECTION:\nFairly simple, but effective class selection.  Four classes, each balanced in their own respect with a different playstyle for each.  Tons of weapon selection with a basic enough principle for each. Different Damage, Reach, Speed, and preferred attack for max damage. (For examples spears have better stab attacks while axes have better overheads.)\n-Knight    (most health and armor, heavy hitting, slower weapons and run speed)\n-Vanguard    (Moderate health and armor, very long weapons, cannot combo with spears-types, charge attack)\n-Men At Arms    (Low health and armor, very fast attack/movement, can use firepots, has dodge)\n-Archer    (piddly health and armor, 1shot by almost all knight weapons, medium speed, excel at killing from afar)\n\n------------\n<NEUTRAL>\n------------\n\nADVANCED TACTICS:\nThe game has a lot of fine nuances. This actually fleshes out the combat system even more for competitive purposes, adding a lot of depth. Tactics that have been adapted over the game's lifetime are utilized by a lot of high-tier players. These include:\n-The fabled reverse overhead\n-Head Feints\n-Feinting\n-Rubberbanding\n-Target switching\n-Combo-feint-to-parry\n\nThe reason this is neutral is because on one hand, I don't think a lot of these tactics were intended, but rather were discovered throughout the community to be effective means of utilizing the game mechanics. On the other hand, they really start to take away from the game's immersive nature. In rare situations, with desync, these can seem like exploits.\n\n---------\n<CON'S>\n---------\n\nNEW PLAYERS:\nThis game has a fairly unforgiving learning curve. I suggest any new player play the tutorial before playing online against other players, and to experiment with all of the classes while playing until you find the class that best suits your playstyle.  This will ensure 1.) that you end up playing the class you were fated to and 2.) that you at least understand from firsthand experience what the other classes are capable of when you are fighting them.\n\nGLITCHES & DESYNC:\n-Every now and again you will get caught in an odd place, possibly something like a step, an awkward corner, a small rock, an odd crevice. In this situation you'll have to press F10 to kill yourself or someone can kick you out of it if you're lucky.\n\n-Desync will occur sometimes. This basically means your game client and the server don't agree on what is going on, despite what may appear to be happening on your screen.  Sometimes you will experience a stab that seemed way too freaking fast, an animation that didn't seem to quite play, or someone rubberbanding around somehow.  It doesn't happen enough where it's overwhelmingly noticeable. In fairness, these issues can be expected in any online game, but are only particularly frustrating in chivalry because time, space, and visuals are such an important element in the complex combat system.\n\n\nAll in all, if you are even slightly interested in the aforementioned aspects of a medieval deathfestival, you cannot pass this game up if it 50% off or more.\n\nIt offers the most emmersive medieval melee combat experience out there.  It has the capacity to be both hilarious as all hell and competative to a stressful point (if you pursue competitive). There have been games where I have gone ten+ lives in a row without killing a soul.  Then the next life, by the grace of valhalla, I will go on a 7 man killing spree involving a legitimate 4v1 situation and lop a few heads, and it gets me rock hard.  These are the moments I live for in chivalry.","May 29, 2015","true","905.5"," 21 of 37 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","21","37","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/memes4breakfast/recommended/219640/","memes4breakfast","Rusty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/memes4breakfast/","224 products in account","I have less than 200 hours, so take my review with a grain of salt.\nUnless you're interested in playing competitively, and learning every abstract technique in the book, just play it with friends. The swordplay is really crazy and fun, but the community mostly consists of veterans with thousands of hours. This makes the learning curve almost entirely vertical, as you'll never have the chance to test your mettle against people of similar skill. You will most likely die to veterans without fully understanding why, again and again. If you can overlook the skill disparity between veterans and newcomers, there is a really enjoyable and deceptively complex experience to be had.\n\nMost veterans are beginner friendly, willing to teach anyone who is willing to learn. In fact, there is even a pinned thread in the Steam forums where players can offer/request coaching. That being said, there are a handful of high-level players who perpetrate a toxic environment by insulting anyone of a lower skill level than themselves. These people are best ignored, as they often get stomped by the more approachable veterans.\n\nIf you're looking for a Medieval swordfighting game with a high skill ceiling, and you don't care about "immersion-breaking bugs," buy at full price. It's absolutely worth every single penny.\n\nIf you're looking for an immersive online Medieval swordfighting experience, you might be disappointed. Wait until the next Free to Play Weekend, and try it before you buy.\n\nIf you're thinking about buying the Medieval Warfare and Deadliest Warrior bundle, DON'T.\nThey abandoned DW, and it's heavily unpolished in comparison to MW. Just buy the base game (MW), and spend that extra money on a weapon skin or something.","December 18, 2015","true","175.5"," 21 of 37 people (57%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","57","21","37","4","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mostlynice/recommended/219640/","mostlynice","Mostly Nice","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mostlynice/","774 products in account","Overall, a very good game for the money. Whilst it's riddled with imbalance issues and has a steep learning curve you can never fully master, it achieves what it sets out to do. The sound effects are second only to the likes of battlefield’s and the graphics, while not the most amazing, are smooth and pleasing enough to carry the game through. This game is not for the feint hearted or those easily frustrated, prepare for counter strike style rounds and re-spawning.\nThe highlights of the game aside from the unique combat really are the objective game types. These prove to give hours upon hours of satisfaction and something to play for. The ranking system for Medieval Warfare is probably one of the worst/laziest I’ve seen to date so you will not have much else incentive except of course unlocking a variety of weapons that becomes frustrating in itself. If you’re looking for a better rank system; I recommend getting deadliest warrior, however, as yet there are no objective game types sadly.\nMy recommendation would be to buy this game. It well worth the full price, but don’t expect it to be perfect. In many ways the game still plays like the BETA but I believe that in time the developers will polish the game and combine elements of the DLC & original game for a better product & a more completive game.","March 21, 2013","true","703.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

The developers at Torn Banner wanted to create a game where you could feel like you were a character in an epic war movie such as The Last Samurai, Braveheart, 300, etc. They have done a very good job at meeting that goal and that is one of the reasons I keep coming back to this game. If you want to have an epic battle you can play team objective, or if you would like to fight someone with honour there is duel mode, or if you just want to get away from the main game there are many mods such as lightsabers, giant slayers, horde mode, and we cant forget the amazing expansion of deadliest warrior. Before I talk about the game mechanics and issues with the game i'd like to first say why I enjoyed it so much.\n\nWell lets start from the beggining. You buy the game (perhaps in an online sale?) and start it up. When you get to the main menu you have a free choice of joining a quick match with no idea what the game even looks like or by playing the tutorial (Which I highly recommend before playing online). During the tutorial you meet some pretty funny AI instructors who will introduce you to the basics of the game as well as a couple of cutscenes describing the story behind the game. Afterwards you may enlist online :). Now you are ready to join your first match. I know what you're thinking, "What if I join a game and I get destroyed by higher level players?". Well unlike some multiplayer games Chivalry has there own low level servers for new players, of course you are able to play in public servers with people of all levels (Level doesnt always doesnt determine skill either ;). When you first play you will definatley have a great time! You will fight other players thinking you are a noble knight on a mission from god while you cut your enemies down in front of everyones very eyes. However when you start to get familiar with the game and start to understand the etiquette and honour this is where the game changes in a good way.\n\nOnce you have fought in enough battles and collected the heads of all your enemies at this point you should understand the etiquette and moral code of the game. At this point in the game things become less serious and much more hilarious (as stated in the intro). I saw massive swords and axes being swung everywhere and heads flying, not that funny right? Well the thing that makes this game so great is the dialogue. Each class has there own unique dialogue ranging from tactical commands to clever insults and taunts (Thats a pretty big sword! You compensating for something? - Agathian Archer Insult). Everytime I play I come across players who will crush your skull with the massive maul and then start bursting out laughing or taking your arm off with a small dagger and apologizing using the dialogue (Walk it off - Mason Knight). These small things are what make the game much more enjoyable and fun to play.\n\nNow that i've told you a bit about the game i'd like to say somethig about the combat system (finally). The combat system in chivalry is by far the one of the most realistic and interesting of any game ever made. Now the swordplay is not the same as it is in real life and to be honest im glad it isn't. I have studied swordplay and fencing and if those same techniques were incorporated into this game it would be tremendously boring and unfair to new players. The damage is very realistic and the amount of damage taken is determined by your class and weapon. For example a heavy knight weildng a morningstar vs an archer weildng a small dagger, the knight would deliver much more damage and take very little. BUT Just because he has more armour and is more powerful does not mean he can win. This leads me to another great part of the game which is balance. Lets look at the knight and archer example/ The knight has more armour, bigger weapons, and looks cooler, so he should win right? well this is where balance comes in to play. The knight being stronger is much slower and the archer could simply dodge his attacks and land several attacks to gravely injure the knight or kill him as long as he doesnt get hit. After many updates and tweaks the combat system is legendary with so many different skills to use fights are unpredictable and never become boring. For new players they aspire to learn these skills to bring them into battle against there foes (under the trainign section in the main menu there are many useful videos highlighting all of the major skills that can be used which can be practiced in game).\n\nThe game is very fun (humour, sword-play/legendary combat system, fights are always fun, makes you feel like a bad a**) however the only negative thing is the chat box which can either have really kind players who will roleplay or help you out and make the game more fun or just people who get angry and inuslt eachother becase they are having a bad day and are getting killed a lot (but that is something that the players decide and is not the developers fault).\n\nThe final verdict for this game is great combat, fun multiplayer experience, great laughs, you can play with friends and fight together in epic battles and seiges, and a sometimes negative chat system (which in my opinion is very distracting to always keep reading and you dont have to pay attention to what other players say). I rate this game 8/10 for its amazing combat system and excellent multiplayer as well as its replayability. The game lacks a story and many rpg elements but the game was clearly intended as a multiplayer hack and slash. I reccomend this game to anyone looking for a good laugh and fun times with friends and other players.\n\n","September 6, 2015","true","981.2"," 22 of 39 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","22","39","0","0"

Huge disk space, high detailed graphics and great sounds etc. Now lets see what we have;\n\n+ Firts point is the type of game. Nowadays people are looking for medieval themed games. And if you are one of them, you can think about this game.\n\n+ Graphics and contents are enough to satisfy gamers\n\n+ Sounds are realy good. Unlike in warband, here you can feel your sword is touching to the enemy by its sound..\n\n+ A lot of servers, players, contents... etc.\n\n\n\nWhat about negative points;\n\n- You need realy high disc space\n\n- Graphics are not simplified, so you cannot play if you don't have really good computer\n\n-  Gameplay is not very well. After playing ''Warband'' i was expecting more professional combat system.\n\n* No direction for your hit, you hit from above and directly with your sword by some other buttons(mouse wheel). And by left mouse button u hit only one direction.\n*Blocking is also only one animated move, like u hit right mouse button and it is done. No direction.. Only thing is timing.. You can not hold and wait in blocking position.\n* Actually if we go deeply we can write pages. But what i mean is realy poor combat system. You cannot see your weapon's reach point like in warband. By ''see'' I mean cannot feel like in warband u can.\n\nActually after speeking much about ''Warband'' if we compare them, what makes ''Warband'' number one is NOT the high quality of graphics or huge contents, it is the uniqe GAME MECHANİCS like combat sysytem.. Looks like producers spent lots of money but without a perfect combat system it is not different than other thousands of games.\n\nFinally if you ask to me ''Would you buy this game?'', ''No, I wouldnt buy it. Because even if you like the game, it is not like some special games you can play for thousands of hours.''\n\nBest wishes..","November 20, 2014","false","34.9"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","1"

It is NOT a simulator. That being said, the mechanics are nothing short of impressive: the weight of the weapon in your hands, solid physics, and top notch sound effects—you really feel a jolt as the weight of your sword is blocked by an opponent's halberd, or the brutal (but oh so satisfying) crisp sound of you shearing off your opponent's head with a perfectly angled swing from your claymore, leaving his head tumbling down the stone steps in front of his slumped body. In a word: Epic.\n\nAnd also hilarious.\n\nThere's something oddly humorous about this entire game. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and the numerous over-the-top voice commands, including screaming battle cries, condescending laughter, and taunts that would make Monty Python proud, make in-game interaction a real treat.\n\nIf you've never played a melee FPS before, I would say CMW is comparable to Counter-Strike 1.6 in terms of pacing and "excitement level", but is far more brutal, visceral, and in-your-face. If you are in any way competitive (and let's face it, most FPS gamers are), get ready to be shouting at your monitor in the beginning. You may even rage quit a few times. But it won't be out of frustration from the game itself, but from getting bested by a player who is better than you—and you know it. On the flip side, you'll be yelling in glee when the opposite happens: your opponent overconfidently rushes in with an overhead swing with a sword that's too heavy for his puny little girly arms, and you—gritting your teeth, holding your breath, and sweating profusely—riposte your sword off of his incoming strike in a fraction of a second and plunge 3 feet of cold steel clear through his chest. Victory is sweet.\n\nChivalry has given me countless hours of enjoyment because it is highly skill based and easy to jump in and out of. If you're busy, you can hop into a public server for 15 minutes to goof around and blow off some steam, or you can spend the better part of an afternoon playing through all of the objective-based maps and dueling high level players, who might just teach you a thing or two.\n\nAnd finally, purely from a "consumer's point of view", you will get your money's worth from this game, especially if you buy it on sale. I only paid $15.00 for my copy, and Chivalry has given me over 800 hours of enjoyment. You'll notice that a lot of other reviewers here have similar playtimes or even longer. I even saw a negative review by a guy with over 1,000 hours (clearly written by someone who loves CMW so much that he "hates" it).\n\nSimply put, CMW is real bang (clang?) for your buck.\n\nOne word of advice for newbies: watch tutorials on YouTube before you start the game. CMW has real-time swings, a lot of depth, and you can be killed in one to three hits, making it very unforgiving. Search YouTube for "chivalry tutorial" and watch all of them. You'll be happy you did.[/b]\n","June 29, 2014","true","088.0"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

It's hilarious, and gives you many many hours of entertainment and what seems like a deep and intricate combat system. However, on the one hand, once you play it for a while, you realize how horribly, horribly buggy and easy it is to abuse the combat system. Once you discover how to slow down your attacks as a Vanguard, it's almost impossible for 70% of all players to defeat you.\n\nThe game has been out for over two years. It quickly got a lot of hype and attention from big YouTubers, but despite the massive cash-in the devs got they're evidently pretty ♥♥♥♥♥ at their job. The peasants are all identical, the kick animation is clunky and the kick mechanic itself is often downright broken. It's remarkable that Torn Banner got the combat system quite rightly addictive and still not polish their game. There are still places you can clip through, get stuck; maps can break and have had the same glitches since they were introduced. Third person is literally allowed, for some inexplicable reason, granting players objective advantage over others, making this the ultimate way to play - which is a glaring problem, to say the least, when the game is advertised as a FIRST PERSON slasher.\n\nAll this total nonsense leads me to believe that the devs really have no ♥♥♥♥ing idea what they're doing. Do they even play their own game, realizing the problems that exist? It's not even debatable that third person is the best way to play. It doesn't matter if you like it or not, if you play in third person and master it then you WILL be better than someone on that same level playing in first person.\n\nThe devs just got lucky with a solid combat formula. I'm sad to admit I've nearly spent 300 hours on the game and nearly every match there is a bug or a glitch or a balance problem that ruins it. It's been two years since the game got out of beta. I don't ♥♥♥♥ing understand how they can add more maps and fail to add unique voice commands to those maps, as was included in every vanilla map.\n\nWhat the hell kind of budget do these people operate with anyway. The instance there comes along a game that is the same but is actually focused on first person I will switch, and I will also uninstall this crap. I cringe seeing it on my games list.\n\n\nFor a slight bit of perspective on how broken this game is at its core, here is a video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4SzkQ2qbB4\n#slasherwhen","December 27, 2013","false","383.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gravespawn/recommended/219640/","Gravespawn","The Great Khorneholio","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gravespawn/","139 products in account","There is a list of reasons for my thumbs down below. All you need to know if you're looking to buy is this:\n\n-This game is not for casual players OR new players. If you did not own this game a year or two ago, don't buy it now. You will be destroyed. You will lose. You will be angry. Save yourself the frustration.-\n\n\n\n\nLet me start off by saying I have a great and many hours on this game. I started playing more than a year ago, when things were a lot more fun. As time went on, the enjoyment started to sink away. I beat a good part of the learning curve and began to shine more. I would have recommended this game, and did. I brought friends to play with. Sadly, in the end, key things broke my loyalty.\n\n1: Community. The community of this game will make you hate all of humanity. They're (not all, but many) childish and insulting. Totally unhelpful. You will run into "that guy" that kicks you over and over again on your own team to goad you into attacking him so he can votekick you for team damage.\n\n2: The patching. I'm not going to sit here and say something about the ballance between classes with the patches. No. It is that each time they patch the game, more of it seems to break. Be it your weapon unlocks, your rank, or the whole screen going black while you play- Torn Banner is all out of free passes in my book to get this process right.\n\n3: Hacking. There are two types of people that will tell you this doesn't happen. 1 is the guy that defends this game and thinks you're just a noob. 2 is the hacker. I knew hackers in this game, and to stop a votekick on themselves, they'd just say to the kicker "You mad bro? learn to play, don't votekick." and the players would vote no. They'd keep the hacker in the game by assuming the kicker was simply  mad about losing.\n\nNothing is more frustrating than knowing the hacker personally and watching them game the system that easy because the community is so poor.\n\nAgain, there was a time I would have been all in for this game. I'd have defended all it's flaws. But as of late, after Deadliest Warrior (which is also not very good), I would tell you only to buy this game  if all of the above won't bother you.","May 19, 2013","false","897.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There are only 4 classes to play and a wide variety of weapons to choose from. The physics in this game are amazing which also takes battling into account for. Trust me, when you get hit, you will feel it. And one on one battles do feel personal on the battlefield. My only gripes with this game is when you die in team matches, you only get 1 life until everybody on eihter team dies. This is the only way to respawn, otherwise you will be in specteter mode. There is also a few bugs here and there but nothing that will effect gameplay. With dedicated servers and enough people to play I recommend this game.

It's a bit clunky and a bit outdated, but both of those things actually add to the game, in my opinion, because they make it impossible to take too seriously. That is, of course, the great flaw in the FPS world: the taking of things too seriously. How many otherwise solid games does The Serious ruin? More than I could count. There ain't none of that going on round these parts.\n\nThere's stuff to unlock, and customization options, and several game types, although you'll probably want to spend most of your time in the Team Objective mode, because that's a hell of lot more fun than overplayed junk game modes like team deathmatch. There's a key for yelling. That's my favorite key. You can yell a lot of stuff, and almost all of it sounds like it was recorded from drunk SCA members. There's a lot of very silly gore: remember the fight with the Black Knight in Monty Python and the Holy Grail? This game is like a 7gb homage to that battle.\n\nAnother thing I heartily approve of is the support this game is getting from its devs. Twenty-eight major updates, and countless smaller ones, in less than two years. I'm sure it desperately needed twenty-seven of those. But it got them! Kudos to these goofy people for providing their goofy game with a classy, old school level of post-release love.\n\nAgain, just to be clear, do NOT, under any circumstances, pay full retail for this game. $12. Or less. For both the game and the expansion. (The expansion is terrible, and no one seems to play it, but that doesn't matter, because, as every gamer knows, COMPLETIONISM IS ITS OWN REWARD.)","August 3, 2014","true","96.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Chivalry is difficult to learn and difficult to master but they key to success is patience, peristence and not trying to tank 3 dudes by yourself.\n\n~ It's hard for new players to get into without being interested with the medieval setting or you aren't the most paitient person when it comes to online games, and the low level servers only teach you bad habits that work against you in the long run.\n\n~ Community is simultaneously the best and worst, new players will be shown no mercy for team damage and people will criticise how you play mercilessly. But at the same time there are some of the wittiest and hilarious bunch out there. The playerbase is old and low level servers are usually barren outside sales and learning to play against 1000 hour veterans can be a huge test of ones fortitude...\n\n~ The only microtransactions/dlc in the game are purely aesthetic such as weapons skins and character skins, weapons are unlocked purely based on amount of kills done with specific weapons.\n\n~ The weapons that you can unlock aren't inherently better than the starting selection although there are some weapons that are virtually useless for competitive play and others which are abused to the utmost for easy kills.\n\n~ Not in any way representive of actual medieval combat...

If you pick this up on sale you most likely wont regret it. I certainly got my money's worth out of it. Be warned though, the game is escpecially difficult to newcomers. This game requires actual skill and knowledge of game mechanics. You will mostly play this for fun at higher levels and not for ranking up. Ranks don't really mean anything in Chivalry, it really is just skill that matters. For instance a level 25 (low) can have the same weapons as a level 50 (high) and still win in a fight. So being high ranked does't inherently make you overpowered, instead its skill, luck, and lag that wins fights.\n\nIf you do pick this up, you will be hopelessly crushed by higher levels at first, but keep trying and you will learn and get better. While I give this game a thumbs up, you start to see the many flaws this game has when you play for as long as I did, and it may discourage you as it has me to stop playing altogether, but you will probably feel the urge to return to it in the future.

Thankfully those hankering for some heavily armoured king slaying now have a superb game that is just what the Knights Templar ordered.Chivalry: Medieval Warfare is a multiplayer-only, first/third-person, hack-and-slasher that grabs most full priced games by the throat, tells them they’re unfit to polish Chivalry’s armour, before running them through with three feet of tempered steel.Built on the Unreal engine, each of the huge levels makes the areas in most other online shooters look like lifeless miniature movie sets. These vast medieval playgrounds are filled with huge castles, wooded forests, and moonlit cliffs. They’re not mere static backdrops for the carnage within, as each area is brimming with life; catapults flinging boulders at crumbling defences; ships circling in the bay under incoming ballista fire; the crowd cheering on in the arena.Full limb dismemberment and decapitation reward particularly effective strikes, and your weapons and armour will be covered in blood by the end of a match. Both first and third-person options are available depending on your preference.Matching the visual brutality are some of the most gut-wrenching sound effects heard in gaming.It looks and sounds great, but how does Chivalry play? This is a game all about melee weapons, so how the hell do you translate that to mouse and keyboard control? Pretty damn well, apparently.Longbows and crossbows control just like a normal shooter, except they take a little while to ready up. Swords, maces and axes require an entirely different set of buttons. Right mouse button is used to block, left mouse is used as a standard horizontal slashing attack, mouse wheel down is a thrusting jab, while mouse wheel up is a powerful overhead blow.Sounds simple, right? It’s anything but. This game is frickin’ hard.Mastering the basics of combat is made even trickier by the four different classes, which all have different strengths.I really enjoyed my time with Chivalry: Medieval Warfare. It was a difficult game to begin with, but after some practice and finding a good team to play with, I couldn’t help but have a good time.","December 31, 2013","true","21.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gravespawn/recommended/219640/","Gravespawn","The Great Khorneholio","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gravespawn/","139 products in account","There is a list of reasons for my thumbs down below. All you need to know if you're looking to buy is this:\n\n-This game is not for casual players OR new players. If you did not own this game a year or two ago, don't buy it now. You will be destroyed. You will lose. You will be angry. Save yourself the frustration.-\n\n\n\n\nLet me start off by saying I have a great and many hours on this game. I started playing more than a year ago, when things were a lot more fun. As time went on, the enjoyment started to sink away. I beat a good part of the learning curve and began to shine more. I would have recommended this game, and did. I brought friends to play with. Sadly, in the end, key things broke my loyalty.\n\n1: Community. The community of this game will make you hate all of humanity. They're (not all, but many) childish and insulting. Totally unhelpful. You will run into "that guy" that kicks you over and over again on your own team to goad you into attacking him so he can votekick you for team damage.\n\n2: The patching. I'm not going to sit here and say something about the ballance between classes with the patches. No. It is that each time they patch the game, more of it seems to break. Be it your weapon unlocks, your rank, or the whole screen going black while you play- Torn Banner is all out of free passes in my book to get this process right.\n\n3: Hacking. There are two types of people that will tell you this doesn't happen. 1 is the guy that defends this game and thinks you're just a noob. 2 is the hacker. I knew hackers in this game, and to stop a votekick on themselves, they'd just say to the kicker "You mad bro? learn to play, don't votekick." and the players would vote no. They'd keep the hacker in the game by assuming the kicker was simply  mad about losing.\n\nNothing is more frustrating than knowing the hacker personally and watching them game the system that easy because the community is so poor.\n\nAgain, there was a time I would have been all in for this game. I'd have defended all it's flaws. But as of late, after Deadliest Warrior (which is also not very good), I would tell you only to buy this game  if all of the above won't bother you.","May 19, 2013","false","897.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Thankfully those hankering for some heavily armoured king slaying now have a superb game that is just what the Knights Templar ordered.Chivalry: Medieval Warfare is a multiplayer-only, first/third-person, hack-and-slasher that grabs most full priced games by the throat, tells them they’re unfit to polish Chivalry’s armour, before running them through with three feet of tempered steel.Built on the Unreal engine, each of the huge levels makes the areas in most other online shooters look like lifeless miniature movie sets. These vast medieval playgrounds are filled with huge castles, wooded forests, and moonlit cliffs. They’re not mere static backdrops for the carnage within, as each area is brimming with life; catapults flinging boulders at crumbling defences; ships circling in the bay under incoming ballista fire; the crowd cheering on in the arena.Full limb dismemberment and decapitation reward particularly effective strikes, and your weapons and armour will be covered in blood by the end of a match. Both first and third-person options are available depending on your preference.Matching the visual brutality are some of the most gut-wrenching sound effects heard in gaming.It looks and sounds great, but how does Chivalry play? This is a game all about melee weapons, so how the hell do you translate that to mouse and keyboard control? Pretty damn well, apparently.Longbows and crossbows control just like a normal shooter, except they take a little while to ready up. Swords, maces and axes require an entirely different set of buttons. Right mouse button is used to block, left mouse is used as a standard horizontal slashing attack, mouse wheel down is a thrusting jab, while mouse wheel up is a powerful overhead blow.Sounds simple, right? It’s anything but. This game is frickin’ hard.Mastering the basics of combat is made even trickier by the four different classes, which all have different strengths.I really enjoyed my time with Chivalry: Medieval Warfare. It was a difficult game to begin with, but after some practice and finding a good team to play with, I couldn’t help but have a good time.","December 31, 2013","true","21.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Trust me, when you get hit, you will feel it. And one on one battles do feel personal on the battlefield. My only gripes with this game is when you die in team matches, you only get 1 life until everybody on eihter team dies. This is the only way to respawn, otherwise you will be in specteter mode. There is also a few bugs here and there but nothing that will effect gameplay. With dedicated servers and enough people to play I recommend this game.

Chivalry is difficult to learn and difficult to master but they key to success is patience, peristence and not trying to tank 3 dudes by yourself.\n\n~ It's hard for new players to get into without being interested with the medieval setting or you aren't the most paitient person when it comes to online games, and the low level servers only teach you bad habits that work against you in the long run.\n\n~ Community is simultaneously the best and worst, new players will be shown no mercy for team damage and people will criticise how you play mercilessly. But at the same time there are some of the wittiest and hilarious bunch out there. The playerbase is old and low level servers are usually barren outside sales and learning to play against 1000 hour veterans can be a huge test of ones fortitude...\n\n~ The only microtransactions/dlc in the game are purely aesthetic such as weapons skins and character skins, weapons are unlocked purely based on amount of kills done with specific weapons.\n\n~ The weapons that you can unlock aren't inherently better than the starting selection although there are some weapons that are virtually useless for competitive play and others which are abused to the utmost for easy kills.\n\n~ Not in any way representive of actual medieval combat...

The combat is fast, visceral and deep. Much deeper than many people realize, and glance over it saying it pales in comparison to M&B or WotR. Combining the 3 basic slashes, combos, a directional parry, kicks, ducks and jumps, feints, footwork and coordination give even the most dedicated melee enthusiasts such a various move set at their disposal. Finding a weapon and class combination, whether you want to be a tower shield wielding Defender or an offensive, jumpy Man at Arms give loads of experimentation. The game modes range from simple Team Deathmatch and King of the Hill to a multi-tiered Team Objective mode taking place in beautiful maps, where teams will raid villages, push siege weapons, sink enemy ships, and (in my personal favorite segment) the player on the top of the leaderboard will become the King, and their team must defend him with their lives while the enemy charge in waves through the throne room. The immersion in the game is top notch, as your army lets the enemy hear their battlecries as they charge, blades clash together, you hear screaming from the distance, siege weapons wreck the battlefield and you truly feel the scope of your actions. I can recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun medieval game that, in my humble opinion, has the best melee system in any game to date.","November 23, 2014","true","12.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The fighting is exremely varied, as different players have different combat types, leading to a kind of rock paper scissors effect, which encourages you to work more on your reaction time and how you fight, so there is a large learning curve which I very much do like. I've been playing a lot of the DLC, Deadliest Warrior, which I now enjoy more than the original. And, on high graphics, this is one of the most beautiful games I've ever seen played before.

You will be unable to block, whilst everyone will always block you.\n2) Countless crashes, for some reason Medieval Warfare crashes whilst it's expansion does not. This is just poor development.\n3) After buying the game, you will basically have to pay more money to get new gear.\n4) Combat becomes a complete mess and a block-fest after a while in game.\n5) After a hour of gameplay, I felt completely bored of the game.\n6) A game that allows for tactical gameplay, does not have any tools or anything to help a team improve their tactical ability.\n7) The game does not feel fun, it becomes a total grind\n\nThe Ups:\n\n1) Graphics and gore is a huge plus, has great immersion to the game.\n\nConclusion:\n\nCurrently the game is on special for 6 dollars, I fear to buy it even if it's 75% off.\n","May 18, 2014","false","2.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The gameplay is beutiful, fast paced and brutal completely dependant on skill rather than buying better weapons. The classes are well balanced, archer seems a bit slow when notching his bow but this gives it a sense of realism. The maps for the most part are epic. Dont waste time on arena matches, team objectives are where the actions at. Amazingly fun sieges with battering rams, catapults and balista make the team objective maps some of the best in the game. However, the best moment by far is when you assault the enemy keep and assasinate their king.\n\nThe game does have some glaring bugs, however these can be ignored for the most part.\nThe worst of these being weapon kills not counting, making it impossible to get new weapons, the kills will count occasionaly it will just take longer to level up.\nThere are also issues with hits not counting, blocking not working, however i have not experienced these yet in the several matches ive played. Might be caused by lag or slow internet.\nNot really a bug but im going to put it here anyway: Teamkills, if your with a good group of players this shouldnt bother you to much, occasionaly getting hit by a friendly vangaurd whose spamming lmb. However if your not with a good group of players you will get the occasional (censored) on your team, who thinks it is funny to sneak up behind you while your fighting and stab you. Fortunately there is a nice ban system to get rid of these trolls.\n\nOveralll this game is well worth the 8.50$ i spent on it after using a coupon. I would really like to see a healer or mage class though this probably wont be implemented, seeing as this game is medeival, not fantasy medeival.\n\nTo the king!\n\nEdit: This is a review for the deadliest warrior expansion.\n\nSo far the game runs slower than chivalry, I had to turn all the graphics down.\nThe new classes are very fun to play, especialy samurai and pirate.\nThe maps are not anything exemplary. Most are too big for the amount of players and they are all arena style, no objective maps yet. I spend a lot of time looking for people to fight instead of fighting.\nThe new charachter progression system is nice, leveling up the charachters you play as rather than one profile as a whole.\nThe vanity system is also a nice feature to help stand out on the battlefield, and its free...currently.\nOverall well worth the 5$ i payed during sale. The game could really use some better maps though. I would really like to see the normal chivalry maps ported over.","March 24, 2014","true","434.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The flaws didn't matter, they were bound to be fixed I assumed, as it was still early days. A year later and I still can't use apostrophes in chat, nor can the rest of Europe (regional keyboards/none US) - such a basic thing, but the developers don't give a crap, and this is the fundemental flaw with these guys. One thing you can't say one of their qualities are and that's paying attention to details. Every aspect of the game has been like that, from server settings to typos, there's a long list.\n\nThe major things like the hit detection is still crap. Swords that one shot kill MAA's on the head never seems to register as a headshot, so the whole slowness of the weapon is unbalanced. MAA's run into you swinging wildly, dragging and accelerating hoping to lag the swing so it misdirects and avoids the parry. The game seems to prefer heavily on the aggressive player so the entire combat is basically everyone from newbies to pros spamming attacks and not actually putting out quality to their engagements or valuing their lives, and it's not the players fault, it's the design and concept of the game.","February 14, 2014","false","752.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

Well, that's because I lost all respect and faith in Torn Banner after they destroyed what I came to love. When I first started, the game was very fun albeit raw and clanky... but still fun! The community has always been toxic (and I've been guilty of this as well), but everyone overlooked this because the game was great for years!\n\nThis game was the reason I logged on to Steam every day. It kept me entertained, and it drove my competitive spirit. I have made so many friends from Chivalry, that I can't even count. I have gone through so many experiences that I hope to never forget...\n\nI quit last year. I tried playing again from time to time, but it didn't work out.\n\nTorn Banner tore the game apart (no pun intended). They started with something beautiful and destroyed it. Their inner greed knows no bounds! Patch after patch, yet the game never improved. It was like a bandaid over a bandaid, repeated over and over again. What do we have after 4 years? Something I can't even recognize.\n\nControls feel like I'm in water. Movement is completely different now. Forget about the exploits that were never fixed but instead got worse. Devs have no respect for the player base. They see us as a cash cow. Some devs even insult and disrespect certain classes. How can I have faith in Torn Banner when they ridicule us?\n\nI feel sad writing this, but I will never play again.\n\nIs it worth 5 bucks? Yes. Is it worth your time though?

I'll explain why.\n\nTHE GOOD\n========\n\n1.) Level design is great if not including bugs. Workshop maps are cool as well.\n\n2.) Character design is cool because there are a lot of options of color choice, pattern, and emblems.\n\n3.) Sound track is great in my opinion.\n\n4.) Come hither! Other voice actions etc.\n\nTHE BAD\n=======\n\n1.) Weapon selection is dynamic and interesting. However, the code is terrible. You can just unlock all weapons in notepad. Psh... Or weapons would relock so you had to go into notepad. That's how I figured it out.\n\n2.) Community went to trash quick. I'm in a FFA server and they say getting cheap kills is what makes it fun and that I'm complaining... Then I join a duel server like they said, and the guy I was against rage quits... wtf... Really people? Also, in team objective people are so desperate for kills that team killing happens in every damn game due to people lunging into a cluster ♥♥♥♥ to get a kill which also leads to gang bangs which are a huge issue in the game. Talk about pathetic...\n\n3.) You're apparently a filthy casual if you don't have some foreskin helmet. Someone literally said to me, "Casual... Only a sire has the pink helmet your near 90 hours isn't anything"... Really? I have to have a ♥♥♥♥♥ tip helmet to be considered opinion worthy? ♥♥♥♥ off dweeb...\n\n4.) The combat is absolute ♥♥♥♥ if you take advantage of the loop hole mechanics. This is medieval warfare not helicopters. The thing is, the devs actually ENCOURAGE this ♥♥♥♥... That's right, ENCOURAGE it!!! Be sure to get the latest weapon skin for your helicopter blades, people!

Everyone is learning the ropes (except for smurfs, of course, but I personally didn't meet many) and the battles are therefore a fun and often amusing experience. Apologies for teamkills were often accepted as pretty much everyone was committing them, and there was a mostly friendly atmosphere.\nHowever, once you are kicked out of the "noob servers", the fun ends there.\nAs this is a rather niche game, servers seem mostly populated by veteran players who have no patience for still unskilled and relatively new players, and have no problem in using their high-tier and sometimes unfair tactics against them.\nFFA is a joke. Since the game is called Chivalry, I thought I would honour other people's duels and wait for fights to end before attacking myself, hoping others would do the same. Instead, high-level players will ignore eachother in order to constantly chase down the new players to earn free kills and top the scoreboard.\nIn the end, unless you don't mind fighting bots who are often more fun than the majority of players, don't bother with this initially promising game.","January 23","false","40.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","3"

Well, that's because I lost all respect and faith in Torn Banner after they destroyed what I came to love. When I first started, the game was very fun albeit raw and clanky... but still fun! The community has always been toxic (and I've been guilty of this as well), but everyone overlooked this because the game was great for years!\n\nThis game was the reason I logged on to Steam every day. It kept me entertained, and it drove my competitive spirit. I have made so many friends from Chivalry, that I can't even count. I have gone through so many experiences that I hope to never forget...\n\nI quit last year. I tried playing again from time to time, but it didn't work out.\n\nTorn Banner tore the game apart (no pun intended). They started with something beautiful and destroyed it. Their inner greed knows no bounds! Patch after patch, yet the game never improved. It was like a bandaid over a bandaid, repeated over and over again. What do we have after 4 years? Something I can't even recognize.\n\nControls feel like I'm in water. Movement is completely different now. Forget about the exploits that were never fixed but instead got worse. Devs have no respect for the player base. They see us as a cash cow. Some devs even insult and disrespect certain classes. How can I have faith in Torn Banner when they ridicule us?\n\nI feel sad writing this, but I will never play again.\n\nIs it worth 5 bucks? Yes. Is it worth your time though?

I actually clocked about 1337 hours in free for all trying to get the final achievement in which actual sword fighting was entirely avoided. Once I joined a team objective map I did well against the lesser roleplayers but got completely destroyed by the lmb gambling vanguards.\n\nActually this review is utter rubbish and does not represent Chivalry at all but a warped\nvery high fov of which the player demonstrates his lack of respect for the game\nand other players, a common theme in all  of his crass reviews.\n\nJust kidding game is good and most of its flaws are actually really charming in a strange way. The skill cap is extremely high though and even after a 1000 hours you are just starting to learn the real mind games that go on during every encounter. There are sadly though still a lot of exploits and glitches in the game and most of these will likely not be fixed anymore. But if you know what is going on and stick with it the game opens up and you can really enjoy its beauty.\nAnd if you get destroyed there is always the quality voice comms which you can enjoy yourself with forever.\n\nThanks for reading (part of) this review,\n\nCome hither boys and gals its not that bad","March 23","true","616.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","6","9","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/219640/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","There are quite many shooters out there - shooters that resemble Counter-Strike. They are fast-paced, easy-to-learn but hard-to-master, full of achievements and various challenges and the ability to create your own levels or certain mods can only increase their almost neverending shelf life.\n\nNow, if - by any chance - you feel a tiny bit bored and tell yourself "hey, let's look for something else" then Chivalry is a game for you. Fast-paced? Yes. Has tons of achievements? Yes. You can look for custom-made levels and server only offering modded stages? Yes. Is it challenging? Yes: while you can quickly pick up the pace mastering a class or one of its weapons takes time.\n\nWhile many characteristics are similar to other games Chivalry requires you to use melee combat. Well, 3 classes out of 4 are knights or knight-like soldiers and the 4th one is the archer (I guess he is Chivalry's very own sniper!). These guys differ from each other in strength and speed. For instance, a knight is massive in size, is full of armor and due to its strength only he can wield a warhammer. Now, a Man-At-Arms may be smaller, but he is a tough fellow to fight as he can dodge your attacks and while he certainly takes his time to off a knight he uses his spear faster and with longer reach.\n\nAs you make progress and collect experience points more and more weapons are unlocked. Too bad some require to be bought and the same goes for some of the customisation options which are pretty much useless (i.e. they do not have a game changing role, they really are just cosmetics).\n\nBut then again the loadout has its variations: you can pick secondary and tertiary weapons if you will. A knight can have throwable, smaller axes with him or can be aided by a shield. Different loadouts offer different tactics. You may find a completely different set which makes you realise that, again, you need to devote time to master the very same class!\n\nBut this is not a problem as Chivalry is a lot of fun! Heads roll, limbs fly away - all realistically thanks to the Unreal engine which is also an indication of the decent graphics you have for this game. The epic medieval battle score accompanying the action can only make you stay longer.\n\nSome of the game modes are easy to recognise: the good old free-for-all or deathmatch or capture-the-flag. But then we have duels so that friends can test how good their skills are and we also have objective-based missions. These always require one faction to complete various tasks while attacking the enemy: kill the peasants in the nearby village, burn the granary and the wheat fields, move a bomb cart to the castle front door and in the end you just might be asked to behead the king once and for all.\n\nAs for the community? The same old story exists here as does elsewhere: votekicks are regularly initiated. At first, you think you've been kicked out for no apparent reason. But then you realise Chivalry does have friendly fire - be careful when you swing your recently earned Messer sword as it can cost your teammates' lives! On the upside, though: with great team comes great cooperation and nothing feels better when you set an enemy on fire with your oil pot while your teammate decapitates the running / burning / howling / soon-to-be-enraged gamer.\n\nChivalry enjoys a regular discount of 90% which means it will only cost you 1.5 euros. It is a really good price for a game with this many levels and game modes. It is an almost 3-year old game - yet, it delivers. With dedication, patience and time you can get the necessary finesse to become a Chivalry knight!","June 25, 2015","true","42.8"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","10","17","2","0"

This game is epic and just a server with 25 people can go into a crazy battle. This game has many game modes to keep you interested, the graphics are stunning and everything from the design to the weapons look realistic. To play you would need to take out your old mouses as this game uses the scroll to actually attack instead of the classic weapon switch. The game does have a couple of bugs and OP and TK issues but they are very small. This game is amazing and i've only been in 1 64 player battle and trust me when you in one of those its the craziest gaming experince you will ever have.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TacticalKillers/recommended/219640/","TacticalKillers","Calculated.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TacticalKillers/","64 products in account","I will try to make this review short and sweet while still giving it a good review.\n\nHonestly I don't get how this game get's the amount of hate that it does. Of course reviews on games vary but I love this game. I've had the game for just over a week and I've already put in 13.5 hours.\n\nWhen playing this game there are several things to consider.\n\nFIrst, when you start this game you WILL NOT be good at it. This isn't your typical game where you start it up and you get the hang of things within 10 minutes of playing because quite frankly it isn't that simple. The tutorial does a great job of giving you the basics and learning all the controls and how to use them but when to use certain attacks is the part you need to wrap your head around.\n\nChances are when you start this game you will be a tker (Team Killer) even if you don't intend to. The biggest complaint EVERYONE has including myself when playing this game is that people will run into group battles and keep left clicking or slashing and hitting every teamate with every swing killing enemies and teammates. It's usually the newer players that do this and it does get annoying at times. The easiest way to avoid it is using the mouse wheel for attacks. If you get this game you'll about these things fairly quickly.\n\nThe community on the game is surprisingly for the most part really good as well. Even if you team kill by mistake or what have you, you don't have those people yelling and screaming at you, everyone is pretty forgiving. The other amazing part is that even though there is friendly fire always on, you don't really have people running around cutting down there teammates and if there is a guy doing that he's kicked within 10 seconds of doing it.\n\nThe game is very noob friendly as well. There are servers that allow only rank 0-15 to be in them. This helps the new comers play with people that are less experienced. Keep in mind that once you get to about Rank 5 you have a decent grip on the game. With that said Rank 10-15's will be pretty good.\n\nIn my time played I've already reached rank 11 that's in 13 hours so it does take some time. I got the hang of the game fairly quickly but I am a fairly quick learner, so some people may find it a bit harder.\n\nMY NUMBER ONE COMPLAINT FOR THIS GAME\nThey want your money WAYYY TOOOOO MUCH.\nJust like most games there are some sort of in game purchases in this game. The purchases in this game are all contents made by players of the game like custom armours, weapons, etc. These custom looks for your weapons all have a high price. When things go 50% off like they are right now it still costs like $3 for a sword. Yes you read that right "A SWORD" A SINGLE SWORD IS LIKE $3 WTF?\n\nThat is really my only complaint with this game besides that I love it and I think anyone who likes fast paced games where you can slash, decapitate, and throw javelins through peoples heads, NEEDS to try this game.","June 12, 2015","true","27.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I created my class and prepared to duel my enemy codenamed "xxFazeklanx". He chose the knight class and I chose the archer. As I drew my bow I shot arrows at the man, but I missed and he ran up and squished my head with a flair like hitting a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with a frying pan. After that I looked in the chat and saw "lol noob go back to mario.". After expirencing this I suffered severe depression and started cutting my self to feel better. People in school saw these cuts and bullied me for it driving me into a deeper depression. It got so bad at one point that I tried to kill my self by taking pills. After I passed out my mother found me on the ground and drove me to the hospital. On the way there we were in a car crash where she died. The paramedics arrived and saved my life before I OD'd.

Whether you pay full price or pick up this title on a 90% sale, I can guarantee you will be more than satisfied with getting far more than your money's worth. The only way a person could really dislike this game is if they don't give it enough of a chance (this is one of those games that's very easy to give up on at first), or if it's simply just not the type of game that's suitable for that person. [READ ON FOR MORE DETAILS]\n\nINFORMATION ON CLASSES:\nChivalry: Medieval Warfare has 4, well-balanced classes that allow for a wide variety of playstyles per person. There are 2 heavily armored classes, the Knight and the Vanguard, and there are 2 light armor classes, the Man-At-Arms and the Archer.\n\nThe Knight class is the most heavily armored class (which means most HP) with a variety of deadly, high damage hammers, axes, swords, and flails (ball and chain) of both the one and two-handed variety, at his disposal.\n\nThe Vanguard, noticably less armored than the knight, specializes in polearms, with all of his weapons being very lengthy and high-damage. Swords, bardiche, halberd, billhook, variety of thrusting spears, polehammer; with these weapons, the vanguard class allows you to stay out of reach of your opponents attacks whilst you seemlessly decapitate them, whereas the Knight class's weapons force you to get up close and personal. The Vanguard is the only class that can not equip a shield.\n\nThe Man-At-Arms; master of evasion, equipped with the unique dodge ability that, if timed well, can evade an enemy's attack with ease, while at the same time, opens an oppurtunity for a counter attack. The Man-At-Arms is equipped a variety of one-handed swords, axes and hammers (the same weapons as the Knight's secondaries), as well as a two-handed quarterstaff. The MAA's lack of HP is made up for by his speed and agility that, if utilized properly, can overwhelm any class.\n\nAnd finally the Archer... those pesky archers... with a weapon choice between bows, crossbows, and throwing spears/javelins of varying speeds and damage, the archer can range and pick off their opponents, especially those who are wounded or distracted. On the flip side of their ranging abilities, the archer is at a disadvantage in melee combat due to its very low-damage melee weapons and miniscule HP.\n\nGAME MODE INFO:\nChivalry offers a variety of official game modes including but not limited to; Team Objective (within this game mode there is a wide variety of objectives that vary between defense and offense, Ex: Tainting the enemy's water supply by dumping a cart-load of corpses into it.), Team Deathmatch, Last Team Standing, and Free-For-All. There are also dueling servers available for sharpening up on your skills. In team-based game modes, you have the option of siding with the Agatha Knights (blue, gold,white), or the Mason Order (Red & Black). The Mason Order, once part of Agatha, are a rebelling force fighting for freedom of Agatha's rule and fighting for power.\n\nI've been playing this game for over a year, and in doing so, I've finally become one amongst the "high-ranks". The challenge and difficulty of this game are what makes it so satisfying and rewarding. You can not allow yourself to be discouraged when first starting out; learning this game can be hell. Be sure to make use of the low rank servers when starting out.\n\n-Shroom","November 29, 2015","true","440.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

(anywhere from 3 to 8 seconds)  Not today good sir, as you charge foward all over again, surrounded by your comrades, through the arrows to greet the shield wall of knights blocking the gate. Not today good sir as an arrow with your name on it takes out your comrade who unfortunetly stepped infront of you at just the right second. Not today good sir as you see the gap in the wall of knights open after repeated attacks against their defense..you charge through, giving one look back to see boiling oil being poured ontop of everyone friend and foe as you whisper not today....Up the wall you go, where is that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that keeps killing me in the name of the Iron Glove?.... Looking through the carnage of men decapitate one another while laughing. Deep screams and howls FOR AGITHTAAAAAA fill the air. Thats when you see him. The archer you have been after. Hes still on the wall with his fellow archers raining death down onto the field below.  Theres several knights in between you and them. They are already moving toward you. The archers continue to fire from relative safety. Thats when several of your other comrades go charging past you and engage the knights. They are now in battle, buying you precious time as you move past them. Not today good Sir, as you hold down C key causing you to scream at the top of your lungs "FOR THE ORDER!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! as you run at full sprint with your two handed broad sword toward the archers. Arrows wiz past your face as you  think to yourself *Not today* swinging a heavy attack, taking your opponents head clean off, and the arm of his buddy. Blood sprays everywhere as the guy with no arm screams and flails for a moment. the remaining archers have begun to fall back to the keep, as more of your men make it through the gate and onto the castle walls, Not today Good sir..this is CHIVALRY, ...iF you liked that story, youll love this game\n\nI think this game is like 20 bucks... if you havent played this and love sword fighting games, you cannot go wrong here. Its brutal, gritty, raw, halarious, epic, amazing, all at once. The main game mode is called team objective, anywhere from 20 to 64 players fight in and around castles, villages, and other areas like a battlefield game. Swinging swords and hollering as you run around. But there will be an objective. Defend the wall or kill the royal family. Murder all the villagers in the town (they are bots) And so one team is usually attacking something while the other team defends it, This is what makes the game good because it drags all the players to the same area so you have actual battles. not you and 1 guy fighting another guy. You wont be sneaking around with your bow like you would a sniper rifle in call of duty. You are constantly surrounded by your team. There isnt a lone wolf. ..With the way this game is set up, i dont even know if lone wolfing is possible. Your teammates take damage from you. You can be voted out of games for too much of it. It makes the battles better in my opinion because if you couldnt hurt each other everyone would be swinging wildly 24/7 as if its dynasty warriors in mosou mode lol. By being able to accident chop your bddies head off you are much more calculated with your swings making really fun engagements that can last for more then a quarter of a second...\n","March 25, 2015","true","129.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The gameplay mechanics seemed pretty fair and balanced and the player base was extremely friendly.\n\nThen it got discounted in the summer, winter and fall sales.\n\nAnd because of the rapid growth of the player base, you are now faced with a ridiculous amount of trolls and speed hackers for which there arent any consequences.\n\nIts also just lovely that the thousands of new players who bought the game in the sales didnt spend more than a day playing and practicing the game and its mechanics before running to tornbanner to ♥♥♥♥♥ about them.\n\nAnd since TB are some of the stupidest developers i have ever seen, they unbalance the game more and more every update purely because of the whining from new players who are too lazy to even try and learn the game.\n\nIts also pretty obvious how green-collared the devs are. The game has ridiculous UI and mechanical problems that have not been solved since release but apparently TB is more concerned about signing onto a contract with ♥♥♥♥ing spike TV tto create a terrible DLC for a BETA that has worse problems than the game its self.\n\nI think that if the game had been dreamed up by TB then placed in the hands and care of a responsible development team, it would be better in every way.\n\nWhen the game first came out i would have given this game an 8/10 at LEAST, but since Torn Banner has absolutely NO IDEA what the ♥♥♥♥ theyre doing and have decided to ruin their game like a 5 year old pouring red paint onto a priceless Metis painting to "make it better", i would never reccomend this game as is no longer has a monetary value in my eyes.\n\n2/10","March 5, 2014","false","472.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

First, alot of people are stating online that this game does not have a large amount of cheaters or hackers which is a huge lie. Hacking is very present in this game with people claiming maxed sensitivity and some fancy setting which still negates the speed of such weapon. Even if you catch such people commiting these actions there are numerous others that ruin the experiance of a game. Second, friendly fire is very present in the game.....be it does put a sense of realism in the game it also breeds a form of elitist mentality in a large sum of the player base toward the newer players in whch you are eithier be trolled out of game or more often kicked and unable to rejoin toward the more populated servers where the game was in one prospective interesting. Lastly, the progression systems for unlocking weapons is based solely on aggregated kills and not on kills that was helped as in other games. Many times while you are in combat a veteran players or at times a newer player will come in while in 1V1 combat take or steal ones kill and make you progression most tedious especially toward weaker weapons that do not kill in one or 2 hits similar that plaques the lighter classes. There are things in game that has some moments but these few times of brightness gets mostly overcasted by constant hacking, lag issues and lack of overall progression in which random interjections in combat by other players ruin the experiance.","June 7, 2015","false","89.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

But it was kinda good once.\n\n48~ of my 56 some odd hours in this game were spent in 2012 when this game first hit Steam. It was fun back then; not great, but still entertaining. But most importantly, there was a huge opportunity for improvements in the coming years, which I was very keen to see (and still have yet to).\n\nThe most recent 8~ hours I've played have been far below the expecations I had for progress made in 3 whole years of development; really, if anything, the current state of the game is a straight retrograde from the 2012 iteration. Hit detection issues have against all odds gotten worse, almost all the combat exploits are still here, the community has gotten far worse, and it seems like very little new content exists now that didn't exist 3 years ago. I mean, I guess the new menus and hats are nice, oh and you can change your armor color to confuse people by obscuring what was previously a clean "red vs blue" combat environment, but...\n\nThe array of weaponry, for example, seems identical. Sure, you have a bunch of reskins for real $$, but they're functionally identical to weapons which already existed 3 years ago. I can understand why adding more weapons just for the sake of more weapons is a recipe for disaster balance-wise, but really guys? Three whole trips around the sun and nothing?\n\nThe minority community of insular elitists has somehow blossomed since 2012, and what's worse is that it seems the developers only cater to this demographic when updating the game. This is why flat-out exploits like mouse dragging or bunny-hopping during sword fights still exist: long-time players have been using these as a crutch for so long that making the game work without them hasn't even been considered.\n\nAdditionally, the populated servers all seem to suffer from high degrees of what I call "Garry's Mod-itis", where server admins go on power trips and break their own server rules pretty much constantly. A catastrophic lack of maturity is a recurring theme.\n\nThe most positive thing I can say about this game is that the tutorial is really well designed, probably one of the more content-rich tutorials I've encountered. It's too bad that the majority of the stuff you learn in it can be safely thrown out the window once you actually start playing multiplayer, because of the aforementioned exploits completely eclipsing all other strategies.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is: if you want to play a melee-only TF2/Enemy Territory-style objective game that is completey mired in a cluster♥♥♥♥ of exploit-dominated playstyles, where new content drips in at a rate of 2-hats-per-year, and whose community of server mods/admins make Hitler look like a sensible and level-headed dude (come on, you know Godwin's Law had to fit in here somewhere), then dive right in.\n\nBut if you're looking for an even semi-realistic portrayal of medieval combat in a multiplayer videogame, with deep but rational gameplay and a mature community, and furthermore whose developers actively develop it to improve its gameplay and appeal, rather than sheltering and encouraging a vocal minority of elitist shitheels who can't function without garbage exploits, then you'll need to look elsewhere.","June 8, 2015","false","73.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Not because of the game (which is fine for the most part), but because of the community, which is extremelly imature. Often you'll get players from your own team attacking you or killing you for no reason and the moment you retaliate they will start a kick vote against you. And more often than not, you will get kicked. Also, you'll get insulted, also for no reason by people you won't even come in contact with. And speaking of kick votes, you will see one every 10-20 seconds, most of which are initiated just because ppl feel like it. So don't waste your time playing this game with 12 years old kids.

Apart from that, pretty fun.\n\nAlso try to avoid servers where half the people are high level, im talking like lvl 40+. Kinda hard to these days but what they do is they all team up on one side, so each match is laughably one sided. IDK, maybe they're afraid they will lose a round or something, seems believable given the community. But it makes each round either very boring (Winning side) or very annoying (losing side).\n\nAs for mods or crypt servers. They are pretty cool like most the game, but if you are new what will happen is they will team kill you because you havent been on before, then if you defend or fight back they will kick you.\n\nSo like i said before and kinda how it looks these days, this game is slowly killing itself and that is pretty much down to its own community. Try disabling the chat box before you ever really play a round and the expirience will probably be funner, tenfold.","June 11, 2015","false","157.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Closely followed after the hack and slash, insults the kick and ban voting began! The battles continue after the actual battle and keyboard warrior regiments commence battle verbally.\n\nWhilst stood watching this, being the last few players left someone on my own team ran up to me and chopped my arm off closely followed by abuse in chat and then was voted to be kicked off the map after saying my mother is a ****** **** ******.\n\nOver all a creative environment for folk who can't afford Call of Duty or are bored of humanity or simply have nothing better to do, but I enjoyed it none the less, was rather amusing.\n\n5/10","August 12, 2014","true","5.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","1"

The atmosphere is great and the developers behind the game are very passionate about their project. I have actively been on their forums and witnessed, without hesitation, developers and producers openly discussing and welcoming criticism to the game for growth.\n\nTorn Banner Studios is an amazing example of what every studio, both new and small, hopes to become and I am very pleased to see their hard work pay off both in game and out.\n\nThis game utilizes the Unreal Engine and allows the player to engage in multiplayer battle like never before. The voice acting (believe it or not) is the utmost best in this game with the ability to shout and road and cry for help being the most ambient and hilarious factor in this game.\n\nEach weapon is different and takes time for the user to properly use. The animations are a truly great as you will witness proper motion, reaction, and have access to full dynamic controls of your character. Kick, Shield Bash, Duck, Dodge, Feint Attacks, Combo Attacks, Switch Weapons and positions all within the heat of combat with, hopefully, one on one engagements!\n\nNot only are the maps well done but you can use your environment to your advantage. This includes ballistae, boiling pots of oil, fire, mini trebutches, catapults and kick people off of heights to their demise!\n\nTorn Banner has not left anything out as your weapons will react in full detail as they cut down or burst open your enemies. Heads will concave, explode, arms will slice off and drop on the ground, bodies will burn. Amazing job and courage.\n\nNewly added character customization makes this game a real treat!\n\n\n+Original\n+Dynamic\n+Skill Based Success\n+Unlockable Weapons\n+Customizeable Characters\n+Free Content Released\n+Lots of game modes and amazing maps\n+In-game ranks\n10/10\n\nThank you TB!!","September 26, 2013","true","124.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

(anywhere from 3 to 8 seconds)  Not today good sir, as you charge foward all over again, surrounded by your comrades, through the arrows to greet the shield wall of knights blocking the gate. Not today good sir as an arrow with your name on it takes out your comrade who unfortunetly stepped infront of you at just the right second. Not today good sir as you see the gap in the wall of knights open after repeated attacks against their defense..you charge through, giving one look back to see boiling oil being poured ontop of everyone friend and foe as you whisper not today....Up the wall you go, where is that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that keeps killing me in the name of the Iron Glove?.... Looking through the carnage of men decapitate one another while laughing. Deep screams and howls FOR AGITHTAAAAAA fill the air. Thats when you see him. The archer you have been after. Hes still on the wall with his fellow archers raining death down onto the field below.  Theres several knights in between you and them. They are already moving toward you. The archers continue to fire from relative safety. Thats when several of your other comrades go charging past you and engage the knights. They are now in battle, buying you precious time as you move past them. Not today good Sir, as you hold down C key causing you to scream at the top of your lungs "FOR THE ORDER!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! as you run at full sprint with your two handed broad sword toward the archers. Arrows wiz past your face as you  think to yourself *Not today* swinging a heavy attack, taking your opponents head clean off, and the arm of his buddy. Blood sprays everywhere as the guy with no arm screams and flails for a moment. the remaining archers have begun to fall back to the keep, as more of your men make it through the gate and onto the castle walls, Not today Good sir..this is CHIVALRY, ...iF you liked that story, youll love this game\n\nI think this game is like 20 bucks... if you havent played this and love sword fighting games, you cannot go wrong here. Its brutal, gritty, raw, halarious, epic, amazing, all at once. The main game mode is called team objective, anywhere from 20 to 64 players fight in and around castles, villages, and other areas like a battlefield game. Swinging swords and hollering as you run around. But there will be an objective. Defend the wall or kill the royal family. Murder all the villagers in the town (they are bots) And so one team is usually attacking something while the other team defends it, This is what makes the game good because it drags all the players to the same area so you have actual battles. not you and 1 guy fighting another guy. You wont be sneaking around with your bow like you would a sniper rifle in call of duty. You are constantly surrounded by your team. There isnt a lone wolf. ..With the way this game is set up, i dont even know if lone wolfing is possible. Your teammates take damage from you. You can be voted out of games for too much of it. It makes the battles better in my opinion because if you couldnt hurt each other everyone would be swinging wildly 24/7 as if its dynasty warriors in mosou mode lol. By being able to accident chop your bddies head off you are much more calculated with your swings making really fun engagements that can last for more then a quarter of a second...\n","March 25, 2015","true","129.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A "fair" percentage of the price you pay is given to the designer as royalties\n*Good graphics and music\n*Amazing in-game charcter voices\n*Except for a few weapons (which can have their own flaws that you need to learn), everything is balanced (Yes archers are cancer! But they did exist! learn to dodge or equip a shield.)\n\nIf you have not already purchased the game and are reading the negative comments (Very fun to laugh at) you see the phrase "Toxic community" appear. Whenever this game is on a steam sale or bundle, I always want to go knight with a tower shield on my back... If your are new to the game. Please note the following:\n\n1. Don't hit your own team members - Accidents happen, so say when you and a fellow team member kill a guy and your sword goes through the enemy and hits your team mate as well. Just say sorry etc... Also if you keep running into someone else's fight greedily trying to get the killing blow and you hit your team mate, your an ♥♥♥. Same goes for someone interfering with your fight; you hit them by accident... unlucky them.\n\n2. Stay off the catapult and ballista!!!!!!!!!!! Don't aim for the team objective where all your team members are gathering at... PLEASE! Only use them if you know how to. (Else everyone will kill you and kick your ♥♥♥ out of the match ASAP)\n\n3. See that guy there with red on his armor? He was an agatha player with blood from the enemy he just slain! Make sure you know who you are actually attacking! (Hint: Red or Blue name shall appear at the bottom of the screen)\n\n4. Learn the length of your weapon. (It will help, trust me)\n\n5. Hating the draggers and feinters? Watch the infininite number of videos on Youtube that explains how its done. It ain't rocket science. This game is not Pay to win or be the best in the match to unlock extra perks to help kill more enemies. The weapons do not get accessories to improve their effectiveness... This is a game of experience and skill. If the game did not include the features of dragging, feinting and accelerating; then it would drag fights out till someone messes up or runs out of stamina only!\n\n6. Last one - Team damage... when you swing a weapon sideways it will hit anything in it's reach.. so why do you swing when standing next to your own team members?!! Use overhead and stabbing attacks. The tutorial is good for beginners but it shouldn't have to explain common sense. So don't hate the game, hate yourself for not paying attention to your surroundings. Those 3 guys on your team you just hit will happily remind you!\n\nP.S. We love it when you panic block :)","November 14, 2015","true","537.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The sword fighting may look a bit wonky from a viewer's perspective, but it is anything but that.\n\nSword fighting is very intense, and precise. The multiple attack types and directional-based blocking system is superb, forcing you to use tactics in a fight to win. Forcing you to use tactics you've died to others that were using those tactics. Controlling each swing, moving your body and landing each hit is suprisingly easy, but to kill a skilled openet will take technique, skill, and tactics.\n\nHowever, a major down side is the amount of bugs in the game. It's not massive, but in some parts of the game it looks like it's in alpha due to lack of a little design. It needs to be all swept up in one patch, but it still has not been swept up. I'd recommend ALL of you get this, play this, and enjoy this.\n\nBugs - Quite prevelent and common! Sometimes looks alpha!\nStory - Briefly explained in training mode. Basic and barebones but it's a MP game.\nPhysics - Meh. Ragdoll physics are a little weightless, but they do work. Clipping can be an issue.\nSwordplay - Top notch. 10/10, very interesting.\n\nOverall I'd give it a 8/10. Good game, but buggy and lacks a story. Physics aren't bad, but you must remember, I just wrote a review for HL2!","February 6, 2013","true","590.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A "fair" percentage of the price you pay is given to the designer as royalties\n*Good graphics and music\n*Amazing in-game charcter voices\n*Except for a few weapons (which can have their own flaws that you need to learn), everything is balanced (Yes archers are cancer! But they did exist! learn to dodge or equip a shield.)\n\nIf you have not already purchased the game and are reading the negative comments (Very fun to laugh at) you see the phrase "Toxic community" appear. Whenever this game is on a steam sale or bundle, I always want to go knight with a tower shield on my back... If your are new to the game. Please note the following:\n\n1. Don't hit your own team members - Accidents happen, so say when you and a fellow team member kill a guy and your sword goes through the enemy and hits your team mate as well. Just say sorry etc... Also if you keep running into someone else's fight greedily trying to get the killing blow and you hit your team mate, your an ♥♥♥. Same goes for someone interfering with your fight; you hit them by accident... unlucky them.\n\n2. Stay off the catapult and ballista!!!!!!!!!!! Don't aim for the team objective where all your team members are gathering at... PLEASE! Only use them if you know how to. (Else everyone will kill you and kick your ♥♥♥ out of the match ASAP)\n\n3. See that guy there with red on his armor? He was an agatha player with blood from the enemy he just slain! Make sure you know who you are actually attacking! (Hint: Red or Blue name shall appear at the bottom of the screen)\n\n4. Learn the length of your weapon. (It will help, trust me)\n\n5. Hating the draggers and feinters? Watch the infininite number of videos on Youtube that explains how its done. It ain't rocket science. This game is not Pay to win or be the best in the match to unlock extra perks to help kill more enemies. The weapons do not get accessories to improve their effectiveness... This is a game of experience and skill. If the game did not include the features of dragging, feinting and accelerating; then it would drag fights out till someone messes up or runs out of stamina only!\n\n6. Last one - Team damage... when you swing a weapon sideways it will hit anything in it's reach.. so why do you swing when standing next to your own team members?!! Use overhead and stabbing attacks. The tutorial is good for beginners but it shouldn't have to explain common sense. So don't hate the game, hate yourself for not paying attention to your surroundings. Those 3 guys on your team you just hit will happily remind you!\n\nP.S.

First, alot of people are stating online that this game does not have a large amount of cheaters or hackers which is a huge lie. Hacking is very present in this game with people claiming maxed sensitivity and some fancy setting which still negates the speed of such weapon. Even if you catch such people commiting these actions there are numerous others that ruin the experiance of a game. Second, friendly fire is very present in the game.....be it does put a sense of realism in the game it also breeds a form of elitist mentality in a large sum of the player base toward the newer players in whch you are eithier be trolled out of game or more often kicked and unable to rejoin toward the more populated servers where the game was in one prospective interesting. Lastly, the progression systems for unlocking weapons is based solely on aggregated kills and not on kills that was helped as in other games. Many times while you are in combat a veteran players or at times a newer player will come in while in 1V1 combat take or steal ones kill and make you progression most tedious especially toward weaker weapons that do not kill in one or 2 hits similar that plaques the lighter classes. There are things in game that has some moments but these few times of brightness gets mostly overcasted by constant hacking, lag issues and lack of overall progression in which random interjections in combat by other players ruin the experiance.","June 7, 2015","false","89.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

But it was kinda good once.\n\n48~ of my 56 some odd hours in this game were spent in 2012 when this game first hit Steam. It was fun back then; not great, but still entertaining. But most importantly, there was a huge opportunity for improvements in the coming years, which I was very keen to see (and still have yet to).\n\nThe most recent 8~ hours I've played have been far below the expecations I had for progress made in 3 whole years of development; really, if anything, the current state of the game is a straight retrograde from the 2012 iteration. Hit detection issues have against all odds gotten worse, almost all the combat exploits are still here, the community has gotten far worse, and it seems like very little new content exists now that didn't exist 3 years ago. I mean, I guess the new menus and hats are nice, oh and you can change your armor color to confuse people by obscuring what was previously a clean "red vs blue" combat environment, but...\n\nThe array of weaponry, for example, seems identical. Sure, you have a bunch of reskins for real $$, but they're functionally identical to weapons which already existed 3 years ago. I can understand why adding more weapons just for the sake of more weapons is a recipe for disaster balance-wise, but really guys? Three whole trips around the sun and nothing?\n\nThe minority community of insular elitists has somehow blossomed since 2012, and what's worse is that it seems the developers only cater to this demographic when updating the game. This is why flat-out exploits like mouse dragging or bunny-hopping during sword fights still exist: long-time players have been using these as a crutch for so long that making the game work without them hasn't even been considered.\n\nAdditionally, the populated servers all seem to suffer from high degrees of what I call "Garry's Mod-itis", where server admins go on power trips and break their own server rules pretty much constantly. A catastrophic lack of maturity is a recurring theme.\n\nThe most positive thing I can say about this game is that the tutorial is really well designed, probably one of the more content-rich tutorials I've encountered. It's too bad that the majority of the stuff you learn in it can be safely thrown out the window once you actually start playing multiplayer, because of the aforementioned exploits completely eclipsing all other strategies.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is: if you want to play a melee-only TF2/Enemy Territory-style objective game that is completey mired in a cluster♥♥♥♥ of exploit-dominated playstyles, where new content drips in at a rate of 2-hats-per-year, and whose community of server mods/admins make Hitler look like a sensible and level-headed dude (come on, you know Godwin's Law had to fit in here somewhere), then dive right in.\n\nBut if you're looking for an even semi-realistic portrayal of medieval combat in a multiplayer videogame, with deep but rational gameplay and a mature community, and furthermore whose developers actively develop it to improve its gameplay and appeal, rather than sheltering and encouraging a vocal minority of elitist shitheels who can't function without garbage exploits, then you'll need to look elsewhere.","June 8, 2015","false","73.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Not because of the game (which is fine for the most part), but because of the community, which is extremelly imature. Often you'll get players from your own team attacking you or killing you for no reason and the moment you retaliate they will start a kick vote against you. And more often than not, you will get kicked. Also, you'll get insulted, also for no reason by people you won't even come in contact with. And speaking of kick votes, you will see one every 10-20 seconds, most of which are initiated just because ppl feel like it. So don't waste your time playing this game with 12 years old kids.

Apart from that, pretty fun.\n\nAlso try to avoid servers where half the people are high level, im talking like lvl 40+. Kinda hard to these days but what they do is they all team up on one side, so each match is laughably one sided. IDK, maybe they're afraid they will lose a round or something, seems believable given the community. But it makes each round either very boring (Winning side) or very annoying (losing side).\n\nAs for mods or crypt servers. They are pretty cool like most the game, but if you are new what will happen is they will team kill you because you havent been on before, then if you defend or fight back they will kick you.\n\nSo like i said before and kinda how it looks these days, this game is slowly killing itself and that is pretty much down to its own community. Try disabling the chat box before you ever really play a round and the expirience will probably be funner, tenfold.","June 11, 2015","false","157.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Whether you pay full price or pick up this title on a 90% sale, I can guarantee you will be more than satisfied with getting far more than your money's worth. The only way a person could really dislike this game is if they don't give it enough of a chance (this is one of those games that's very easy to give up on at first), or if it's simply just not the type of game that's suitable for that person. [READ ON FOR MORE DETAILS]\n\nINFORMATION ON CLASSES:\nChivalry: Medieval Warfare has 4, well-balanced classes that allow for a wide variety of playstyles per person. There are 2 heavily armored classes, the Knight and the Vanguard, and there are 2 light armor classes, the Man-At-Arms and the Archer.\n\nThe Knight class is the most heavily armored class (which means most HP) with a variety of deadly, high damage hammers, axes, swords, and flails (ball and chain) of both the one and two-handed variety, at his disposal.\n\nThe Vanguard, noticably less armored than the knight, specializes in polearms, with all of his weapons being very lengthy and high-damage. Swords, bardiche, halberd, billhook, variety of thrusting spears, polehammer; with these weapons, the vanguard class allows you to stay out of reach of your opponents attacks whilst you seemlessly decapitate them, whereas the Knight class's weapons force you to get up close and personal. The Vanguard is the only class that can not equip a shield.\n\nThe Man-At-Arms; master of evasion, equipped with the unique dodge ability that, if timed well, can evade an enemy's attack with ease, while at the same time, opens an oppurtunity for a counter attack. The Man-At-Arms is equipped a variety of one-handed swords, axes and hammers (the same weapons as the Knight's secondaries), as well as a two-handed quarterstaff. The MAA's lack of HP is made up for by his speed and agility that, if utilized properly, can overwhelm any class.\n\nAnd finally the Archer... those pesky archers... with a weapon choice between bows, crossbows, and throwing spears/javelins of varying speeds and damage, the archer can range and pick off their opponents, especially those who are wounded or distracted. On the flip side of their ranging abilities, the archer is at a disadvantage in melee combat due to its very low-damage melee weapons and miniscule HP.\n\nGAME MODE INFO:\nChivalry offers a variety of official game modes including but not limited to; Team Objective (within this game mode there is a wide variety of objectives that vary between defense and offense, Ex: Tainting the enemy's water supply by dumping a cart-load of corpses into it.), Team Deathmatch, Last Team Standing, and Free-For-All. There are also dueling servers available for sharpening up on your skills. In team-based game modes, you have the option of siding with the Agatha Knights (blue, gold,white), or the Mason Order (Red & Black). The Mason Order, once part of Agatha, are a rebelling force fighting for freedom of Agatha's rule and fighting for power.\n\nI've been playing this game for over a year, and in doing so, I've finally become one amongst the "high-ranks". The challenge and difficulty of this game are what makes it so satisfying and rewarding. You can not allow yourself to be discouraged when first starting out; learning this game can be hell. Be sure to make use of the low rank servers when starting out.\n\n-Shroom","November 29, 2015","true","440.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

About mechanics, meh, if you don't care about a knight who is spinning like a beyblade then you'll love it.\n\n\nIf you are under 15 level and if you playing on low level servers (0-15 lvl ones with the green color.) you will love its mechanics too. But whenever you are higher than 15, then you won't be able to enter those ones. And you will see some people spinning around like trying to hit a fly with his weapon. You won't be able to predict their movements for a while, and you'll get used to it. So, the breaking point is the lvl 15. If you don't care about realistic movements then i think you'll love this game.\n\nGraphics are fancy enough to satisfy me, but i suggest you to watch some videos to see if it's your style or not.\n\nLet me be clear, comminuty is bad, for me at least, so you had better to play this game with your friends. It'll neutralise the effect of the bad comminuty a bit.\n\nBots are bad, just, bad.\n\nBut I'll give it a upvote because I'm playing it with my friends mostly, and we're enjoying it together.","January 4","true","65.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Although it is far from realistic, it is entertaining in the gameplay aspect, with certain /heavy/ flaws to it. Being able to combo overheads, lunges and horizontal swings fluently with only a break if the enemy is capable of parrying in time is astounding. Getting struck during the wind-up phase can make you flinch, which will lose the wind-up, a good idea not a lot of games impliment. If the enemy is a capable man of parrying, you can feint to trip him up, although the feint is capable of being countered by timing your parries to be at the exact moment.\n\nCombat is fast and lethal, with a variety of weapons that suit your interests, with multiple classes that function better in certain ways, such as the Man-At-Arm's ability to dodge back, the Vanguard's ability to leap into the enemy and the Knight's ability to one hand a two handed weapon, and couple it with a large shield. They've recently added the ability to customize your character for each class, as well as purchase special cosmetic items that in no way give the buyer an advantage in combat. Mods are regularly released and community content is sometimes permitted to be official.\n\nThe voice-acting is entertaining and very well done. There's even a war-cry button handy while you're sprinting.\n\nUnfortunately, Chivalry suffers from a very extreme problem. Sword dragging is an exploit in which the user will tilt their camera at an angle so as to do a overhead swing on you, while their backs are turned to you, or stabbing into you well after your parry is over. It has become a common trend and used by the players that have played for a long while and rather than taking the chance of upsetting this small number of would-be customers, or perhaps being too lazy to fix it themselves, Torn Banner has simply allowed it to carry on for the time being.\n\nIf you are a new player in this game, do not leave the low rank servers until you can't play in there anymore. If you are interested in getting into Chivalry, you shouldn't buy it at full price, because I personally believe laziness shouldn't be rewarded. It is, at its core, a good game, and at the very least you should buy it on sale.","June 1, 2015","true","465.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has easily become the best $2.50 I have ever spent in my life.  This game is incredible, especially if you're a fan of deathmatch/battle arena style games.  There's incredible skill involved at the competetive level of play.  I can guarantee this game will keep you happy for hundreds of hours, AT THE LEAST.  This game is definitely in my top list of best games ever made, which is surprising because I had never heard of it prior to purchasing.  In any case, I cannot, in good conscience, give this game anything less than a 5 star review.  Buy it.

So the arm and sword movement is: reachback for the swind -> swing to the front.\n\nClever movement allows you to damage the enemy behind you if you look up while reaching back with your sword. That is since your torso bends backwards while looking up and the tip of your sword is at that point directly behind you. That is possible since the torso movement is liked to te mouse.\nVery good players attacking you will use that to turn away from you and look up while reaching back with their sword and you will get damaged by their sword. The second they swing out they look down again and spin to you and damage you again.\n\nThis looks uttely stupid and ther are many different ways to exploit the mouse system in that way.\n(For example you can turn while making a leaping attack and if you are good leap past and enemy to swing in his side or back)\n\nThis leads to enemies spining and flailing with their arms and torsos while the player brandishes with his mouse.\n\nThis not only makes no sense but also looks extremely stupid and steals all sense of fighting atmosphere.\nFor me it destroys the combat system since I am not willing to play in that moronic way and make myself look like a total idiot while actually beeing very efficient and dangerous.\n","April 2","false","29.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Over the time since this was in beta, it has improved so so much. The bad reviews on this game are from people who don't like the learning curve, and the bugginess of the game in the past. Chivalry does indeed have a big learning curve to become really good at it, but seriously, the more you play the better you get.\n\nGraphics for this game are amazing, and pretty demanding too. You're going to need a mid range or better graphics processor to max out the settings.\n\nGameplay is a great experience. You can have the most intense fight against your opponents and rise to the top of the player list, or you can constantly mash X2 to say "NO" while you run away from enemies. This game has made me laugh so hard because of the voice commands. I can be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if I get killed by some person, but then they say something like "You're welcome" or "The pleasure is all mine" and I can't even be mad. Now onto the few bad things about this game. Some aspects of the fighting are unrealistic, because some people choose to  use these dumb methods of fighting. For example, a knight is facing you and runs right infront of you, turns around, and swings overhead. You take full damage if you don't parry or block fast enough. There are a few other moves like this, but all of them are pretty easy to avoid. Keep your distance from a higher rank player (35-60) It's likely they'll use these moves effectively and put ya six feet under.\n\nAnyway that's my review for Chivalry: Medieval Warfare. I play it all the time, because the community is so great and fun to interact with. I plan on playing for a long time (at least 1000 hours), and you should too. Reccommended game for sure","June 29, 2014","true","710.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

So you need to aim and direct where you attack and block. This makes for an intense are real experience, where timing and being technical can mean life and death.\n\nA summary of the action - it's bloody and graffic, with decapitations and limb lopping fun!\n\nChivalry sets the bar for real time stikes and every other fighting game has begun to follow by it's example.\n\nThere are a huge arsenal of weapons you can unlock from playing and you always have the option to change between different character classes: knight, vanguard, man at arms, or archer.\n\nEach class is unique and has it's own style as well as weapons. Each weapon has pros and cons, meaning certain styles of playing work better or worse with it.\n\nChivarly also allows your character to call out and say things, from insults, to respectful congratulations, warnings and even team objective reminders.\n\nIt makes it a more social game and adds an extra bit of fun to the experience.\n\nYou can also switch between 1st and 3rd person, anytime during the game. So everyone is happy.\n\nThe levels are well set up and work well for the different game modes. from the mateship of team objective and team deahtmatch, the chaos of free for all and the techical battles of duel.\n\nI strongly reccomend this game for anyone who likes playing online games and has interest in fighting games. You will not be disappointed.\n\nCheck out some videos or go in sword first and ask questions later!\n\nRob.","September 2, 2014","true","251.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Any game that you put 300+ hours into has to be good. For me, this was one of those games. I've probably played this than any other game in the recent years.

The game is polished, and has a wonderful team of developers. All in all, if I was to assign a score to Chivalry, I'd definitely give it a 9 out of 10. There are no drawbacks in the game, as I do not count the very uncommon (but of course occuring) player nuisance.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/monstercocaine/recommended/219640/","monstercocaine","Emperor Trump","http://steamcommunity.com/id/monstercocaine/","113 products in account","Chivalry: Medieval Warfare is a game about medieval warfare as it so happens. The game features brutal combat with a nice mix of game modes and a lot of people to play with.\n\nPros:\n\n- Brilliant combat. The game does an amazing job with the fighting, especially in first person.\n- Lots of players. The game is still very active and has a large amount of players on it, mainly in the afternoon.\n- It looks stunning. If you have the graphics on the highest then you will be satisfied!\n- Has many different weapons to play with. All of them vary in size, damage, stamina cost, etc.\n- Has an okay Stamina and Health system. It's not very realistic (at least, the health), but it's actually quite good.\n\nCons:\n\n- Crashes and freezes a LOT. You'll have to deal with this a lot, until they fix it.\n- Every update to fix bugs brings more bugs. They tend to do this a lot. Don't even get me started on major updates.\n- People use public servers as servers to play with friends. You'll get kicked from servers sometimes (not common).\n- If you're good, butthurt people will try to kick you. I'm rank 37 and it happens sometimes, it happens to all of us.\n- Peope complain. If you feint or drag, butthurt people WILL complain, just ignore them.\n\nThe two main mechanics of this game:\n\n- Feints. Feinting is where you stop an attack while you're winding up, in order to follow up with a proper attack. This makes people block early meaning you get a free hit on them, you can also double feint, etc.\n\n- Dragging. Dragging is where you move the mouse around when you attack to slow down or speed up your attack. A lot of people will drag overheads with slow weapons like the Messer because they deal lots of damage.\n\nThe other mechanic of this game which isn't quite main but you could consider it there:\n\n- Blocking. Yeah, obviously you can block, but the blocking is special. With a weapon only you can only block for 1 second before going back to no blocking, this makes the combat very tense and exciting and you can get some really good fights out of it. With a shield you can block as long as you like, but you don't regain stamina with a shield up and you can be stunned with a kick for something like 3 seconds so they can get a hit on you. Also, the stunned shield hits do more damage.\n\nLearning the game:\n\nThe game will be hard to learn. It really will. The only matchmaking system is some servers putting rank limits on them. The only ones that are there that I see are the official low rank servers which are rank 0 - 15. The server I'm an admin on has a rank limit of 30-90 but a bug causes this to not work. (the highest rank is like rank 61 at the moment by the way). When you join servers and there's someone with a higher rank than you (sometimes 1 rank higher) will destroy you constantly, the trick is you use this to get good yourself, and it works.\n\nConclusion:\n\nTo conclude, I do recommend this game. Apart from all the cons mentioned, the game is still a good game and the major bugs are always fixed, and you can deal with the minor bugs that can actually be quite funny. There are plenty of maps, plenty of players, plenty of weapons, and plenty of hours to be spent! The crashing will be fixed at some point and the devs seem to be active. Recommend it to your friends too, it can be a laugh and on the whole a great deal of fun.","August 6, 2014","true","103.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","4"

Played about 10 games, had the one off game where I got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off, but I tend to rage at many things. Every kill means something, it's an intense, deeply personal fight where you scream when you achieve victory and punch the air for joy. I also spend half the time laughing just because of how awesome the gore is. Enjoy\n\nEDIT: If I had to add one thing? It's that never go past level 15. Once you get shut out of the 0-15 rank lobbies, which are genuine fun, and have skilled and awful players in equal measure, you get thrust into the multitude of idiotic, barely populated lobbies with players who either endlessly spam the standard attack (LMB) or who spin in a ridiculous pattern to unpredictably slow or speed up the attack, making it impossible to block. It's now ruined, beacuse nobody plays the objective. Nobody has any sense of playing well either, 1v1s at the end of Last Team Standing matches don't exist, beacuse people are too wrapped up in ♥♥♥♥♥♥ one man with their nine teammates. It's now ♥♥♥♥ing ruined, and I can not get one single decent game now, as I refuse to participate in this exhibition of cuntishness anymore that involves turning the sensitivity up to 100, whipping the mouse around, and clicking. Clicking. Clicking. I am geniunely considering getting another account and buying the game for a second time, as the immense fun has been drained out of the game by the denizens of the regular servers. Rare is the time you come across someone who doesn't complain (me being one of them). And if you do, they'll probably be on your team. The game is barely the same thing now, and the frustration from the spammers, the bouncing men at arms, and the endlessly swivelling knights has made me rage quit several times within hours, within HOURS, of advancing past the opening lobbies. This is not a game you can seriously invest in, as if you do: you will become a ♥♥♥♥.","August 3, 2014","true","28.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The more recent updates include vast graphical improvements but seem to also incorporate more bugs. These include a drop in hit detection and a strange measurement in the range of attacks (greatswords are out of range but a dagger still makes contact from the same distance). They aren't a very common occurence, however and gameplay remains very engaging and tense. It can be difficult to get used top at first but with some experience gained over time this can be very addictive as you take part in epic battles of a decent scale but with massive bloodshed and many skilled opponents.
