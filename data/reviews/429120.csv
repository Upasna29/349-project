It seems to be a direct port from a tablet or smart phone, keeps telling me to press screen to continue. In the config menu before the game starts it shows a joystick menu and config, yet in the game itself there is no joystick support, its too bad really. It uses the mouse, although a little strange at first, its quite easy to learn. Its actually quite fun and the only TEMPEST spin off I have ever played in my 35 years of gaming. Also another thing, its got autofire which also confirms its a tablet/smartphone port..... Its most likely $2 on googleplay, yet its $5 on STEAM, go figure.....","January 29","true","0.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I like the aspect of using the mouse to control the spaceship in this game. I enjoy the single player mode for its replayability and superb enemy and boss design. It also reminds me of the 80s arcade shooters Gyruss, Tempest, and Sinistar. The multiplayer aspect is extremely fun as well. I had hours of fun playing this game along with friends and family.\n\nAlso, there is really cool guy on youtube named Saiga GeneCast who did a Let's Play of this game. You should check him out because he describes in detail how to play this game. Type in Zamarian Saiga GeneCast and you should find his video.\n:)","January 23","true","10.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","0"

I loved the refreshing graphics and sounds. I could play endlessly alone, but the multi-player function is an awesome bonus.

I had lots of fun playing after playing for about an hour with my friend I can see this game being great for lan parties. Im having a large lan party with about 15-20 in a couple weeks so will see how it goes and update. Appears to be a mobile port, not a problem just worth bearing in mind before purchasing. There were a couple glitches here and there but nothing major, nothing that would have an affect on gameplay. Overall I think this game is great and would really recommend purchasing. At the moment it is priced at £3.99! It really is a bargain at that price","February 19","true","0.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

No one associated with this game has compelled me to leave positive feedback. Observations and comments, whether positive or negative, are entirely my own. If you would like me to review a game, check out: fiverr dot com slash ThatAwesomeTerr.\n\nZamarian is a neat little tube shooter. It will probably remind older gamers of arcade classics like Tempest. In keeping with the theme, graphics are suitable for the genre, sitting neatly somewhere between a modern isometric style and indie pixel art.\n\nWhen it comes to gameplay, it could be a little more fleshed out. The basic controls are simple enough. Players can move the mouse side-to-side to roll around the screen, and forward and back to move the ship up and down the ship's flight path.\n\nMinor problems with gameplay only start popping up when trying to get any idea of what the strange buttons on the side of the screen are. To figure that out, you will have to start a new game and pay close attention to the pop-ups. After that initial introduction though, there seem to be any further explanation of the capabilities of the weapons or even the differences between the ships. Of course, you can figure out what they do by purchasing them. I'm still not sure what the non-cosmetic differences are between the ships. Likewise, I also couldn't figure out what the EMP does.\n\nOpening up one of the menus to upgrade your ship will just slow the game down, not pause it. A separate pause button will do as advertised, and will provide you with options to turn both music and sound off or back on.\n\nThe enemies are easy enough at first, but quickly ramp up the challenge. There is a good variation of them, and more and more enemy types will be added as levels are progressed through. Bosses are intimidating and challenging, but not impossible to take down.\n\nThere is also an online leaderboard and a multiplayer component. Though I didn't get to check the latter out, it seems to allow up to 4 players to join either a random or private match. That's pretty cool, in my opinion.\n\nFor just over $5, Zamarian provides some solid arcade action. But community and openess is increasingly important in the gaming industry these days. Zamarian's devs are no exception when it comes to engaging with their community. It's difficult to see anything but a good future for a game whose developers are willing to listen to their players with a critical ear.","January 31","true","3.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"
