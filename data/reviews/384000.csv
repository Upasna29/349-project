It's a bit difficult to properly aim your blows and the fact Pier moves forward while attacking makes things even harder: there were a few times when I found myself punching air. A controller makes things somewhat easier though\n\n-combat design per se is, once again, very simple since you don't have any sprint, dodge or parry buttons and are sometimes faced with quite many enemies that can surround you and quickly drop you if you're not careful. A good solution until you get a sword or upgrade your health is to use a special move, run away while your health recharges and do it over again but it isn't fun nor it feels epic: cutting down the number of enemies and/ or giving us more defensive options'd have helped\n\n-stealth sections, while generally easy, add nothing to the game and lack any fun factor: it's also aggravating that, if one gets caught, you have to start over from scratch (in chapter 7 this meant replaying about 4 minutes stealthing through the previous areas again)\n\n-UI is disappointing in some aspects as in it lacks a clear way to know when a special move is available again ( either a tick on the stamina bar or the ability glowing when ready'd have been great) and the special moves you can buy lack a description apart from some very vague bars regarding their stamina cost, range and damage\n\n-the various characters, including Pier's family, are generally paper thin and little more than a portrait and some dialogue lines: since they have little background and we don't really have time to form an attachment to them during the game I sadly didn't really care much for their fate\n\n-you only have 6 areas to explore (your farm, a couple of surrounding villages and the roads connecting them), they're quite small and tend to all look quite alike\n\n-very linear with no extra quests and also short, I've finished it (opening about 3/4 of the secret chests) in less than three hours\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=515734387\n\nReviewing Cross of the Dutchman feels a bit weird since this'll be, at the time I'm writing, the only negative review it's getting: I want to point out this is NOT a bad game per se but, in the end, it just feels too generic and bland in its gameplay to warrant a recommendation. I know this isn't an AAA title and the price is low to match the fact, but there's no denying it'd have used either a better narrative or a more engaging and complex combat system to distinguish itself in a genre that's been done countless times before...as things stand the only thing making it stand out is its, admittedly good, setting but that's- imho- not enough.","September 10, 2015","false","4.1"," 138 of 172 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","138","172","2","4"

This is exactly what happened to Triangle Studios with Cross of the Dutchman, a game about the Frisian hero Pier Gerlofs Donia, and it shows.\n\nIt's a playable adventure game with some hack & slash and very rare stealth elements. Playable being the keyword.\nNothings actually "good" or well made, but there isn't anything really bad in here either. It's bland.\nI did, however, enjoyed my time with the game. Full disclosure; being from The Netherlands and having Frisian relatives might have helped with that. A historically themed game set in Frisia sounded amazing.\n\nThe historical part is ultimately the most disappointing part about the game, though. You'll get to see the tale about how a simple farmer became the legendary "Grutte Pier" told in a mostly lighthearted and really straightforward manner. I'd have loved to have seen some more detailed information about the Saxons, live in Frysia during that time-period and so on. Even if it where just simple codex entries. But unfortunately, there's nothing like that to be found. That might just be my inner geek speaking, though.\nThe environments are pretty and the sound-design is fantastic. But Pier himself...\n\nHe's a large pile of rather dumb powermuscles.\nOr atleast, that's how the game portrays him, and I doubt it's what the developers where going for. I like the lighthearted form of story-telling, but it isn't handled very well, lacks any kind of character development and hurts the whole game in the process.\n\nThe game itself is a four to five hour affair wherein you'll punch some soldiers, search for treasure chests, do some light sneaking and participate in a whole lot of backtracking.\n\nThe combat's...fine. Basic, but it works. You'll get some special abilities early on and you can fully rely on using the heaviest one and your standard punches to defeat your enemies. Sneaking around is a bit annoying. All of a sudden the player can't attack guards he fought just a couple of moment ago and get's instantly killed when spotted. It's short, easy and only happens twice, so it's not a big deal.\n\nThe amount of back-tracking is, however, a very big deal. Somewhere at the start of the game, Pier makes a joke about feeling like an errand boy, and that never goes away. There are just a small number of area's you can visit and you'll be running between them so many times it get's very repetitive. And then it ends.\n\nThere's nothing in the way of side-activities, beside searching for some hidden treasure chests. They're...treasure chests.\nFinished the game with every chest opened without any issues.\n\nThe game feels like a well-polished idea. It might know what it wants to achieve, but clearly isn't able to do that on it's budget. Everything is just...there.\n\nIt's a game. It's playable. It exists.\nAnd that's more then I thought would happen after the Kickstarter failed.\n\nI'm glad it's here and enjoyed my time with it, but I can't possibly recommend it.","September 16, 2015","false","6.8"," 45 of 54 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","45","54","4","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/recommended/384000/","Jadarma","Jadarma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/","267 products in account","Note: This game was provided to me for free for review purposes.OverviewCross of the Dutchman is the second game we see on Steam from Triangle Studios, from the Netherlands. In this game you will control a farmer and help him collect an army of fellow country men and fight off the Saxon invasion. It is a top-down fighting game with minor RPG elements. The game is based on a real story / local legend of Pier Donia, who's tomb is actually located at a walking distance from the dev's office building, hence the inspiration for the game.\n\nThe Pros:Accurate Story Telling - From what I was able to research about the legend of Pier, the game stays true to the story, and tries to sneak in as many details as possible. The writing is concise, doesn't waste too much time on minor details and the story is actually pretty straight forward and well paced.\n\nLovely Art Style - The game adopts a very brightly colored, low poly and fluidly animated scenery, which is an interesting choice considering this is a game about mass murdering soldiers. This is reminescent of the way people treat Pier now as a hero, when he was, even if patriotic, responsible for many brutal deaths. The game does look very pleasant to the eye, and due to it's graphical style, it doesn't demand many resources, so expect a smooth 60fps on most systems.\n\nGood, clean fun - There aren't a lot to do in this game, but it's not a bad point. Your main activities will include recruiting allies (story driven), finding gold in hidden chests and loot crates, and killing saxons with your bare fists or swords. These are surprisingly not that repetitive as I've expected, and you can get about 4 hours in a not rushed game. The Combat is also satisfying, primarily due to the fact that you are very very overpowered.\n\nAppealing UI - The user interface looks very nice overall, and even features a full map, besides the mini-map in the corner with useful information such as POI's and the amount of hidden treasure chests in the region you're in. (Game does not mention this, but Pier was also a pirate. Yarr)\n\nVery easy achievements - The game has only 31 achievements, and they are all so easy to get, you won't need several runs if you organize yourself. I've put together a guide which you can check out here: 100% - Achievement of the Dutchman. The Cons:Too Easy - This is a story driven game, however the combat is very easy. The only way you could lose is by heading fist first in a bunch of archers and be overwhelmed at a distance. Using your fists, and later sword, you can use special attacks that can kill a dozen soldiers in one hit. All combat is here, really, is evading enemy blows until your abilities recharge and then own them. The adition of your immortal followers make this even easier.\n\nSub Par Stealth System - There are parts of the game where you must use stealth in order to not alert the Saxon soldiers. The problem with this is that they are all practically blind. The only way you can be detected is if you walk one meter in front of them. As long as you are not in the (small) circle of light their lamp gives, you're invisible, even if you are clearly in front of them, in plain sight. Not challenging at all.\n\nLinear - I understand they planned this as a story driven game, and I'm not disappointed with it, it's just that the linear nature of the game really kills replayability. If you want it for the story reinactment, then no problem here. But it would have been great to have this small, open world where you would have random events to save peasants, kill saxons, and persuade new vigilantes to join your side before heading into battle!\nConclusion:Cross of The Dutchman is a good game. Pleasant visuals, decent writing, fun (even if easy) combat and a generally nice experience. Keep in mind this is a story driven game, and won't offer much replayability, but it is very fun to play the first few times!\n\nDon't forget to check out my complete guide here: 100% - Achievement of the Dutchman.\n\nIf you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ladyoberon/recommended/384000/","ladyoberon","LadyOberon [#GamersRule]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ladyoberon/","2871 products in account","This game caught my attention for several reasons. Firstly, is was an ARPG with controller support, so that meant that I had to give it a chance. I've enjoyed gaming for years, but I really do prefer to game with a controller, so that was an absolute plus for me. I was also fascinated by the historical fantasy aspect of this game, so I was pleased to find during gameplay that this concept was maintained throughout with clothing and architecture.\n\nThe soundtrack was good, and the graphics were very vivid and colorful. The one thing I have to say about this, though, is that the color saturation seemed a bit off to me. I must have walked past the carrot patch a dozen times during the prologue, because they looked like beets to me, and I noticed that "ruddy" color scheme throughout. I'm unsure if this was intentional, but it was definitely noticeable.\n\nMechanically, the game is sound, but there is room for improvement. I felt like, at times, there was a bit of lag or delay between button presses and action on the screen, specifically with combat. That does improve later on with the addition of the sword, but the delay coupled with the lack of auto-aim made combat unimpressive and a bit more of a challenge than it probably should have been.\n\nI liked the health, stamina, and combat upgrades, but gold is scarce in the game, so if you intend to obtain the achievement for having 1,000 gold, it's best to do that before purchasing upgrades. In my case, I hadn't reviewed the achievement guide beforehand, so I'm stuck at the end of the game with little to do but start a new game for that achievement. That brings me to replayability. If I didn't intend to replay for the purpose of attaining my last 3 achievements, I probably wouldn't feel the desire to revisit this game.  That fact leads me to address the pricing. I feel like the price point could be lowered a bit. I wanted this game very badly, so I paid full price for it, but I'd feel a bit better about that if there was more content, or greater replayability. Since that's not the case, this might be a game you'd want to pick up on sale. In my opinion, even a dollar or two off of the full price would be a fair deal.\n\nAlso a positive are the number of destructibles and the looting aspect in the form of gold. While I wish that gold was of greater occurrence during the game, it is possible to attain all upgrades if you enjoy smashing destructibles and looting chests, like I do. What I would like to see improved, though, is layout. The gaming environment is relatively small, with a lot of backtracking or revisiting of areas as the game progresses. This world has tremendous opportunity for expansion, so hopefully, we'll get to see that in a future update.\n\nStory and character development are also areas that can be improved. There's not much to the characters or the story, and a lot of the dialogue between characters seems to have been inserted as filler, as if the developers felt that something was needed but didn't quite know what, or didn't have the time/budget to do what they really wanted.\n\nThe game can easily be played from start to finish in an afternoon, and it comes with a lot of very attainable achievements. This will likely become my first "perfect" game, so if that is something that interests you, you might consider this when deciding if this is a game for you.\n\nOverall, it's a perfectly enjoyable game with some unique elements. I'd encourage achievement hunters and ARPG fans to give this a try. I'd also encourage the developers to either revisit Cross of the Dutchman in the form of content updates or publish a sequel. I would definitely consider their next publication.\n\n\n*This review is featured on the curator page of Good Games Giveaways & Reviews.","February 25","true","6.5"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","22","26","0","2"

The story ends after his first great victory, so before he became a pirate/bandit captain.\n\nGraphics are colorful and beautiful, they really portray the mediaeval Frisia in a good way. Environments are detailed and very nicely crafted. All characters appearing in the game wear realistic depictions of 16th century clothing and the main cast is instantly recognisable. A nice touch is that Greate Pier is indeed a full head taller than most others, as he is described to have been.\n\nSound is well done with good soundeffects and a very nice fitting score. At the end during the big battles it is very cinematic.\n\nCombat is limited to a two button affair: normal attack and special attack, which takes stamina. Through upgrades (8 in total) you can learn new special attacks and each has its special purpose, although I mainly stuck with the circle attack. There is no strategy to combat other than hitting the enemy as much as you can and running away from dogpiling. Don't expect Arkham-style brawling here.\n\nAs long as the game is combat or exploring, it's fun. However, there are lengthy stealth sections where upon getting caught the level resets, where you cannot attack at all and have to avoid the light radius of patrolling soldiers. Getting caught means the level resets, which in the final stealth section can cost you five minutes of replaying across several areas. They are the only real bad part of the game, and unfortunately not skippable.\n\nThe game will take about three hours to complete, or four if you want to collect all the Points of Interest and hidden chests. Achievements almost all unlock during normal gameplay and with one exception, can all be gotten even after the fact. The exception is an achievement for having 1000 gold: if you buy upgrades too soon, you can lock yourself out of this one so beware.\n\nOverall this gets a recommendation. The game is not expensive and is definitely fun to play through. You're not just getting a good brawler, you're also getting a nice peek into a Frisian historical hero.","September 28, 2015","true","4.1"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","22","27","2","1"

At this point you become tasked with repelling the invaders and rallying people to help fight for your cause to become the Legend you were born to be. This is based on hisotical events and while I might not know anything about them I do feel like it's telling a good story for the most part, I just wish there was more to the story since without spoiling anything it just ends and you feel like there should be more to the tale.\n\nGameplay is pretty much a simple hack and slash, you have two attacks "Basic" and "Special". Your basic attack is a simple punch (or sword when you aquire that), the special attacks can purchased and swapped as you progress and find coins that drop from barrels/chests. You also have a Health upgrade/stamina upgrade vendor that can give you a boost to stats. My only beef is the combat doesn't feel good and you can't block, if enemies overwhelm you it might be best to run away and recharge health. Controls feel a bit stiff to do (I used a pad) and moving wasn't a problem but lining up my aim to an enemy became a bit hard to do.\n\nEnemy variety is basically two types of enemies (the melee ones and the ranged ones), I feel like it's a wasted opportunity to add some more enemies to the game and perhaps even add some boss fights to mix things up a little. Since there is only one path to the story there is no side questing to be done and that's something I'd have enjoyed. You do have Stealth sections that require you to move without being detected but it feels a bit easy and doesn't bring much to the game overall.\n\nArt style is really great, I do like the cutscenes but wish they had some voice acting to go with them as they feel would benefit from the dialogue of a narrator at least. Video options are pretty limited, you have Very Low, Low, Medium, High and Very High to select from so it would be nice if they allowed more settings there to pick from (especially resolution options).\n\nLength of the game is not great, I managed to finish in 2.7 hours and that's doing 27/31 achievements with a couple of the collection achievements being missed it might have taken me over 3 hours in total and I wasn't speeding or anything. It's apparently a 6-8 hour game to do everything according to the devs but I have to question that with what I played.\n\nWould I say yes to the game? It depends, if you're someone that enjoys a casual little hack and slash adventure then it might be the game for you but at the price I feel maybe it's too much for what you're getting. Perhaps a DLC or sequel might be able to fix some of the problems I felt were lacking.","September 10, 2015","false","3.4"," 33 of 54 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","33","54","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lothy/recommended/384000/","lothy","Lothy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lothy/","1455 products in account","Cross of the Dutchman is an action RPG based on the “true story of the folk legend” of Pier Gerlofs Donia. Is it historically accurate? I don’t know. Does it follow the legend? I also don’t know, I had not really heard of the tale until I played the game. I do know, however, that the game is rather short. And it couldn’t be otherwise, for as it follows the story of Pier, it has a clear beginning and clear end.\n\nThe game has the looks of a rather typical RPG, but it lacks all the extra customization of one. Even comparing it to rather linear games, this one is particularly so. It was clearly geared to tell a somewhat interactive story more than it was to be a full on game. The maps are average, the quests are not atypical of RPGs, even if they do follow the story, and there’s nothing overly challenging in it (except maybe when it lagged on me during mob areas). Was it fun to play? Yes, but it had nothing to make it stand out except that it’s based on that story… There are no skill trees, though you purchase ‘upgrades’ for your skills and switch between them, there are upgrades for health and such, but little else worth mentioning.\n\nThe graphics are simple but nice. I wasn’t particularly fond of most of the cartoony art style (though I did like the general art), but it wasn’t bad either, and effort was clearly put into it to portray it as accurately to the time and area as possible. The music and sounds were pleasing enough, and overall the game ran fairly nicely; the only time I encountered problems being during a couple sections in which there were too many enemies and it lagged some on my computer.\nControls are simple (mostly you’ll only be using the mouse), but I found the obstacle-avoidance a bit sketchy. Combat (which is quite basic skill-spamming) was a bit clunky as well, because it’s difficult to aim your hits properly and often times you’d end up hitting air repeatedly. Cross also had some slightly interesting stealth-like areas (though the game doesn’t offer an actual stealth engine); it wasn’t too hard to get through them (but it was annoying to get caught) and made for a bit of a variation, which was rather nice. Just don’t expect it’ll be full on take-cover type of stealth.\n\nThe story itself was good, though as I mentioned before I can’t really compare it with the real story/folk legend. The dialogue was rather poor, however, sometimes I felt like it was trying too hard to be funny.\n\nAll in all Cross of Dutchman is a nice, simple game. It was easy to grab, play for a bit up to another checkpoint, and then go do something else, so I think it’s a good game for casual players as well as for those who will want to sit through all 4ish hours of gameplay in one go. However, it doesn’t go beyond average, and I don’t think it’ll be satisfactory for people who don’t care about the story, which is the strongest point of the game.\n\nRecommended: Yes, but I wouldn’t expect too much out of it.\n\n* View more reviews at Wala Wala Games[walawalagames.com]","November 11, 2015","true","3.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I just read some reviews. Had no idea this was a true story. You'd never know that through the game's story telling. Also, I'm calling the game an ARPG bc there's Action and Hack n Slash with character development. You buy your level ups. Sounds like an ARPG to me.\n\nWhen I saw this game in the store I was very eager to play it. It has an art style I like, ARPG's are a personal favorite of mine, and controller compatible. Unfortunately, bad game design has turned what should have been a great game into something that is marginally playable. My advice would be to stay away.\n\nStory telling through gameplay.  This is a fundamental of game design. Esp ARPG's. Cross of the Dutchman has mountains of dialogue. So much so, you'll spend more time reading poorly written dialogue than playing the game. There is no story telling by gameplay. If you skip all the dialogue you won't know what's going on or what to do next many times.\n\nCharacter Customization It's fine by me that your character has no customization, but loot is really where this game fails. Loot drops are what makes ARPG's great. There is no loot in this game. As a matter of fact, this guy uses his bare hands to kill soldiers. He's constantly looking for a weapon, but no one has any to spare. READ: Even your in-game character wants loot!\n\nPoor Level design This game has you going over the same maps multiple times. When you go into a new map region parts will be blocked off. You'll have to come to the blocked off parts later in the story so be prepared to traverse every region 5 or 6 times. BUT there's more! There are barrels and boxes you can break to get coins (bc tropes are real people!). You go over the region and try to hunt down all the breakables for coinage. The next time you arrive in that region, all the barrels are there again. However, the ones you broke previously have no coins in them. So you have to go over a region 5 or 6 times as small pieces of that region unlock through story told only in dialogue and there is no way to know which barrels are full of moneys and which ones are not. Other than having eidetic memory, you're just boned.\n\nIt's for these reasons I do not recommend this game.","January 10","false","1.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The combat is very basic and has no depth to it whatsoever, and the RPG elements are few and far between. You spend a lot of time walking in the game more then anything else, and it doesn't help that stealth sections will pop up that feel out of place. The artwork is alright and is probably the strongest element of the game, but for a tale based on the legend of 'Pier Gerlofs Dania', it doesn't do a good job of translating that into a fun experience.

The setting of Cross of the Dutchman is incredibly amazing and the art style perfectly supplements it. The simplistic art style is really awesome, but Cross of the Dutchman isn’t without fault. There is nothing that would make me not recommend the game, but just a few things that would greatly improve this game. During the cutscenes you are forced to read the dialogues, but I think that if triangle studios would add a narrator to the cutscenes. Another thing that I noticed while playing was the combat is a bit clunky at times, but the more I played the more I got used to it. I was able to get used to the combat. The only other thing that I criticize about Cross of the Dutchman is that it is short, but again it’s not overpriced for the length of the game. (I would just have liked to play more of the game) With all of that being said I would highly recommend picking Cross of the Dutchman up based upon the setting and the neat art style.\n\n-HiPFiRED\n\nPros\nBased upon legend (Incredibly interesting story)\nMemorable moments\nUpgradeable stats\nNeat art style\n\n\nCons\nClunky combat at times\nShort\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\n","September 10, 2015","true","6.7"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","15","27","2","0"

The story takes place in medieval Western Europe, in the province of Frisia, near the turn of the 16th century."\n\nStory\n\nThe story itself is good, and I really like the fact that it follows a little piece of history of someone who  became legend, and it's great you get to see from this stylised perspective some of the things he did and achieved. What they say is actually correct, at least from what I already know of it. If I could ever teach history I would want it this way! It's a lot more interactive compared to just being told, since you follow the character and you do something you enjoy which is playing a game. It's not heavy on the detail but it's accurate and gives you enough to enjoy it.\n\nObviously things are exaggerated for game purposes. But that just makes it more entertaining than just getting it from a book – and it may make you interested enough to look up the full history for yourself!\n\nThe story (as told like this) follows the tale of a very manly farmer with a very loud and manly voice whose farm is attacked by some very nasty Saxons who just don't leave him in peace, when all he wants to do is work on his farm and live a simple life. I would tell more about the story but I don't want to spoil the adventure you'll be embarking on. But you probably get the impression that Pier is very manly. You will be impressed by it.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe graphics are cartoonist and polished, making it more interesting to play following this distinctive art style. It doesn't lag for me, the gameplay is smooth and responsive, and it all works well with the atmosphere of the game, the feel of medieval style Holland and how Pier interacts with his environment and his enemies. There is not a great deal of variation in the visuals (Like the grass and trees and roads) but it's not needed for this game. Also, Pier is very manly in the way he punches and kicks and destroys containers.\n\nControls\n\nEverything's with the mouse, and you can basically do everything in the game like this, you don't need to use a keyboard. I didn't try out to see if the keyboard was viable since the mouse is enough to get you where you want. You can mis-click if there's a barrel next to a person or if you're trying to reach a obscured area. Sometimes you will also start punching or hacking in a random direction against an enemy  when they start swarming you, but that's probably because you're clicking like crazy, and because Pier likes to finish off his manly moves before changing direction.\n\nSound\n\nThe sound is great, it fits in with the scene you're playing, like: Pier's farm, when and you're fighting, where you're sneaking, and what you're doing. Pier also has very manly shouts which makes you want to break open all the barrels and chests just so you can hear it. And kill all the enemies even on timed missions.\n\nOverall\n\nI really liked this game, I was excited to start playing it and I wasn't disappointed by what I experienced. The sound and graphics and story makes this a great game to learn history from Friesland. It's an amazing experience that went to game. It's great that it can be accurate without getting boring!\n\nIn fact one of the only things that bothered me was the re-spawning of the chests and barrels, because the re-spawned ones don't have any loot, and if I missed one I would have no way of knowing short of staying in the scene and kicking everything open again. But that's ok. Pier is very manly. AND YOU CAN KEEP SMASHING BARRELS AS MUCH AS YOU WANT. RARGH!\n\nSmall conclusion\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough. Its full of learning material, with a cool story, good gameplay and amazing music. It’s an overall good experience, and truelly amazing to have.\n\n9.5/10(Why 9.5/10? I wish for a fries voice actor- to tell part of the story to get fully involved in)\n","September 17, 2015","true","2.0"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aldershot/recommended/384000/","aldershot","[F!] Aldershot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aldershot/","2454 products in account","Cross of the Dutchman is an isometric adventurer that features a story based off of the real life figure of Pier Gerlofs Donia, a Dutch historical hero. The game is played in an isometric view where you'll be running around completing tasks as you explore the world and help save the people who you love.\n\nCross of the Dutchman is a pretty simple game mechanically. Combat only has 2 buttons. A basic swing, and a special attack that takes stamina to use. Upgrading is just as simple, with only health or stamina to increase, and you'll also be given the opportunity to purchase new special attacks as well. The basic swing is faster but weaker, but the special attack not only is stronger, but can send multiple enemies around you flying into the air, which is pretty satisfying. Out side of combat the game is pretty linear in it's structure. Though the world may look expansive on first impressions, many areas are gated off until the game want you to reach said area. There are also stealth segments sprinkled in between to add some variety.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLpKWqCfkKU\nCross of the Dutchman is a game that looks promising judging from trailers and screenshots, but after finishing the game in about three hours, the game shows a lot of flaws. As mentioned above the combat is very simple. This would be fine, except for the fact that it also feels sluggish, and it's the main activity besides running around. Since that's the case, it needed to be polished, it needed depth, but has none of the two. At no time did I ever switch to another special attack, or switch from sword to fist. Once I attained the sword and a special attack I liked it was all I used for the entire game. The adventuring in Cross of the Dutchman is also lacking. It being linear isn't an issue to me, but it demanding that I retread the same grounds three, four, or even five times over is ridiculous. There is a lot of running around in this game, A LOT of it. The game tries to break the monotony of either fighting or running with some stealth segments, but unfortunately the stealth is probably the poorest aspect of the game. It makes no sense why I can take on tens of soldiers at once one minute, then the next, I'm sneaking around just a couple of soldiers armed with lanterns! It makes no sense in the context of the mechanics, or the story, and is an obvious attempt at breaking up the flow in the game (which admittedly, does desperately need).\n\nThe game's also short, clocking in at three hours on my first play through, with a story that disappointed me. It's not that the story or characters are necessarily bad, it just wasn't memorable for me. Maybe because I'm Canadian and not Dutch, so I don't feel that historical connection, but there were no part of the game where I felt any emotions, or care for the characters.... except at the end. With out spoilers, the ending of the game was abrupt and felt cut off. The game's narrative finally reaches a point where something interesting happens. Where emotions and character development finally start to take place, then ROLL THE CREDITS! WUT?! Again, I don't want to spoil anything, but the game's ending feels more like the story only just started.\n\nSo I've mentioned a ton of things I took issues with, is there anything redeeming about Cross of the Dutchman? Though I've mentioned that I didn't like the combat much, the sense of impact when you hit an enemy, or especially when you use a special attack is really satisfying. Seeing a half dozen men go flying in the air, with some pretty good rag dolling and physics attached is actually pretty fun to see. The game also features some pretty good visual and audio design as well. The cut scenes are done in a still illustration format, but the illustrations are quite nice with a digital comic book look to them. The in game graphics, though low-poly, is quite charming, with colorful environments and characters, some nice particle and lighting effects, complimented with some pretty decent music. The game was also stable and optimized well for me. It never crashed nor did I encounter any major bugs, with it running at over 60 FPS the entire time.\n\nOverall Cross of the Dutchman was a disappointment to me, as I am a fan of Triangle Studio's other game "It came from space, and ate our brains".

You are a farmer whose village is under attack by Saxon soldiers, who serve as cannon fodder for your fists/sword. The plot is fairly bare bones, and about 15 minutes of my time in the first hour was spent finding boxes to smash for coins.\n\nThere's also a stealth segment in the first hour, which was mercifully very short and simple. I hope they don't make that a regular thing. There are only checkpoint saves, whereas I would have preferred the ability to save anywhere.\n\nThe combat is fairly simple with only 2 inputs: Left Click (normal attack) and Right Click (Special attack). You can buy alternate special attack, health upgrades etc are certain points in the game. However, large groups of enemies can stun lock you which makes it near impossible to get out of a bad situation, which is a significant drawback here.\n\nThis is one of the cases where my review would be a sideways thumb, but since Steam doesn't allow that I'll say: get this game if you're looking for a simple brawler with a light story.\n\nNOTE:\n(a) The screenshots on the store page made me think this was an action RPG like Torchlight, which it is not. However, that is not necessarily a bad thing, just different.\n\n(b) I recieved a key from the developer for review purposes.\n\n(c) I'll update this review as I keep playing.

The story takes place in medieval Western Europe, in the province of Frisia, near the turn of the 16th century."\n\nStory\n\nThe story itself is good, and I really like the fact that it follows a little piece of history of someone who  became legend, and it's great you get to see from this stylised perspective some of the things he did and achieved. What they say is actually correct, at least from what I already know of it. If I could ever teach history I would want it this way! It's a lot more interactive compared to just being told, since you follow the character and you do something you enjoy which is playing a game. It's not heavy on the detail but it's accurate and gives you enough to enjoy it.\n\nObviously things are exaggerated for game purposes. But that just makes it more entertaining than just getting it from a book – and it may make you interested enough to look up the full history for yourself!\n\nThe story (as told like this) follows the tale of a very manly farmer with a very loud and manly voice whose farm is attacked by some very nasty Saxons who just don't leave him in peace, when all he wants to do is work on his farm and live a simple life. I would tell more about the story but I don't want to spoil the adventure you'll be embarking on. But you probably get the impression that Pier is very manly. You will be impressed by it.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe graphics are cartoonist and polished, making it more interesting to play following this distinctive art style. It doesn't lag for me, the gameplay is smooth and responsive, and it all works well with the atmosphere of the game, the feel of medieval style Holland and how Pier interacts with his environment and his enemies. There is not a great deal of variation in the visuals (Like the grass and trees and roads) but it's not needed for this game. Also, Pier is very manly in the way he punches and kicks and destroys containers.\n\nControls\n\nEverything's with the mouse, and you can basically do everything in the game like this, you don't need to use a keyboard. I didn't try out to see if the keyboard was viable since the mouse is enough to get you where you want. You can mis-click if there's a barrel next to a person or if you're trying to reach a obscured area. Sometimes you will also start punching or hacking in a random direction against an enemy  when they start swarming you, but that's probably because you're clicking like crazy, and because Pier likes to finish off his manly moves before changing direction.\n\nSound\n\nThe sound is great, it fits in with the scene you're playing, like: Pier's farm, when and you're fighting, where you're sneaking, and what you're doing. Pier also has very manly shouts which makes you want to break open all the barrels and chests just so you can hear it. And kill all the enemies even on timed missions.\n\nOverall\n\nI really liked this game, I was excited to start playing it and I wasn't disappointed by what I experienced. The sound and graphics and story makes this a great game to learn history from Friesland. It's an amazing experience that went to game. It's great that it can be accurate without getting boring!\n\nIn fact one of the only things that bothered me was the re-spawning of the chests and barrels, because the re-spawned ones don't have any loot, and if I missed one I would have no way of knowing short of staying in the scene and kicking everything open again. But that's ok. Pier is very manly. AND YOU CAN KEEP SMASHING BARRELS AS MUCH AS YOU WANT. RARGH!\n\nSmall conclusion\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough. Its full of learning material, with a cool story, good gameplay and amazing music. It’s an overall good experience, and truelly amazing to have.\n\n9.5/10(Why 9.5/10? I wish for a fries voice actor- to tell part of the story to get fully involved in)\n","September 17, 2015","true","2.0"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/plezmo/recommended/384000/","plezmo","Plezmo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/plezmo/","1036 products in account","I preordered this game , lured by the promise of an action adventure rpg with delightful graphics and based on historical events.\n\nNOTE: Some of the points in this review are based on my expirience playing with a XBOX 360 controller\n\nIn reality however , the game just did not deliver. Firstly the combat is borderline passable, had it been a little worse , I would have categorized it as awful. You have one fast attack -bound to the A button on a standard 360 controller , which is ok I guess if X which is usually bound for attack wasnt bound to draw/holster sword. And then you have your heavy/special attack that uses stamina. Thats it. No block , no dodge , no roll or anything of that kind. I get that Pier is supposed to be this huge muscly Dutchman , but making him able to roll away from incoming blade and arrow attacks wouldn't have made him less believable. Would have made the otherwise sluggish combat much more dynamic too.\n\nThen you have the game world. "Small" pretty much sums it up. Oh , dont worry tho , it wont feel as small as it is , because you will revisit every location 10000 times. Walking. At the pace of a turtle with late stages of arthritis. Yep , no sprint button as well. Pier is waaay too manly to move faster than "I sort of need to pee , but don't want anyone to notice " speed.  And while we are on the topic of movement speed the totally unnecessary stealth segments limit your speed even further. When I say stealth I mean this in the loosest sense possible.\n\nUpgrades are almost non existent , you only have 2 stamina and 2 health upgrades , and 6 total special attacks WHICH YOU CANT BUY PAST CHAPTER 7!!! Thanks game , I finally have enough gold to buy the strongest attacks and all of a sudden all the merchants die or disappear.\n\nLength wise the game is pretty short , maybe 3 hours or so. Its not really even long enough to drop all of its cards , so Im alt+tabbing it atm to get my cards. This is not necessairly a bad thing, it would have become really frustrating had it been more than 5 hours long with the same amount of content. Replayability is non existent , as achievements are pretty easy to get and you cant really play it any differently than your original playtrough (well maybe you could buy stronger attacks before chapter 8 or something)\n\nMandatory pros / ways to make the game better list : Music is really nice and fitting. Art style is ok too and was one of the reasons I preordered. Story is ok , although it lacks some depth , maybe throw in some dialog options in and some characters may die in different scenarios. Combat would have been a lot better with a roll or block mechanic. Bigger map would have been nice, maybe put in a mountain/snowy area where Pier could save on of his kids from wolves. Being able to spring outside of combat would have been nice.\n\n\nTL;DR: Game has potential but needs some serious tweaking.","September 27, 2015","false","4.8"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","6","12","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aldershot/recommended/384000/","aldershot","[F!] Aldershot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aldershot/","2454 products in account","Cross of the Dutchman is an isometric adventurer that features a story based off of the real life figure of Pier Gerlofs Donia, a Dutch historical hero. The game is played in an isometric view where you'll be running around completing tasks as you explore the world and help save the people who you love.\n\nCross of the Dutchman is a pretty simple game mechanically. Combat only has 2 buttons. A basic swing, and a special attack that takes stamina to use. Upgrading is just as simple, with only health or stamina to increase, and you'll also be given the opportunity to purchase new special attacks as well. The basic swing is faster but weaker, but the special attack not only is stronger, but can send multiple enemies around you flying into the air, which is pretty satisfying. Out side of combat the game is pretty linear in it's structure. Though the world may look expansive on first impressions, many areas are gated off until the game want you to reach said area. There are also stealth segments sprinkled in between to add some variety.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLpKWqCfkKU\nCross of the Dutchman is a game that looks promising judging from trailers and screenshots, but after finishing the game in about three hours, the game shows a lot of flaws. As mentioned above the combat is very simple. This would be fine, except for the fact that it also feels sluggish, and it's the main activity besides running around. Since that's the case, it needed to be polished, it needed depth, but has none of the two. At no time did I ever switch to another special attack, or switch from sword to fist. Once I attained the sword and a special attack I liked it was all I used for the entire game. The adventuring in Cross of the Dutchman is also lacking. It being linear isn't an issue to me, but it demanding that I retread the same grounds three, four, or even five times over is ridiculous. There is a lot of running around in this game, A LOT of it. The game tries to break the monotony of either fighting or running with some stealth segments, but unfortunately the stealth is probably the poorest aspect of the game. It makes no sense why I can take on tens of soldiers at once one minute, then the next, I'm sneaking around just a couple of soldiers armed with lanterns! It makes no sense in the context of the mechanics, or the story, and is an obvious attempt at breaking up the flow in the game (which admittedly, does desperately need).\n\nThe game's also short, clocking in at three hours on my first play through, with a story that disappointed me. It's not that the story or characters are necessarily bad, it just wasn't memorable for me. Maybe because I'm Canadian and not Dutch, so I don't feel that historical connection, but there were no part of the game where I felt any emotions, or care for the characters.... except at the end. With out spoilers, the ending of the game was abrupt and felt cut off. The game's narrative finally reaches a point where something interesting happens. Where emotions and character development finally start to take place, then ROLL THE CREDITS! WUT?! Again, I don't want to spoil anything, but the game's ending feels more like the story only just started.\n\nSo I've mentioned a ton of things I took issues with, is there anything redeeming about Cross of the Dutchman? Though I've mentioned that I didn't like the combat much, the sense of impact when you hit an enemy, or especially when you use a special attack is really satisfying. Seeing a half dozen men go flying in the air, with some pretty good rag dolling and physics attached is actually pretty fun to see. The game also features some pretty good visual and audio design as well. The cut scenes are done in a still illustration format, but the illustrations are quite nice with a digital comic book look to them. The in game graphics, though low-poly, is quite charming, with colorful environments and characters, some nice particle and lighting effects, complimented with some pretty decent music. The game was also stable and optimized well for me. It never crashed nor did I encounter any major bugs, with it running at over 60 FPS the entire time.\n\nOverall Cross of the Dutchman was a disappointment to me, as I am a fan of Triangle Studio's other game "It came from space, and ate our brains". From the screenshots, trailers, and based off of their previous work, I had high hopes for this game. Ultimately it lacks variety, depth, and it's further mired by an abrupt ending to it's story.\n\nPros:\n- Visual and audio are charming\n- Great sense of visual and audio impact as you hit enemies\n- Cool style to it's illustrative cut scenes\n\nCons:\n- no replay value\n- Basic and sluggish combat\n- Poor stealth mechanics\n- Too much running\n- Abrupt ending to the story","September 10, 2015","false","4.8"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"

However it is very very short and gameplay is very simplistic. They had some great ideas like coins that you can spend on different skills and upgrades but there isn't enough time to test all of these before game is over and so it ends pretty flat. If the game was longer and there were a lot of very different skills you could have at once I would definitely be interested.\n\nI did love graphics, plot and cutscenes  however  towards the end I expected what was going to happen and game ended in a rush.\n\nHOWEVER!\nIf you can find this game on sale and you want little game for small price this is definitely an option. If you like graphics & story more than actual gameplay then this is also definitely an option.\n\nHowever at 9€ there is no way in my mind that this game is worth that money (there are much longer games with a lot better gameplay for that money).\n\nEDIT:\nMinor fixes and I totally forgot cutscenes.\n\nResponse to dev\nOriginally posted by Robert - Triangle Studios:Hi meloncat,\n\nSorry to see that you didn't particularly like the game that much! However, I do appreciate it that you leave a review! Thanks for the compliment on the graphics, I've told our artist that you liked them!\n\n\nI don't think game itself was bad. I just don't think I can personally recommend it at this point.\n\nIf the game was longer and had better gameplay I would definitely recommend the game. For example  for half of the game I used normal & super punch and then for the other half I used normal & super sword attack.\n\nI know we have come to this point where customers can really demand but personally for 3 hourish of entertainment with simple gameplay 9€ falls a bit short. Its definitely not a game I hate but a game I hope will one day become great. If you could extend the game I am sure you could ask much more money and gain more audience.\n\nAlso for the future it's maybe better to concentrate on one thing (combat) rather than trying to get both stealth and combat to function flawlessly. I know that making solid stealth requires enourmous amounts of work (I tried that out and it's not easy).","April 22","false","2.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

Interesting stories that are not Fantasy, Sci Fi or take place in the US. Cross of the Dutchman COULD have been that. A story about strife with a European medieval hero.\n\nInstead we got not even a generic ARPG, we got THIS...Let me tell you what Cross of the Dutchman "features":\n\n- An overworld map, a small one, but large enough to be annoying, since you'll be revisiting the same areas over and over again getting from point A to B back to A\n- Clunky animations, seriously, nothing in this game is well animated\n- Oversaturated colours (personal annoyance)\n- A hideous combat system that consists of mashing A on your controller and occasionally tapping B for your special attack, which either destroys whole swathes of enemies or just hits 1\n- A very bland and foreseeable story\n- Shallow characters\n- A crappy and arbitrary stealth system\n- Lots of crates to break, which will respawn, but not contain any more gold\n- A boring upgrade system\n\nAlright, so the story is about a revolution, it's depicted in boring stills without any voice acting. The game lacks that completely. In the end the story was so boring and forgettable I half-skipped all the dialogue. It's cringy and feels like a 10 year old wrote it. Very generic. So, basically you run around the map from one quest point to the next, building your little revolution. Of course you ALWAYS have to take detours, because the direct route is mysteriously blocked. You're smashing crates for gold, which is fine. What is not fine is those same crates respawning after you've already smashed them, because they contain no more gold. You need that gold to purchase upgrades like +health and stamina as well as special attacks. To be honest, the former are mandatory upgrades, the latter are unimportant, your basic ability is more than enough.\n\nBetween running around, smashing crates and reading boring dialogue you have to fight HORDES of enemies at times. They swarm you really easily. As I said the combat consists of mashing auto attack, which executes a 3 hit combo if you want to. Press B whenever your stamina is full to unleas a potentially devastating attack...or miss completely. Seriously the same attack patterns netted me either a whole bunch of enemies or just 1. The combat could not be any less challenging. There is no dodging, no blocking, no positioning, archers will just stand there and shoot you point blank, you can't avoid attacks and sometimes your attacks simply miss the target. This isn't helped by the fact, that you're going to be spending more than half of the game without a WEAPON. Yes, this is an ARPG and you do not have a damn weapon. You only get that later on, when the game is almost over and frankly the only thing that changes is that your attacks have a bit of an AOE effect.\n\nThe last bit is the stealth part. Luckily this only happens twice in the game...the first time it's even believable, the second time is just arbitrary frustration (the only part of the game where I repeatedly failed). You have to dodge soldiers at night who carry lintels. Whether they can see you or not seems to be entirely up to chance. Sometimes I was walking right in front of them or beside them, other times I was spotted 10 meters away. Very annoying, since there is no manual saving and the checkpoints can be a ♥♥♥♥♥ at times. The second stealth sequence is so pointless, since you're killing everything in your way until suddenly you have to avoid any enemies, only to be killing them again a few meters later. Makes no bloody sense.\n\nI don't know why people rate this game so highly, it's got NOTHING. It's (thankfully) only 2 hours of your time or less, if you happen to not die. What you could have done here is a story about a farmer who leads a revolution and loses everything in the process, a depiction of a righteous man going down a dark path, a "hero" organising a revolution. This is a short story and a badly executed one at that, with forgettable characters and an ending that was entirely foreseeable. Just, I don't know, I got it for a very low price, but even for that I feel cheated. Steer clear imho.","April 19","false","2.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","2"

Click Comment to See Non-Broken Version -cough- Game Given By Dev For Review -cough-\n\nAnother Day	Another BSOD while I write Review	Name:\nDeveloper:\nGenre:\nOfficial Website:	Cross of The Dutchman\nTriangle Studio\nAction Adventure\nhttp://www.crossofthedutchman.com/	What so crossy about said Dutchman?	Alright so the dutchman is cross because he's a big guy. Anyways this is a narrative based game where the gameplay takes a big step back there in order to showcase a real world story loosely based on the farmer turned freedom fighter/pirates [up for interpretation] Pier Gerlof Donia.\n\nIn this game you control Pier in a topdown view as you witness his descend from happy farmer with a family into the person that will define him in the legends.\n\nArtistic license applied liberally. On to the drawing board.	Graphics	Cartoonish style, this isnt to say the game is bad looking however but it is quite serviceable. Although at times you will get stuck behind a piece of scenery.\n\nAll the more time to enjoy the graphics i suppose as you try to unstuck yourself.	Sound	Period wise, it fits right in. A shame that the main battle music only got used towards nearly the very end.	Performance/Option Menu	60 smooth fps. Although during the big group fight the framerate will froze for a short time if you use AOE attack.\n\nAs for option menu, you get a sparse but adequate options like Res, sounds, and preset graphics setting. No advance settings I'm afraid but it is not a graphical extensive game to begin with.	Gameplay	You control Pier in a top down view as you click or drag the mouse to control his movement performing many task. Gameplay wise it is a bit sparse with most missions requiring back track to talk to people and fights occuring almost every step of the way.\n\nFor fight you simply left click to attack and right click to attack with the specials. You gain money from breaking crates and opening chests to purchase health upgrades and stamina upgrades which is needed for the specials but otherwised money is a bit pointless.\n\nSpeaking of fighting, you usually just swing your sword around and retreat if you get a low heath issue before spamming the special attack to eliminate enemies quicker than you losing health. For most part you just want to plow through the fights to get to the story sections.\n\nThere is also the obligatory stealth mission guarantees to infuriate you since it restart from the beginning if you fail and you cannot be detected at all, thankfully the sections are short.	Conclusion	I accidentally deleted my review twice while doing a review for this game and each time has made me decide even stronger on Cross of The Dutchman.\n\nThat is the story section is alright and the gameplay is serviceable even if it lacks variety and pretty bare at time. If I could give this game a neutral one I would have done so but I can't therefor I would recommend people to get it for the interesting story that will make you say "huh interesting" but not expected to be wow by the gameplay. Therefor, C+\n\nScoring Methology:\n-	S-Rank: excellent\n-	A-Rank: very good\n-	B-Rank: solid\n-	C-Rank: satisfactory\n-	D-Rank: inferior\n\nVerdict: C+\n\nNote: The story is quite short but at least it ends correctly. After all since the gameplay doesnt carry much any longer and you are liable to hit your head in frustration.	 EXTRA EXTRA 	If you gonna get the game might as well just go for the deluxe edition since it comes with a nifty artbook and a nice papercraft of Pier.\n\nAlso press shift when attacking so Pier doesnt run away instead of attacking. Happens often.\n\nJust buy health, stamina at default is fine anyways.\n\n(:^\nNo drama, Just Reviews","September 10, 2015","true","2.7"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","12","25","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/recommended/384000/","TheIronicGamer","TheIronicGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/","1545 products in account","Cross of the Dutchman is an RPG about a true story but it unfortunately fell way short of my expectations. The game features a terribly lackluster combat system and is only carried forward by having a gripping story.\n\nThis combat system is one of the most boring I have ever seen in a game. You have 2 buttons to press. Left and right mouse button. Left does a standard attack and right does a power attack. The power attack can only be used when your stamina bar is charged to max. Apart from gaining a sword instead of your fist the combat doesn't change dramatically throughout the entire game. It basically consists of click, click, click, click, power attack, click click... and so on. No kind of innovation in that whatsoever.\n\nThere are a few things you can upgrade to make your combat slightly better. You basically have 3 upgrades that you can buy for both your fists and your sword. They each increase stamina, damage and range differently. They also give your attack a slightly different asthetic attack to it which I was unsure whether that actually made a difference. One problem I came across with this system is that it seems only your most recently purchased upgrade shows the asthetic animation. Which was annoying because the first upgrade I bought for my fist was the most expensive one. So I lost this after buying the previous upgrades later on. You can also buy a few health upgrades and stamina upgrades. These are the only purchasables and isn't enough to improve the combat system.\n\nDutchmans enemy variety doesn't help it either. Basicaly there are only 2 different enemies. These are an archer and a soldier. There are varients of each of these with differing amounts of armour. Though only have these 2 different enemies to fight gets boring really fast.\n\nWhat would be nice for them to do with the combat system is to have combos. This instantly makes a games combat way more fun. It makes it actually require a bit of skill. Constant spam clicking isn't fun by anyones opinion I wouldn't have thought.\n\nWhat about gameplay? Is there any other types of gameplay instead of combat? Well there is one other. You also have a stealth mode which happens a few times throughout the game. This involves you trying to avoid patrolling enemies and hide from them. They have lamps so you can clearly see the zone you have to stay out of. This adds a bit to the gameplay to get away from the boring combat.\n\nThe thing is though is the way in the which the game includes these different activities is just in a cycle. The basic cycle of the game is this: Go to an area to an area to fight an enemy, get ambushed, fight the enemies in the area you was going to, go to another area, get ambushed, fight enemies, sleep, do stealth mission in dark... repeat. Not much variety there. The biggest problem is that the areas you have to go to always seem to be the other side of the map to you.\n\nSo what exactly is it that redeems this game from a negative review into a positive? Well the only thing really is the story. Cross of the Dutchman is said to be based on a true story. It follows the story of a land where the towns are being taken over by saxons and they are putting horrible taxes and such on the people. They won't stand for this and the main character, Pier, decides to start a revolution to stop this. This is the basics of the story but within it there is a lot of twists and sadness. Each of the characters works together to build of the story and each of them have their own unique personality.\n\nIn itself this story might seem rather basic. What I really like about the story is the cutscenes. After an event instead of telling the rest of the story through dialog they use cutscenes. The beauty of this is how amazingly they are styled. I love it! A fantastic soundtrack plays in the background of these cutscenes.\n\nThe only other thing that impressed me with the game is the graphics. I do really love the cartoony style of the game. Everything seems to follow this art style and nothing is missed out from it.\n\nAlthough I loved the story I had a bit of an issue with it. The ending seemed very abrupt. Just when I was getting into the story it just seemed to kind of end. The story is resolved a little in a custcene after it and then it just ends. I was literally sitting there at the end staring at the credits like "Is that it?". It only took me just over 3 hours to complete as well. I definitely expected a longer game that that.\n\nI also had a few other small bugs. A few times I got stuck in areas. Most of the times it just took a bit of a wiggle of the mouse or attacking of the sword to get out. But once it required me to restart the game. These aren't common so it shouldn't be a big deal. The other problem I had was with chests. Chests are went to know when you've already opened them and not let you open the same chest again. However on one of the times booting up the game I noticed the game had forgotton this. So I found I could open all the chests i've already opened again. Effectively this made it so I could double my money.\n\nHonestly I was very dissapointed with this release. The only thing that keeps me recommending the game instead of putting it as a negative seems to be a story. If only they could have put as much effort into the combat and actual gameplay as they did with that story then it would have been a great release. I would say the price point is quite reasonable though. £5.99 isn't too expensive.\n\nTheIronicGamers rating system\nDon't ever buy this game.\nMaybe consider it on a sale.\nAn average game.\nA good game that should definitely be considered.\nA must play!\nDisclaimer: I was provided a free review key by the developer to make this review.","September 10, 2015","true","4.3"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","0"

To keep this review short and sweet Cross of the Dutchman was a ton of fun to play. There is something extremely charming about this game. I can't quite put my finger on it. Maybe it's the adorable art style coupled with the perfect music with a complete and interesting story of a badass dutchman. The open world is awesome and well designed I love walking into a village and seeing all the NPCs roaming about doing their own thing it's adorable. There are several weapon and character upgrades in the game Heath, stamina, fist and sword combat. The story is well paced and well told. Art style and music are my favorites followed by the combat. All in all a great game for 9 bucks defiantly worth it. I've beat it twice and I'm still going to buy it just to show some love to Triangle Studios for making a fun game <3.

And its main problem it that by focusing on the story and making sure it’s told the way the devs wanted to tell it, it sacrifices gameplay and player choice. While playing this I always felt guided, as I was playing an on-rail shooter. I always had a map marker to go to in order to advance the story and no other variations. There are also a few invisible walls, which I always hate. The gameplay is very repetitive and what variations come seem tacked on - there is a stealth section in between to fighting sequences that literally makes no sense, punishing the player for getting seen even if you really know you could take the enemies on.\n\nThis, combined with the fact that the game is pretty easy, puts the whole game duration at around 3 hours.\nI recommend you to buy it for kids or if you’re interested in dutch folk tales.As people said before, it's not a bad game, If it was possible I would give it a "Neutral" recomendation, but as it is, there are way better options on Steam.\nYou can see me playing it here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6sf0IMwhA","September 11, 2015","false","3.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Pier is a hulk of a man, but happily assumes the role of a gentle farmer and family man.\n\nUnless you set foot on his land. Then he'll punch you and nobody will ever see you again.\n\nIn Cross of the dutchman you control Pier as he gets deeply enmeshed in the conflict between his people (the residents of 16th century Fresia) and Saxon invaders because he wants some fish for dinner. After whalloping some guards into what must be a near comatose state, the angered saxons attack the farm belonging to Jon, one of Pier's neighbors and steal Jon's wife.\n\nThis leads to one of the first stealth segments, but not the last, as you have to get Jon's wife back. Then you just have to fight the guards you had to sneak past, making the entire exercise pointless.\n\nStealth segments aside, the dialogue, both written and spoken is interesting ,or well acted and the art direction of the game is colorful with bold lines and I enjoyed it. I feel that the cutscenes could do with some narration and submitted that to the developers, so I hope that is addressed.\n\nOverall, the game is a bit short (About six hours) and ends very abruptly but is a fun play, and a refreshing look back at old punch 'em ups.

A cool thing the developers did with this game was releasing an early version to schools as a means of teaching some history. The game is partially based on a book.\n\nThe game itself is a bit shorter than I expected, but the story is great, and the combat is really well-done. There's something fun about just slamming down five enemies at a time. The development in the main character as part of the story is also pretty cool, which makes the game feel much longer than it actually is. In summary, if you're looking for something short and satisifying, this is worth it.\n\nBonus points: you can play in Frysian, and it runs well on linux!\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I know someone on the development team, so I might be a bit biased.","September 12, 2015","true","3.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The art style is interesting and the story is pretty interesting too.\nIt has some small problems, but they are really small and do not affect gameplay.\nThe one thing I have a problem with is that you need to walk pretty far without anything really happening.\n\nFighting feels good and powerful, even with your fists.\nHit detection is sometimes a bit awkward and sometimes your character doesnt attack for a moment, breaking the flow of punches.\n\nThere is no clutter, no unnecessary collectibles and no sidequests, only the main story.\nCharacters and enemies (if they are speaking to you) have some personality to them.\nI would love to see voice acting, it would add a lot to the experience.\n\nA good thumbs-up.","September 15, 2015","true","0.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Cross of the Dutchman is not a bad game but it is a very average game. The game doesn't do anything particularly wrong but it doesn't really stand out in any way either.\n\nI liked the theme of the game since it is always nice to actually play a game in a different setting for once. The story is not bad despite only a few of the characters being memorable.\n\nThe combat is solid but lacks a lot of depth. The game is essentially a button masher. The game does not include a block or dodge button so you pretty much just attack and run away from enemies. I got a little tired of the combat towards the middle of the game but the last couple of missions are pretty good. The game kind of feels like a long fetch quest though as you go back and forth between cities fighting enemies.\n\nUnless you want to find all of the treasure chests or get all of the achievements the game will only take around three hours to complete. That is mostly due to the fact that the game is not particularly difficult.\n\nAt full price I don't think Cross of the Dutchman is worth it. If you like beat 'em ups/hack 'n slash games you could still get some enjoyment out of the game and I would recommend it to you if you can get it on sale.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy of Cross of the Dutchman.\n\nRead My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com]\n","September 18, 2015","false","3.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

That review is forthcoming (I'll update this when it's done), but I wanted to play more before I wrote something longer.\n\nSo far, I really like this game.  The story is simple, quests are easy to follow thanks to the minimap, the graphics are colorful, the cutscene art is vibrant, and the controller works well for this game.  Combat, upgrades, and maps are all relatively straightforward, so if you're looking for something complex and involved, this might not be the game for you.  I like this more casual game, though.\n\nI only have two "cons" so far:  Firstly, I experienced some lag in two spots during character dialogue, but it cleared up quickly.  Secondly, punching is hard to aim sometimes, and like another reviewer said, I find myself punching air a lot.\n\nI'll be back with a longer review after I finish the game, but so far, so good!\n\nEDIT!

However there are a few reasons why you might not which I will get into. I played with a mouse & keyboard, so I cannot comment on gamepad support.\nPros:\n+ Colourful\n+ Great Design Aesthetic\n+ Tells a good story based upon historical events\n+ Skippable Cutscenes\nCons:\n- Extremely simple combat\n- Short playtime. I managed to finish it in under 3 hours\n- Limited replay value. Unless you want to hunt all the achievements, there is little reason to play the game again\n- Small map size\n- Extremely linear\n- No purpose for gold outside of potions/blacksmith\n- You sometimes get stuck to people/objects\n\nSome of those negatives might be nitpicks, but that's still how it is. I am somehow disappointed that it didn't offer more gameplay. Unfortunately, I don't see any reason to play it again or to complete all of the achievements. If you are expecting an experience like Torchlight or some other ARPG with random levels, you would be disappointed. It tells a tale that is based on reality between the Saxons and the Frisians. I found the pacing to be okay, but I somehow knew that it would be short when it introduced chapters. It is extremely linear to the point that you could have just removed the game and still have told the story. I guess the gameplay was only there to break up the other story-telling bits. My guess is this game could be completed in about 30-45 minutes or less if the cutscenes were skipped as well as simply going from A to B.\nThe game seems more tuned towards teaching children a history lesson. So I recommend it for that. It does look nice.","April 17","true","2.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The leveling was ok and the enimies, while not exactly massively different, were fun to knock around and see them get thrown into the air. Basically the game is fun and the mecanics are there in this game.\n\nHowever, it simply is to short. This game offers to tale the tail of this giant midievil warrior who weilded a giant sword and slew hundreds of man in battle. He stormed across the battlefield, avenging his family and killing these forces who had invaded his country and taken everything from himself, and the men who fought with him. He created a massive personal navy and became a midieval pirate lord, plundering and raiding ships, all the while defending a country he loved. He goes from place to place attacking these invaders who have now taken over towns and cities. He kills many and makes the land run red. As his life begins to come to an end hei pauses for a moment to think about what he has done, after fighting for so long. He sees that around, left in his wake, is untold death and distruction and this man stops fighting. He disbands his crew (some more forcefully then others) and convinces them, through conversation or by steel, that they need to stop fighting. After finally stopping his blood shed, he hangs up his sword, takes off his armor, and finally sits down and builds a new farm. He lives a simple like until he dies one year later. And this is what you can find on wikipedia for gods sake.\n\nPeir Gerlof bacame a monster to fight monsters and he let this monster he had create run wild until he finally put it down, in favor of being a peaceful man. And if this story was what you wanted to be told then you get the first part of it. You get chapter 1 of the story in this game, not the whole story.\n\nI wanted the whole story and it wasn't delived, thus I can't say that this game can get my vote.\n\nI want this game to be great, and if the creator wants to make this an eposadic adventure I would be happy with it. I'd gladdly keep paying if I can keep having as much fun as I did in this game, perhaps for a lower price tag. I want you guys to succeed, but please not like this.\n\nTL:DR - the game is good and fun but its kind short and doesn't tell the whole story of pier gerlof.

It takes a bit of a different route, and succeeds quite well. Following a more historical narrative (Sort of, very light hearted for such a dark time period) based on a true story/Legend " Pier Gerlofs Donia" You go from being a farmer, to a mercenary. Eventaully leading a full scale Rebellion against the Saxon incursion. It has a very warm color scheme and cartoon like graphics (if that wasn't apparent already.) The first thing what struck me was the soundtrack, very catchy and quite good! I recommend the controller (Xbox 360 gamepad works flawlessly thus far) Interesting gameplay mechanics, combat feels good and histaricle when you "Falcon" punch ten guys that pretty much hit your screen!

You have a quick attack button that you can mash constantly, or a special attack which can kill multiple enemies at once, and throw them into a ragdoll mess. It's glorious. Although there's not much to the combat, I find it quite satisfying.\n\nThere are multiple areas in the map that allow for a little exploration and to collect chests of money.\n\nThe game also has occasional stealth sections. They aren't too hard, as you just need to avoid people with lanterns. Although they don't provide much challenge, they're a nice change of pace from the rest of the game.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty relaxed game. Don't come into it expecting the best fighting mechanics, or RPG elements. The game's main attraction is that it takes you through an interesting story.","September 11, 2015","true","6.0"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","42","8","19","2","0"

I can definitely see this being a fun one for the young ones to play.  Graphics are decent, looks like you're in a story book.  Gameplay is fairly easy to start, but gets quite a bit harder when you start getting attacked by hordes of soldiers.\n\nWould like to see some things like actual loot off the bodies, and perhaps less of the going around stealing people's money (you're supposed to be a good guy).\n\nAside from that, it was enjoyable, and they hit the price point perfectly for this game.  It's more of a storyline game than an RPG, but it could be a good way to kill a couple hours.\n\nI still get a kick out of the whole "true story based on a folk legend" :P\n\nHere is a bit of gameplay; note that it's raw streaming and not edited.  Gives you a look at the first 20-30 minutes of the game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhSd62AGio","September 10, 2015","true","1.3"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

A true display of how a small developper can make a seriously awesome game and an own IP.\nI love that this game being based on Frisian folklore is actually playable in the Frysk language. If you can read it like I do (Frysk being my mother tongue) I highly recommend playing it in this language. It adds a lot to the feeling of the game.\n\nThe graphics are not very high-def and there is no real camera control, but for a hacky slashy game that really doesn't matter much to me. Camera-control might just get in the way of solid gameplay here. The graphics-style suits the storytelling which the game does through beautifully illustrated cutscenes.  The story of Grutte Pier is really emersive and interesting.\n\nThe music score is very fitting, tacid when needed and grand where applicable. The orchestrals are a pleasure to the ear and the music has a strong effect on my immersion in the game. The sound-effects are realistic and convincing.\n\nGameplay wise the game started slowly, and I was aching for some action, but I've now reached the point at which I definetly say this game stands on it's own as an action adventure. Xbox-controller support is a big plus for me as I can play from the relaxing position of couch-potato mode. This is the mode I prefer when escaping in games.\n\nI find it very hard to find a game that has a decent story these days, and this is the positive exception.\nI definetly recommend you play this game.","September 11, 2015","true","1.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I have seen a few bugs that should be addressed. For some reason I cannot use my mouse on about the whole 3rd of the right of my screen. I also couldnt get the resolution to span to my 1440p screen. I also find the clipping to be a bit annoying at times. Pier should not have to stop while he is moving around items. As far as the gameplay other than that though. Im finding it thoroughly enjoyable. I like the wit and prologue involved as well as the action sequences. I find its not just an easy blow through like some of the other combat games are. I do think the map boundaries could be smoother and the trails marked a bit brighter but its so far a great indie game. I cant wait to get into the weapons and armor portion.

In Cross of the Dutchman, you play as Pier, the farmer who turned into the commander of a Frisian army, an example for all people who were oppressed by the Saxon invaders. While leading the rebellion you will get to meet and befriend historical characters and let them join your cause for freedom!\n\nYou will explore the Frisian landscape as it was during the 16th century and experience first hand how people struggled to survive during these times of conflict. Travel to villages, farms, forests and other landmarks and collect and find the treasures and gold that is hidden all over Frisia.\n\nLead by example with your formidable sword which inspires fear and respect with even the toughest of enemies. The legend says that Pier was able to cut down multiple Saxon mercenaries with a single blow! (The sword is nowadays displayed in a museum in the Netherlands)\n\nDuring the game, you will be able to help Pier by improving his abilities and making him even more powerful. Using your sword and fists you will make your enemies tremble!  - Highly Recommended!","September 11, 2015","true","1.2"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","3","10","0","0"
