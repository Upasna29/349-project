This game really shows off the tracking system as you have to be really accurate. What the developers have done is vibrate the controllers when what you are holding comes into contact with other objects. This greatly improves immersion and makes you think that there actually are blocks you are trying to poke. Great humor, lots of puzzles. Only downside is needing a minimum of a 2mx2m square.","April 12","true","2.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

This game is usually compared to to Jenga, which I can totally see for the one gamemode, though the shape of the structures is more than a 3 stick/row tower. There are other gamemodes, such as building a tall tower using some blocks, taking out specific blocks, or taking out X number blocks. The simplicity to understand and use the game makes it really strong compared to the more complex games (eg Modbox). The humor combined with the simplicity makes it an easy game to show off and play casually.\n\nFinally. the cons: SDE is more noticeable in this game than most games, due to the nature of the gameplay & graphics. I had some difficulty with using both hands to try to pick up stones. Also, be aware of the space requirements; if you have a small space, this game is extremely uncomfortable. The more space the better.","April 15","true","0.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

But once you get a few stages into it, it's surprising how fun and addicting it is. The gameplay is sort of like Jenga, except your hands are replaced with various tools and weapons like axes, swords, chisels, and hammers. Some levels task you with knocking out a certain number of blocks without knocking off the top totem block, while others ask you to construct a stable tower using the blocks strewn about the level to hold up the totem. It's a great demonstration of the extreme precision of the Vive controllers, and encourages you to try things like sticking the blade of a sword through a gap of equal size between two blocks to wedge them apart. It's fun to play, fun to watch, funny, and also comparatively cheap for a VR launch game, so if you're planning your list of games to buy when you get your vive you might consider sticking this one in for a try.","April 29","true","1.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

The voice actor added to the feel of a more mature effort and was quite funny. The levels are all really different and dynamic. The only issue is the gripping in this game. Sometimes the blocks spin around like crazy which makes stacking hard. Definitely worth playing though!","May 10","true","2.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Great production quality, and funny.  And the puzzles stay interesting by continually introducing new quirks.  All in all, I enjoy it and think I will easily get my money's worth from this game.

The game is still in Early Access but is already pretty polished and I encountered almost no bugs. I must have played about 10 to 15 levels, maybe more so far. Unfortunately don't know how many there. Already encountered six different kind of blocks. There are even tiny worshippers for you to smash with the building blocks (that's what safety inspectors do, right?). And before I forget it: The game has excellent voice narration that is genuinely funny! Be aware though that you'll need a playspace of at least 2mx2m! My 2xm3m space felt a bit too small at times.","May 2","true","3.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I like the sense of humor given by the narrator and the haptics work well with the in game interactions.  Physics work how you would expect, giving you the option to balance some of the blocks on your tools or knock out a whole row with one quick swing.\n\nI have noticed that when you have the hand tools, some of the blocks swing around wildly unless you grab with both hands. Overall, the game plays like an amped up version of Jenga with an interesting theme.  I've only played a few levels so far, but the level design has been pretty varied.\n\nI would reccomend this game if you like Puzzles even in the slightest bit, as it is a lot of fun and seems to be great value for the price.","May 1","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
