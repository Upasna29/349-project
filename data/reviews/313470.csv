You actually only get to use your full group for one single boss encounter, before being whisked away to use several new sets of characters in what boils down to an interactive cutscene, and then the credits roll.  You'll have to either buy BHH2 or pick up the DLC to have any real full party content.\n\nThe part of the game that is there is a solid, fun RPG, but I would not recommend buying this game until June 2015, when the final segment is slated to come out.\n\nAbout the parts of the game that are complete though, the combat system is pretty strong, allowing a decent amount of customization, and a cool stance system adds timing and defensive elements typically not found in this type of RPG.  Enemies also use stances, but the game does a pretty terrible job of explaining what your enemeis stances do when they're not the same stances that you can use.\n\nAs of October 2014, the game had quite a few bugs, and during my playthrough the game crashed 2 or 3 times, several times my characters started moving during dialogue, and once my character got stuck on a wall during scripted movement, and the game got stuck there until I restarted it.\n\nThis game shows promise, but I would wait for the trilogy to be completed before picking it up.","October 24, 2014","false","6.7"," 82 of 108 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","82","108","3","6"

What I found was something so very similar to one of my all-time favorite games, Earthbound. This beauty has similar artwork, music, animations, and fight mechanics. The only difference is, it's set in the late 1800s in a western setting. Pardon me while I go play this game. As an added bonus, you can use a Microsoft controller for Windows, or, I can only assume, retro USB gamepads.\n\nUpdate after ten minutes of gameplay: This game features all of the best aspects of the Mother game series! This is definitely getting finished and put upon my proverbial game mantle.

I mean what is that? A decade? That's a mighty long time. It's time enough for all the Saint's Little Gang to plan for their return. Chaos is brewing, and it's up to a new generation of heroes to put a stop to it. Will they succeed? Or is it going to be their last round-up? Well, since this is just the beginning, I'd hate to imagine they failed their quest before it even started.\n\nEarthbound gets mentioned often when discussing this game, and for good reason. Both games share similar aspects such as perspective and enemies appearing on the map rather than at random. BHH also has some obvious call-backs, which can be found in Kickstart Creek, but we're getting a little ahead of ourselves here. Let's talk about the biggest difference, the battle-system.\n\nThis game uses an active battle-system. Each character (up to 4) can equip four vantages. These can consist of attacks, healing abilities, stances, and so on. Having the right combination of vantages for battle is a necessity. Attacking is more than just stabbing or shooting something until it falls over. You gotta figure out a strategy. Do you pick the enemy apart with a thousand cuts? Debilitate them with several status effects? Or save up for those powerful attacks? There isn't an "item" option in battle. You can't hand someone a sarsaparilla if their health is low. Either have someone equip a healing vantage, or make proper use of stances. Stances are the cheapest abilities, and for good reason. They put characters on the defensive, reducing or outright avoiding damage. There are many stances, some not even defensive at all.\n\nMeter management is an essential tactic. Using abilities requires power, and it can take awhile to use the most devastating attacks. The same goes for the enemy. Even when you don't know their next move, you always know how long it'll take them to perform it. That's the key moment to go in any stances that you have. Not doing so is a fatal mistake. Still, death isn't quite the end in battle, your characters will recover given enough time, but they'll be worse off. Wounded party members tend to bleed out, become less resistant to status effects, and generally have a tougher time staying alive. If they accrue too many wounds, they're permanently out. Okay, I mean permanent as in: "until they see a doctor" but whatever. Basically, you have to go into battle with the mindset that anything you can do, the enemy can do as well.\n\nLike I said though, this is just the beginning of the trilogy. It only takes about 7 or 8 hours to reach the end of this chapter, and that's hardly enough time to get your boots wet. However, there are several battles that will require an understanding of how the west was won, and they're not the kind you can grind enough experience to breeze through. I expect battles in the next two entries to emphasize this unique and fun battle-system.\n\nSome other things I'll note:\n\n-There are no clone NPCs. Usually with these 16-bit RPGs we see 20 dozen of the same townspeople everywhere. Not so with this game, everyone is different.\n-I'd be lying if I said that the music doesn't elevate this game. Jake "virt" Kaufman provides a great soundtrack.\n-Easy (and missable!) achievements. Pay attention to your surroundings.\n\nIn short, Boot Hill Heroes is on the right track. Hopefully subsequent entries are even better, I'd hate to see such a promising start go to waste.","November 10, 2014","true","9.2"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

The graphics have a "dirty pixels" style that really accents the western theme. The music is top notch and will instantly draw you in. Combine both of those and you will get a very atmospheric experience that you have to let yourself get lost in. This is my favorite thing about this game over all.\n\nThe game is high customizable in combat. it has all of the tactical thought and personal pace of turn based combat, without any of the waiting. Prefer active battle? You can do that as well. There are so many enemies you won't find in any other game, the art is very well done. From the way a ring of fire that enters you into combat, to the way enemies fall over (as if they were a hastilly constructed western movie setpiece), you can see very deliberate and very western themes. I wish more developers would steal this combat system, once you try it, you'll wonder why AAA games don't give you the amount of options you have here.\n\nThe game features an optional co-op combat system (I haven't tried it), and has 2 more parts scheduled for release. If you want to play a turn based western game that oozes charm from its every pore, this is it!\n","October 11, 2014","true","0.1"," 24 of 36 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","24","36","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BigBirdIII/recommended/313470/","BigBirdIII","Big Bird III","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BigBirdIII/","1503 products in account","[Spoiler-Free Review]\n\nPerhaps the biggest consideration before starting out with an RPG nowadays is, "Can I find time to finish this game?" As much as I adore the old SNES RPG’s for instance, I can’t really go back and play through them anymore; too big a commitment. Disregard that concern for Boot Hill Heroes. Between the hats, the music, and the characters, your time is well spent playing this game. Setting an RPG in the spaghetti west just makes so much sense!\n\nSo what do you need to know beforehand?\n\nTimes have changed.\nBoot Hill Heroes is a modern RPG designed as a sort of homage to the glory days of the Role Playing and Wild West genres. The storyline is easy to follow and progresses at a snappy pace, the difficulty is forgiving (for the most part), and while it doesn’t allow for true ‘save anywhere!’ functionality, you’ll never feel locked-in to a play session beyond what your time allows. Despite being a linear experience overall, the game still manages to deliver a large scope RPG feel (complete with unique characters and game mechanics, twists and turns). Did I mention it can be played with up to four people simultaneously?\n\nIt isn’t just an Earthbound clone.\nIt’s easiest to draw associations between this game and Earthbound/Mother; the graphic style alone! Setting that aside however, what really distinguishes this game is the setting. The story features big entrances and over-the-top performances from a cast of characters the likes of which you’d expect to find in Vaudeville. I won’t give anything away but the characters (esp. the villains) are the true stars of the game and they don’t disappoint.\n\nThis game has heart!\nEvery character in the game is completely unique (in appearance and dialogue). It’s hard to imagine how much work went into creating a world, one character and one house at a time. Some of those efforts are obvious; you walk into a building and find the place has been meticulously decorated and arranged. It's not like you're going to stay over for dinner or anything, but you'll notice people's houses aren't cookie-cutter. In addition to the dinnerware, you’ll find livestock penned in barns and stables, people working the farms and such: towns feel alive.\n\nHat Mechanic\nHats are the means by which your characters change their appearances and acquire new abilities. They’re equipped, but don’t produce any defensive bonuses. This is crucial to what makes them work, once you've unlocked the skills associated with a new hat, you can choose to wear another hat for purely aesthetic purposes. In this way, you'll never have to worry about hats being outclassed by others discovered down the line. It’s a system that encourages experimentation. Receiving new hats throughout your adventure never feels old, you'll rush to try each one on as soon as you get them. Unfortunately there is some overlap in unlocked abilities so not every hat provides you with a completely new set of unlearned skills.\n\nThe writing is clever and witty!\nEspecially in battles where enemies are introduced and later eulogized depending on your performance. I wish there was a greater variety of phrases rather than one or two for each type of foe, but I always looked forward to seeing how they would come to grips with being defeated: I know at least one or two lives were changed thanks to my relentless beatings.\n\nDialogue could use a bit of tightening up overall. In battles you'll sometimes get a message detailing every aspect of what an enemy attack does. Lick is probably the most egregious example of what I’m trying to describe here, “Weak physical damage with small chance for confusion that slightly heals the user.” Thankfully, the developer has demonstrated a willingness to address issues as they're identified.\n\nThe graphics in battles aren’t the best…\nA bit rough around the edges shall we say? Don’t expect to be blown away. Some of the enemies look like they were created in MS Paint. In addition, the font style (all caps, some spacing issues) makes it somewhat difficult to read what’s being said at times. I’m not saying you can’t read it, I’m saying you’ll appreciate how easy it is to read text in other games.\n\nThe Music/Soundtrack!!!\nDoes the industry have an award for Videogame Music of the Year? What won? This is better.\n\nMissing content from PS Vita version?\nThis is the definitive package, all content released on other platforms is being included in the Steam release.\n\nPost-Release Support?\nBoot Hill Heroes Part 1 is finished but new features have been added post-release (including a new mini map feature in the latest patch). Since the game is being spread out over multiple episodes, the developer has seen fit to reward early adopters by offering each DLC release free at launch (free for one week), the price then becomes $0.99 each. What does this mean? Buy the game now and get all future episodes for free.\n\nTLDR:\nIf you've got any interest in RPG games of old, get Boot Hill Heroes. This game is special.","January 30, 2015","true","40.8"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

I am gladly go to replay this game again on Steam.\n\nIt really is simple when it comes to this game. It's a Earthbound clone with a lot more character than anything made via something like RPG Maker and is very professional in its presentation. The story is engaging and not anywhere near as hackneyed as many JRPGs are these days. The combat is essentially a FF ATB system kind of thing with a little bit more customization and diversity thrown in and it works well. It does take a little time to get used to the pace, but once you do it's one of the more fun JRPG battle systems you'll find.\n\nAnother thing of note here is the music. It's extremelly well done. It totally captures the feel of something from the days of the SNES but with a lot of the overall compositional quality you'll find in a lot of today's AAA titles. It really helps evoke the western feel.\n\nFor me, this is a simply choice whether to recommend this title. It's a western JRPG based largely off Earthbound. You'd have to be high not to salivate at that sentence if you enjoy JRPGs at all. This game is lovingly crafted, well implemented, and a pretty great value at such a low price.","October 11, 2014","true","119.1"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","16","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/selfsufficient/recommended/313470/","selfsufficient","Ryan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/selfsufficient/","40 products in account","Having beaten the game within a week and getting all the extra content I would say that this game is definitely worth the price of admission. This is part one of a series of three.\n\nThese are the strengths and weaknesses of the game and having obsessively played it and beating it start to finish I feel I have a fairly good comprehension of where the game excels and in some areas underwhelm for those who don't want to read everything I have to say I will sum things up first with a 8/10 score although this could be subject to change as some of the gripes I have that hold this game back from being a masterpiece could easily be remedied as this game is not yet complete as previously mentioned.\n\nStrengths:\n\n1) Local Multiplayer is something that is lacking in a lot of new games, I feel that Dave definitely knew what he was doing not just in getting a game to function for multiple people but also to have it flow well. I like the fact that locally I can still change my gear and skills while my friend may be running around or vice versa if we alternate party leaders. The menu system leaves a bit to be desired in terms of it's looks in my opinion but in terms of functionality A+\n\n2) The pacing is done well, I strongly dislike how part one ends in that it feels like you are cut off right as the story is getting started but aside from that I never felt bored or that I was in a certain area for too long, I have this listed as a strength because once part 2 and 3 come out and the game is finished my main issue with the pacing (the end of part one) will cease to exist\n\n3) Level Design, again keeping in mind that there will be more content to come I feel what is there is done well the areas are colorful and are quite different as you travel from one main hub to the other considering that all of this takes place in a western setting the variety within that is quite vast. The towns feel like the right size and the different dungeons feel like the right length, the only part I felt was tedious was the bonus dungeon at the end (without any spoilers you'll know why when you get there) with that exception though as I said what is there works great.\n\n\nDecent but could be better:\n\n1) The story is not bad but not great either. That could have a lot to do with the fact that by the time you finish part one it is just barely getting started, it's too early to say in terms of the overall scope but having said that I think you should have done and seen more by the time you reach a third of the games length. The characters are servicable and have their own motivations as to why they join up with the protagonist but to be honest I feel like every character in this game is a character I've seen a million times before. It's not a big deal but for the longevity of the series I hope these characters can break out of their stereotypes (Kid and Doc and the antagonists come to mind) I feel like there is potential in all of them to be something more but Moon in particular as a native american is not someone you see in a games story too often and I think there are a lot of interesting themes that could be explored with some research now that the story is starting to take off as part one ends.\n\n2) The music wasn't bad, it definitely suited the theme of a western well, this really just comes down to my own personal opinion but I wish there were tracks that were a bit more catchy. When I think about games that this one was based off of like Earthbound there are just things that make you go "oh wow" and make you stop and listen to the track like Onett for example. The music does its job but I'm hoping that some tracks will come along that stand out a little bit more as the game picks up.\n\n3) The first playthrough getting new attacks was interesting and the there is nothing wrong with a turn based rpg but I feel like there could be more variety, you learn a lot of different skills with different hats that you unlock as the game progresses but when I tried playing through a second time with a friend it was almost agonizing that there was usually just a go to move that was better than everything else or offered no real tactical change, kick kick kick dodge, or kick kick kick heal, etc. I feel like the core combat system and the idea of using x amount of points based on how strong the attacks are is a great idea but it needs to come with some skills that have a bit more variety. Also the customization of the weapons leaves a bit to desire, maybe it's because I never really liked grinding to gather materials to improve gear but I also feel like the options there are kind of limited, I would like to see it expanded upon in the latter 2 installments.\n\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1) The overall presentation of this game was pretty good but I feel like the menus look very ugly relative to the characters and the buildings. I think the health bars etc. should be redone as they stand out as something not quite on par with everything else, The dialogue boxes are not as bad but it wouldn't hurt if they were spruced up a bit.\n\n2) The length of the game is very short, I completed it in a couple of days. I think there should be some extra things for you to do outside of going to a dungeon or grinding for materials. This would take some work but it would be cool if there were some random side quests or other interesting things to do while waiting for part 2 or part 3 when part 2 is out. Random encounters and the like to make the world a bit more lively. Maybe some bandits roll into town and you get some perks for beating them or something. Just something to break up the monotany of town/dungeon over and over.\n\n3) There is no online multiplayer I feel like with how well the local multiplayer was designed this was a missed opportunity, Though I understand the reason why it was not included (most likely down to resources)\n\n4) I feel like the game and a lot of games like this are lacking the innovations that it was inspired by. If you just want to go back to the old days and play a game like the snes days then this is right up your alley, and for me I did enjoy it quite a bit because of the yearning for nostalgia but to me I would like to see some new interesting ideas. I'm not talking about mind blowing graphics or state of the art effects but innovation in terms of gameplay. Things to do, places to see. Just because it was inspired by old school games doesn't mean it should be limited by those same conventions. The art style? makes sense because it's one main guy and a couple of outsiders helping him work on the game, completely makes sense. As an example and I'm just throwing it out there I didn't think about this in depth or anything but just something to inspire, what about if you could duel people in the game? Maybe a mini game to clear a town that has been raided by bandits with a timer and then you can have a gun duel with the leader it could be a weekly or monthly event where you could unlock new gear. How about horse races with your friends? These may sound bland but elaborated upon I'm sure they could be something interesting that could help elevate the game. If they don't work don't put them in the game but It'd just be neat to have something on the side to do and look forward to.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nI do really like this game, despite a lot of the things I have said there is nothing wrong with what's here, I just figured I could contribute some ideas and as parts 2 and 3 are completed maybe some of them will find their way into the game in some form. I'm not really complaining more just constructive criticism as I feel the foundations for a strong game are definitely here. If not this is still worth $10 easy.\n\n8/10","October 28, 2014","true","1.0"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","1"

Maybe the finest example this far on what the aging RPGmaker engine can do when the game is done with attention to detail and love.  Do note though that some reviews have noted the abrupt ending of the game so consider the price closely what you wish to pay for this. I got mine in a bundle for a very cheap price and for that price it has this far been a real blast. But full price might be a bit too much for some.\n\nGame itself is a bit clicheey in that the protagonist character is just named 'Kid' and you 'need to save the farm' and your dear ol' ma'. But it's quite entertaining nevertheless to go out and do the plot. Not that much freeroaming as combat is avoidable mostly if you wish and placed in transit areas between safer places.

In this way you can time yourself to be more effective, much like Child of Light. The story is cliche western, but still very fun and interesting.

The graphics are quite good with some expressive sprite animation that reminds me of good SNES era RPG's. The story is fairly straight forward and full of the usual western cliches, but its well enough told and builds to a good conclusion at the end of this chapter, certainly setting up interest for whats going to happen in the next chapter. The combat is turn based but each action needs a certain charge before it will perform, so a large part of the strategy in combat is timing, picking what moves to use and when. This really makes the combats quite tactical and raises them above the usual "Pick an option from the menu and wait" fare thats typical of older JRPG. Skills ("vantages") are learned by wearing different hats, after each combat you will get a certain amount of skill points that will be assigned to the skill set the hat gives you, once you have earned enough for a skill you learn it permanently, even if you take the hat off. You can only have four skills equiped at once so this adds another wrinkle to the already interesting combat. All in all I had a great time with this game in the 15 odd hours it took me to complete, well worth the price.\n\nPros:\nGood amount of content for the price\nIts the wild west\nGood combat system that is deeper than you might expect\n\nCons:\nSome grinding\nFinal boss will murder your face (You can click retry until you beat him though)","June 18, 2015","true","15.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The western setting is noticably different from other RPGs.  The graphics are deliberately retro, which fits both the setting and the inspiration.  The hat-based skill-learning system reminds me of Final Fantasy 6 and 9 (which happen to be my favorites of the series).  The combat mechanics are something new and refreshing, and should present some good tactical options once far enough along in the game to learn the necessary Vantages.  The dialogue is playful, with some fun old-school gaming references and playing with the Kickstarter backers.  The story gets off to a good start with a destroyed town, an obvious scapegoat, corrupt business interests, outlaws in hiding, and protagonists thrust into the whole situation by circumstances beyond their control.  The classic "go kill some rats" starting quest is fitting for a farm boy, and the second party member's rodeo-inspired abilites are useful and flavorful.  Riding a horse is a fitting fast-travel option, and easy to work with.\n\nThere seem to be some exploitable item-farming oddities (on an actual farm, for once), but not really any more so than the respawning Rupees in any Zelda game.\n\nI also find making the achievements match up to a deck of playing cards very amusing, and appropriate to the setting.","October 13, 2014","true","3.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","4"

I liked the start its got very clever writing and the combat is unique. I kind of started getting irritated with the game later on in the game. Insta kills are a bad game design. BAD. I hate insta kills.  I think its kind of a lazy mans crutch. Later in this game insta kills are very common. Lions can Insta kill characters and more then likely will insta kill you with  just 1 lion. So unless you get lucky with stances or have the perfect unique build like putting the lions to sleep then your doomed to failure when you meet up with 4 of them.\n\nI think had the insta kills been upfront I would not have cared and honestly I would have just ignored the game. Again I dislike insta kills. A lot. Perhaps after my blood pressure goes down I may give this another try. Look if your gonna insta kill players up front and thats the kind of game this is thats fine. I have no issues with insta killing the player. However this game is like I said before unique combat, fun writing, interesting characters and then blam. Insta kills R us later in the game.  A lot. Their is a creature in a cave later on that can kill you in 2 hits or less if your level 9 or below.\n\nI mean someone out their might want to be insta killed. I give you that. Just make it up front having characters getting insta killed right from the get go. Hey in this game were going to insta kill you better get used to it. So the start great, middle is very hard and the ending is in my view probably impossible for most.\n\nI dont mind not completing the game . However the DLC is locked away unless you finish the game. Doh.  So if you cannot complete the main game you cannot play the DLC.  Great. This seems to me like a bad design choice by the way.  Honestly the way it stands now with the insta kills later on in the game I cannot really recommend this.\n\nI looked up the  achievement for completing the game to see what percentage got to the end.  Its currently right around 3.6% add to the fact you need to complete the first game to get the dlc working and I cannot see many people buying the dlc.","March 22, 2015","false","9.8"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","5","15","0","0"

On the other side of that, there is SO MUCH reading, especially during the beginning scene. I accidentally quit the game before saving it and was pretty annoyed that I couldn't skip the cutscene part. The gamepad controls don't work in the options and title screen menus. The hitboxes around certain objects are pretty annoying too, but that's not too big of a deal, just confusing, especially when the candle on the table is stopping you from moving beside the table. By the look of the control swapping menu it looks like theres some 2 player stuff in the works, but that's just my speculation. Anyway, this is looking like it'll be a fun game once I get the hang of the combat. Also, Western RPG. Lol.","December 7, 2014","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Give it a shot, I expect patches and fixes will be coming.\n\nI will start off by saying that I enjoy the story and the gameplay. I will finish this game. My one warning is to grind. A lot. Even when you have nowhere to rest or recover wounds, because you will die. A lot. This isn't a bad thing.\n\nHowever... there are a lot of problems with this game. It crashes. Often. I have had to restart the game probably 15 times in the time I've spent on this game due to freezes.\n\nAlso... don't use a controller (I use an Xbox wired PC controller), because when trying to select actions, the cursor just goes everywhere but where you want it to go. Movement is the same. It's hard to be accurate.\n\nAnd what I said about combat being hard? It would be a good thing if you didn't have to juggle 4 ATB gauges in real time. It's nigh impossible on big fights where you have to keep dodge up constantly and rotate in attacks and heals when you can. (Not to mention menu options randomly turn on and off)\n\nTrying to get one keyboard and one controller working... doesn't. Can't get it to work at all, even when you set each character for the proper controller/keyboard. So co-op basically isn't working.\n\nI suggest waiting until this has been updated more for fixes. Then it will be worth the cost.","October 13, 2014","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thelasttimelord/recommended/313470/","thelasttimelord","The Last Time Lord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thelasttimelord/","430 products in account","The game is really fantastic. I've played some retro stuff, but I really can't recall ever playing a game that made me feel the same way I did when I played Chrono Trigger. The story is engaging and right off the bat sets up some characters (just at first glance from their sprites) that you immediately want to know more about.\n\nThe old west setting, for an RPG, is both very unique and adapted well. The combat is excellent (I remember the first menu-driven combat where there was queue times for actions that you could affect in Grandia, I think...) and actually keeps me thinking for most of the battles rather than devolving into select Fight, select Fight, select Fight.\n\nA good way to sum it up is that if this was released for the SNES, it would be in the top 3 or 5 RPGs for the system. (Just to clarify, that's because this is the whole package. You could take any game today and just because of the graphics alone, it would have been revolutionary.) This would alos be an example of a game that would be on everyone's "please make a sequel" list.\n\nAbout the only issue I have with the game is that I wish the character sprites were a little less detailed - because I think you can get a lot of expression from the sprites in Chrono Trigger and FF Tactics even though, for instance, those sprites lack noses and sometimes mouths. Trying to make the sprites 30% larger in order to fit in the extra facial detail - while it works in theory, it loses some of the charm.\n\nSo in short, I've seen retro games that are decent and give you an experience that is fun but largely relies on following tropes or tongue-in-cheek mocking them. But this is different, this actually feels like a new mid-90s Squaresoft RPG. They put in the effort to make use of the tropes, have some humor based off them, but more importantly go far, far beyond that to make a game that doesn't actually need nostalgia to get you to enjoy the game.","March 23, 2015","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/serendone/recommended/313470/","serendone","Serendone","http://steamcommunity.com/id/serendone/","675 products in account","tl;dr this game has a super-fun combat system and well-realized setting, but the pacing is uneven and it falls apart 2/3 into the game. Being a 3-part series does not excuse the sloppy narrative. Buy the game if you have even a remote interest in JRPGs (or if part 2 is already out), but as the game goes on, try not to get your hopes up.\n\nI've played Boot Hill Heroes for a hefty amount of time, and my verdict is that I'm both very pleased and surprisingly disappointed with it. Ultimately I recommend it because it's such a unique experience, but it was a tough verdict to come to for reasons I will explain below.\n\nTo start, the combat is AWESOME. I'm not too familiar with JRPGs, so I don't know if this kind of stamina-based system is common, but I love it. It feels slow with just one person, but get a party of two or more and the combat hits that perfect balance of tension & action and statistics and calculation. The best of both worlds, so to speak.\n\nThe setting is definitely interesting, something few games really visit. The game follows the typical JRPG storyline and some of those accompanying tropes, but it does so in a fresh way with a cast of characters both memorable and fun (aside from the blank slate of a main character). Each locale is filled to the brim with residents and you can spend hours just talking to everybody. The storyline is nothing crazy or riveting, but stories in games like this are mainly to shuffle the character from setting to setting, and the story arcs you have in between places are enough to keep you wanting more.\n\nMore on the setting, it's interesting to see how the game handles not only the aesthetics of the time, but the social norms and values of the time. The protagonist is a country boy, looked down upon by many because of his age and his social status. In addition, the factions in this game boil down to cowboys and Indians. Neither of them like each other, and the game makes this known in a way that feels ambivalent yet humanizing. It clues you in to the fact that the native population has a big leathery boot stepping down on them without needing to resort to straight-up racism. It also serves as a unique vehicle for the plot, rather than the typical "omg bad guys, let's stop them because why not" arc.\n\nSo, Polygon-esque observations aside, the game has a great setting and awesome combat. So why the difficulty in recommending this? Well, this is the first of a three-part series, but the pacing is awful and the endgame is frustrating, causing the game to fizzle out when it's just starting to get REALLY good. The protagonist and his motley crew of westerners spend about 2/3 of the game chasing one of the game's six bad guys, focusing unevenly on the main characters and shuffling you back and forth between them in ways that feel irritating and disorganized. Just when you start to get the hang of one character, the game yanks it away and hands you another. You don't even get all four party members together until that 2/3 mark, and unless you've got the DLC, they're really only together for one or two battles.\n\nAnd then there's the endgame, a flashback-based boss rush of all the bad guys. You don't have your characters that you've been spit-shining with modded weapons and sweet attacks; instead you get 2-4 loadouts depending on the scene and you fight these incredibly difficult bosses, dying over and over until you figure out their schtick and get it right. It's good in the sense that it lets you really understand how the different, interchangable moves work, but it's just a death march of trial and error until you FINALLY get it right. Also, if your medic dies at any point during one of these battles, you may as well just give up. The endgame hinges a little too much on pure luck.\n\nThis in and of itself wouldn't be so frustrating if it weren't for the fact that the game kept crashing on me during this ONE particular part of the game. WIth the exception of a number of visual glitches, the game was completely stable until it came to this last section, and then all hell broke loose. Imagine having almost defeated a hair-pulling boss and then having the game crash. Now you have to load the game up, sit through the cutscene, and pray that you can kill the boss before the game craps itself again. Once I forgot to save in between battles and the game crashed, and I was SO close to just uninstalling the game and never touching it again.\n\nPlus, once this boss rush ends, the game's over. There's no denouement, no extra bits with your party (unless you got the DLC), nothing. You see the credits and get dropped off in one of the cities so you can visit about half of the world you travelled. It's extremely disappointing. The fact that this is going to be a three-part series does not mean narrative shortcuts get to be taken.\n\nSo really, that about sums up my feelings on the game. Stellar setting and combat, but a lot of instability and some bad pacing and narrative choices. I guess in the end I ultimately like this game and can't wait to play more, especially since your save will carry over. If part 2 is already out, I say buy this game and the second part right now. If not, it might be harder to recommend unless you really like JRPGs, as the game fails to get the ball rolling until it is too late.","March 6, 2015","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"
