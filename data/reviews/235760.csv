I am having fun unlocking the costumes and dioramas.  I don't think this was a cash grab because it has been in development for 2+ years.  I would say the game is about a 7 out of 10.\n\nI am having a blast playing the game, and isn't that what matters?  I bought all the DLC on day one, because I wanted all of the characters and costume, I know this rubbed a lot of people the wrong way.\n\nFor me it was worth, $40 for Base game +DLC.  Wait for the price to go down and give this game a chance, at least for me it's a lot of fun!","November 25, 2013","true","25.2"," 85 of 110 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","85","110","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spodamayn/recommended/235760/","spodamayn","spoderman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spodamayn/","4647 products in account","I bought this game and the Ultimate Hero Pack dlc during a sale for 50% off. Little Orbit never seem to discount their games past 50% off, and this was the first time any of the DLC had been discounted so I grabbed it. I had been wanting it for a while, so $5 was my buy point.\n\nI enjoyed it enough to play through twice (you unlock 1 extra character for finishing the game per difficulty and the character you unlock for hard mode is pretty damn cool), however the character you unlock for finishing the game on normal is one of the worst in the game and lazily coded. The PC versions options are lacking, all you can choose from are resolution and fullscreen/windowed mode. Vsync is off by default, you'll have to force it. The framerate is capped at 30 FPS, but I honestly wasn't bothered by that and I'm usually picky with framerate caps. The graphics very much look like a polished PS2 game, which isn't surprising.. it's a budget TV show adaption.\n\nI was disappointed right off the bat after seeing that the online co-op is completely broken. It'll give you an error when trying to create or search for a lobby. I checked the forum and there didn't seem to be any way around this, but I was willing to play the campaign in singleplayer so this wasn't a deal breaker for me. Ideally, the game is best played in co-op, so if you have the opportunity of doing local co-op, I'd recommend that.\n\nIn singleplayer, you'll be constantly switching across the 3 heros you have in your team, so it does take some getting used to. Focusing on playing only one hero isn't very effective, as your power meter will keep running out and the normal melee attacks (that don't consume energy) are ♥♥♥♥ing terrible and pointless to use most of the time. You'll mostly be spamming power attacks, which is why it's better to use all 3 of the characters on your team.\n\nThe tutorial kind of sucks. They teach you most of the core mechanics, but they don't tell you about the squad/hero boost, a semi-important feature, which is only briefly mentioned in a loading screen tip, and doesn't go into detail for how to use it. They expect you to RTFM, but who has time for that?! Actually, there are a few other things that aren't explained in detail. When you open a chest, it will appear that it's empty but it has a tiny XP orb that you can't really see, and I think you get money for smashing boxes, but those also seem to be empty whenever they're destroyed. I don't know if this is a lazy design choice, or if it's a problem attributed to the PC port.\n\nThe money that you earn is almost completely useless, because 90% of the items you can buy are crap. Many of the "enhancements" you can buy boost your melee attack power, or your defense. Melee attacks suck, and the game is ridiculously easy even on hard mode that you'll never need extra defense. I ended up using the same 2 items (that increase power damage and energy efficiency) for the entire game. This also means that the hero skills that increase defense or melee strength are useless.\n\nAbout half of the characters in the game suck, they aren't very balanced. You'll have the option to take whoever you want with you into a mission though, except for the team leader, so it's not a big deal. It does however make the game a bit more boring when you're using the same sets of characters for the whole game once you figure out which heroes are good. The best character in the game IMO is Wondergirl, which is DLC. If you're wondering which heroes are worth using, this is how I rank the best of them: Wondergirl (DLC) > Artemis > Lagoon Boy (DLC) > Miss Martian > Nightwing > everyone else. Rocket's also pretty sweet, but she takes forever to unlock so I didn't rank her. Zatanna is useful as well, but only when her skills are maxed.. which takes too long. DLC characters are unlocked from the start, along with Artemis, so you start out with good characters by default. The good thing is that XP is shared with all of the characters, so you can freely choose who you want without needing to level them exclusively.\n\nSo by now, you must be wondering why the hell I would play through it twice. The answer to that is the game is worth playing through if you love Young Justice and want to play as the characters or test out the superpowers. It's NOT worth playing for the story though. It's meant to fill the gap between season 1 and 2, but the story ultimately seemed rushed and uninteresting to me. The plot is nowhere near the same quality of the show, but it is cool to fight against the majority of the villains from the show. If your only interest is the story, I suggest youtubing it. For $5 + $2.49 for the DLC, I got my moneys worth. If I could, I'd give this a "neutral" review rather than positive, but seeing how I enjoyed it enough to play through the game twice, this is worth a positive review from me.","August 8, 2015","true","21.4"," 32 of 34 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","32","34","3","0"

I simply bought the game because I'm a huge fan of the series and want a third season to be made.\n\nStory timeline ? The game takes place between season 1 and 2.\n\nWhile the gameplay is kinda repetitve, the game features variety of characters. Each character has his\her unique way of fighting and his\her unique set of powers. There is a level up rewarding system that allows you to upgrade your character as you progress in the campaign. Adding to that the variety of bosses (shameless self-promotion: I already have a walkthrough guide for the game published on steam in case you wanna see the list of bosses). There are total of 15 missions divided to 3,2 or 1 section. Every 3 sections are set in a different location. For example; A missions conists of 3 sections set in Gotham, another in Greece, etc...\n\n\nThe voice acting in this game is awesome, why? well, because the voice actors who voiced our beloved superheroes and their rogues came back and lent their voice talent for the game.\nThe only thing missing that is related to voice acting, in my humble opinion, is in-game dialogue\banter between the team members(just like in the show), that would've been cool.\n\nHere is a list of things I didn't like in the game\n\nCons:\n- Dumb AI: Sometimes your assistant AI can be annoying and so fraustrating. They get stuck behind a door or a crate easily, lol.\n- Blue Beetle, Wonder Girl, Bumblebee, and Lagoon Boy are DLC characters.\n- Lack of attack combos (there are like 2 or 3 combos for each character and that's it)\n- No 'restart mission' option from the pause menu. You have to exit all the way to mount justice (campaign mission menu), go to the missions list and re-select the one you wish to replay.\n\n- While it's not that big of an issue for me, the graphics could have been polished a little bit more.\n\nIf I to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10, it would be 6.5/10. It is an ok game at best, you might wanna give it a try when it goes on sale.....","November 27, 2013","true","30.5"," 44 of 58 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","44","58","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eliterocketeer/recommended/235760/","eliterocketeer","eliterocketeer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eliterocketeer/","176 products in account","I'll preface my review by saying Young Justice: Legacy has a lot of potential and is probably a decent game on consoles - it just wasn't ported very well to PC.\n\nMe and a friend - both fans of the Young Justice cartoon - purchased the game to play online together. Before even playing the single player campaign, we attempted to play together. I was able to host a game, but I was stuck on the "waiting for players" screen indefinitely. My friend could not even host OR join a game, he simply received vague error messages.\n\nWith multiplayer not working, we decided to play the single player campaign separately. I immediately noticed that the game's menus did not have support for a mouse cursor, you must use the arrow keys. Additionally, the "space bar" had been chosen as the primary "make a selection" key, not the standard "enter key" or mouse click. These were minor inconveniences, but probably a red flag.\n\nIn the game, I was immediately annoyed by the fact that the camera could not be adjusted. In narrow pathways (which this game has many of) the camera really impedes gameplay. I ignored this and continued on.\n\nThe combat was pretty typical of a hack-and-slash. Mindless, but enjoyable. Unfortunately, the voice emotes were very repetitive and triggered way too often. My biggest issue with the combat was the enemies' aggro radius. It was very small, and moving out of this radius caused the enemies to reset and go back to their patrol locations. I found myself accidentally exploiting this as I was playing. I would attempt to back off a little bit to do some ranged attacks and the enemies would reset, giving me time to regain health. It was very unnatural.\n\nI continued. I found my first chest, which I had hoped would contain some interesting item - but it was empty. My friend found the same chest, no item.\n\nI ran into another game-breaking bug. I have two monitors, and my cursor was not limited to the game screen. As I encountered larger battles, I found myself clicking outside of the game and minimizing my session.\n\nAt this point, I exited the main game and decided to take a look at the mini-games in the central hub; particularly, the trivia game. The game seemed interesting, especially for fans of the game, but every time I finished I assumed the game froze because I could not return to the hub. The UI prompted me to press "space bar" to exit, but this did nothing. Eventually, I discovered that you actually had to press "s" to exit. One of the many control-based typos in the game.\n\nOverall, the combat was pretty polished and fun. Fans of the Young Justice cartoon would appreciate the story. The graphics were very out-dated (I've seen comparisons to the Gamecube, which are pretty accurate) but they weren't unreasonably bad.\n\nUnfortunately, though: the menus were frustrating to deal with; the controls were unintuitive and typos worked against you; and the game wasn't interesting enough to justify the gameplay bugs (empty containers, bad AI).","November 27, 2013","false","1.5"," 45 of 69 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","45","69","0","0"

Multiplayer doesn't work (apparently if you have certain combinations of DLC), trying to create or join a game just results in connection errors. This has been a problem for months but no peep from the devs or publishers.\n\nIt's full of weird glitches like missing text, missing menu options that magically reappear sometimes. This is a console port so it tells you "don't turn off your console while autosaving". When you hold the right-trigger to use your powers there's nothing on the screen showing what buttons do what. This game is trying to be like the Marvel X-Men or Marvel Ultimate Alliance action RPG/brawler games, but it's missing most of the UI and gameplay features that make those games fun.\n\nThe graphics are pretty bad. They look like 2005 or earlier, but the game came out in 2013. Textures are blocky and muddy, there are no graphic options other than resolution, and the game won't start at all if you have it in full-screen mode. Even text and menu items are blocky and jagged.\n\nI wish I could like this game. I wish I could recommend it. There aren't enough games like this on PC. Unfortunately, this one is terrible. If the devs ever come back and fix it up I'll change my recommendation but for now, meh. It's possible to have fun with this game if you can overlook the many many flaws, but you have to be pretty desperate for a superhero action RPG brawler. 4/10","April 10, 2015","false","1.9"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

The game is meant to take place in the years between Season 1 and 2 of the TV series, and is meant to fill in a lot of the gaps that happen in between these points. I wont go into spoilers, but the game does cover some of the aspects that weren't explained in Season 2, with a reasonable explination as to the events. That, really, would be the only reason to purchase this game, but I'd highly reccomend you just find a Let's Play and learn the story that way.\n\nThe gameplay at release was quite glitched, with the multiplayer feature not even working out of the box, and because of that, there is a lot of trouble finding a co-op game. If you're lucky and have a friend that can play it, then you're fine as you can play together - unless you have a network card that doesn't support each other, according to the Developer's posts on the Steam forum. That's okay though... except that Single player also has a lot of issues. Firstly, they never explain the controls to you in any meaninful way if you use a gamepad - and you'll want to use a gamepad - so you spend a bit of time figuring out how to even do certain moves, such as your heroes/heroines special attacks, or the Sqaud move, for the group or single. On top of that issue, there are various crash reports that are visible from the forum; I myself have the game crash when I attempt to go to the challenges section, and if I press B during hero select on Multiplayer, it crashed the game entirely. The Developer hasn't released any content for this game since they "fixed" multiplayer - which took almost 2 weeks after release to even comment - and has not made their presence known on the support forums either, making it appear that this game is all but dead to them.\n\nCombat in the game tends to get a little repative, as there is little challenge in it across the entire game, and boss battles are rarely a challenge even on hard. Whereas it had a chance to create something amazing with an entire catalog of DC powers to come from, Superboy, just seems EXTREMELY underwhelming in attack power, and hits just as hard as Miss Martian, who the game states is physicall weak. There seems to be very little balance between the heros, with many of the feeling the same, and the ones that do feel special, they become your go to heroes because they are so over powered compared to the others. For example, one Hero gets a heal that impacts an circle AOE, and you need to be in that AOE. The next healer you get, impacts EVERY hero on the map, no matter where they are, and heals for a far greater amount, making the first hero almost meaningless to play as.\n\nThis game, really, lacks any real gameplay, or even more important, game stability. Unless you were a big fan of the TV serieds and want to support that, then I wouldn't bother getting this game. Read up on what the story is, watch playthroughts of it, or something to that extent, because even if this game hits $10, there are far superrior titles with less bugs even at that price range.","February 8, 2014","false","24.6"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","19","29","0","0"

This is simply a clunky poorly controlled hack and slash. The mobile version equals the pc game in every cosmetic way. The only reason to buy this game is if you aren't able to buy the mobile version. Even then wait for a sale.","January 30, 2015","false","0.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Clearly a very bad console port. I do not think they put any effort whatsoever into setting up a decent control system. They did not even enable the mouse for the menus.\n\nMay be a good game, but the controls are so bad, I never even got to start it.","April 12, 2015","false","0.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The combat was beyond easy, and not challanging in the slightest. The catch phrases that each character uses become incredibly annoying after a while. Boring use of collectables throughout the game, decreasing replayability. Most of all however, the story was exceedingly bland. No interesting twists, nothing really linked up, a very disappointing return from the writer of the TV show. Where was the reveal of Jason Todd? Where was the break up between Miss Martian and Superboy? Where did Tempest go? Why is the camera angle really odd in some places and unchangeable?\n\nOn the plus side, the graphic style is quite nice, the use of all the characters is quite cool.","January 9, 2014","false","5.1"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

The online doesn't even work either. The game also felt really rushed as the graphics are very low par and the animations and gameplay are pretty bland as well. Its pretty much a hack and slash rpg, it would be a great if the local or online would work, but for 20.00 the game isn't really worth it. If i were you I would avoid this game unless it goes on sale for like 9.99.","December 28, 2013","false","0.4"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","1"

Loads of reviews on Steam and the internet say stuff like, 'Terrible. No Don't waste your money.' and to be honest i was debating whether or not to buy it. I cracked and my inner nerd came out and i bought it, and boy I made great choice.\n\nPeople say, 'The controls are really bad and uncomfortable,' Now I'm not going to lie i was pretty anxious and scared about that until i realised that considering I bought it 2 years late the controls had either:\n\nA) Changed, The production team decided to change them due to way to many complaints\nor\nB) They were just plain picky and the controls didn't suit THEIR way of playing.\n\nIt is literally your average 3D fighting games, WASD to move, spacebar to jump, Mouse 1 for medium attack with Mouse 2 for strong attack, as well as 1 2 3 4 for your special moves.\n\nYoung Justice: Legacy takes place between season 1 and season 2 and how Aqualad joined sides with his true father (SPOILERS) Black Manta. It also sadly shows how Tula (Aquagirl) died. The entire soryline was simply perfect. It was constructed so well that is nearly impossible to actually stop playing. The charcters are really well designed, still from the TV show but what really caught my eye was a few of the characters that looked alot like they were from Disney Infinity game (especially Bane) and honestly it looks aMAZING!\n\nUnfortunetly there is no such thing as a perfect game :( As much as I love Young Justice (WHICH I DO LIKE HEAPS) There are some flaws.\n\nThe game tends to crash a whole lot of times, I've encountered about 5 times when in the middle of a level (which is super long with absolutely no checkpoints or anything   (will talk about that soon)   and the entire game crashes and I have to start again from the start.  I can't stress enough how annoying that is.\n\nAnother minor negative thing is the cAMERA. You can control it by looking around but there are times when it does it for you and it is most stressful thing ever because you can't tell where you are going.\n\nThe levels are really long which is great don't get me wrong but if you and the 2 other CPUs fall you have to start from the start. There is this one level where you must kill all enemies while a lazer follows you, so you must act fast and work as a team, but since the CPUs aren't team players they pretty much just sprint into the lazers leaving you to take measures in your own hands but if you are not carful and touch the lazers well you start from the start.\n\nHonestly that's about it. The game is simply great and i would recommend to just about everybody! 8/10!\n\n\nWhat really annoys me is the fact that there isn't any Steam Profile Backgrounds for this game D; *cough cough* Steam *cough*","April 28","true","21.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
