The art is a little bit odd at first, but you get used to it very quickly.\nOne of the best parts about it for me was the music. It's gorgeous. In most cases I simply turn off the music because it's so repetitive and boring, but that isn't the case here.\n\nIf you're a visual novel fan, just get it. It's free.

It seems to confuse New Year's and Christmas heavily. Technically the day they're celebrating is New Year's, but they celebrate it like it's Christmas. Also, this game makes the harem ending, where all the girls show up at Semyon's apartment, the canon ending. The English isn't the best, and Miku is referred to as an "anifag's idol" Not sure if intentional or not. Sadly, Slavyana has no special CG like the others do.

Because, let's be honest, not all sequels are great (Duke Nukem, DMC, James Bond as a Daniel Craig...), but this sequel was so fun to play and had left me with so much warmth, that i like it even more than the original full game.\n\nIt's short, but easily understandable. It has some minor problems, though (when you try to save your process on existing save file, the game asks if you want to close the game, menu scroll thingy, sometimes lags and doesn't open from first 3 tries). Other than that, it's pretty cool and totally worth spending 20-45 minutes to play (i read a bit slow, to immerge into story, that's why it took me 45 minutes to finish).","March 4","true","2.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

There are the orange girl, blue haired, girl who can't cook, and etc. The story branch is fun, but the is no personality that divide each of the character. Each of them accepted your confession, though all the reaction of them is the same making it more like you only play the game for the cool music, or the "girls". Though, this game is one of the competent Visual Novel game on steam, some of the Visual Novel on steam is more like attention grab. Focusing on the 18+ art and not at the story is what we got at some of visual novel these day. But not this one.\n\nThe music is the one that keep perfectly infinite loop of music feels fun to listen. Music consist of guitar and some beat, and I hope this devs keep increasing their music quality. The character sprite, looks almost badly drawn though the propose art is far more better than the character sprite. Some of the character have unrealistic body, but I hope their next game could be manga realistic :D.\n\nConclusion + Cool Music\n-+ Some amazing art, some dont\n- Bland character personality\n\nDont play  / Meh, it's something /  Must play 8/10 for visual novel","January 8","true","0.2"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","0"

Frosty Kiss really helps wrap up the after story in a definitive feel-good way. There doesn't seem to be bad endings, only different paths for each girl, and each one can warm your heart this winter, or any winter for that matter.\n\nIf you can deal with the grammar difficulties in the English translation, then it this is really a must-read VN for anyone who has read the preceding story in "Everlasting Summer."

The story is straight and simple. Basically you are trying to route through each scenario that hooks up the protagonist with each of the girls in the game. Sexist? Probably but it is Russia so what more can I say? Isn't this what men want anyhow even though they can't talk about it anymore in today's "political correctness"? Possibly women too now. The main problem I have with this is there was not enough art changing as you read the story. You basically stayed on the same "page" for far too long. It almost made me want to read faster just to get to the next scene. I like pictures as i read because it kind of immerses you into the story more. Setting is everything for me. And since it is a visual novel well what more can I say? More pictures please? The achievements apparently don't work as of yet either so that annoyed me. Overall it is ok and doable and it is free so I really can't have much to criticize. Oh and lastly.....the editor does not know how to spell and also does not know their English well. There were quite a few grammatical mistakes and spelling errors. Even with that it is a cute story if you like stories about the boy getting the girl/s?","January 18","true","2.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

There are two or three decisions in this short game, and again, I'm uncertain if that's typical, but I rather felt as though I was clicking to read a...well, a novel, a short story, rather than having any real power of choice in the game. That, I feel, is where it is lacking, and for that reason, I cannot recommend this game.\n\nAs something to lazily click through and read, sure. It looks nice enough, and it's clear the developers put in some effort, even with their translation to English(which was appreciated - could understand their intent at all times).\n\nI feel the need to reiterate, because I am so very unfamiliar with this genre, that maybe this is what the game is supposed to be like. If that's the case, then I'm sure it's great, and I am wrong for not recommending it.  I just can't understand calling it a game with such minimal interaction.\n\nThanks for reading.","January 11","false","0.9"," 8 of 23 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","8","23","0","0"

Frosty Kiss is filled with small things that make your memories from Everlasting Summer come back; memories of those blissful days in Sovynok when everything was so simple, yet so complicated. And most importantly memories of our journies with these star-crossed strangers that we grew to love (possible pun intended there), and the memorable moments we went through with them as we began to strive less and less to find that cursed bus and more and more to just get them to accept us.\nI love all the little references to the events in Sovynok and how the characters have grown as individuals, as well as a group that can share such a great treasure together. The music adds to that atmosphere and offers a laid-back vibe and the tone of every character pleasantly gives the suggestion that there will always be something to look forward to in life.\n\nOn a side note, despite going through each route I never unlocked any of the four achievements for the game. And they are all hidden achievements so I don't know what to do to unlock them. Other than that it's a very nice and simple game, certainly fulfilling, with no mazes or Yulya's coincidentally gathering supplies for the winter. (And regrettably no stargazing even though that was always a thing with Lena)","May 3","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/recommended/431540/","sharuun","No More Please","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/","204 products in account","Needless to say, I am disappointed.\n\nAs my enraptured fanbase knows so well, I liked Everlasting Summer a lot. It was the first actually good interactive novel I had played- which isn't actually saying much- and when I found out there was even more Everlasting Summer to uncover, I nearly p***ed myself.\n\nNeedless to say, I was disappointed.\n\nThe game serves as an ending for the players out there who wanted a bit more romance when they got the "Harem" at the very-very-VERY end of the game. I was fine with it. It wasn't a perfect ending, but I didn't need to a kiss with a girl of my choice to make me feel fulfilled. But the game is short- damn short- about fifteen minutes for me to get my first ending.\n\nAnd that wouldn't be bad if the game were actually... interesting.\n\nMy biggest problems in Frosty Kiss come from the obvious lack of refinement since Everlasting Summer. Yes, it's a new team, but the text boxes are improperly shaped for their text, there's tons of grammatical errors, and the menu and choice system are absolute garbage.\n\nThe main menu, from what I've played, is inaccessible until you get to the end. You can skip with Ctrl, but you can't change any settings or load a game (but you can save a game), until you get to the end of whatever choice you made. Why? That is so stupid.\n\nAnd a lot of times I might have misclicked or something, but some decisions seemed to opt me in one direction but take me in another. For one, I thought that if I dropped the firecrackers out the windows, I'd be pursuing Ulyana. No, I have to do that if I want to pursue Miku or Slavya or Lena. And in the kitchen if you look at Lena, you pursue Slavya... but if you look at Slavya, you pursue Lena. What kind of logic is that in a choice?\n\nThe endings are all very samey. Talk to X for a few lines, get a final kiss, get the "Frosty Kiss" logo. Roll credits. But, for some reason, Slavya (my personal favorite of the girls) got me the sh**tiest ending! There was a kiss, but I ended up getting crowded by the other four girls. Very intimate, touching scene there.\n\nFrosty Kiss is there if you liked Everlasting Summer and wanted more time to flirt with the girl of your choice. Beyond that, I don't really see any substantial value for it. I personally think Everlasting Summer was nice and contained. It wasn't perfect, but everything fit in together in the end. But this is like a floppy attempt to end a specific ending of a game that was pretty okay by itself. I preferred the "Yulya" ending, anyway... well, kinda.\n\n"Frosty Kiss" kinda sucks, but it's not wholly flawed. It's still well-drawn, the music isn't god-awful, and the dialogue is pretty meh. It gets a 5/10.","March 23","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
